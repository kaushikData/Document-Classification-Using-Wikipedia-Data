'''''.detuned''''' is a [[demoscene]] project by the German demogroup [[.theprodukkt]] (also known as [[Farbrausch]]), released on the [[PlayStation 3]]. It was initially released on September 20, 2009 in Japan, and on October 15 in Europe and North America. It is the second [[demo (computer programming)|demo]] released on the PlayStation 3 after ''[[Linger in Shadows]]''.

''.detuned'' features a man sitting in a chair surrounded by a psychedelic environment. The player can switch into various modes, and using the trigger buttons and right analogue stick, apply certain effects on the man, which e.g. make his head shrink or apply a post-processing filter on the visuals and music. The player is also able to load their own music in.

[[IGN]] cited the lack of lasting appeal as the biggest problem about ''.detuned'', saying that "selling for $2.99 in the US PlayStation Store, that's about a dollar per minute of entertainment". Overall they awarded the game a 4/10, with a 1/10 on Lasting Appeal.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

{{italic title}}

'''''A capriccio''''' {{IPA-it|a kaˈprittʃo|}} (Italian: "following one's fancy") is a [[tempo]] marking indicating a free and [[Wiktionary:capricious|capricious]] approach to the tempo (and possibly the style) of the piece. This marking will usually modify another, such as ''lento a capriccio'', often used in the [[Hungarian Rhapsodies]] of [[Franz Liszt]]. Perhaps the most famous piece to use the term is [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''Rondò a capriccio'' (Op. 129), better known as ''[[Rage Over a Lost Penny]]''.

'''Alekano''', or '''Gahuku''' (Gahuku-Gama), is a [[Papuan language]] spoken in the northern district of Goroka [[Eastern Highlands (Papua New Guinea)|Eastern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. There are about 25,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=gah Ethnologue report for Alekano]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alekano is also known as Gahuku, after the name of the largest clan of speakers, or Gama, after the second largest clan. Calling the language by these names has been rejected by speakers who are not members of these clans, and Alekano has been largely adopted as the official name. The latter name means "bring it". In two closely related languages spoken directly to the northwest, [[Tokano language|Tokano]] and [[Dano language|Dano]], it has the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Deibler, Ellis W. 1987. "The function of glottal stop in Gahuku." In John M. Clifton (ed.), Studies in Melanesian orthographies, 23-30. Data Papers on Papua New Guinea Languages, 33. Ukarumpa: Summer Institute of Linguistics. [http://www.sil.org/pacific/png/abstract.asp?id=22176]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Deibler, Ellis W., compiler. Available: 2008; Created: 2008. Dictionaries of Alekano - English and English - Alekano. [Manuscript] iii, 311 p. [http://www.sil.org/pacific/png/abstract.asp?id=51218]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Alekano has 5 vowels, all [[roundedness|unrounded]], which is exceptional. It has 12 consonants, but {{IPA|/w/}} is found only in the village Wanima, in derivations or in [[pidgin]] loanwords.&lt;ref name="Phonemes"&gt;1992. Alekano Organised Phonology Data. [Manuscript] [http://www.sil.org/pacific/png/abstract.asp?id=29]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===

! [[Back vowel|Back]]

| {{IPA link|ɯ}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA link|e}}
| {{IPA link|ɤ}}
|-
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
| || {{IPA link|ɑ}}
|}

===Glottal coda===
In Alekano, a syllable may be closed only with a [[glottal stop]], as in {{IPA|/ɑʔnesiʔ/}} "enough". That is currently not treated as a consonant, but it is unclear if words written as vowel initial begin with a glottal stop. It is written as an acute accent in the orthography, for example, ''ánesí''.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

===Consonants===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! colspan=2|

|
| {{IPA link|z}}
|
|
|}
The lateral is {{IPAblink|l}} initially and {{IPAblink|ɽ}} between vowels.

===Syllables===
The most complex syllables are of the form {{IPA|/CVVʔ/}}: VV may be a diphthong of {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, or {{IPA|/ɤ/}} followed by {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɯ/}}, or of {{IPA|/iɯ/}}. Other vowels may also occur in sequence ([[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]).

===Tone===
Alekano has low and high tones but with a very low [[functional load]]. HL receives strong stress, LH lesser stress.

==Grammar==
Alekano is a [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) language.&lt;ref&gt;http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_gah&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Alekano uses the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name="Phonemes"/&gt;

==History==
Prior to moving to San Diego in 1967, Enrique had lived in San Antonio, and expected to find services for folklorico dancing in the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was surprised to find none and created her own classes at the Mexican American Advisory Committee (MAAC) Center at [[National City, California|National City]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her sons and daughters helped teach classes with her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These classes grew in popularity and led to the creation of BFA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The BFA first became involved with members who later formed the Centro Cultural de la Raza in 1969.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Salvador Torres]], an artist, had been given the old Ford Building in [[Balboa Park, San Francisco|Balboa Park]] as studio space for a six-month period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, he found out that Enrique was having trouble finding places for the dance group to practice; he offered some of his studio space to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, BFA would be involved in helping to found "Toltecas en Aztlan," which later created the Centro.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Through the 1970s and 1980s, classes were taught at the Centro by Isabel, Teresa, Veronica and Viviana Enrique (later Viviana Enrique Acosta), along with other teachers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Today==
BFA offers dance classes for children and adults at Muevete Dance Studio in [[Lemon Grove, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.muevetestudio.com/|title = Muevete Dance Studio|date = |accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director of BFA, Acosta, has been inducted to San Diego Women's Hall of Fame as a Historian and for her work with BFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.lajollalight.com/news/2015/feb/25/10-questions-natasha-josefowitz/|title = 10 QUESTIONS: Natasha Josefowitz enters San Diego Women's Hall of Fame|last = |first = |date = 25 February 2015|work = La Jolla Light|access-date = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11333">The British legend of the [[Black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dog]] has appeared many times in popular culture.

== General references ==
*One of the most famous black dogs in fiction is [[the Hound of the Baskervilles]] from the book of the same name by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. In the book, the villain uses the long-standing legend of a ghostly dog that haunts the Baskerville family in his plan to murder them.
*In Russell Hoban's novel ''[[Riddley Walker]]'' (1980), Riddley's post-apocalyptic quest is initiated by a dog sacrifice and a folktale, "Why the Dog Won't Show its Eyes."  Death dogs are important in the "Eusa" story that guides Riddley's quest, as is a companion black dog later in the quest.
*In ''Welcome To The Jungle'' The First [[Dresden Files]] graphic novel, a Black Dog in summoned to hunt down and kill Harry.
*In ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' by [[J.K. Rowling]], Harry comes across what he believes is a [[Church Grim|Grim]]. He is told that it is a powerful omen of death. In reality, though, the "Grim" is his god-father, [[Sirius Black]], whose nickname is "Padfoot", and whose [[Animagus]] form is the huge black dog seen by Harry.
* In the [[Patrick Swayze]] trucker movie ''[[Black Dog (film)|Black Dog]]'', the legend is updated for the motorized 20th century as a beast that is seen "when you've been on the road too long and pushing too hard. When you get greedy, it comes to take everything away from you."
*In Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the Devil Mephistopheles first appears to Faust in the form of a black poodle which follows him home through a field.
*In ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' episode 2 "[[Wendigo (Supernatural episode)|Wendigo]]" they mention the possibility of a black dog being the creature that is killing campers. The two later encounter hellhounds which appear as black dogs to those they hunt, but remain invisible to all others.
* The ''[[Moddey Dhoo]]'' is a phantom black hound in Manx folklore that reputedly haunted Peel Castle on the west coast of the Isle of Man.
*In ''[[Black Dogs]]'' by novelist [[Ian McEwan]], a character encounters two black dogs that she believes to be evil incarnate.
*[[Dracula]] transforms into a black dog to leap from the boat to land when he arrives in Whitby.
*In the movie [[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]] the main character, Llewelyn Moss, comes across a stray black dog immediately before running into a botched heroin deal.
*In the book ''[[Treasure Island]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] one of the pirates is called Black Dog. He is the first to threaten and harass Billy Bones. As soon as the unwelcome visitor is gone, Bones suffers a stroke. Also Jim Hawkins' father dies shortly after Black Dog's visit.

*In [[Eva Ibbotson]]'s 1975 children's book ''[[The Great Ghost Rescue]]'' the main character, Humphrey the Horrible, rescues a neglected, stray [[Black Shuck]].
*It's possible that the werewolves of [[An American Werewolf in London]] were based the stories of Black Dogs, because both monsters were portrayed as four-legged beasts and were in the description of "rabid dog" and "some sort of mad dog".
*In [[Alan Moore]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'', characters throughout Northampton, England's history encounter black dogs (in one case, identified as a "shagfoal").

== Barghest ==

===Literature===
* In the novel by [[Bram Stoker]], when arriving at [[Whitby]] aboard the ship ''Demeter'', [[Dracula]] takes the form of a big and ferocious dark dog. The barghest is part of Whitby folklore, and may well have been Stoker's inspiration.

* Also inspired by this legend, the barghest also appears in the children's book ''The Whitby Witches'' by [[Robin Jarvis]].

* The [[Barghest (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|barghest]] is depicted as a shapeshifting beast in ''Sojourn'', written by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. Most of R.A. Salvatore's literary inspiration comes from the pen and paper [[Role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.

* In [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'', it is mentioned as always being male.

* Comic book publisher [http://www.barghest.com Barghest Entertainment] takes its name from the legendary demon-dog.

* In the novel ''Forge of the Mindslayers'' by Tim Waggoner, a Barghest is described as a lupine beast with blue tinged fur, a 'goblin-ish' face, and human hands. It can shapeshift into a goblin.

* In Chapter 63 of Theodore Dreiser's classic novel, ''An American Tragedy,'' he references the spectre adjectivally, saying, "And at one point it was that a wier-wier, one of the solitary water-birds of this region, uttered its ouphe and '''barghest''' cry, flying from somewhere near into some darker recess within the woods. And at this sound it was that Clyde had stirred nervously and then sat up in the car. It was so very different to any bird-cry he had ever heard anywhere."

* Steven Erikson's epic fantasy series, the Malazan Book of the Fallen, features a nomadic warrior people called the Barghast. Any possible relation to the mythological canine, aside from the name, is unclear.

* [[Neil Gaiman]]'s short story, "Black Dog" also uses the legend as its sources material. In this story, the main character from Gaiman's ''[[American Gods]]'' is visiting a small English village when one of the residents becomes menaced by [[Black Shuck]]. This story deals heavily with the concept of black dogs as bad omens and hellhounds.

* In Bethan White's novel ''Downward'', the protagonist Chris is accompanied by a black dog that only he is able to see.

===Film and television===

* The Barghest is the main villain in the children's TV series ''[[Roger and the Rottentrolls]]'', which is set in Troller's Ghyll.

* The 1978 made-for-TV film ''[[Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell]]'' features a barghest named Lucky.

* In an episode of the [[BBC]] drama series ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe (BBC TV series)|Dalziel and Pascoe]]'', a public house situated on the [[North York Moors]] which the episode's plot revolves around is named 'The Barguest', and features a large black dog on its sign.
* The anime [[The Ancient Magus' Bride]] features a character, Ruth, who is revealed to be a "Black Dog".

Cher Burundi, ô doux pays,&lt;br&gt;
Prends place dans le Concert des nations.&lt;br&gt;
En tout bien, tout honneur, accédé à l'indépendance.&lt;br&gt;
Mutilé et meutri, tu es demeuré maître de toi-même.&lt;br&gt;
L'heure venue, t'es levé&lt;br&gt;
Et fièrement tu t'es hissé au rang des peuples libres.&lt;br&gt;
Reçois donc le compliment des nations,&lt;br&gt;
Agrée l'hommage de tes enfants.&lt;br&gt;
Qu'à travers l'univers retentisse ton nom.

Cher Burundi, héritage sacré de nos aïeux,&lt;br&gt;
Reconnu digne de te gouverner&lt;br&gt;
Au courage tu allies le sentiment de l'honneur.&lt;br&gt;
Chante la gloire de ta liberté reconquise.

Cher Burundi, digne objet de notre plus tendre armour,&lt;br&gt;
A ton noble service nous vouons nos bras, nos cœurs et nos vies.&lt;br&gt;
Veuille Dieu, qui nous a fait don de toi, te conserver à notre vénération.&lt;br&gt;
Sous l'egide de l'Unité,&lt;br&gt;
Dans la paix, la joie et la prospérité.

===English Translation===
Our [[Burundi]], gentle country,&lt;br&gt;
Take your place in the concert of nations,&lt;br&gt;
Acceding to independence with honourable intentions.&lt;br&gt;
Wounded and bruised, you have remained master of yourself.

When the hour came, you arose,&lt;br&gt;
Lifting yourself proudly into the ranks of free peoples.&lt;br&gt;
Receive, then, the congratulations of the nations&lt;br&gt;
And the homage of your sons and daughters.&lt;br&gt;
May your name ring out through the universe.

Our Burundi, sacred heritage from our forefathers,&lt;br&gt;
Recognized as worthy of self-government,&lt;br&gt;
With your courage you also have a sense of honour.&lt;br&gt;
Sing the glory of liberty conquered again.

Our Burundi, worthy of our tenderest love,&lt;br&gt;
We vow to your noble service our hands and hearts and lives.&lt;br&gt;
May God, who gave you to us, keep you for us to venerate,&lt;br&gt;
Under the shield of unity,&lt;br&gt;
In peace, joy and prosperity.

'''''Captain Nemo and the Underwater City''''' is a 1969 British film starring [[Robert Ryan]], [[Chuck Connors]] and [[Nanette Newman]]. It features the character [[Captain Nemo]] and is inspired by [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''. It was written by [[Pip and Jane Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; 17 December 1969, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Captain Nemo's submarine [[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]] rescues drowning passengers and takes them to an underwater city, Templemer (pronounced Temple-Meer) where they are told they will remain forever. The survivors include brothers Barnaby ([[Bill Fraser]]) and Swallow Bath ([[Kenneth Connor]]), Lomax ([[Allan Cuthbertson]]), Helena Beckett ([[Nanette Newman]]) and her son, and Senator Robert Fraser ([[Chuck Connors]]).

Nemo takes them on a city scuba tour, but Lomax attempts to steal diving gear and escape but is caught. Fraser seems taken with a musical performance given by the city's swimming teacher Mala ([[Luciana Paluzzi]]), this noted by Joab, Nemo’s second in command ([[John Turner (actor)|John Turner]]).

Joab shows the Bath brothers how the city makes oxygen and fresh water and as a by-product gold, which is even thrown away. Joab advises them that no one has ever escaped Templemer. Lomax sees the oxygen machine as a means to escape by rupturing the city's dome. Lomax attempts this but only manages to flood the machine’s control room killing Lomax in the process. During this episode, the Bath brothers  sneak into the Forbidden Area where they discover a second submarine, the  Nautilus II, and see it as a means of escape.

Enlisting Fraser to aid them, Fraser learns how to operate the submarine. During training they ram and kill a vast Manta Ray-like creature accidentally created during the building of the city. Fraser tells Nemo he should leave as he is attempting to cut off the supply of weapons to the American Civil War. Nemo refuses but offers Fraser a position at Templemer. This alienates Joab, who helps Fraser and the Baths steal Nautilus II, on condition they leave without bloodshed, and allow the crew to return with the submarine intact.

They manage to take the submarine and are followed by Nemo in his submarine. Nemo explains there is fault with the Nautilus II's engines that means the sub could explode. The chase is brief. Unable to match the speed of the escaping submarine, Nemo has Nautilus I sheer away, to try 'going under the reef.' Confused by their pursuers apparently giving up, Fraser asks the Nautilus II's first mate if there is 'a shorter way,' to be told that 'yes, there is,' but that 'this ship is too large!'

A now desperate Fraser gives orders for 'crash speed.' As the submarine increases to flank an explosion causes the engines to fail, and out of control the ship strikes a reef before coming to a stop whilst still submerged. The crew with Fraser and the Baths put on diving gear and attempt to escape from the now flooding submarine, but Barnaby panics and drowns in the attempt.

Nautilus I approaches the wreck just in time to be buffeted violently as the bigger ship explodes; Joab is electrocuted as he is thrown against a control panel. Mortally wounded he confesses to Nemo that he helped Fraser to escape. Helena Beckett admits that she knew of the attempt, and that she and her son chose to stay. Mala reads Nemo a letter that Fraser left behind, in which he thanks Nemo for offering him a place in the city's future, but that he cannot accept, as he believes in his mission, and the 'slower, more painful process' towards peace.

The film closes as Nautilus turns towards Templemer. On the surface, a small [[schooner]] is seen picking up two men in mid-ocean, far from either land or any sign of wreckage. Fraser and Swallow Bath, huddled in blankets, are made welcome aboard, and as the schooner prepares to set sail, Fraser finds his companion has concealed a gold ladle under his coat. The two exchange rueful smiles, and Fraser tosses it lightly into the sea.

==Production==
The film was produced on a budget of 1.5 million US dollars. It had stemmed from an idea that led to [[Roger Corman]]’s failed ''Captain Nemo and the Floating City'', itself based on a combination of two of Jules Verne’s stories. Though that movie never passed the planning stage, [[MGM]] producer [[Steven Pallos]] managed to re-create the project having read a series of inspirational articles about [[Jacques Cousteau]]’s experiments with deep sea habitats, and the 'floating' was changed to 'underwater'. The film drew heavily on the supposed charm of the Victorian era, following agreement between director and scriptwriters to produce a popular escapist atmosphere, more the essence of Michael Todd’s ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' than of Disney‘s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.

{{Paranormal}}
The '''chupacabra''' or '''chupacabras''' ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾas}}, literally "goat-sucker"; from ''chupar'', "to suck", and ''cabra'', "goat") is a [[legend]]ary creature in the [[folklore]] of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Latino Bigfoot" /&gt; The name comes from the animal's reported [[Vampirism|habit]] of attacking and [[Hematophagy|drinking the blood]] of [[livestock]], including [[goat]]s.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.

Eyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]], and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like [[Russia]] and the [[Philippines]], but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as [[Canidae|canids]] afflicted by [[mange]].&lt;ref name="Radford2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford |year=2011 |title=[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore |isbn=978-0-8263-5015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corp.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=3283EF0636144DD6AAC744E6D18C3E66&amp;year=2002&amp;keyword= |title=Disfrazado el chupacabras |trans-title= |date=24 September 2002 |last=González Rodríguez |first=Miried |website=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]] |location=Puerto Rico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
''Chupacabras'' can be literally translated as "goat-sucker", from ''chupar'' ("to suck") and ''cabra'' ("goat"). It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,&lt;ref name="Clave"&gt;Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras chupacabras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000326/http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras |date=4 March 2016 }}. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it.  The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian [[Silverio Pérez]], who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.&lt;ref name="Pérez2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pérez |first=Silverio |author-link=Silverio Pérez |title=Más humortivación: para el camino del éxito |trans-title=More Humortivation: The Path for Success |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG3wb8qOgt8C |year=2000 |publisher=Dreams Come True |isbn=978-0-9702011-0-2 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradford2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/was_the_nightjar_an_early_chupacabra/ |title=Was the Nightjar an Early Chupacabra? |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Radford |date=1 June 2017 |website=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |title=On the trail of the Chupacabras |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |year=1998 |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919215215/http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |archive-date=19 September 2005 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood.&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt; A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt; In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' ("The Vampire of Moca").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |title=Encounters with Chupacabras |year=2000 |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163054/http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |archive-date=17 October 2007 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and entrepreneur [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], Chile, [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], United States, and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt;

== Reputed origin ==
A five-year investigation by [[Benjamin Radford]], documented in his 2011 book ''[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]'', concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: "It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive," Tolentino reported.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. {{ISBN|1-883729-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford revealed that Tolentino "believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''Species'' were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time," and therefore concludes that "the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted."&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Benjamin. "Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery" ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Latin America]] where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted, and the reports in the United States of [[mammal]]s, mostly dogs and [[coyote]]s with [[mange]], that people call "chupacabra" due to their unusual appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chupacabra Science: How Evolution Made a Mythical Monster |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101028-chupacabra-evolution-halloween-science-monsters-chupacabras-picture/ |date=28 October 2010 |last=Than |first=Ker |work=National Geographic |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred "because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ur.umich.edu/1011/Oct25_10/1698-scary-chupacabras-monster |date=25 October 2010 |title=Scary chupacabras monster is as much victim as villain |last=Ross-Flannigan |first=Nancy |website=The University Record |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade and Bowns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |title=Evaluation of Suspected Predator Kills |date=May 2010 |last1=Wade |first1=Dale A. |last2=Bowns |first2=James E. |website=Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center | |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055717/http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |archivedate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal [[bleeding]] or [[circulatory shock]].&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade and Bowns" /&gt; The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the [[canine teeth]], are to be expected since this is the only way that most land [[carnivores]] have to catch their prey.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;

There are reports of stray [[Mexican Hairless Dog]]s being mistaken for chupacabras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch |title=Breaking News Videos, Story Video and Show Clips – CNN.com |date=12 March 2014 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The most common description of the chupacabra is that of a [[reptile]]-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skepdic.com/chupa.html |title=Chupacabra |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |date=29 October 2015 |website=The Skeptic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be approximately {{convert|3|to|4|ft|1}} high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a [[kangaroo]].&lt;ref name="top ten"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/most-mysterious-creatures-of-modern-times-2594695 |title=The Top 10 Most Mysterious Creatures of Modern Times |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |date=8 September 2017 |website=ThoughtCo |publisher=[[Dotdash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle or through one or two holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |last=De Jesús Mangual |first=Tomás |author-link=Tomás de Jesús Mangual |date=9 January 2006 |title=Imputan otro ataque al Chupacabras |website=[[El Vocero]] |location=San Juan, Puerto Rico |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110443/http://vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |archive-date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related legends ==
A popular legend in [[New Orleans]] concerns a popular lovers' lane called Grunch Road, which was said to be inhabited by "grunches", creatures similar in appearance to the ''Chupacabra''.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The [[peuchen]]s of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the [[vampire bat]], an animal endemic to the region.&lt;ref name=peuchen1&gt;[https://archive.is/20070619191305/http://www.diarioelcentro.cl/articulos_sc.php?fecha=26-07-2004&amp;semana=29-2004 Article: Tras los pasos del chupacabras. El centro, Journal. 26-07-2004 {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, another [[legendary creature]] called the [[Sigbin]] shares many of chupacabra's descriptions.

The popularity of the chupacabra has resulted in its being featured in many types of media.
* At least one published mystery novel uses aspects of the myth as the centerpoint of the plot.&lt;ref name="Wagner2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Lloyd |title=El Chupacabras: Trail of the Goatsucker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejeE4_e_mQQC |date=October 2004 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-0-595-33315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of books include those that provide a scientific explanation for the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott.

Cinema arrived in [[Cuba]] at the beginning of the 20th century. Before the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, about 80 full-length films were produced in Cuba. Most of these films were [[Melodrama#Current use|melodramas]]. Following the revolution, Cuba entered what is considered the "Golden age" of Cuban cinema.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=Who considers it?}}

== Early stages ==
After being popularised by the brothers [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Louis Jean and Auguste Marie Lumière]], the [[cinematographe]] traveled through several capital cities in different [[United States|American]] countries before arriving in [[Havana]], which occurred on January 24, 1897. It was brought from [[Mexico]] by [[Gabriel Veyre]]. The first presentation was offered at Paseo del Prado #126, just aside the [[Teatro Tacón]]. Four short films were shown: ''Partida de cartas'', ''El tren'', ''El regador y el muchacho'' y ''El sombrero cómico''. The tickets were sold at a price of 50 cents, and 20 cents for kids and the military. Short after, Veyre performed a leading role in the first film produced in the island, ''Simulacro de incendio'', a [[documentary]] centered around firemen in Havana.

In this first phase of introduction there were several locations devoted to cinema: Panorama Soler, Salón de variedades o ilusiones ópticas, Paseo del Prado #118, Vitascopio de Edison (in the famous Louvre sidewalk). The Teatro Irioja (today Teatro Martí) was the first to present cinema as one of its attractions. The first in a long list of movie theatres in Havana was set by [[José A. Casasús]], actor, producer and entrepreneur, under the name of "Floradora", later renamed "Alaska".

In the six or seven years before [[World War I]], cinema was expanded and stabilized as a business in the most important cities in [[Latin America]]. Cuba, just as the rest of the countries in the continent, went through those first years with itinerant and sporadic exhibitions, changing from European providers to North American providers, starting the dependency on the big [[Hollywood]] companies.

The first ambitious genre in the continent was probably historic reviews. In Cuba films like ''El Capitán Mambí'' and ''Libertadores o guerrilleros'' (1914), by [[Enríque Díaz Quesada]] with support from Gen. [[Mario García Menocal]] are worth mentioning. Díaz Quesada adapted from the Spanish novelist [[Joaquín Dicenta]] in 1910, as a tendency widely used then, of using literary works adapted for movies, as well as imitating [[Charlie Chaplin]], the French comedies and [[cowboy]] adventure films. The silent stage of production was extended until 1937, when the first full-length fiction movie was produced.

=== Pre-revolutionary cinema ===

Before the Cuban Revolution of 1959 the total film production was around 80 full-length movies. Some films are worth mentioning, such as ''La Virgen de la Caridad'' starring Miguel Santos and ''Romance del Palmar'' by [[Ramón Peón]]. Many famous people from the continent came to the island to film, and some leading Cuban actors had a strong presence mainly in Mexico and [[Argentina]]. Musicians such as [[Ernesto Lecuona]], [[Bola de Nieve]] or [[Rita Montaner]] also performed and composed for movies in several countries.

=== Cinema after the revolution ===

In the first days of 1959, the new government created a cinematographic department within the ''Dirección de Cultura del Ejército Rebelde'' (Culture Division of the Rebel Army), which sponsored the production of documentaries such as ''Esta tierra nuestra'' by [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]], and ''La vivienda'' by [[Julio García Espinosa]]. This was the direct ancestor of what would eventually become the ''[[Instituto Cubano del Arte y la Industria Cinematográficos]]'' (ICAIC), which was founded in March as a result of the first culture law of the revolutionary government. Film, according to this law, is "the most powerful and provocative form of artistic expression, and the most direct and widespread vehicle for education and bringing ideas to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Cubacine. El Portal del Cine Cubano. http://www.cubacine.cu/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICAIC founded ''Cine Cubano'' in 1960. All production, distribution, and exhibition in the country were run by ICAIC by 1965. The ICAIC also established mobile projection units called ''cine moviles'', trucks that visited remote areas to hold screenings.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kristin and Bordwell David. (2010) "Film History: An Introduction". New York: McGraw-Hill. p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; From its foundation up until 1980, Alfredo Guevara was head of the ICAIC. Under his direction, the organization was pivotal in the development of Cuban cinema which came to be identified with [[anti-imperialism]] and revolution.&lt;ref name="Chanan-p1-25"&gt;Michael Chanan, ''Cuban Cinema'' (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2004) 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ten years of the institution were called by critics the Golden Age (''Década de Oro'') of Cuban cinema, most of all because of the making of ''[[Lucía]]'' (1969) by [[Humberto Solás]] and ''[[Memorias del subdesarrollo]]'' (''Memories of Underdevelopment'') (1968) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea. These two directors are often regarded as the best film directors to have come out of Cuba. ''Memorias del subdesarrollo'' was selected among the best 100 films of all times by the International Federation of Film Clubs. One of the most prolific and strong branches of the Cuban cinema in the last 40 years has been documentaries and short-films. The documentary ''Now'' (1965) by [[Santiago Álvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago Álvarez]] is often considered the first [[video clip]] in history.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} It combines a song with an uninterrupted sequence of images depicting [[racial discrimination]] in the U.S..

Animation has also been a major highlight in the last decades. In 1974, Juan Padrón gave birth to ''[[Elpidio Valdés]]'', a character that represents a [[mambí]] fighter, struggling for Cuban independence against the Spanish occupation in the 19th century. It is very popular among Cuban children. Another great success of Cuban animation was the full-length film ''[[Vampiros en La Habana]]'' (1983), also by Juan Padrón.

Essential in the history of Cuban cinema is the ''Noticiero ICAIC Latinoamericano'' (Latin-American ICAIC News) whose first director was [[Alfredo Guevara]]. Years later it was directed by Santiago Álvarez and the Mexican [[Rodolfo Espino]], the most successful documentary maker in the island. In 1979 the ICAIC played a key role in the creation of the Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano (International Festival of New [[Latin America]]n Cinema) allowing Latin American films a more international audience. The festival is one of the most important of its type in Latin America and has been held in Havana every year since 1979. There is also an international cinema university, the ''[[Escuela Internacional de Cine, Televisión y Video de San Antonio de los Baños]]'' (International School of Cinema, Television and Video of San Antonio de los Baños) located in [[San Antonio de los Baños]] near Havana, on land donated by the Cuban government and supported by the ''[[Fundación del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano]]'', [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and the Father of the New Latin American Cinema, Fernando Birri. Hundreds of young students from all over Latin America have studied direction, script, photography and edition.

The contribution of the ICAIC, which was rapidly positioned as the head of a process aiming for legitimate artistic values and expression of nationality, is not limited only to the support in producing and promoting a movement that spanned fiction, documentary and animation, but also allowed for the exhibition and spread of popular knowledge of the best of cinema from all over the world. It also created the film archives of the Cinemateca de Cuba, and took part in initiatives such as Cinemóviles, which made cinema available on the most intricate sites of the national [[geography of Cuba|geography]].

The institution also helped developing the Cuban poster, as a mean of promoting films. It gave birth between 1969 and 1977, to the Grupo de Experimentación Sonora, which influenced [[Cuban music]] to a great extent, serving as a starting point for the movement of the [[Nueva Trova]]. Figures like [[Silvio Rodríguez]], [[Pablo Milanés]] and [[Leo Brouwer]] were prominent through all this process.

In 1980, Alfredo Guevara was ousted from his position as head of the ICAIC, which he had held since its formation, over controversies about [[Cecilia (1982 film)]]. The film, directed by Humberto Solás, was based on the 19th century Cuban novel [[Cecilia Valdés]]. It was the most ambitious Cuban film to date and somewhat monopolized the funds available to filmmakers during its production. This, coupled with the fact that many other directors and the general public did not agree with Solás's interpretation of the film, led to the removal of Alfredo Guevara from his position.

Having won a great deal of autonomy from the central government in the 1970s, the ICAIC, under the new leadership of Julio García Espinosa, was allowed to make many films dealing with sociopolitical issues. Espinosa was able to increase the recognition of Cuban film and especially of the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema by obtaining greater funds from the government and also inviting big names such as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert De Niro]], and [[Jack Lemmon]] to the island. Despite his successes, Espinosa faced a large problem in 1991, again due to a controversial film. This film, entitled ''Alicia en el pueblo de Maravillas'', was very critical of the bureaucracy of the government. This, combined with the simultaneous collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], led to Espinosa's retirement.

During this time, Alfredo Guevara returned to the scene of the ICAIC in order to help it maintain its autonomy from the central government. Many of the party faithful were calling for the organization to merge with the Cuban Radio and Television Institute. Due to the loss of Cuba's largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, the future of the island country became uncertain, and criticism of the government, which the ICAIC was known for, became unpopular. Guevara managed to get the film released and allow the ICAIC to keep its independent status. He then remained president of the organization throughout the [[Special Period]] until his retirement in 2000.&lt;ref name="Chanan-p1-25" /&gt;

One of the most notable Cuban films in the recent years was ''Fresa y chocolate'' (''[[Strawberry and Chocolate]]'') (1993) by [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]] and [[Juan Carlos Tabío]]. It is about intolerance, and portrays the friendship between a [[homosexual]] and a young member of the Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas (a communist youth organization). It was also the first Cuban production to ever be nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

Omar González succeeded Alfredo Guevara as the head of the ICAIC and remains in that position today. It continues to directly aid in the production and distribution of films and has production offices, issues film permits, rents studios and equipment to filmmakers, and is closely involved in each stage of the film, from its inception and production, to its distribution and release.

=== Cinema of the Cuban diaspora ===

After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cubans who were ideologically ill at ease with the new revolutionary government made their way to the [[United States]], where they settled in concentrated communities made up of other Cubans in South [[Florida]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[New Jersey]].  Unlike traditional immigrants who chose to leave the homeland behind in search of a better way of life in a new place, most of these Cubans consider themselves exiles forced out of their homeland by political or economic circumstances. Because they continue to think of themselves as Cuban even after decades in the United States, it is appropriate to talk about them as part of a Cuban [[diaspora]] that links them emotionally and psychologically to the island.  Over one million Cubans have left Cuba since 1959 in different waves of immigration.  Among those are talented directors, technicians and actors who settled in the USA, Latin America or [[Europe]], in search of work and creative space in the field of cinema.

''Los gusanos'' (''The Worms'') (1978) produced by Danilo Bardisa and directed by Camilo Vila was the first film made by the Cuban exiles dealing with Cuban politics. The screenplay written by [[Orestes Matacena]], Clara Hernandez and Camilo Vila has an overwhelming impact in the U.S. Cuban community inspiring many other Cuban filmmakers to tell their stories with their cameras.

Orlando Jiménez Leal, one of the best known exile filmmakers, produced ''[[El Super]]'' (1979), the first Cuban exile fictional film, directed by Jiménez Leal and his young brother-in-law, Leon Ichaso.&lt;ref&gt;Ana López, "Cuban Cinema in Exile," ''Jump Cut'' 38 (1993), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on a play by Ivan Acosta, the film was broadly distributed in the U.S. and won awards at film festivals in [[Mannheim]], [[Biarritz]] and [[Venice]].  The film examines the trauma of the Cuban [[middle class]], showing them as displaced from their former life and unable to adapt to new circumstances.  It also highlights generational conflicts between Cuban-born parents and their teenage children who have been raised in the U.S. and reject tradition in favor of the North American way of life.  Jiménez Leal went on to make documentary films such as ''The Other Cuba'' (1983) and  ''[[Improper Conduct]]'' (1984) in collaboration with [[Néstor Almendros]].  ''Improper Conduct'' is a highly [[controversy|controversial]] film that deals with the treatment of gays in Cuba.  ''The Other Cuba'' is a bitter denunciation of the Revolution told from the point of view of the exiled community.  The director's strong anti-Castro stance gave voice to the growing community of Cuban political exiles in the U.S. in the 1980s.
  
Leon Ichaso's best known film in the U.S. is ''Bitter Sugar ''(1996), a fictional film that strongly criticizes life in post-revolutionary Cuba.  The screenplay, written by Ichaso and [[Orestes Matacena]] shows the disillusionment of a young Communist and his girlfriend, who are pushed to the breaking point by a repressive society. In tone and theme, it is similar to Jorge Ulla's ''Guaguasí'' (1982), which had less distribution in the U.S.  The ''Guaguasí'' screenplay, written by [[Orestes Matacena]], Clara Hernandez and Ulla, portrays a simple man from the countryside, played by actor [[Orestes Matacena]], who is brutalized by his experiences with the revolutionary government in Cuba. The reactionary stance of directors like Villa, Ulla, Ichaso, Almendros and Jiménez Leal has made them the cinematic spokespersons for Cubans who believe that [[Fidel Castro]] is personally responsible for negative changes that have occurred in Cuba since 1959.  ''Bitter Sugar'' has been shown to the [[Human Rights Commission]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] and to the [[US Congress]].

An important theme in cinema of the Cuban disapora is the coming and going of people in exile, and the difficult process of adaptation to a new culture. Iván Acosta made the film ''Amigos'' (1986) to show the painful bicultural existence of Cuban-Americans living in [[Miami]].  Although it is a [[low-budget]] film, it does an effective job of capturing the problems of the younger generation of [[Cuban-Americans]] who are torn between the desire to fit in and the pressure to uphold tradition.  ''Lejanía'' (1985) by Jesús Díaz is the first film to deal with the issue of Cuban exiles returning to the island for visits with relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chanan, ''Cuban Cinema''.  (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota P., 2004) 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cercanía'' (2008) by Rolando Díaz, the brother of Jesús, shows a recent arrival from Cuba attempting to reconcile with his family in Miami after decades apart. Rather than address political themes in a direct way, these films focus on personal issues related to adaptation and culture shock.  ''Honey for Oshún'' (2001) by Humberto Solás, a Cuban director who remained in Cuba, addresses the clash between Cuban-Americans returning to the island and those who never left.  It hints that reconciliation is possible, as long as those who return are willing to accept Cuba on its own terms and not force [[capitalism|capitalist]] ideology on the Cuban people.

In Cuba, films made by Cuban-Americans or Cubans in exile are not widely distributed or well known, in part because the films deal with the Revolution in a negative light, but also because Cubans on the island dispute the notion of a Cuban diaspora and believe that those who live in exile no longer represent Cuban reality in an authentic light.  They take the position that directors who experience life outside Cuba represent Cuba through a distorted lens, and that the films they make are largely works of [[propaganda]].

Many important Cuban actors now live in exile. Among them are [[César Évora]], [[Anabel Leal]], [[Reinaldo Cruz]], [[Francisco Gattorno]], [[Reynaldo Miravalles]], [[Tomás Millán]], William Marquez, [[Orestes Matacena]] and Isabel Moreno.  Cuban American actors who were born in Cuba but grew up in the U.S. include [[Andy García]], [[Steven Bauer]],  [[William Levy (actor)|William Levy]], and [[Tony Plana]].

=== International co-productions ===

The [[international co-production]] of films has become very important for the cinema of Cuba and also for the rest of Latin America. An internationally co-produced film is one in which two or more production companies from different countries are involved, or the financing has been sourced from more than one country. Co-productions are becoming increasingly common today but even as early as 1948 were common between Cuba and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Libia Villazana, "Hegemony Conditions in the Coproduction Cinema of Latin America: The Role of Spain," Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media 49.2 (2008): 65-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-productions began to take off in the 1960s and 1970s, many with the aim of increasing political awareness and highlighting common problems in Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;Luisela Alvaray, "National, Regional, and Global: New Waves of Latin American Cinema," Cinema Journall 47.3 (2008): 48-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before its dissolution, the USSR also played a role of co-producing films in Cuba such as [[Mikhail Kalatozov]]'s ''[[I Am Cuba]]''. The increased importance of co-produced films was inevitable due to [[globalization]], and in the case of Cuba especially, due to a lack of economic resources. A film created with the cooperation of two or more countries nearly always guaranteed distribution in both countries, resulting in a greater audience and increased [[revenue]]s. This also allowed for more exposure of regional cinemas.

Beginning as early as the 1930s Spain played a role in producing Latin American and Cuban films, but began to invest more heavily in the 1990s. In 1997, [[Ibermedia]] was created for the purpose of promoting co-production between Spain and Latin American countries. There are 14 countries involved in this organization and Cuba is one of them. Two examples of Cuban co-produced films are Humberto Solás's ''Cecilia'' (Cuba/Spain) and Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío's [[Academy Award]]-nominated ''Strawberry and Chocolate'' (Cuba/Mexico/Spain).&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Movie Database, &lt;https://www.imdb.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been mixed opinions about the development of co-productions. For some it is a [[lesser of two evils principle|necessary evil]]. Humberto Solás states that "For established filmmakers there is not a single cent for production. We are obliged to seek co-productions. If a film is not co-produced, it will not be made."&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Martin, Bruce Paddington, and Humberto Solás. "Restoration or Innovation: An Interview with Humberto Solás: Post-Revolutionary Cuban Cinema." Film Quarterly 54.3 (2001): 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with finding foreign funding for Cuban films is that, often, the financiers want to have some amount of influence over the final product so that it can be successful in their own countries. Frequently there are also stipulations that require a certain number of cast and crew to be working on the film from each of the producing countries. For example, a Cuban film that was co-produced by Spain would require a certain number of Spanish actors, writers or directors, and production technicians. This makes it difficult for Cuban national cinema to hold on to its identity and also creates issues when determining the nationality of a film. Julio García Espinosa agrees that the benefit of co-productions is that it has allowed for films to continue being made in Cuba and Latin America, but believes that the most successful co-productions are those that exist solely between Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;Libia Villazana, "Hegemony Conditions in the Coproduction Cinema of Latin America: The Role of Spain," Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media 49.2 (2008): 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba has been involved in aiding in the production of other Latin American films, but through technical assistance rather than acting as a financier. One example is [[Chile]]an director [[Miguel Littín]]'s Academy Award-nominated ''[[Alsino and the Condor]]'', which was shot in [[Nicaragua]] and received technical support from Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Ana M. Lopez, "An 'Other' History: The New Latin American Cinema." Radical History Review 1988.41 (1988): 93-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late 1980s, Cuba created the Third World Film School to train students from various third world countries in the art of filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Aufderheide, "Latin American Cinema and the Rhetoric of Cultural Nationalism: Controversies at Havana in 1987 and 1989." Quarterly Review of Film and Video 12.4 (1991): 61-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperfect Cinema==

Cuban cinema and Latin American films communicate many different meanings, messages, and focuses. Cuban film director Julio García Espinosa was well known in the 1960s for his contributions to cinematography and culture. He was a founder of the ICAIC and the President of the Section of Cinema of the Cultural Society. The main objectives of Cuban Cinema were production, distribution, and screening films that recorded the ongoing revolutionary process from the perspectives of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Catherine. "Modernity, masculinity and Imperfect Cinema in Cuba." Questia Media America 38 (1997): 345.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davies, the films that were shot on location and featured local people were shown free of charge across the country in city cinemas and on makeshift village screens to spectators who were encouraged to participate actively in the films' reception and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Catherine. "Modernity, masculinity and Imperfect Cinema in Cuba." Questia Media America 38 (1997): 345&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968–88, the most common and desired form of film used in Cuba was Imperfect Cinema.

It can be acknowledged that Imperfect Cinema was creative, innovative and possessed a distinctive style that is typically a very thought provoking original work of art.&lt;ref name="Quiros"&gt;Quiros, Oscar. Critical Mass of Cuban Cinema: Art as the Vanguard of Society. John Logie Baird Center and Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Imperfect films captured the viewer's attention because the relevance of the story line matched what the audiences were experiencing in their own lives. Imperfect cinema is a form or theme found through audiences that have struggled in life and are aware of the hard times the people were going through. Only in the person who suffers do we perceive elegance, gravity, even beauty; only in him do we recognize the possibility of authenticity, seriousness, and sincerity. Not only does imperfect cinema represent the struggles of the people it also reveals the process which has generated the problem.&lt;ref name="Espinosa"&gt;Espinosa, Julio Garcia. For an Imperfect Cinema. Berkeley: Jump Cut, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The subjective element is the selection of the problem, conditioned as it is by the interest of the audience-which is the subject. The objective element is showing the process-which is the object.&lt;ref name="Espinosa" /&gt; Imperfect cinema uses the audience as the subject to show the process of the problem as the object.

Aside from indicating the demonstrative, communicative and inquisitive qualities, these characteristics also convey an implicit [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] quality. In other words, Imperfect Cinema possesses utilitarian features because it must perform a particular political function within society.&lt;ref name="Espinosa" /&gt; Cubans felt included by the films which gave them a sense of importance and [[pride]]. Cuban and Latin American films were successful in the international market even though they did not always fit the hegemonic models or use mainstream film languages. Imperfect cinema is a great example of film that is accepted internationally even though it does not fit into the Hollywood genre or codes of representation.

Style for Imperfect Cinema is thus defined by the specific techniques and qualities contextualized in orthodox [[Marxism]]'s aesthetics of content over form, such as the use of 'type' characters, harsh imagery made by scratches, under/over exposure, high contrast, excessive movements of the camera, presentation of historical events and the wide use of hand-held cameras.&lt;ref name="Quiros" /&gt; This form of film was very popular among the revolutionary people because the films were portrayed in a manner that was very easy to relate to and shared a common feeling and interest among the people that were experiencing similar situations that were occurring in Cuba at the time. The revolution provided alternatives, supplied an entirely new response, enabled the country to do away with elitist concepts and practices in art, and was the highest expression of culture because it abolished artistic culture as a fragmentary human activity.&lt;ref name="Espinosa" /&gt;

Imperfect Cinema was responsible for making a reputation for Cuban film, but by the mid-1970s, Cuban filmmakers were purposely making a different style of cinema.&lt;ref name="Quiros" /&gt;  Chanan, for example, concludes that by the late 1970s Imperfect Cinema had just about disappeared. He believes that since then Cuban cinema has given up the challenge of creating its own style in favor of imitating Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Chanan, Michael. The Cuban Image. London: British Film Institute, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; For Garcia Espinosa and many of his fellow Latin American filmmakers, Imperfect Cinema was the answer to the need of creating a form of art that demonstrates the process of the problems&amp;nbsp;... not a cinema to beautifully illustrate concepts and ideas we already know. The purpose of this revolutionary form of film was derived from the revolution itself.&lt;ref name="Quiros" /&gt;  By 1989, Cuban cinema had the formal sophistication to carry any revolutionary message, or none at all.&lt;ref name="Quiros" /&gt; Imperfect cinema was no longer interested in quality or technique. It can be created equally well with a Mitchell or with an 8mm camera, in a studio or in a guerrilla camp in the middle of the jungle.&lt;ref name="Espinosa" /&gt;

Since all of these critical operations require new approaches to film directing, we cannot expect flawless results every time. Films built on the consecrated conventions of traditional cinematography are more likely to attain technical "perfection" than those necessarily "imperfect" attempts to challenge established conventions and search out new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Julianne. Cinema and Social Change in Latin America. Austin: The University of Texas Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of imperfect cinema is "perfect" cinema which is basically described as films that are portrayed as perfect, flawless, and contain beautiful scenery. The majority of scenes that are shot in a "perfect" film are in a beautiful place, typically the film is not produced to make the viewer think, and they're usually more aesthetically pleasing rather than meaningful. We maintain that imperfect cinema must above all show the process which generates the problems. It is thus the opposite of a cinema principally dedicated to celebrating results, the opposite of a self-sufficient and contemplative cinema, the opposite of a cinema which "beautifully illustrates" ideas or concepts which we already possess.&lt;ref name="Espinosa" /&gt;

Modern authorship is established and valued mostly as a matter of output and public success. "Perfect" films are valued by critics, awards, and merchandise that are produced because of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Eduardo. Cuba and the Tempest: Literature &amp; Cinema in the Time of Diaspora. North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to "perfect" films, imperfect films focus on the art, sending a message, and creating substance. Most Latin American films can only achieve success in the international market if they emulate hegemonic models and borrow from mainstream film languages.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw, Deborah. Contemporary Latin American Cinema: Breaking into the Global Market. Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The "perfect" films are difficult for Latin American and Cuban film makers to compete with because most viewers are interested in watching films that are visually attractive and don't require a lot of thought while watching. It stands to reason that today's changing circumstances of film production and consumption determine that genres cannot exist by mere repetition and recycling of past models but have to engage with difference and change.&lt;ref name="Shaw" /&gt; Art will not disappear into nothingness; it will disappear into everything.&lt;ref name="Espinosa" /&gt;

===Post-Cold War era===

The post [[Cold War]] period is known as the "Special Period" in Cuba. During this time period the Cuban cinema industry suffered greatly (as did the Cuban citizens due to severe economic depression). This is best phrased by Elliott Young:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The state expected artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals to become economically autonomous and not rely on state subsidies; this new market orientation forced cultural producers to seek foreign financing or simply to leave the country altogether. The impact of the economic crisis hit the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográfico (ICAIC) directly, leading to an exodus of personnel and the slowing down of production to the extent that, in 1996, the Institute did not release a single feature film&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Young, "Between the Market and a Hard Place: Fernando Pérez's Suite Habana in a Post-utopian Cuba." ''CUBAN STUDIES'' 38, (2007): 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The films that were produced were no longer made solely for Cuban people, but mainly for foreign audiences. Pastor Vega states "Before one only thought about the Cuban public. Now you have to think about 'marketing' and 'profits' and all that."&lt;ref&gt;4.  Young, "Between the Market and a Hard Place: Fernando Pérez's Suite Habana in a Post-utopian Cuba," 28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the films that were produced for the Cuban people, tended to take a more drastic turn towards more controversial issues. One of the biggest genres that came out of this period was about homosexuality. One of the most popular movies that come out of this time period is called ''Fresa y chocolate'' (1994, ''Strawberry and Chocolate''). The success of this movie "can be partially explained by the way the film elicits multiple recognition from the Cuban viewer"&lt;ref&gt;5.  Catherine Davies, "Recent Cuban Fiction Films: Identification, Interpretation, Disorder." ''BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH'' 15, (1996): 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it makes the viewer think/look at the film in a different light.

During this time the producers and directors had to always think about cost of production. In the past, going on long excursions to make films were the standard rather than the exception. A perfect example of a movie that was made through this time period is called ''Madagascar'' (1994), directed by Fernando Perez. Ann Marie Stock states (about the production of ''Madagascar''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Madagascar'' (1994), was made against all odds, during a time when Cuba's state sponsored film institute was experiencing shortages of virgin film stock, fuel to transport crews and equipment, food to provide a meal to those working long days, and the hard currency necessary to edit, produce and distribute films.&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Stock, "Imagining the Future in Revolutionary Cuba: Interview with Fernando Pérez." ''FILM QUARTERLY'' 60, (2007): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The films that were lucky enough to be put into production, found them that they were being produced as close to the ICAIC (Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry) as possible, or found that the major cities (Havana, [[Santiago de Cuba]], etc.&amp;nbsp;...) became the backdrop to the plot of the movies. This allowed the directors to use ordinary citizens in the movies instead of having to bring in extras for production. The director could even use citizens' homes as a backdrop, if the owner agreed to allow the director to use it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">A '''corporate university''' is any educational entity that is a strategic tool designed to assist its parent organization in achieving its goals by conducting activities that foster individual and organizational learning and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Mark|title=The Corporate University Handbook|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|date=2002|pages=9|isbn=978-0-8144-0711-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate universities (CU) are a growing trend in [[corporation]]s. In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]], [[Boeing]], and [[Motorola]].&lt;ref name="Hearn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/OrgTheory/Hearn721.html|title=Education in the Workplace: An Examination of Corporate University Models |last=Hearn|first=Denise R.|date=2002-05-10|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'corporate university' also refers to public universities which have developed, or have been forced by states to develop, corporate style behaviour&lt;ref&gt; Marginson and Considine, 2000, https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-University-Governance-Reinvention-Australia/dp/052179448X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528155796&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=simon+marginson&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In most cases, corporate universities are not [[University|universities]] in the strict sense of the word. The traditional university is an educational institution which grants both [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] degrees in a variety of subjects, as well as conducting original scientific research. In contrast, a corporate university typically limits scope to providing job-specific, indeed company-specific, training for the managerial personnel of the parent corporation. Corporate universities are most commonly found in the [[United States]], a nation which has no official legal definition of the term "university". Perhaps the best known corporate university is the [[Hamburger University]] operated by [[McDonald's Corporation]] in [[Chicago]].

==Typical goals of a corporate university==
Corporate universities are set up for a variety of reasons, but most organizations have the same basic needs. These are to:&lt;ref name="Hearn"/&gt;
*Bring a common culture, loyalty, and belonging to a company
*Get the most out of the investment in education
*Organize training
*Remain competitive in today's economy
*Retain employees 
*Start and support change in the organization

CUs offer valuable training and education to employees, but they also help organizations retain and promote key employees. Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project.

==Curriculum==
[[J.P. Morgan]] and Co. is an example of a company with an organized curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2003/07/28/focus2.html?page=1|title=Corporate university approach taking hold|last=Tanner|first=Lisa|date=2003-07-25|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three different types of courses: Business specific courses, organizational learning and communication classes, and management and executive training. What your company decides to offer will depend on your needs (such as sales training, marketing, or soft skills) and your company's business (like manufacturing, consulting, or technology). 

Most CUs offer a blended curriculum of online and in person classes. Some organizations offer courses during the workday while other offer them at varying times. Courses can be short workshops or longer, more traditional courses. 

Unlike traditional universities, CUs demand a return on their investment. There must be concrete evidence that the classroom is delivering results. Many CUs provide hands-on and team learning as a more effective alternative to lecture-based courses, but all CUs agree that what is learned in the classroom should be directly applicable to the work environment.

==Implementation==
Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project such as complex logistics, resource optimization and careful budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/training-roi-walmart-success-stéphane-pineau/|title=Training ROI- the Walmart success|last=Pineau|first=Stephane|date=2016-12-07|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, corporate universities tend to be cost centers with dedicated training facilities servicing an often global workforce through a dedicated curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21651217-more-firms-have-set-up-their-own-corporate-universities-they-have-become-less-willing-pay|title=Keeping it on the company campus|date=2015-05-15|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To manage this complexity, specific [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems have been developed for Corporate Universities, such as a [[Training management system]]. Other systems such as accounting systems and different types of [[Educational Technology| learning technologies]] can be used together.

'''''Diary of an Oxygen Thief''''' is a 2006 Dutch novel, written anonymously and published in [[Amsterdam]] by NLVI. ''Diary of an Oxygen Thief'' was called a "surprise dark-horse [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] best seller" by ''[[New York Magazine]]'', referring to the independent art, literature, and  music scene in [[Brooklyn]], New York.

==Summary==
Purporting to be an autobiography, ''Diary of an Oxygen Thief'' begins with the narrator, an Irish advertising executive living in London, describing the pleasure he used to receive from [[Psychological abuse|emotionally abusing]] women.  After the narrator starts attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings, he sobers up and looks back on his past relationships with a measure of remorse. After taking a job in the United States, the narrator is confronted externally by the  absurdity of corporate America, culture shock, and the conflict of moving from the lower to upper-middle class. Internally he grapples with paranoia, addiction, and a legacy of pain.  Later, he meets a young, aspiring photographer in New York and falls in love with her. 

The "Oxygen Thief" in the title refers to narrator's low self-esteem. Because of his sense of self-loathing he seems to go through life unworthy of the very air he breathes.

==Reception==
''Diary of an Oxygen Thief'' quickly became popular from its initial publication in 2006 to 2016 where it was listed on both [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[iTunes]] 20 top selling books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=Unnamed ‘Oxygen Thief’ becomes self-published success|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/unnamed-oxygen-thief-become-self-published-success/|website=Seattle Times|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deahl|first1=Rachel|title=How 'Diary of an Oxygen Thief' Went from Self-Published Obscurity to Bestsellerdom|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/70874-how-diary-of-an-oxygen-thief-went-from-self-published-obscurity-to-bestsellerdom.html|website=Publisher's Weekly|publisher=Publisher's Weekly|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Housham|first1=Jane|title=Diary of an Oxygen Thief by Anonymous review – the cult tale of a misogynist’s ruin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/02/diary-of-an-oxygen-thief-review-anonymous|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was attempted by [[the Beach Boys]] in 1976 during recording sessions for their album ''[[15 Big Ones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doe|first1=Andrew G.|title=GIGS76|url=http://esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs76.html|website=Endles Summer Quarterly|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the song was rewritten with [[Al Jardine]] for his album ''[[A Postcard from California]]'' and with several of his Beach Boys bandmates making a guest appearance. Al Jardine's version was also issued on a Vinyl 45 RPM Record [[Record Store Day]] 2011 in a limited edition of 2,500 copies (1,000 White Vinyl and 1,500 Black Vinyl) with the proceeds to benefit tsunami relief for Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Beach Boys Single, 'Don't Fight the Sea,' To Benefit Red Cross Relief Efforts In Japan|url=http://www.soundstagedirect.com/beach-boys-japan-relief-vinyl-records.shtml|accessdate=2 July 2014|date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Doors Open Day took place in France in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;http://us.france.fr/en/events/european-heritage-days-5&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2015}} and the concept has spread to other places in Europe (see [[European Heritage Days]]), North America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doorsopenontario.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_39_1.html About Doors Open Ontario Retrieved 25 February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228053418/http://www.doorsopenontario.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_39_1.html |date=February 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] and elsewhere.

Doors Open Days promotes architecture and heritage sites to a wider audience within and beyond the country's borders. It is an opportunity to discover hidden architectural gems and to see behind doors that are rarely open to the public for free.

== Heritage Open Days in England== 
[[Heritage Open Days]] established in 1994 celebrate English architecture and culture allowing visitors free access to historical landmarks that are either not usually open to the public, or would normally charge an entrance fee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doors open days in Scotland==
Doors Open Days is organised by the [[Scottish Civic Trust]]. Alongside Scottish Archaeology Month,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottisharchaeologymonth.com scottisharchaeologymonth.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the open days form [[Scotland]]'s contribution to [[European Heritage Days]].  This joint initiative between the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]] aims to give people a greater understanding of each other through sharing and exploring cultural heritage.  49 countries across [[Europe]] take part annually, in September.

During [[Glasgow]]'s  year as [[European City of Culture]] in 1990, organisers ran an Open Doors event.  Its popularity encouraged other areas to take part the following year and were coordinated by the [[Scottish Civic Trust]].  Doors Open Days now take place throughout Scotland thanks to a dedicated team of area coordinators.  These coordinators work for a mixture of organisations:  [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]], civic trusts, [[cultural heritage|heritage]] organisations and archaeological trusts.

[[Scotland]] is one of the few participating countries where events take place every weekend in September, with different areas choosing their own dates.  More than 900 [[buildings]] now take part. In 2008, over 225,000 visits were made generating £2million for the Scottish economy.  It is estimated that 5,000 or more [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s give their time to run activities and open doors for members of the public.

Doors Open Days was supported in 2009 by Homecoming Scotland 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homecomingscotland2009.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a year-long initiative that marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns.  It was funded by the Scottish Government and part financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund.  Its aim was to engage Scots at home as well as motivate people of Scottish descent and those who simply love Scotland, to take part in an inspirational celebration of Scottish culture and heritage.

== Open house in Australia==
{{Commons category|Open days in Australia}}
Open House events are organised in Australia in partnership with Open House Worldwide. The first Open House event took place in [[Open House Melbourne|Melbourne]] in 2008. This was followed by [[Brisbane Open House|Brisbane]] in 2010, and [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 2012.

'''Edholm's law''', named for [[Phil Edholm]], says the [[wireless]], nomadic and wired network capabilities will converge. Soon, even slower communications channels like cellphones and radio modems will eclipse the capacity of early [[Ethernet]], thanks to upcoming standards known as [[UMTS]] and [[MIMO]], which will boost bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage.

Extrapolating forward indicates a convergence between the rates of nomadic and wireless technologies around 2030.

While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the [[nonprofit sector]], the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit.&lt;ref name="doing-good-better"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=Doing Good Better|date=2015|publisher=Avery|isbn=978-1592409105}}&lt;/ref&gt; People associated with the movement include philosopher [[Peter Singer]],&lt;ref name="blog.ted.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=The why and how of effective altruism: Peter Singer’s talk visualized|url=http://blog.ted.com/why-how-effective-altruism-peter-singer-visualized/|website=TED Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook cofounder [[Dustin Moskovitz]],&lt;ref name="Washington Post on Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/billionaire-couple-give-plenty-to-charity-but-they-do-quite-a-bit-of-homework/2014/12/26/19fae34c-86d6-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html | title=Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz: Young Silicon Valley billionaires pioneer new approach to philanthropy | date=December 26, 2014 | agency=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cari Tuna,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/9/12/meet-cari-tuna-the-woman-giving-away-dustin-moskovitzs-faceb.html|title=Meet Cari Tuna, the Woman Giving Away Dustin Moskovitz's Facebook Fortune|first=Favid|last=Callahan|work=Inside Philanthropy|date=September 12, 2013|access-date=March 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford-based researchers [[William MacAskill]]&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Derek|title=The Greatest Good|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/#b06g25t20w15|work=The Atlantic|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toby Ord]],&lt;ref name="Peter Singer The Most Good You Can Do"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBWWX4ViD3E/|website=YouTube|title=Peter Singer: "The Most Good You Can Do" &amp;#124; Talks at Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professional poker player [[Liv Boeree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokerstrategy.com/news/world-of-poker/Liv-Boeree-on-Effective-Altruism_100487/|title=News: Liv Boeree on Effective Altruism|website=www.pokerstrategy.com|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livboeree.com/effective-altruism/|title=Effective Altruism {{!}} Liv Boeree|website=www.livboeree.com|language=en-GB|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Singer]] is a prominent advocate of effective altruism.]]
Effective altruism differs from other philanthropic practices because of its emphasis on quantitatively comparing charitable causes and interventions with the goal of maximizing certain human values. In this way it is similar to [[consequentialism]], which some leaders of the movement explicitly endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity|title = You have $8 billion. You want to do as much good as possible. What do you do?|authorlink = Dylan Matthews|last = Matthews|first = Dylan|date = April 24, 2015|accessdate = August 4, 2015|publisher = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The views of the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in particular helped give rise to the effective altruist movement.&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality" /&gt; Singer's book ''[[The Life You Can Save]]'' argued for the basic philosophy of effective giving, claiming that people have a moral imperative to donate more because of the existence of extreme poverty. In the book, Singer argued that people should use [[charity evaluators]] to determine how to make their donations most effective. Singer personally gives a third of his income to charity.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

===Impartiality===

Effective altruists reject the view that some lives are intrinsically more valuable than others. For example, they believe that a person in a developing country has equal value to a person in one's own community.&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jollimore|first1=Troy|title=Impartiality|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impartiality/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=March 11, 2017|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1972 essay '[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]', Peter Singer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It makes no difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. ... The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously ..., this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.&lt;ref name="singer1972"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fringer.org/wp-content/writings/famine.pdf |title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality |format=PDF |year=1972 |page=231 |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106212947/http://www.fringer.org/wp-content/writings/famine.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, many effective altruists think that future generations have equal moral value to currently existing people, and focus on reducing [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|existential risks to humanity]]. Others believe that the interests of [[Personhood|non-human animals]] should be accorded the same moral weight as similar interests of humans and work to prevent the suffering of animals,&lt;ref name="skelton" /&gt; such as those raised in factory farms.&lt;ref name="huffpost-ea-global"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitney|first1=Nico|title=Elon Musk To Address 'Nerd Altruists' At Google HQ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-google-effective-altruism_us_55a56626e4b04740a3de3130|website=Huffington Post|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cause prioritization===
Although there is a growing emphasis on effectiveness and evidence among nonprofits, this is usually done with a single cause in mind, such as education or climate change. Effective altruists, however, seek to compare the relative importance of different causes and choose one objectively, a concept that is usually referred to as cause neutrality.&lt;ref name="gabriel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oliver"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Huw|title='Effective Altruists' Are a New Type of Nice Person|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/why-are-young-people-being-so-altruistic-209|website=Vice|publisher=Vox|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practical-ethics/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/understanding-cause-neutrality/|title=Understanding cause-neutrality - Centre for Effective Altruism|website=Centre for Effective Altruism|language=en-US|access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruists choose the highest priority causes based on whether activities in each cause area could efficiently advance broad goals, such as increasing human or animal welfare, and then focus their attention on interventions in high priority areas. 

Several organizations perform cause prioritization research to answer the question of what causes warrant the highest priority.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causes|url=http://80000hours.org/causes|work=80,000 Hours|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate= June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GiveWell Labs Overview|url=http://www.givewell.org/about/labs|publisher=GiveWell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common priorities among effective altruists include poverty in the [[developing country|developing world]], the suffering of animals in [[factory farming|factory farms]], and [[Global catastrophic risk|risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]].&lt;ref name="doing-good-better" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gabriel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gabriel|first1=Iason|title=Effective Altruism and Its Critics|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2016|volume=33|issue=3|doi=10.1111/japp.12176|url=https://www.academia.edu/13786913/Effective_Altruism_and_Its_Critics_Journal_of_Applied_Philosophy_2016_|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practical-ethics/&gt;

===Cost-effectiveness===
Effective altruist organizations argue that some charities are far more effective than others, either because some do not achieve their goals or because of variability in the cost of achieving those goals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Funding-the-Right-Program | publisher = GiveWell | title = Your dollar goes further when you fund the right program }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dollar-overseas&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas | publisher = GiveWell | title = Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas}}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, they seek to identify charities that are highly [[cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]], meaning that they achieve a large benefit for a given amount of money.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good" /&gt; For example, they select health interventions on the basis of their impact as measured by lives saved per dollar, [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) saved per dollar, or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY) averted per dollar. This measure of disease burden is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.

Some effective altruism organizations use [[randomized controlled trial]]s as a primary form of evidence,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skelton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skelton|first1=Anthony|title=The Ethical Principles of Effective Altruism|journal=Journal of Global Ethics|date=2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137–146|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SKETEP|accessdate= March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are often considered to be at the highest level of strong evidence in healthcare research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/cp30.pdf |title= A guide to the development, implementation and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines |author= National Health and Medical Research Council |date=November 16, 1998 |publisher= Commonwealth of Australia |location = Canberra | isbn = 1-86496-048-5 |page= 56|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Counterfactual reasoning===

Effective altruists argue that [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] reasoning is important to determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume that the best way to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Best jobs for saving the world | first1 = Donna | last1  = Rosato | first2 = Grace | last2 = Wong | date = November 2011 | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/jobs-helping-others/1.html | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 10 "helping" professions and how to train for them | first = Aimee | last = Hosler | date =  June 14, 2011 | publisher = Schools.com | url = http://www.schools.com/articles/10-helping-professions-and-how-to-train-for-them.html | accessdate = 2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.&lt;ref name="todd-career-paper"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Benjamin|title=Which Ethical Careers Make a Difference?: The Replaceability Issue in the Ethics of Career Choice|url=https://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice?auto=download|website=University of Oxford|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Room for more funding===

Effective altruist organizations make philanthropic recommendations for charities on the basis of their current funding need rather than merely evaluating the value of the work itself.&lt;ref name="givewell-interview-huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=Linch|title=How Can You do the Most Good with Your Charitable Giving? This Expert's Answers Might Surprise You|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linch-zhang/how-can-you-do-the-most-g_b_10597442.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate= March 18, 2017|date= June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSIR-holden"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karnofsky|first1=Holden|title=We Should Expect Good Giving To Be Hard (SSIR)|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/we_should_expect_good_giving_to_be_hard|website=Stanford Social Innovation Review|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=March 18, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruists avoid donating to organizations that have no "room for more funding" - those that face bottlenecks other than money which prevent them from spending the funds they have already accumulated or are expected to receive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria/room-for-more-funding Room for More Funding - GiveWell]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a medical charity might not be able to hire enough doctors or nurses to distribute the medical supplies it is capable of purchasing, or it might already be serving all of the potential patients in its market. There are many other organizations which ''do'' have room for more funding, so giving to one of those instead would produce real-world improvements.

==Behavior==

===Donation ===

Effective altruism encourages significant charitable donation. Some believe it is a moral duty to alleviate suffering through donations if the purchases that one forgoes to donate do not cause comparable suffering to oneself,&lt;ref name=singer1972 /&gt; leading some of them to lead a frugal lifestyle in order to give substantially more than is typical in their society.&lt;ref name="kaufman-wise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burton|first1=Paul|title=Family Gives Away Half Their Income To Help Others|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/family-gives-away-half-their-income-to-help-others/|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy focuses on increasing the amount that people donate or identifying nonprofits that best meet the criteria of effective altruism.

[[Giving What We Can]] (GWWC) is an organization which hosts a community of individuals who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income for the remainder of their working lives to the causes that they believe are the most effective. GWWC was founded in November 2009 by [[Toby Ord]], a moral philosopher at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the remainder of his income to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843|title=Toby Ord: Why I'm giving £1m to charity|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date= December 13, 2010|accessdate= March 2, 2013|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, more than 3,200 individuals have taken the pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/#our-members-have-done-some-amazing-things|title=Giving What We Can|website=www.givingwhatwecan.org|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ox-gwwc-pledges"&gt;{{cite news|title=1000 people match Oxford philosopher’s ‘10% of future income’ charity pledge|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-07-15-1000-people-match-oxford-philosopher%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9810-future-income%E2%80%99-charity-pledge|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=University of Oxford|date= July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founders Pledge]] is a similar system run by the nonprofit Founders Forum for Good where startup founders make a legally binding commitment to donate at least 2% of their personal proceeds to charity in the event that they sell their business.&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-80k-interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=One of the most exciting new effective altruist organisations: An interview with David Goldberg of the Founders Pledge|url=https://80000hours.org/2015/11/one-of-the-most-exciting-new-effective-altruist-organisations-an-interview-with-david-goldberg-of-the-founders-pledge/|website=80,000 Hours|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prosser|first1=David|title=Entrepreneurs Pledge Millions To Social Good|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2015/06/10/entrepreneurs-pledge-millions-to-social-good/#3d2f84e66bb9|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=Forbes|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/09/uk-tech-founders-take-the-founders-pledge-to-2-commiting-28m-to-good-causes/|title = UK Tech Founders Take The Founders Pledge To 2%, Committing $28m+ To Good Causes|last = Butcher|first = Mike|date = June 9, 2015|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2016, one year after launch, 430 entrepreneurs had pledged, for an estimated total value of $134 million based on the founders' equity and the companies' valuation.&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-anniversary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Founders Pledge generates £90m in its first year|url=http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/news/founders-pledge-generates-%C2%A390m-its-first-year|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=City Philanthropy|date= May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career selection===

Effective altruists argue that selection of one's career is an important determinant of the amount of good one does,&lt;ref name="oliver" /&gt; both directly (through the services one provides to the world) and indirectly (through the ways one directs the money earned based on the career).&lt;ref name="macaskill-replaceability-paper" /&gt;

[[80,000 Hours]] is an [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based organization in the effective altruism movement that writes articles and conducts one-on-one coaching to help people find careers with a positive social impact.&lt;ref name=yc-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/|title = Want To Make An Impact With Your Work? Try Some Advice From 80,000 Hours|date = August 4, 2015|accessdate = October 31, 2015|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers indirect methods of altruistic employment, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct practices, such as scientific research. It was co-founded by [[William MacAskill]],&lt;ref name="fastcoexist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alcorn|first1=Stan|title=How To Choose An Ethical Career (With Help From Oxford Philosophers)|url=https://www.fastcoexist.com/1682193/how-to-choose-an-ethical-career-with-help-from-oxford-philosophers|website=Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company Inc|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also its current president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the Team|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[earning to give]] strategy has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating large sums of money to charity.&lt;ref name="join-ws-save-world"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Join Wall Street.

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], a columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', criticized effective altruists who adopt the strategy. He wrote that most people who work in finance and other high-paying industries value money for selfish reasons and that being surrounded by these people will cause effective altruists to become less altruistic.&lt;ref name="brooks2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=David | title=The Way to Produce a Person |newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 3, 2013| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Week]]'', Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry argued that the practice was "unsettling".&lt;ref name="gobry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/542955/effective-altruism-really-change-world|title = Can Effective Altruism really change the world?|last = Gobry|first = Pascal-Emmanuel|date = March 16, 2015|accessdate = March 21, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Week]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause priorities==

Effective altruism aspires to be cause-neutral, meaning it is in principle open to helping in whichever areas allow them to do the most good.&lt;ref name=practical-ethics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2013/05/what-is-effective-altruism/|title = What is Effective Altruism?|publisher = Practical Ethics blog|last = MacAskill|first = William|date = May 20, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kissel" /&gt; In practice, most people in the effective altruist movement have prioritized poverty, animal welfare, and risks of the long term future.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name=skelton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/|title=Four focus areas of effective altruism - Effective Altruism Forum|website=effective-altruism.com|language=en|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/|title=A list of the most urgent global issues|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=May 31, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global poverty alleviation===

Global [[poverty alleviation]] has been a focus of some of the earliest and most prominent organizations associated with effective altruism.

Charity evaluator [[GiveWell]] was founded by [[Holden Karnofsky]] and Elie Hassenfeld in 2007 to address poverty and is currently a part of the effective altruism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konduri|first1=Vimal|title=GiveWell Co-Founder Explains Effective Altruism Frameworks|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/4/givewell-founder-effective-altruism/|website=The Harvard Crimson|publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|accessdate= March 10, 2017|ref=crimson|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell-opt-in&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/|title = Effective Altruism|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = August 13, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; GiveWell has argued that the value of donations is greatest for international poverty alleviation and developing world health issues,&lt;ref name="bloomberg-givewell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolfe|first1=Alexandra|title=Hedge Fund Analytics for Nonprofits|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-23/hedge-fund-analytics-for-nonprofits|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg LP|date= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dollar-overseas/&gt; and its leading recommendations have been in these domains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing good by doing well|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21651815-lessons-business-charities-doing-good-doing-well|website=The Economist|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo-elie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/elie-hassenfeld-givewell_n_6927320.html|title = That Time A Hedge Funder Quit His Job And Then Raised $60 Million For Charity|last = Pitney|first = Nico|date = March 26, 2015|accessdate = April 27, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Against Malaria Foundation]], [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]], [[Deworm the World Initiative]], and (earlier) [[VillageReach]] in global health, and [[GiveDirectly]] for direct unconditional cash transfers).

While much of the initial focus of effective altruism was on direct strategies such as health interventions and cash transfers, there has also been interest in more systematic social, economic, and political reform that would facilitate larger long-term poverty reduction.&lt;ref name="scott-weathers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weathers|first1=Scott|title=Can ‘effective altruism’ change the world?

===Animal welfare===

Many effective altruists believe that reducing [[animal suffering]] should be a major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Matthews, [https://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9067641/william-macaskill-effective-altruism "You have 80,000 hours in your career. Here's how to do the most good with them"], ''Vox'', August 3rd 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2.7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims|title=Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate|date=2010-09-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=June 14, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/GlobalWarningExecutiveSummary1.pdf|title=Global Warming Climate Change and Farm Animal Welfare|last=|first=|publisher=Compassion in World Farming|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fishcount.org.uk/published/standard/fishcountfullrptSR.pdf|title=Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish|last=Mood|first=Alison|publisher=fishcount.org.uk|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction.{{sfn|Singer|2015|pp=138, 146–147}} Philosophically, [[wild animal suffering]] may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Effective Altruism for Animals" Panel, Animal Studies|url=http://animalstudies.as.nyu.edu/object/as.events.20150729|website=New York University Animal Studies Initiative|publisher=NYU|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an organization connected with the movement that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their cost-effectiveness and transparency, particularly those that are tackling [[factory farming]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Daniel Engber, [http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/08/animal_activists_crunched_the_numbers_to_learn_that_the_creature_most_in.html "Save the Chicken"], ''Slate'', August 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singer|2015|p=139}} [[Faunalytics]] (formerly the Humane Research Council) is an organization loosely affiliated with the movement that conducts independent research on important animal welfare topics, provides resources for advocates and donors, and works with animal protection organizations to evaluate their work.

===Long term future and global catastrophic risks===

Focusing on the long-term future, some effective altruists believe that the total value of any meaningful metric (wealth, potential for suffering, potential for happiness, etc.) summed up over future generations, far exceeds the value for people living today.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name="eaf-far-future"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of the Far Future|url=https://ea-foundation.org/blog/the-importance-of-the-far-future/|website=Effective Altruism Foundation|publisher=Effective Altruism Foundation|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=2003|title=Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.pdf|journal=Utilitas|volume=15|pages=308–314|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the importance of addressing [[existential risk]]s such as dangers associated with [[biotechnology]] and [[Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|advanced artificial intelligence]] is often highlighted and the subject of active research. Because it is often infeasible to use empirical science (such as randomized control trials) to measure the probability of an existential risk, researchers such as [[Nick Bostrom]] have used other methods such as expert opinion elicitation to estimate their importance.&lt;ref name="xrisk methods"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rowe |first1=Thomas |last2=Beard |first2=Simon |title=Probabilities, methodologies and the evidence base in existential risk assessments |journal=Working paper,  Centre for the Study of Existential Risk |date=2018 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/89506/1/Beard_Existential-Risk-Assessments_Accepted.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations that work actively on research and advocacy for improving the long term future, and have connections with the effective altruist movement, are the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]], and [[Future of Life Institute]].&lt;ref name="guan-op-ed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guan|first1=Melody|title=The New Social Movement of our Generation: Effective Altruism|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/new-social-movement-generation-effective-altruism/|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=Harvard Political Review|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] is focused on the more narrow mission of aligning advanced artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="washpost-ai"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basulto|first1=Dominic|title=The very best ideas for preventing artificial intelligence from wrecking the planet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/07/07/the-very-best-ideas-for-preventing-artificial-intelligence-from-wrecking-the-planet/|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matthews-ea-global"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=I spent a weekend at Google talking with nerds about charity.

==History as a social movement==

The ideas behind effective altruism, such as [[consequentialism]], have been present in practical ethics for a long time and have been reflected in the writings of philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham,&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ram|first1=Aliya|title=The power and efficacy of effective altruism|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1954323c-8eb3-11e5-8be4-3506bf20cc2b|accessdate= February 14, 2018|work=Financial Times|date= December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]],&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA" /&gt; Peter Singer,&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality" /&gt; and [[Peter Unger]]. A basic argument for altruism was defined in Singer's 1972 paper "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]", in which he argued that people have an obligation to help those in need:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it.&lt;ref name="singer1972" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the movement identifying with the name 'effective altruism' itself only came into being in the late 2000s&lt;ref name="tmgycd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/170/The-Most-Good-You-Can-Do|title = The Most Good You Can Do|last = Singer|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Singer|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''The Life You Can Save''}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a community formed around the groups Giving What We Can and Givewell.

==Criticism==
[[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] has questioned whether children in distant countries should be treated as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be "internally ennobling".&lt;ref name="brooks2013" /&gt; In the ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'', Ken Berger and Robert Penna of [[Charity Navigator]] condemned effective altruism's practice of "weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another", calling this "moralistic, in the worst sense of the word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism|title = The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism|last = Berger|first = Ken|last2 = Penna|first2 = Robert|date = November 25, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry warns about the "measurement problem", stating that some areas, such as medical research, or helping to reform third-world governance "one grinding step at a time", are hard to measure with controlled cost-effectiveness experiments and therefore risk being undervalued by the effective altruism movement.&lt;ref name="gobry" /&gt; Jennifer Rubenstein also hypothesizes that effective altruism can be biased against causes that are not straightforward to measure.&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA" /&gt;

In ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' magazine, Mathew Snow argued that effective altruism "implores individuals to use their money to procure necessities for those who desperately need them, but says nothing about the system that determines how those necessities are produced and distributed in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/peter-singer-charity-effective-altruism/|title = Against Charity|last = Snow|first = Mathew|date = August 25, 2015|accessdate = September 5, 2016|publisher = ''Jacobin''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various critics have similarly objected to effective altruism on the basis of the fact that its proponents tend not to support political causes such as [[anti-capitalism]] that change "the existing global institutional order".&lt;ref name="Berkey" /&gt; Joshua Kissel has replied that anti-capitalism is compatible with effective altruism in theory, while adding that effective altruists and anti-capitalists have reason to be more sympathetic to each other.&lt;ref name=kissel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=eip/|title = Effective Altruism and Anti-Capitalism:  An Attempt at Reconciliation|last = Kissel|first = Joshua|date = January 31, 2017|accessdate = February 19, 2017|publisher = '' Essays in Philosophy ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Berkey has also argued that support for changing institutions such as capitalism does not contradict the principles of effective altruism, because effective altruism is open to any action that will have the greatest positive impact on the world, including the possibility of changing the existing global institutional order.&lt;ref name=Berkey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berkey |first1=Brian |title=The Institutional Critique of Effective Altruism |journal=Utilitas |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=2 |url=https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Institutional-Critique-of-Effective-Altruism.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Ashton argues that we are separately obligated to donate to effective aid charities and to reform the structures that are responsible for poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashford |first1=Elizabeth |title=Severe Poverty as an Unjust Emergency |journal=The Ethics of Giving: Philosophers' Perspectives on Philanthropy |date=2018 |pages=103-148 |doi=10.1093/oso/9780190648879.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European Film Promotion (EFP)''' is an international promotion organisation and a unique network of 38 European member organisations who represent films and talent from their respective territories. Under the EFP flag, the members team up on initiatives to promote the diversity and the spirit of European cinema and talent at key international film festivals and markets.

==Activities==
EFP's joint promotional strategies including artistic and business-oriented platforms with a focus on three main areas: Promotion of Films &amp; Talent, Access to International Markets, and Film Sales Support outside of Europe.

EFP has developed innovative programmes and initiatives such as the well-known programmes European [[Shooting Stars Award|Shooting Stars]], introducing young talented actors to the press, industry and public at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], and Producers on the Move, a networking event at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] to promote and link up aspiring young producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-shooting-stars-2018-unveiled-1068802|title=European Shooting Stars 2018 Unveiled|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/efp-names-2017-producers-on-the-move-ahead-of-cannes/5117352.article|title=EFP names 2017 Producers on the Move ahead of Cannes|work=Screen|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further programmes concentrate on films by female directors ('''Europe!

==History==
Its predecessor was the European distribution organisation European Film Distribution Office (EFDO) which had been established by [[Dieter Kosslick]] and others in Hamburg in 1988 as a pilot project of the European MEDIA I funding programme. The concept of a network was taken up and further developed by the initial ten members of the European Film Promotion association when it was founded in 1997. The network's President is Martin Martin Schweighofer ([[Austrian Film Commission]]) and Sonja Heinen took over the responsibility for its management from her predecessor and EFP co-founder Renate Rose in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of European Cinema|last=Finney|first=Angus|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2016|isbn=9781474290708|location=Bloomsbury|pages=148 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
EFP is financially supported by the Creative Europe – MEDIA Programme of the [[European Union]] and by its member organisations. The Hamburg-based office is backed by the German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, the Film Fund Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein, and the Ministry of Culture of the City of Hamburg.

An '''exonym''' or '''xenonym''' is an external name for a [[geographical place]], a group of people, an individual person, or a language or [[dialect]]. It is a common name used only outside the place, group, or [[linguistic community]] in question. An '''endonym''' or '''autonym''' is an internal name for a [[geographical place]], a group of people, or a language or [[dialect]]. It is a common name used only inside the place, group, or [[linguistic community]] in question; it is their name for themselves, their homeland, or their language.

For instance, ''Germany'' is the English language exonym, {{wikt-lang|fr|Allemagne}} is the French language exonym, and {{wikt-lang|de|Deutschland}} is the endonym for the same country in Europe.

[[Marcel Aurousseau]], an Australian [[geography|geographer]], first used the term exonym in his work ''The Rendering of Geographical Names'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Aurousseau, 1957, ''The Rendering of Geographical Names'', London, Hutchinson, pp. 2–3, and; Kelsey B. Harder, 1996, "The term", in: Ernst Eichler &amp; Walter de Gruyter (eds), ''Namenforschung/Name Studies/Les noms propres. 2. Halbband+Registerband'', Berlin, Walter de Gruyter, p. 1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''endonym'' was devised subsequently as an [[antonym]] for the term ''exonym''.

==Etymology==
All four of the terms (exonym, endonym, antonym and xenonym) are from the [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek root word]] {{transl|grc|ónoma}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ὄνομα}}), 'name'. The prefixes are from the Greek {{transl|grc|éndon}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἔνδον}}), 'within'; {{transl|grc|autós}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|αὐτός}}), 'self'; {{transl|grc|éxō}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἔξω}}), 'out'; and {{transl|grc|xénos}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ξένος}}), 'foreign'.

==Definitions==
[[wikt:exonym|Exonyms]] and [[wikt:endonym|endonyms]] can be names of places ([[wikt:toponym|toponym]]), ethnic groups ([[ethnonym]]), languages ([[wikt:glossonym|glossonym]]), or individuals ([[personal name]]).&lt;ref&gt;
"The names of monarchs, popes, and non-contemporary authors as well as place-names are commonly translated. Foreign names for geographic proper names are called exonyms. Fourment-Berni Canani (1994) discusses the (im)possibility of translating proper names. He gives the examples of the place-names Venice and London. The Italian city Venezia has been renamed Venice in English and Venise in French. A city in the American state California is also called Venice, but this name is not changed into Venezia in Italian and Venise in French. Similarly, the English city London has been renamed Londres in French and Londra in Italian. However, the Canadian city called London is not translated into French and Italian in this way. Thus, as Fourment-Berni Canani concludes, a place-name can be translated if the place, as a unique referent, has already been renamed in the target language."
Loulou Edelman (2009). ''What's in a name? Classification of proper names by language''. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: expanding the scenery'' (pp. 141–153). London: Routledge. Goh, CL (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As pertains to geographical features, the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] defines:
* '''Endonym''': Name of a geographical feature in an official or well-established language occurring in that area where the feature is located.
* '''Exonym''': Name used in a specific language for a geographical feature situated outside the area where that language is spoken, and differing in its form from the name used in an official or well-established language of that area where the geographical feature is located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ungegn.zrc-sazu.si/ Working Group on Exonyms], United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, ''[[India]]'', ''[[China]]'', ''[[Egypt]]'', and ''[[Germany]]'' are the [[English language|English]]-language exonyms corresponding to the endonyms ''[[Names for India|Bharat]]'', ''[[Names of China|中国]]'' (''Zhōngguó''), ''[[Names of Egypt|مَصر]]'' (''Masr''), and ''[[Names of Germany|Deutschland]]'', respectively. [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[German language|German]] are exonyms in English for the languages that are endonymously known as "中文" ("Zhōngwén"), "فارسی" ("Fārsi"), "Türkçe", "العَرَبِيَّة" ("al-Arabiyah"), and "Deutsch", respectively.

Exonyms may derive from different roots, as in the case of Germany for ''Deutschland'', or they may be [[cognate]] words which have diverged in [[pronunciation]] or [[orthography]], or they may be fully or partially translated (a [[calque]]) from the native language. For example, [[London]] (originally [[Latin Language|Latin]] ''Londinium'') is known by the cognate exonyms ''Londres'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; ''Londino'' (Λονδίνο) in [[Greek Language|Greek]]; ''Londen'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; ''Londra'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; ''Londër'' in Albanian; ''Londýn'' in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]; ''Londyn'' in [[Polish language|Polish]]; ''Lundúnir'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]; ''Lontoo'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. An example of a translated exonym is the French name ''Pays-Bas'' for the [[Netherlands]], ''Nederland'' in Dutch, all of which mean "[[Terminology of the Low Countries|Low Countries]]".

Exonyms can also be divided into native and borrowed, i.e. from a third language. For example, Slovene uses the native exonyms ''Dunaj'' ([[Vienna]]) and ''Benetke'' ([[Venice]]), and the borrowed exonyms ''Kijev'' ([[Kiev]]) and ''Vilna'' ([[Vilnius]]), from Russian. A substantial proportion of English exonyms for places in continental Europe are borrowed (or adapted) from French; for example: [[Navarre]] (''Navarra/Nafarroa''), [[Belgrade]] (''Beograd''), [[Cologne]] (''Köln''), [[Munich]] (''München''), [[Prague]] (''Praha''), [[Rome]] (''Roma''), [[Naples]] (''Napoli''), [[Florence]] (''Firenze''), [[Copenhagen]] (''København''){{citation needed|reason=wikipedia Copenhagen claims it's from Low German origin|date=March 2016}}, etc.

== Tendencies in the development of exonyms ==
According to [[James A. Matisoff]], who introduced the term "autonym" into linguistics, "Human nature being what it is, exonyms are liable to be pejorative rather than complimentary, especially where there is a real or fancied difference in cultural level between [[ingroups and outgroups|the ingroup and the outgroup]]." For example, Matisoff notes ''Khang'' "an opprobrious term indicating mixed race or parentage" is the [[Palaung language|Palaung]] name for [[Jingpo people]] and the [[Jingpo language|Jingpo]] name for [[Chin peoples|Chin people]]; both the Jingpo and Burmese use the Chinese word ''yeren'' 野人 (literally "wild men") "savage; rustic people" as the name for [[Lisu people]].&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff, James A. (1986). "The languages and dialects of Tibeto-Burman: an alphabetic/genetic listing, with some prefatory remarks on ethnonymic and glossonymic complications." In John McCoy and Timothy Light, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=jdYUAAAAIAAJ Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies, presented to Nicholas C. Bodman], p 6. E.J. Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exonyms develop for places of significance for speakers of the language of the exonym. Consequently, many European capitals have English exonyms, e.g. [[Athens]] (Αθήνα/Athína), [[Belgrade]] (Београд/Beograd), [[Bucharest]] (București), [[Brussels]] (Bruxelles, Brussel), [[Copenhagen]] (København), [[Lisbon]] (Lisboa), [[Moscow]] (Москва/Moskva), [[Prague]] (Praha), [[Rome]] (Roma), [[Vienna]] (Wien), and [[Warsaw]] (Warszawa), while for instance historically less prominent capitals [[Ljubljana]] and [[Zagreb]] do not (but do have exonyms in languages spoken nearby e.g. [[German language|German]]: Laibach and Agram, though "Agram" is old fashioned and not used any more). [[Madrid]], [[Berlin]], [[Oslo]], and [[Amsterdam]], with identical names in most major European languages, are exceptions.  Some European capitals might be considered partial exceptions in that whilst the spelling is the same across languages, the pronunciation can differ; thus [[Paris]] in English sees the 's' vocalised, whilst in Swedish [[Stockholm]] is pronounced with a more emphasised glottal stop which is missing in English.  For places considered to be of lesser significance, attempts to reproduce local names have been made in English since the time of the [[Crusades]]. [[Livorno]], to take an instance, was ''Leghorn'' because it was an Italian port essential to English merchants and, by the 18th century, to the British Navy; not far away, [[Rapallo]], a minor port on the same sea, never received an exonym.

In earlier times, the name of the first tribe or village encountered became the exonym for the whole people beyond. Thus the Romans used the tribal names ''Graecus'' (Greek) and ''Germanus'', the Russians used the village name of ''[[Chechen people|Chechen]]'', medieval Europeans took the tribal name ''[[Tatar]]'' as emblematic for the whole [[Mongol]]ic confederation (and then confused it with ''Tartarus'', a word for Hell, to produce ''[[Tatars|Tartar]]''), and the [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invaders were equated with the 500-years-earlier [[Hun]]nish invaders in the same territory, and were called ''Hungarians''.

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders of the [[Roman Empire]] applied the word "[[Walha]]" to foreigners they encountered and this evolved in West Germanic languages as a generic name for all non-Germanic speakers; thence, the names [[Wallachia]], [[Vlachs]], [[Wallonia]], [[Walloons]], [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]], [[Wallasey]], [[Welche]] in Alsace-Lorraine, and even the Polish name for Italy, ''[[Italy|Włochy]]''.

==Usage==
During the late 20th century the use of exonyms often became controversial. Groups often prefer that outsiders avoid exonyms where they have come to be used in a [[pejorative]] way: for example, [[Romani people]] often prefer that term to exonyms such as ''Gypsy'' (from [[Egypt]]), and the French term ''bohémien, bohème'' (from [[Bohemia]]). People may also avoid exonyms for reasons of historical sensitivity, as in the case of German names for Polish and Czech places that at one time had been ethnically or politically German (e.g. [[Danzig/Gdańsk]] and Karlsbad/Karlovy Vary), and Russian names for locations once under Russian control (e.g. Kiev/Kyiv).

In recent years, [[Geography|geographers]] have sought to reduce the use of exonyms to avoid this kind of problem. For example, it is now common for Spanish speakers to refer to the [[Turkey|Turkish]] capital as [[Ankara]] rather than use the Spanish exonym ''Angora''. According to the [[United Nations]] Statistics Division, "Time has, however, shown that initial ambitious attempts to rapidly decrease the number of exonyms were over-optimistic and not possible to realise in the intended way. The reason would appear to be that many exonyms have become common words in a language and can be seen as part of the language’s cultural heritage."

In some situations the use of exonyms can be preferred. For instance, for multilingual cities such as [[Brussels]], which is known for its linguistic tensions between Dutch- and French-speakers, a neutral name may be preferred so as to not offend anyone. Thus an exonym such as Brussels in English could be used instead of favoring either one of the local names (Brussel in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]/[[Flemish]] and Bruxelles in [[French language|French]]).

Other difficulties with endonyms have to do with pronunciation, spelling and word category. The endonym may include sounds and spellings that are highly unfamiliar to speakers of other languages, making appropriate usage difficult if not impossible for an outsider. Over the years, the endonym may have undergone phonetic changes, either in the original language or the borrowing language, thus changing an endonym into an exonym, as in the case of ''Paris'', where the ''s'' was formerly pronounced in French. Another example is the endonym for the German city of [[Cologne]], where the [[Latin]] original of Colonia has evolved into ''Köln'' in German, while the Italian and Spanish exonym ''Colonia'' closely reflects the Latin original. In some cases no standardized spelling is available either because the language itself is unwritten (even unanalyzed) or because there are competing non-standard spellings. Use of a misspelled endonym is perhaps more problematic than the respectful use of an existing exonym. Finally, an endonym may be a plural noun and may not naturally extend itself to adjectival usage in another language, like English, which has a propensity to use the adjectives for describing culture and language. The attempt to use the endonym thus has a bizarre-sounding result.

The names for a language and a people are often different terms, which is a complication for an outsider, with a noticeable example being people from the Netherlands being called the Dutch by native English speakers.

As modern technology removes many of the barriers between peoples, it is increasingly becoming the case that younger people may be more familiar with an endonym than with its official exonym. For example, many Italian cities are now more famous for their football teams and [[Torino]] and [[Napoli]] are becoming more common than [[Turin]] and [[Naples]].

Sometimes the government of a country tries to endorse the use of an endonym instead of traditional exonyms outside the country:
* In 1782 [[Rama I|King Yotfa Chulalok]] of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] moved the government seat from [[Bangkok Yai District|Thonburi Province]] to [[Phra Nakhon District|Phra Nakhon Province]]. In 1972 the Thai government merged Thonburi and Phra Nakhon, forming the new capital, Krungthep Mahanakhon. However, outside of Thailand, the capital retained the old name and is still called [[Bangkok]].
* In 1935 [[Reza Shah]] requested that foreign nations use the name [[Iran]] rather than Persia in official correspondence. The name of the country had internally been [[Name of Iran|Iran]] since the time of the [[Sassanid Empire]] (224–651), whereas the name Persia is descended from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Persis'' (Περσίς), referring to a single province which is officially known as [[Fars Province]].
* In 1949 the government of [[Siam]] changed the name to [[Thailand]], although the former name's adjective in English (''Siamese'') was retained as the name for the [[Siamese fighting fish|fish]], [[Siamese (cat)|cat]] and [[conjoined twins]].
* In 1972 the government of [[Ceylon]] (the word is the anglicized form of Portuguese ''Ceilão'') changed the name to [[Sri Lanka]], although the name Ceylon was retained as the name for [[Ceylon tea|that type of tea]].
* In 1985 the government of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] requested that the country's French name be used in all languages instead of exonyms such as ''Ivory Coast'', so that Côte d'Ivoire is now the official English name of that country in the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (see [[Côte d'Ivoire#Names|Name of Côte d'Ivoire]]). In most non-Francophone countries, however, the French version has not entered common parlance.
* In 1989 the government of Burma requested that the English name of the country be [[Myanmar]], with ''Myanma'' as the adjective of the country and ''Bamar'' as the name of the inhabitants (see [[Names of Burma]]).
* The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] government maintains that the capital of Ukraine should be spelled ''Kyiv'' in English because the traditional English exonym [[Kiev]] was derived from the Russian name ''Kiyev'' (Киев) (see [[Kiev#Name|Name of "Kiev"]]).
* The [[Belarus]]ian government argues that the endonym ''Belarus'' should be used in all languages. The result has been rather successful in English, where the former exonym ''Byelorussia''/''Belorussia'', still used with reference to the [[Byelorussian SSR|Soviet Republic]], has virtually died out; in other languages exonyms like Danish [[:da:Hviderusland|Hviderusland]], Dutch [[:nl:Wit-Rusland|Wit-Rusland]], Estonian [[:et:Valgevene|Valgevene]], Faroese [[:fo:Hvítarussland|Hvítarussland]], Finnish [[:fi:Valko-Venäjä|Valko-Venäjä]], German [[:de:Weißrussland|Weißrussland]], Greek Lefkorosía ([[:el:Λευκορωσία|Λευκορωσία]]), Hungarian [[:hu:Fehéroroszorság|Fehéroroszország]], Icelandic [[:is:Hvíta-Rússland|Hvíta-Rússland]], Swedish [[:sv:Vitryssland|Vitryssland]], Turkish [[:tr:Beyaz Rusya|Beyaz Rusya]], Chinese [[:zh:白俄罗斯|白俄罗斯]] (all literally 'White Russia'), or French [[:fr:Biélorussie|Biélorussie]], Italian [[:it:Bielorussia|Bielorussia]], Portuguese [[:pt:Bielorrússia|Bielorrússia]], and Spanish [[:es:Bielorrusia|Bielorrusia]] are still much more common than ''Belarus''.
* In 2006 the South Korean national government officially changed the Chinese name of its capital, [[Seoul]], from the exonym ''Hancheng'' (漢城/汉城) to ''Shou'er'' (首爾/首尔). This use has now been made official within the [[People's Republic of China]].

Following the declaration in 1979 of [[Hanyu Pinyin]] spelling as the standard romanisation of Chinese, many Chinese endonyms have successfully replaced English exonyms, {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} especially city and most province names in mainland China, e.g. [[Beijing]] (北京 ''Běijīng''), [[Guangdong]] (广东 ''Guǎngdōng'') (province), [[Qingdao]] (青岛 ''Qīngdǎo''), although older English exonyms are sometimes used in certain contexts – e.g. Peking ([[Peking duck|duck]], [[Peking opera|opera]], etc.), Canton, etc. In the case of ''Beijing'', the adoption of the exonym by media outlets quickly gave rise to a [[hyperforeignism|hyperforeignized]] pronunciation, with the result that many English speakers actualize the ''j'' in ''Beijing'' as [ʒ].&lt;ref&gt;The Reality of Linguistic Rules, eds. Susan D. Lima, Roberta Corrigan, Gregory K. Iverson, 1994, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exonyms as pejoratives==
Matisoff wrote, "A group's autonym is often egocentric, equating the name of the people with 'mankind in general,' or the name of the language with 'human speech'."&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff (1986), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various Native American autonyms are sometimes explained to English readers as having literal translations of "original people" or "normal people", with implicit contrast to other first nations as not original or not normal. Exonyms often describe others as "foreign-speaking", "non-speaking" or "nonsense-speaking". The classic example is the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] term for the Germans, ''Nemtsi'', possibly deriving from a plural of ''nemy'' ("mute"): standard etymology has it that the [[Slav]]ic peoples referred to their Germanic neighbors as "mutes" because their language was unintelligible. The term survives to this day in the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''nemtsy'' (''немцы''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''nemtsi'' (''немци''), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''nimtsi'' (''німці''), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Niemcy'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Němci'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''Nijemci/Nemci'' (''Нијемци/Немци''), [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] ''Njemci'' (''Њемци''), as well as in the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Német'' and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''Nemţi'' (both adopted from the Slavic), and even in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Nemçe'' and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-Nimsa'' (النمسا). The Turkish was adapted from the Slavic, and the Arabic from the Turkish, the words in both cases referring specifically to [[Austria]].

One of the more prominent theories regarding the origin of the term "[[Slav]]" suggests that it comes from the Slavic root ''slovo'' (hence "[[Slovenia]]," "[[Slovakia]]"), meaning "word" or "speech". In this context, the [[Slavs]] are describing Germanic people as "mutes"&amp;mdash;in contrast to themselves, "the speaking ones".

Another example of such development is the exonym "[[Sioux]]", an abbreviated form of ''Nadouessioux'', derived most likely from a Proto-Algonquian term, *-a·towe·, "foreign-speaking".

Two millennia earlier, the Greeks thought that all non-Greeks were uncultured and so called them "[[barbarian]]s," which eventually [[Berber (name)|gave rise]] to the exonym "[[Berber people|Berber]]".

While the [[Irish language|Irish]] words for [[England]] and its people are ''Sasana'' and ''Sasanach'' ("Saxons"), the word for the [[English language]] is ''Béarla'', which derives ultimately from a word meaning "lips". In [[Old Irish]], this word was applied to any foreign language, but by the medieval period it had come to be used exclusively for the English language.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Confusion with renaming ==
Exonyms and endonyms must not be confused with the results of [[geographical renaming]] as in the case of [[Saint Petersburg]], which became Petrograd (Петроград) in 1914, Leningrad (Ленинград) in 1924, and Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург ''Sankt-Peterbúrg'') again in 1991. In this case, although ''St Petersburg'' has a German etymology, it was never a German exonym for the city between 1914 and 1991, just as [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the Dutch name of [[New York City]] until 1664, is not its Dutch exonym.

Old place names that have become outdated after renaming may afterwards still be used as [[historicisms]]. For example, even today one would talk about the [[Siege of Leningrad]], not the Siege of St. Petersburg, because at that time (1941–1944) the city was called Leningrad. Likewise, one would say that [[Immanuel Kant]] was born in Königsberg in 1724, not in [[Kaliningrad]] (Калининград), as it has been called since 1946.

Although the pronunciation for several names of Chinese cities such as [[Beijing]] and [[Nanjing]] has not changed for quite some while in [[Mandarin Chinese]], they were called [[Peking]] and [[Nanjing|Nanking]] in English due to the confusion brought about by the older [[Chinese postal romanization]] convention, which was used for transcribing Chinese place names before [[Pinyin]] became the official [[romanization]] method for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] in the 1970s. Nonetheless, many older English speakers still refer to the cities by their older English names and even today they are often used in naming things associated with the cities like [[Peking opera]], [[Peking duck]], and [[Peking University]] to give them a more antiquated or more elegant feel. Like for Saint Petersburg, the historical event called the [[Nanking Massacre]] (1937) uses the city's older name because that was the name of the city at the time of occurrence. Likewise, many Korean cities like [[Busan]] and [[Incheon]] (formerly [[Pusan]] and [[Incheon|Inchǒn]] respectively) also underwent changes in spelling due to changes in romanization, even though the Korean pronunciations have largely stayed the same.

Sometimes, however, historical names are deliberately not used because of nationalist tendencies to linguistically lay claim to a city's past. As a case in point, the [[:sk:Bratislavský mier (1805)|Slovak Wikipedia article]] on the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] does not use any of the city's names then in use (the Hungarian ''[[Pozsony]]'', the Slovak ''Prešporok'' or the German ''Pressburg''), but today's name ''Bratislava'', which became the city's name in 1919.

The name [[Madras]], now [[Chennai]], may be [[Chennai#Etymology|a special case]]. When the city was first settled by Englishmen, in the early 17th century, both names were in use. Possibly they referred to different villages which were fused into the new settlement. In any case, Madras became the exonym, while more recently, Chennai became the endonym.

Likewise, [[Istanbul]] (İstanbul in Turkish) is still called Constantinople (Κωνσταντινούπολη) in Greek, although the name was changed in Turkish to disassociate the city from its Greek past between 1923 and 1930 (the name Istanbul itself [[Names of Istanbul#İstanbul|derives from a Medieval Greek phrase]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Names of Istanbul". Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi. 5. Ciltli. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;). Prior to Constantinople, the city was known in Greek as [[Byzantium|Byzantion]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Βυζάντιον, [[Latin]]: {{lang|la|Byzantium}}), named after its mythical founder, [[Byzas]].

'''Fiambre''' is a [[Traditional food|traditional]] [[Guatemala]]n salad that is prepared and eaten yearly to celebrate the [[Day of the Dead]] (''Día de los Muertos'') and the [[All Saints Day]] (''Día de Todos los Santos''). It is served chilled and may be made with dozens of ingredients.

==History==
Fiambre started out from the tradition in Guatemala of taking dead family members their favorite dishes to the cemeteries for the Day of the Dead. As all different families brought food to the celebrations, they became mixed, eventually mixing them together to this all-encompassing salad. Ingredients usually include numerous [[sausages]] and [[cold cuts]], pickled [[baby corn]] and onion, [[beet]]s, [[Pacaya (food)|pacaya flower]], different [[cheese]]s, olives, chicken, and sometimes even [[brussels sprout]]s.

This dish varies from family to family, recipes traditionally passed on to younger generations. Because of this, on the Day of The Dead, it is customary to share your ''fiambre'' with other families and relatives.

==Variants==
[[File:Listos para el fiambre!.jpg|thumb|Fiambre Served|200px|right|Table with fiambre ingredients before final preparation]]
Some variants are:
*Fiambre from Antigua
*Fiambre rojo (with beets)
*Fiambre blanco (no beets)
*Fiambre desarmado (traditional of the department of Jalapa)
*Fiambre verde (no cold cuts, vegetarian)

'''''Heretica''''' was a conservative cultural and literary magazine published in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], from 1948 to 1953.&lt;ref name="mikim"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Skovmand|author2=Kim Christian Schrøder|title=Media Cultures: Reappraising Transnational Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPYwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180|accessdate=8 October 2016|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-51191-7|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hollywood Hex''''' is an in-depth history of "cursed movies". The book deals with deaths on-set, copycat crimes, obsessed fans, bizarre coincidences, and other incidents which lead a film to be called "cursed".

==Description==
The book's origins are in several essays by the author, [[Mikita Brottman]].&lt;ref name="Images"&gt;{{cite web |first=David|last=Ng|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue08/reviews/hollywoodhex/|title=Hollywood Hex
|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=[http://www.imagesjournal.com/index.html Images: A Journal of Film and Popular Culture]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brottman received her Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from [[Oxford University]],&lt;ref name="Pacifica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifica.edu/faculty_staff.html|title=Core and Adjunct Faculty|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=[[Pacifica Graduate Institute]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211150303/http://www.pacifica.edu/faculty_staff.html|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jhu"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mikita|last=Brottman|year=2000|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/biography/v023/23.1brottman.html|title="Everybody Loves Somebody": The A&amp;e "Rat Pack" Biographies

In a 2005 interview for the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', Brottman defined the elements that make a "cursed movie": "A film will appear to be hexed if one or more of the stars has died after filming or during filming or if it turns out that the stars have drug or health problems or suicidal tendencies - something that the audience wasn't aware of at the time. Or if there's been an unusual pattern of co-incidences associated with the film such as a series of deaths or a series of accidents during filming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barry|last=Didcock|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20051023/ai_n15715683/pg_2|date=Oct 23, 2005|title=Curse of the OMEN and other Hollywood hexes|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=[[Sunday Herald]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central section of the book, and the two films which receive the most analysis, are Polanski's ''[[Macbeth (1971 film)|Macbeth]]'' (1971), and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt;
Polanski's ''Macbeth'', which receives the most complete coverage, is intercut with descriptions of and parallels with the [[Charles Manson|Manson Family]] murder of [[Sharon Tate]], Polanski's wife.&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt; The section on ''The Exorcist'' details extreme audience reactions to the film.&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt; Films which receive shorter coverage include ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983) and [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt;

==Criticism==
A review of the book in the film and popular culture journal ''Images'' judges that ''Hollywood Hex'' is most successful in the sections covering ''The Exorcist'' and ''Macbeth'' because of not, "exploiting the subject material but in maintaining distance."&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt; Brottman's objective approach to the material gives it an academic and neutral point of view which, in a subject which could easily be sensationalized, is remarked on approvingly in the review. The reviewer, David Ng, comments, "How easy it would have been to sensationalize this material, to cheapen it with tabloidish conjectures, to dilute it with pop psychology, or to kill it with over-analysis... It is a mature book that trusts its readers to extrapolate... freely."&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt;
''Images'' points out that other films covered by the book are not done in as complete a manner as are ''Macbeth'' and ''The Exorcist'', giving the book a somewhat disjointed quality. Ng comments, "The shorter essays... while always fascinating, seldom reach the subtle genius of the two centerpieces."&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt; Nevertheless, Brottman's academic approach to the subject is consistent throughout the book, according to Ng, who writes that she, "never short changes a movie because it was a bomb or a turkey. ''[[Poltergeist III]]'', for instance, is scrutinized with the same level of intelligence as ''The Exorcist''.&lt;ref name="Images"/&gt;

The ''Headpress Guide to the Counter Culture'' (2004) calls the book, "a fascinating account of murder and misadventure in Tinseltown," and an "unashamedly esoteric film book with a very entertaining premise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIzQpu1HeXsC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Hollywood+hex%22+brottman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QFCKu5yskj&amp;sig=XRPMdChi_saDiE51e5lbsBti7D0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result|last=Kerekes|first=David|editors=Drake Temple and David Kerekes|title=Headpress Guide to the Counter Culture: A Sourcebook for Modern Readers |year=2004|publisher=Headpress|location=Manchester|isbn=1-900486-35-0|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2017, the series was cancelled after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/matt-damon-ben-affleck-incorporated-canceled-syfy-1201997821/|title=Syfy Cancels Matt Damon-Ben Affleck Series 'Incorporated'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Oriana|last=Schwindt|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The series takes place in a [[dystopia]]n [[Milwaukee]] in the year 2074, where many countries have gone bankrupt due to a number of crises and [[climate change]]. In the absence of effective government, powerful multinational corporations have become ''de facto'' governments, controlling areas called Green Zones. The remaining territories are called Red Zones, where governance is weak or non-existent.

==Plot==

Ben Larson is a manager at Spiga Biotech, the largest corporation in the world. He works for Elizabeth, the estranged mother of his wife, Laura. In reality, he is a climate refugee from the Red Zone outside Milwaukee whose real name is Aaron. Aaron has infiltrated the Green Zone, assuming the identity of Ben Larson to search for his childhood love Elena, who through a series of unfortunate circumstances has become an executive club companion—a high-end, [[indenture]]d prostitute who works at a Spiga "executive club" called Arcadia. Arcadia is an exclusive [[brothel]] for senior Spiga executives. Aaron resolves to work his way up to a senior position in order to access Arcadia and rescue her. After framing his boss Chad for stealing classified information and ensuring his dismissal from the company, Aaron endeavours to obtain the promotion to the now-vacant position and rescue Elena, all while maintaining his Ben Larson cover in the face of increasingly paranoid Spiga security scrutiny and competitive coworkers. He is assisted by Theo, Elena's brother who is still living in the Red Zone, and Reed, another Red Zone denizen who managed to assume a Green Zone persona years before Aaron managed the same feat.

* [[Sean Teale]] as Ben Larson / Aaron Sloane
* [[Allison Miller]] as Laura Larson, a [[cosmetic surgeon]] and Ben's wife
* Eddie Ramos as Theo Marquez
* [[Julia Ormond]] as Elizabeth Krauss, Laura's mother and a high-ranking executive in SPIGA

[[File:Gallee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]: "''Forsachistu diobolae..''" (Forsake devils) and "''gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer''" (believe in god almighty father). Left caption in a later writing: "''Abrinuciatio diaboli lingua Teotisca veter''." = (abjuration of the devil in Old German). Under the Baptismal Vow in Latin an enumeration of the first 20 practices in the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum.]]

The '''''Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum''''' (''Small index of superstitions and paganism'') is a [[Latin]] collection of [[Capitulary|capitularies]] identifying and condemning superstitious and pagan beliefs found in the north of [[Gaul]]&lt;ref name=dierkens24&gt;Dierkens 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Saxon]]s during the time of their subjugation and conversion by [[Charlemagne]].

From the original manuscript only the cover remains, which lists thirty chapters. The manuscript is held in the [[Vatican Library]] in a collection (''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577) which probably originates from [[Fulda]] and thence traveled to [[Mainz]], arriving there in 1479. From Mainz it went to the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] in [[Heidelberg]], and arrived in Rome at the latest in 1623. Preceding the ''Indiculus'' is the so-called [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]. The text is edited in the ''Karlomanni Principis Capitulare'', published by the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].

==Date==
''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577 itself appears to have been copied ca. 800 in either Fulda or [[Mainz]]. Alain Dierkens argues, on the basis of word choice (the correspondence between the phrase ''superstitionem et paganiarum'' and the diction used by Boniface in his 742&lt;ref&gt;Tangl, letter 50, 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt; letter to [[Pope Zachary]]) and a comparison between the content of the ''Indiculus'' and the conclusions of the [[Concilium Germanicum]] (744), that the ''Indiculus'' was indeed appended to or pertained to the decisions made at the Concilium Germanicum and the two consequent Frankish synods at Estinnes and Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they were not the product of a late-seventh century scribe at Fulda, nor were the prohibitions aimed specifically or exclusively at the Saxons.&lt;ref name=dierkens24/&gt;

==Significance==
The index provides valuable insight into the religious culture of the pagan Saxons (from the Christian point of view) and into the daily practices of Christian missionaries working in that area. Since it is more or less contemporary with the activities of [[Saint Boniface]] in modern-day Germany, he has been called a "guiding influence" on its compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA173 Filotas 173.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alain Dierkens, the ''Indiculus'', which he thinks derives from the "entourage" of Boniface, evidences the ongoing practice of pre-Christian practices, including divination, the use of amulets, magic, and witchcraft, and suggests that the church allowed or transformed certain practices which it had been unable to extirpate.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infinite Ability''' is a special interest group on disability within the [[medical humanities|Medical Humanities]] Group of the [[University College of Medical Sciences]] ([[University of Delhi]]).

{{Jewish culture}}
'''Jewish languages''' are the various [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s that developed in [[Jew]]ish communities in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. The original Jewish language is [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], which was supplanted as the primary vernacular by [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] following the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]]. Jewish languages feature a syncretism of indigenous [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Judeo-Aramaic]] with the languages of the local non-Jewish population.

==Ancient history==
Early [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] (ENWS) materials are attested through the end of the [[Bronze Age]]—2350 to 1200&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="enws"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Waltke|O'Connor|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this early state, [[Biblical Hebrew]] was not highly differentiated from the other Northwest Semitic languages ([[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Amarna letters|Amarna Canaanite]]), though noticeable differentiation did occur during the Iron Age (1200–540&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="wo8-9"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Waltke|O'Connor|1990|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew as a separate language developed during the latter half of the [[2nd millennium BC|second millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE]] between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], an area known as [[Canaan]].&lt;ref name="s1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest distinctively Hebrew writing yet discovered was found at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]] and dates to the 10th century&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="eurekalert.org"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Feldman|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shanks|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israelite tribes established a kingdom in Canaan at the beginning of the first millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE, which later split into the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south after a dispute of succession.&lt;ref name="sthist"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Steiner|1997|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE, and the kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586&amp;nbsp;BCE, its higher classes exiled and the [[first Temple]] destroyed.&lt;ref name="sthist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s112" /&gt; Aramaic became the primary language of the Jews deported to Babylonia, with the first attestations of Jewish/Judean Aramaic found in [[Elephantine papyri|scrolls]] from  the 5th century BCE on the island of [[Elephantine]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; Later the Persians made Judah a province and permitted Jewish exiles to return and [[Second Temple|rebuild the Temple]].&lt;ref name="sthist" /&gt; Aramaic became the common language in the north of Israel, in [[Galilee]] and [[Samaria]], though Hebrew remained in use in Judah with Aramaic influence.&lt;ref name="s112"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander conquered Judah in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic domination.&lt;ref name="s112" /&gt; During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the [[Hasmonean]]s, but later the Romans ended their independence, making [[Herod the Great]] their governor.&lt;ref name="sthist" /&gt; One Jewish revolt against the Romans led to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70&amp;nbsp;CE, and the second [[Bar-Kochba revolt]] in 132–135 CE led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea.&lt;ref name="sthist" /&gt; Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|pp=166, 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew remained in widespread use among diasporic communities as the medium of writing and liturgy, forming a vast corpus of literature which includes rabbinic, medieval, and modern literature prior to the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], 2003. [https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781403917232 ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'']. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|9781403917232}} / {{ISBN|9781403938695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Jewish varieties of languages==
Jewish communities were dispersed around the world in the diaspora which followed the Jewish-Roman wars. Some adopted the languages of their neighbors, but many developed new varieties of these languages, collectively termed "Jewish languages".&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; Various reasons lead to the development of distinctive Jewish varieties of the languages of their surrounding non-Jewish neighbors. Jews have often had limited exposure to non-Jewish society for various reasons, including imposed [[ghettoization]] and strict [[endogamy]], and as a result Jewish languages diverged and developed separately from non-Jewish varieties in the territories they settled in. Due to frequent [[Expulsions of Jews|expulsions]] and migrations, single Jewish communities were often influenced by multiple distinct regional languages via [[language contact]]. For example, Yiddish, while based on [[High German]], has elements of [[Judeo-Latin|Romance]] and Slavic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/yiddish.html YIDDISH: History and Development]&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish languages belong to a variety of genealogical language families, but these languages have common characteristics making their study a distinct field of comparative linguistics known as [[Jewish linguistics]]. The common feature between the Jewish languages is the presence of a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Judeo-Aramaic]] lexical components stemming from the shared use of these languages in writing and liturgy. Many Jewish languages also display phonological, morphological, and syntactic features distinct from their non-Jewish counterparts. Most written Jewish languages are Hebraized, meaning they use a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet. These languages, unless they already have an accepted name (i.e. Yiddish), are prefixed with "Judeo" (ex [[Judeo-Spanish]], [[Judeo-Arabic]]).&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sG3sCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq= Handbook of Jewish Languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, secularism among Jews, and large population shifts prompted the beginning of a shift from Jewish to non-Jewish languages. Even so, the majority of Jews in Eurasia and Africa, and many immigrants in North America and Palestine, still spoke Jewish languages. However, the [[Holocaust]] brought about a significant drop in the use of Jewish languages, especially [[Yiddish]].

== Classification ==
Jewish languages are generally defined as the unique linguistic [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Jewish communities in the diaspora in their contact with surrounding non-Jewish languages.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; Languages vary in their [[Abstand and ausbau languages|distance and divergence]] from their non-Jewish sister languages.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; For example, [[Judeo-Yemeni Arabic]] is quite similar to some non-Jewish varieties of [[Yemeni Arabic]], while [[Yiddish]], a [[Germanic language]], shows a high degree of dissimilarity to modern German dialects. Due to continued liturgical and literary use of Hebrew and Aramaic, Jewish communities were naturally in a state of [[diglossia]].&lt;ref name=Chaim&gt;[http://www.adath-shalom.ca/rab_vi.pdf A Short History of the Hebrew Language: Hebrew in the Diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with their vernacular Jewish language, most Jews could read and write in Hebrew, which was necessary to fulfill the religious commandment to learn [[Torah]] and teach it. Jews were expected to also have knowledge of Judeo-Aramaic, the language of religious commentary (''targumim'') as well as many prayers, including the [[Kaddish]]. Hebrew, the "Holy Tongue", was the highest linguistic [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] in these communities, used for liturgy and study. Hebrew-Aramaic is the only [[Stratum (linguistics)#adstratum|adstratum]] shared by all Jewish languages.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; 
Some Jewish languages have multiple registers, for example, both Yiddish and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Judezmo]] have three [[Register (sociolinguistics)|linguistic register]]s: colloquial, written, and scholarly-liturgical.

Some Jewish languages show the effects of the history of language shift among the speakers, including Hebrew-Aramaic influence. Yiddish exemplifies such a language. Some Jewish languages may become marked as distinctively Jewish because some shift affected some parts of the language as a whole. For example, what is today known as [[Baghdad Jewish Arabic]] (because it is the [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic variety]] that was up until recently spoken by Baghdad's Jews) was originally the Arabic dialect of Baghdad itself and was used by all religious groups in Baghdad, but the Muslim residents of Baghdad later adopted Bedouin dialects of Arabic. Similarly, a dialect may be perceived as Jewish because its Jewish speakers brought the dialect of another region with them when they were displaced. In some cases this may cause a dialect to be perceived as "Jewish" in some regions but not in others.

Some Jewish language varieties may not be [[Dialect#Dialect or language|classified]] as [[language]]s due to [[mutual intelligibility]] with their parent language, as with [[Judeo-Malayalam]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Judeo-Spanish]]. In the case of Judeo-Spanish, also known as [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]], linguistically it is a dialect of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], mutually intelligible with other [[Spanish dialects and varieties]], albeit with [[influences on the Spanish language|each Spanish dialect having loanwords and influences]] from different source languages: [[Nahuatl]] and [[Maya language|Maya]] loanwords and influences for [[Mexican Spanish]]; [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in [[Peruvian Spanish]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], Quechua and  [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in [[Argentinian Spanish]]; [[Maghrebi Arabic]] and [[Berber language|Berber]] in "Ladino Occidental" (also known as [[Haketia]]); [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] in "Ladino Oriental".

In some cases, as with Ladino, a register may be developed for Biblical translation and exegesis in which Hebrew-Aramaic patterns are frequently [[calque]]d, though the number of true Hebrew and/or Aramaic loanwords may be low. Another possibility is that Jews may speak the same language as their non-Jewish neighbors, but occasionally insert Hebrew-Aramaic or other Jewish elements. This is a transitory state in the shift from use of a Jewish to a non-Jewish language, often made in the context of assimilation. This occurred, for example, with many educated German Jews who transitioned from Western Yiddish to German. This variety of German, used between 1760 and the end of the 19th century (the [[Haskala]]), was written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]], and contained a small number of Hebrew and Yiddish loans. An example is [[Moses Mendelsohn]]'s translation of the Hebrew Bible into German written with Hebrew letters.

==Status==
Among the most widely spoken Jewish languages to develop in the diaspora are [[Yiddish]], [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]], and the [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judæo-Arabic]] group of languages. [[Yiddish]] is the Judeo-German language developed by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who lived in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] before the [[Holocaust]]. [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]], also called ''Judezmo'' and ''Muestra Spanyol'', is the Judeo-Spanish language developed by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jews who lived in the [[Iberian peninsula]] before the [[Spanish inquisition]]. [[Judæo-Catalan|Judeo-Catalan]] (also called ''Catalanic'' or ''Qatalanit''), was the Jewish language spoken by the Jewish communities in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencia]], and the [[Balearic Islands]]. [[Shuadit|Judeo-Provençal]] (or ''Shuadit'') was the [[Occitan language]] as it was historically spoken by [[French Jews]] although it was not a distinct language, and was indistinguishable from the Occitan spoken by non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient and distinct Jewish languages, including [[Judaeo-Georgian]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]], [[Judeo-Berber language|Judeo-Berber]], [[Krymchak language|Krymchak]] and [[Judeo-Malayalam]] have largely fallen out of use due the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], the assimilation policies of Israel in its early days and other factors.

Yiddish was the language spoken by the largest number of Jews in the 1850s, but today the three most commonly spoken languages among Jews are English, modern Hebrew, and Russian—in that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bh.org.il/links/jewishlangs.asp |title=Jewish Languages |accessdate=2008-07-03 |publisher=[[Beth Hatefutsoth|Beth Hatefutsoth, The Nahum Goldmann Museum of the Jewish Diaspora]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085641/http://www.bh.org.il/Links/JewishLangs.asp |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yiddish, as well as several other Jewish languages, has contributed to the vocabulary of coterritorial non-Jewish languages, such as [[Yiddish words used in English|English]] or French&lt;ref&gt;For Yiddish loanwords in French, see P. Nahon, « Notes lexicologiques sur des interférences entre yidich et français moderne », Revue de linguistique romane 81, 2017, p. 139-155.&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Kol Israel]] (Israel's public service broadcaster) has long maintained daily short news and features programming in many Jewish languages and dialects. For domestic audiences it broadcast in Iraqi Jewish Arabic (Yahudi) on its Arabic network. While producing:  Yiddish, Ladino, Moroccan Jewish Arabic (Mughrabi or Marocayit), [[Bukhori dialect|Bukharian]] (Central Asian dialect) and [[Judeo-Tat]] for both to domestic and overseas shortwave audiences in relevant areas. In addition, for over two decades from the late 1970s a daily 30&amp;nbsp;minute shortwave transmission was made to Yemen in Yemenite Jewish Arabic.

[[Radio Exterior de España]], the Spanish International Public broadcaster, provides programming in Ladino, which they refer to as Sefardi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtve.es/programas/sefardi REE programs in Ladino]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States there are some local radio programs in Yiddish as there are also in [[Birobidzhan]] in Russia.

[[Judæo-Marathi]] ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: जुदाव मराठी) is a form of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] spoken by the [[Bene Israel]], a [[Jewish ethnic group]] that developed a unique identity in [[India]] and in [[Pakistan]]. Judæo-Marathi is, like other Marathi, written in the [[Devanagari]] script. It may not be sufficiently different from [[Marathi language|Marathi]] as to constitute a distinct language, although it is characterized by a number of [[loanword]]s from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as a result of influence from the [[Cochin Jews|Cochin Jew]]ish community, [[Judæo-Malayalam]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and also some influence from the [[Urdu]] language.

{{main article|Hebrew alphabet|}}
For centuries Jews worldwide spoke the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive [[dialect]]al forms or branching off as independent languages. The usual course of development for these languages was through the addition of Hebrew words and phrases used to express uniquely Jewish concepts and concerns. Often they were written in Hebrew letters, including the block letters used in Hebrew today and [[Rashi script]].

Conversely, Ladino, formerly written in Rashi script, since the 1920s is usually written in Turkey in the Latin alphabet with a spelling similar to [[Turkish alphabet|that of Turkish]], and has been occasionally printed in the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;''Verba Hispanica'' X: [http://hispanismo.cervantes.es/documentos/smidX.pdf Los problemas del estudio de la lengua sefardí] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407074136/http://hispanismo.cervantes.es/documentos/smidX.pdf |date=2008-04-07 }}, Katja Smid, Ljubljana, pages 113-124: ''Es interesante el hecho que en Bulgaria se imprimieron unas pocas publicaciones en alfabeto cirílico búlgaro y en Grecia en alfabeto griego. [...] Nezirović (1992: 128) anota que también en Bosnia se ha encontrado un documento en que la lengua sefardí está escrita en alfabeto cirilico''. The Nezirović reference is: Nezirović, M., ''Jevrejsko-Spanjolska knjitévnost''. Institut za knjifevnost, Svjeálost, Sarajevo, 1992. This inscription shows the influence of Spanish orthography: more correctly, in Ladino orthography it would have been written: "Es interesante el echo ke en Bulgaria se imprimieron unas pokas publikasiones en alfabeto siriliko bulgaro y en Gresia en alfabeto griego ...&lt;/ref&gt;
Soviet authorities tried to promote the Cyrillic alphabet for Yiddish in the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Also, some Yiddish-speakers have adopted the use of the Latin alphabet, in place of the Hebrew alphabet. This is predominantly to enable communications over the internet, without the need for special Hebrew keyboards.

The Hebrew alphabet has also been used to transcribe a number of languages including Arabic, English, French, Spanish,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} German, and Greek. While not common, such practice has occurred intermittently over the last two thousand years.

[[Judaeo-Marathi]] ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: जुदाव मराठी) is a form of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] spoken by the [[Bene Israel]], a [[Jewish ethnic group]] in [[India]] and in [[Pakistan]]. Judæo-Marathi is written in the [[Devanagari]] script.

'''Juan Roque''' was an African living in colonial [[Mexico City]]. He died in 1623, leaving behind one of very few wills and testaments of African residents of colonial Latin America.  His daughter Ana María, and the [[confraternity]] to which he belonged in the hospital of the ''Limpia Concepción'', also left behind documents describing a court battle which detail the final requests made by Juan Roque concerning a house “in the neighborhood of San Hipólito in the lane next to the College of San Juan where it meets the open air market of San Hipólito, bordering the houses of the marshals and those of Don Ángel de Villasaña.”&lt;ref name=McKnight89&gt;"Juan Roque's Donation," in Kathryn Joy McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'', (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africans in New Spain ==
Africans played a notable role in the [[Spanish Conquest]]. As the Spanish and Portuguese control in colonial Latin America spread, Africans were stereotyped as slaves. However, there were exceptions.  Africans and [[mulattos]] played active roles in the early 16th century, acting as [[conquistadors]].  Juan Garrido, Juan García, and Juan Valiente were all successful conquistadors, who became part of the Spanish communities as the conquest was completed.

By the 17th century, Africans lived in colonial Latin America, with distinctive organizations and communities that blended African culture with the laws and social expectations of the Spaniards.  In New Spain, Africans, who originated from modern day coastal [[Sierra Leone]], founded a brotherhood in Mexico City,&lt;ref&gt;Mario Austin Nesvig, ed., Local Religion in Colonial Mexico, (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 2006), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
which became the ''Zape'' Confraternity. Documents describe how Africans rose from slavery to become influential members of the community.

===The wealth and status of Juan Roque===
Brought to New Spain as a slave before 1600, Juan Roque left a comprehensive will and testament at his death. It reveals the importance of 'confraternities' to the African community in Mexico City, as well as the prominence some Africans were able to achieve. 

Written before his death in 1623, this last will and testament provided for a lavish and expensive funeral and lists profitable real estate that helped ensure the survival of the ''Zape'' Confraternity in Mexico City for several decades after his death.  Both expensive and Catholic, Juan Roque’s funeral provides evidence that Africans could establish themselves within communities in colonial Latin America.  He requested that he be buried either in the church of the Hospital of [[Our Lady of Immaculate Conception]] or the Santísma Veracruz Church of which he was a parishioner.  

In addition, Juan Roque asked that the brotherhoods to which he belonged, like the ''Zape'' Confraternity, accompany his body to the burial and that fifty-five Masses be sung for his soul at different churches around Mexico City, as well as twenty Masses sung for his deceased wife, Isabel de Herrera.&lt;ref name=McKnight87&gt;"Juan Roque's Donation," in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro-Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 87.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In her essay analyzing confraternities in New Spain, Nicole von Germeten points out that as a prominent and wealthy African in Mexico City, Juan Roque's lavish funeral “with all the trappings of baroque religiosity” and membership in a confraternity like that of the Zape nation demonstrates the respectability of men of African descent in colonial Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Austin Nesvig, ed., Local Religion in Colonial Mexico, (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 2006), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He stated that his deceased wife was a free black woman, and when bequeathing his profitable real estate in the neighborhood of San Hipólito, Juan Roque pointed to the status of his daughter, Ana María, as a legitimate daughter from his marriage “according to the Most Holy Church” to Isabel de Herrera and therefore a free black woman.&lt;ref name=McKnight89/&gt; Designating  these Africans as free, gave them status within the community and helped the ''Zape'' Confraternity, as it made its case to regain the income from houses around San Hipólito, following Ana María dying childless.

==Confraternities==
Before her death, Ana María spoke to members of the ''Zape'' Confraternity confirming that her father had wished the brotherhood to receive the income from the real estate in San Hipólito.&lt;ref name=McKnight87/&gt;

In colonial Latin America, confraternities were organizations that allowed Africans to achieve a sense of community after being taken from their homeland through the slave trade. These brotherhoods also facilitated the Africans’ conversion to Catholicism: by providing a place of worship, a Christian community, and financial support for members' funerals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haskett, “The Many Catholicisms of Colonial Mexico,” 216.&lt;/ref&gt;   The confraternities provided social welfare for Africans in New Spain and limited health care, when Africans were denied access to other assistance.

The importance of the confraternity’s ability to aid its members monetarily, is clearly evident In the court documents detailing the Zape Confraternity’s battle to receive the income of Juan Roque’s houses in San Hipólito. Juan Roque’s exact description of the location of the houses, in his last will and testament, attempted to ensure that his daughter. and eventually the confraternity, received the benefits of the properties.

===Ana Maria===
Several witnesses said that Ana María was adamant that her father wished the houses to go to the brotherhood, should she die without children.  Even when one of the elder members of the confraternity urged her to agree with her husband and sell the houses, Ana María refused, because her father “charged her that if she did not have children she should not dispose of the houses, but give them the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception (the ''Zape'' Confraternity), of which he was a member and founder, so that the blacks of the Zape nation would administer them and take care of their earnings.”&lt;ref&gt;“Juan Roque’s Donation,” in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro-Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korma''' is a dish originating in the [[Indian subcontinent]],&lt;ref name=times2773345&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/anjum_anand/article2773345.ece Amjum Anand (2007), ''My Chicken Korma'' (Times Online)]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt ([[dahi (curd)|dahi]]) or cream, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or glaze.&lt;ref name=singhp24/&gt;

==Etymology==
The English name is an anglicisation of [[Urdu]] {{lang|ur|{{nq|قورمہ}}}}, more accurately transliterated ''qormā'',&lt;ref name=mw&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/korma Korma], Merriam-Webster, accessed 30-01-18&lt;/ref&gt; and derived from a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] root.&lt;ref name=perry254&gt;Perry, C. "Korma, Kavurma, Ghormeh: A family, or not so much?" in Hosking (ed.) ''Food and Language: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cooking 2009'', p.&amp;nbsp;254&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''korma'' is derived from [[Urdu]] ''qormā'', ''ḳormā'' or ''ḳormah'', meaning "[[braising|braise]]", and refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.&lt;ref name=singhp24&gt;Singh, D. ''Indian Cookery'', Penguin, 1970, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25&lt;/ref&gt; All these words, and the names of dishes such as [[ghormeh sabzi|ghormeh]] ({{lang-fa|قورمه}}), the [[Azerbaijan]]i [[qovurma]] or ''kavarma''  are ultimately derived from a [[Turkish language]] word ''qawirma'' meaning "[a] fried thing".&lt;ref name=perry254&gt;Perry, C. "Korma, Kavurma, Ghormeh: A family, or not so much?" in Hosking (ed.) ''Food and Language: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cooking 2009'', p.&amp;nbsp;254&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish [[kavurma]] or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.&lt;ref name=perry256&gt;Perry (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;256&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Korma has its roots in the [[Mughlai cuisine]]&lt;ref name=times2773345/&gt; of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A characteristic [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal incursions into the region. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with ''[[vark]]'', said to have been served to [[Shah Jahan]] and his guests at the inauguration of the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref name=chapman26&gt;Chapman, ''India: Food and Cooking'', New Holland, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt;

Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt, cream or stock added. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on a mixture of spices, including ground [[coriander]] and [[cumin]], combined with yogurt kept below [[curdling]] temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with [[charcoal]] on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[Goat meat|goat meat,]] [[chicken]], [[beef]] or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables such as [[spinach]] and [[turnip]]. The term ''Shahi'' ({{lang-en|Royal}}), used for some kormas indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court.

==Preparation==
[[File:Chicken White Qorma (Korma).JPG|thumb|A chicken korma dish]]
The korma style is similar to all other [[braising]] techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly or seared using a high heat, traditionally using [[ghee]], and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.&lt;ref name=singhp24/&gt; The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called ''dum'' or ''[[dampokhtak]]''.&lt;ref name=singhp24/&gt;

The korma can make use of a technique called ''[[chaunk|bagar]]'': later in the cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated [[ghee]] and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising; the pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.&lt;ref name=singhp26&gt;Singh, p.&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wide variation between individual korma and other "curry" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. [[Cinnamomum tamala|Indian bay leaves]] or dried [[coconut]] may be added, the latter being a predominantly [[South Indian]] flavoring.

A korma ''pilau'' ([[pilaf]]) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.&lt;ref name=singh154&gt;Singh, p.&amp;nbsp;154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

===In the United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, a korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features [[almond]]s, [[cashew]]s or other nuts, and [[coconut]] or coconut milk. In the 21st century chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing [[chicken tikka masala]] in surveys of public eating habits.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/8813481/Korma-is-nations-favourite-curry-as-Brits-shun-spicy-tastes.html Korma is nation's favourite curry as Brits shun spicy tastes]", ''Daily Telegraph'', 07-10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmirror&gt;"[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/chicken-tikka-masala-no-longer-11304493.amp Chicken tikka masala no longer Britain's favourite curry – here's the new titleholder]", ''Daily Mirror'', 07-10-17 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Navratan korma===
[[File:Navratan Korma (Mughal Kitchen).JPG|thumb|Navratan korma (Mughal kitchen)]]
Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either [[paneer]] (an Indian cheese) or nuts – or sometimes both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianfood.about.com/od/vegetarianrecipes/r/navratankorma.htm |title=Navratan Korma – Nine-gem Curry |publisher=about.com |accessdate=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Navratan" means nine gems, and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables.

An '''[[organ stop]]''' can mean one of three things:

*the control on an [[organ (music)|organ]] console that selects a particular sound
*the row of [[organ pipe]]s used to create a particular sound, more appropriately known as a ''rank''
*the sound itself

Organ stops are sorted into four major types: [[principal pipe|principal]], [[string pipe|string]], [[reed pipe|reed]], and [[flute pipe|flute]].

This is a [[Help:Sorting|sortable]] list of names that may be found associated with [[Electronic organ|electronic]] and [[pipe organ]] stops. Countless stops have been designed over the centuries, and individual organs may have stops, or names of stops, used nowhere else. This non-comprehensive list deals mainly with names of stops found on numerous [[Baroque]], classical and romantic organs. Here are a few of the most common ones:

'''Marzanna''' (in Polish), '''Marena''' (in Russian), '''Morana''' (in Czech, Bulgarian, Slovene, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian),  or '''Morena''' (in Slovak and Macedonian), '''Maslenitsa''' (in Russia) and also '''Mara''' (in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]]), Maržena, Moréna, Mora or Marmora is a [[Slavic pantheon|Slavic goddess]] associated with seasonal rites based on the idea of death and rebirth of nature. She is an ancient goddess associated with winter's death and rebirth and dreams. In Slavic rites the death of the Goddess Marzanna at the end winter, becomes the rebirth of Spring of the Goddess Kostroma (Russian), Lada, Vesna representing the coming of Spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religia Słowian|publisher = Wydawn. WAM|date = 2003|location = Kraków|isbn = 8373182055|language = Polish|first = Andrzej|last = Szyjewski|trans-title = Religion of the Slavs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval Christian sources such as the Czech 9th century [[Mater Verborum]] compare her to the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess [[Hecate]], associating her with sorcery. 15th century [[Poland|Polish]] chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] likened her in his [[Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae|''Annales'']] to [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture (together with another Slavic goddess [[Dziewanna]]).

In modern times the rituals associated with Marzanna have lost their sacred character and are a pastime – an occasion to have fun and celebrate the beginning of spring. The tradition is usually celebrated around the [[Equinox|spring equinox]] (March 21){{fact|date=April 2016}}. Usually schoolchildren and young people participate in the celebrations alongside local folklore groups and other residents. A procession consisting of men, women and children carries handmade Marzanna (and often also ''Marzaniok'' dolls, the male counterpart to Marzanna) to the nearest river, lake or pond. The participants sing traditional songs and throw effigies of Marzanna into the water. Sometimes the effigies are first set on fire, or their clothes are torn. On the journey back to the village the focus falls on the copses, adorned with ribbons and blown egg shells. The procession, still singing, returns to the village. In some locations (e.g. in [[Brynica (disambiguation)|Brynica]] – a district of [[Miasteczko Śląskie]]), the beginning of spring is then celebrated with a feast.

== Names and etymology ==
Marzanna's name most likely comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] *mar-, *mor-, signifying [[death]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyklopedia mitologii ludów indoeuropejskich|publisher = Iskry|date = 2000|location = Warszawa|isbn = 8320716292|language = Polish|first = Andrzej M|last = Kempiński}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] form of the [[theonym]] – ''Ma(r)muriena'' – suggests that the goddess may have originally been connected to the Roman [[List of war deities|god of war]] [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (known under a variety of names, including ''Marmor'', ''Mamers'' and ''Mamurius Veturius'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The connection to Mars is supported by, among others, [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]], who underline that he was originally an agricultural [[deity]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]]'', ''[[Vladimir Toporov]]''. Indo-European Mythology. / В. В. Иванов, В. Н. Топоров. Индоевропейская мифология. Мифы народов мира, М:Российская энциклопедия, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories claim her name is derived from the same [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root as [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mors'' 'death' and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''mor'' 'pestilence'. Some authors also likened her to [[mare (folklore)|mare]], an evil spirit in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Slavic folklore|Slavic]] folklore, associated with [[nightmare]]s and [[sleep paralysis]]. In Belarusian, Polish, Ukrainian and in some Russian dialects the word '[[wikt:mara#Noun_17|mara]]' means dream. But Vladimir Dahl says it means 'phantom', 'vision', 'hallucination'.&lt;ref&gt;Мара (Mara) in ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language]]'' by [[Vladimir Dahl]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==

 [[Image:Vynášanie Marmurieny vyše kostola.jpg|thumb|Morena effigy, Slovakia]]
The tradition of burning or drowning an [[effigy]] of Marzanna to celebrate the end of winter is a folk custom that survives in the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia. In the past, the festival was held on the fourth Sunday of Lent. In the 20th century the date 21 March was fixed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polska|url=http://en.poland.gov.pl/Why,do,we,sink,Marzanna,Events,7072x3361.html|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (20–21 March). The rite involves preparing an effigy in female clothing, and either setting it on fire or drowning in a river (or both). This is often performed during a field trip by children in kindergarten and primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.folklornisdruzeni.cz/vynaseni-morany-v-dolni-lomne&lt;/ref&gt; The effigy, often made by the children themselves, can range in size from a puppet to a life-size dummy. This ritual represents the end of the dark days of winter, the victory over death, and the welcoming of the spring rebirth.

{{quote|''It concerns the "drowning of Marzanna," a large figure of a woman made from various rags and bits of clothing which is thrown into a river on the first day of the spring calendar. Along the way, she is dipped into every puddle and pond ... Very often she is burned along with herbs before being drowned and a twin custom is to decorate a pine tree with flowers and colored baubles to be carried through the village by the girls. There are of course many superstitions associated with the ceremony: you can't touch Marzanna once she's in the water, you can't look back at her, and if you fall on your way home you're in big trouble. One, or a combination of any of these can bring the usual dose of sickness and plague.''|Tom Galvin|"Drowning Your Sorrows in Spring", ''Warsaw Voice 13.544'', March 28, 1999}}

=== Drowning of Marzanna ===
Marzanna is also the name used to describe the effigy of the goddess, which was ritually burned or drowned during an early spring rite called [[Jare Święto]] in order to hasten the approach of spring. The custom of drowning the effigy of Marzanna derives from sacrificial rites; its function was to ensure a good harvest in the upcoming year. Following the principles of [[sympathetic magic]] – as described by [[James George Frazer|James Frazer]] – it was believed that burning an effigy representing the goddess of death would remove any results of her presence (i.e., the winter) and thus bring about the coming of spring.
[[File:Topienie Marzann w Brynicy.jpg|left|thumb|Marzanna dolls are thrown into the [[Brynica]]; [[Miasteczko Śląskie]], 2015]]
The effigy has usually been made of straw, wrapped in white cloth and adorned with ribbons and necklaces. Traditionally the effigy has initially been carried past every house in the village by a group of children holding green juniper twigs. During this [[procession]] Marzanna was repeatedly dipped in every encountered puddle or stream. In the evening the effigy passed to the young adults; the juniper twigs were lit, and thus illuminated Marzanna was carried out of the village, burned, and thrown into water. There is a number of superstitions related to the custom of drowning Marzanna: one cannot touch the effigy once it's in the water or one's hand will wither; looking back while returning home may cause an illness, while stumbling and falling may lead to a relative's death within the coming year.

The [[Catholic Church]] attempted to forbid this old Slavic custom. In 1420, the [[Synod of Poznań]] instructed the Polish clergy: ''Do not allow the superstitious Sunday custom, do not permit them to carry around the effigy they call Death and drown in puddles''. However, both the custom and tradition prevailed. At the turn of the [[18th century]] there has been an attempt to replace it (on the Wednesday preceding Easter) with a newly introduced custom of throwing an effigy symbolizing [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] down from a church tower. This attempt also failed. Today, the custom is celebrated at spring equinox on 21 March, which coincides with the traditional date of Jare Święto.

=== Marzanna and the copse ===
[[File:Topienie Marzanny w Miasteczku Śląskim - 21 marca 2015 06.jpg|thumb|In many parts of the Slavic world the procession to depart the village with a Marzanna effigy, returns home with bouquets of green twigs called ''gaik'' (literally: copse).]]
The rite of drowning Marzanna, often conducted together with carrying bouquets of green twigs and branches (dubbed ''gaik'' in Polish, literally "[[copse]]") was originally performed on the fourth Sunday of [[Lent]], called the [[White Sunday]]. The tradition of celebrating it on 21 March only began in the [[20th century]]. Most researchers agree that the custom of carrying the copse (also known as ''grove, new summer'', or ''walking with the Queen'') from house to house was earlier performed much later in the year, probably shortly after Easter.

==== The effigy of Marzanna ====
Details of the ritual vary from region to region. Typically the effigy or doll representing Marzanna is made of straw and dressed in traditional local costume, rags, or even bridesmaid's clothes. Marzanna may resemble a young woman wearing a [[garland]] as well as an old crone. Village dwellers carry the effigy away from the village, often singing event-related songs. [[Jerzy Pośpiech]] points out that at first only adults participated in the ritual; only when the custom became a fun game did the young join in.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Zwyczaje i obrzędy doroczne na Śląsku|publisher = Instytut Śląski w Opolu|date = 1987|location = Opole|language = Polish|first = Jerzy|last = Pośpiech|oclc = 20139666|pages = 156, 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on local tradition, the ritual that takes place after the procession reaches its chosen destination can be performed in various ways: sometimes the effigy is first torn into pieces, its clothes ripped off, and then drowned in a lake, river or even a puddle. In some variants of the ritual, the effigy is burned; in others, it is first set on fire and then thrown into water. A number of superstitions (also locally varied) are connected to the ritual, e.g.: the person who last returns to the village after the ritual is sure to die in the coming year. In some locations, a tradition functions in which Marzanna is given a male counterpart – Marzaniok.

==== Walking with the copse ====
Walking with the Copse is a ritual in which pine branches, twigs or even entire small trees ([[pine]] or [[spruce]]) – adorned with ribbons, handmade ornaments, [[Pisanka (Polish)|egg shells]] or flowers – are carried from house to house. In some variations of the ritual a doll is tied to the top branch; in others, a local girl accompanies the copse (hence "walking with the Queen"). The copse is usually carried by girls, who walk from house to house, dance, sing and extend best wishes to the hosts. Some sources relate that the group also collected donations. Today the ritual often takes the form of bringing a decorated copse to the village after the ritual of drowning Marzanna is completed. This type of a two-part ritual (destroying the effigy and then returning with the copse) had been observed in the [[Opole]] region, the western parts of [[Kraków Voivodeship|Kraków voivodeship]], [[Podhale]], [[Slovakia]], [[Moravia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Lusatia]] and Southern Germany ([[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Śla̜ska forma obrze̜du Marzanny i Gaika na tle porównawczym|publisher = Inst. Śla̜ski|date = 1964|location = Opole|language = Polish|first = Zofia|last = Staszczak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[19th century]] [[Oskar Kolberg]] noted that the copse had been carried around as a standalone custom (without the prior destruction of Marzanna) around Kraków and [[Sandomierz]], as well as in the regions of [[Mazovia]] (on [[Easter Week|Easter Tuesday]]) and [[Lesser Poland]] (beginning of May or the [[Green week|Green Week]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kieleckie|publisher = Polskie Towarzystwo Ludoznawcze|date = 1963|location = Wrocław|language = Polish|first = Oskar|last = Kolberg|orig-year = Photo-offset reproduction of Vols. 18-19 of the author's ''Lud, jego zwyczaje, sposób życia...'' originally published 1885-1886|oclc = 4885472|isbn = 8300000062|series = Dzieła wszystkie|trans-title = Region of Kielce|author-link = Oskar Kolberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditions related to Marzanna and the copse in Silesia ===
The date when the customs of drowning Marzanna and carrying the copse originated in [[Silesia]] is unknown. Although the [[Catholic Church]] considered these to be [[Paganism|pagan]] traditions, and persecuted them accordingly, the custom nevertheless survived in Silesia even at times when it had been almost extinct in other regions of Poland.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Niektóre zwyczaje ludowe na Śląsku i ich wykorzystanie w pracy zespołów artystycznych|publisher = GM PM|date = 1958|location = [S. l.]|language = Polish|first = Ludwik|last = Dubiel|oclc = 832512659|pages = 39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers point out that traditionally only women and girls would walk with a hand-made Marzanna; only later was the custom taken over by young adults and children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some regions – such as around [[Gliwice]] and [[Racibórz]] – local girls were followed by boys carrying Marzanna's male equivalent – Marzaniok.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ludowe tradycje: dziedzictwo kulturowe ludności rodzimej w granicach województwa śląskiego|publisher = Polskie Tow.

Songs, often improvised, were sung in front of each house, especially if a girl lived in it. Hosts would reward the singers with money or eggs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Afterwards, the singing procession left the village and went to a nearby body of water – a stream, pond, lake or even a puddle. If there was no lake or pond nearby, the effigy was burned; its clothes had been ripped off or it had been pelted with snow or mud.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The procession would usually return carrying a copse – a small spruce or pine tree adorned with eggs and ribbons. Nicknamed ''latko'' (summer), the copse symbolised the spring and blooming nature. The procession carried it into the village, accompanied by songs and best wishes.

== Significance ==
Today Marzanna is often perceived as a personification of winter and the symbolic drowning ends this season and returns life. In this interpretation, the copse is used to welcome spring and to affirm the re-awakening of nature. However, modern interpretations simplify the ritual: one example is merging two originally separate rituals and changing the time of the year at which they were celebrated. Moreover, even medieval chroniclers suggested that the custom had already evolved into a light-hearted, fun event and its original meaning had been almost forgotten.

Researchers emphasise that Marzanna functioned not merely as a symbol of winter, but also as a Slavic goddess. Marzanna's later association with death (in some regions Marzanna is called Death Crone) trivialized the importance of the goddess, who was the lady of not only death, but also life, and commanded the natural world.

Drowning Marzanna in water (an element of high importance in season-related folk celebrations) is understood as the goddess' symbolic descent into the underworld, to be reborn with next winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Leksykon - znaki świata: omen, przesąd, znaczenie|publisher = Wydawnictwa Naukowe PWN|date = 1998|location = Warszawa; Wrocław|isbn = 8301125616|language = Polish|first = Piotr|last = Kowalski|pages = 609–615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers underline the sacrificial character of this ritual and suggest that Marzanna is sacrificed in order to appease Winter. The authors of ''Wyrzeczysko'' propose that Marzanna is sacrificed to the demons of water, whose favour was necessary to ensure a plentiful harvest in the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wyrzeczysko: o świętowaniu w Polsce|publisher = Ludowa Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza|date = 1976|location = Warszawa|language = Polish|first = Tadeusz Maciej|last = Ciołek|first2 = Jacek|last2 = Olędzki|first3 = Anna|last3 = Zadrożyńska|trans-title = Wyrzeczysko: on celebrating in Poland|oclc = 3482291|pages = 151–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrating the Copse after Easter – in full spring –  performs an individual function in the cycle of rebirth: it announces the coming of spring, a time of joy and song, a time when the Earth bears new fruit.

{{Wikisource|Mrs Warren's Profession}}
'''''Mrs. Warren's Profession''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in 1893, and first performed in London in 1902. The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam ([[brothel]] proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It is a [[problem play]], offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw's 1882 novel ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'', about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities.

==Summary==

The story centres on the relationship between Mrs Kitty Warren and her daughter, Vivie. Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current [[brothel]] owner, is described as "on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old [[wikt:blackguard|blackguard]] of a woman." Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain.

==Plot==

Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with honours in Mathematics (equal Third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]]), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.

==Characters==

*'''Mrs. Kitty Warren''': An attractive, middle-aged businesswoman and former prostitute, made wealthy by running a string of brothels.
*'''Mr. Praed''': A friend of Mrs. Warren, middle-aged and attractive, a good man.
*'''Sir George Crofts''': Mrs. Warren's business partner. A middle-aged, stodgy, entitled member of the upper class.
*'''Reverend Samuel Gardner''': A local minister and (possibly) Vivie's biological father.
*'''Vivie Warren''': Mrs. Warren's daughter, recently graduated from university with honours.
*'''Frank Gardner''': Youthful son of Reverend Gardner.

==Origins==
Shaw said he wrote the play "to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but simply by underpaying, undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge companion to Victorian and Edwardian theatre |first=Kerry |last=Powell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICi7QY_VSA8C&amp;pg=PA229 |page=229 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-79536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explained the source of the play in a letter to the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' on 28 April 1898:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss [[Janet Achurch]] [an actress and friend of Shaw’s] mentioned to me a novel by some [[French people|French]] writer [''Yvette'' by [[Guy de Maupassant]]] as having a dramatisable story in it. It being hopeless to get me to read anything, she told me the story... In the following autumn I was the guest of a lady [Beatrice Webb] of very distinguished ability—one whose knowledge of English social types is as remarkable as her command of industrial and political questions. She suggested that I should put on the stage a real modern lady of the governing class—not the sort of thing that theatrical and critical authorities imagine such a lady to be. I did so; and the result was Miss Vivie Warren ... Mrs. Warren herself was my version of the heroine of the romance narrated by Miss Achurch. The tremendously effective scene—which a baby could write if its sight were normal—in which she justifies herself, is only a paraphrase of a scene in a novel of my own, ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'' (hence the title, ''Mrs Warren's Profession''), in which a prize-fighter shows how he was driven into the ring exactly as Mrs. Warren was driven on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Mrs. Warren's Profession Study Guide| work =| pages =25–26| publisher =Guthrie Theater| year =2003| url =http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-08-14| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071031110511/http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-31| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The play was originally banned by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s official theatre [[Censorship|censor]]) because of its frank discussion of [[prostitution]], but was finally performed on Sunday, 5 January 1902, at [[London]]'s New Lyric Club with the distinguished actor-manager [[Harley Granville-Barker]] as Frank, [[Fanny Brough]] as Mrs. Warren, George Goodhart as Sir George Crofts, Julius Knight as Praed, Madge McIntosh as Vivie and Cosmo Stuart as Rev. Samuel Gardner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3qaAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Mrs.+Warren's+Profession%22+1902+cast#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession: A Play in Four Acts|first=Bernard|last=Shaw|date=8 April 2018|publisher=A.

The first public performance in London took place in 1925.

A 1905 performance in [[New York City|New York]], this time on a public stage, was interrupted by the [[NYPD|police]], who arrested the cast and crew for violating New York City's version of the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold Daley Held for his Shaw Play |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 15, 1905 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96493562/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later held not to be in violation of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Court Approves Bernard Shaw's Play |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 7, 1906 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96637422/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been revived on Broadway five times since.

The play has been twice revived by the National Theatre, first in 1970-71 at the Old Vic, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Coral Browne and Sarah Badel, and more recently at the Lyttelton Theatre in 1985-86, directed by Anthony Page, with Joan Plowright and Jessica Turner as Mrs Warren and Vivie.

The [[Shaw Festival]] at [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario]] has mounted the play five times since the Festival's inception in 1962: 1976, 1990, 1997, 2008, and 2016 

In 2006, it was revived off-broadway by [[Irish Repertory Theatre|The Irish Repertory Theatre]], with [[Dana Ivey]] as Mrs. Warren, Laura Odeh as Vivie Warren, and [[David Staller]] as Mr. Praed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irishrep.org/show/2005-2006-season/mrs-warrens-profession/|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession - Irish Repertory Theatre|author=|date=|website=irishrep.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived in 2010 in three separate venues:

* London's West End, at the [[Comedy Theatre]] with [[Felicity Kendal]] in the title role
* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], by the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] at [[Sidney Harman Hall]], with [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in the title role
* [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] under the auspices of the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], with [[Cherry Jones]] as Kitty Warren and [[Sally Hawkins]] as Vivie

It was performed by the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] in 2012, and was so popular that the season was extended.

In 2016 the play was performed at the Center Theatre in Seattle.

In 2018, Eleanor Bishop's adaptation of the play was performed at the ASB Waterfront Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand by the Auckland Theatre Company.

==Sequel==
Sir [[Harry Johnston]] wrote a sequel, a novel entitled ''Mrs. Warren's Daughter'', circa 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15380|title=Mrs. Warren's Daughter: A Story of the Woman's Movement by Harry Johnston|author=|date=|website=gutenberg.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A 1960 German film adaption, ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession (film)|Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'', starred [[Lilli Palmer]].

BBC Television produced a television version first broadcast on 3 October, 1972 on [[BBC2]] under the 'Stage 2' drama strand.&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/fce706d308d34b28935c4c64df0c7666&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Cedric Messina]] and directed by [[Herbert Wise]], it starred [[Coral Browne]] in the title role, with [[Penelope Wilton]] as Vivie. Also in the cast were [[James Grout]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] and [[Derek Godfrey]]. Under the ''[[Play of the Month]]'' strand, the production was repeated on [[BBC1]] on 21 April, 1974&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/66c1ecd4a77a4700ace420bc4b92aad1&lt;/ref&gt;. The production was released on DVD in 2006.

A radio adaptation was broadcast on the [[BBC]] in 2002, and re-broadcast in January 2009 on [[BBC Radio 7]], starring [[Maggie Steed]] in the title role.

==Vivie's character and the changing role of women==

Men who could afford to get married in the Victorian era could make use of “laws that gave him total control of his wife's person—and her fortune”.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Dan H. "Victorians Unveiled: Some Thoughts on Mrs. Warren’s Profession". Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies 24 (2004): 40. Retrieved 2010-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian women were expected to maintain a poised and dignified manner, and to obey their husbands. Vivie defies the Victorian expectations of an obedient woman: she is educated and entirely self-sufficient. She rejects two marriage proposals, reflecting her reliance on her work ethic and hard-headed approach to life. Shaw represents Vivie as the product of a type of gender reformation: a character who is asexual and "permanently unromantic".&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Warren's Profession", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Twentieth Century and Beyond'' (eds. Joseph Black, et al.) Canada: Broadview, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the play, the boundary between sexual desires and proposed marriages is blurred. Frank flirts with both Mrs. Warren and Vivie; Mrs. Warren's companion Sir George Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie despite his relationship with her mother. Critic Petra Dierkes-Thrun argues that these examples illustrate the way in which Shaw "critiqued the ideological and economic system that produced her [Mrs. Warren], attacking the problematic double standard of [[male privilege]] and the deeply entrenched objectification of women, which Shaw saw pervading all levels of Victorian society down to its most basic nuclear element, the family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://z3950.muse.jhu.edu/journals/english_literature_in_transition/related/v049/49.3.dierkes-thrun.html Dierkes-Thrun, Petra].

The name New Philology was coined by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.''

Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology" ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest [[Mesoamerican]] Ethnohistory'', Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].  In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard.  The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation.  A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian [[Charles Gibson]], whose ''Aztecs under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&gt;'' Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and his earlier ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called [[Nahuas]]) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the [[Nahuatl language]]. His magnum opus was published in 1992, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries,'' James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.

An early and important text in this vein was ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years'' (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'', Frances Karttunen &amp; James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of ''Beyond the Codices'' (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Codices'' [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with [[Charles Dibble]] in publishing an English translation of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.

In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or ''altepetl'' of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. S.L. Cline and Miguel Leon-Portilla (Eds.) 1984. UCLA Latin American Center Nahuatl Studies Series, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town'', S.L. Cline, 1986. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Testaments of Culhuacan, Sarah Cline. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as ''The Book of Tributes'', as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Tributes: Early Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. S. L. Cline, 1993, Museo de Antropología e Historia, Archivo Histórico Collección Antigua, vol. 549. UCLA Latin American Center Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Tributes", Sarah Cline, ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos" (Col. Ant. Ms. 551) im Archivo Historico,'' Mexico. 2 vols. Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds. 1983. Hanover.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles.&lt;ref&gt;''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Indian Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca'', Robert Haskett, 1991, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Primordial Titles", Robert Haskett. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications &lt;ref&gt;''Chimalpahin and the Kingdoms of Chalco'', 1991, Susan Schroeder, Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Chimalpahin: Society and Politics in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Culhuacan, and other Nahua Altetpetl in Central Mexico.'' Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuantzin, Arthur J.O. Anderson, Susan Schroeder, Wayne Ruwet. 1997. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Quahtlehuantzin''James Lockhart, Susan Schroeder, and Doris Namala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Annals of Chimalpahin", Susan Schroeder. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;''Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico.'' Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan", Rebecca Horn. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.

Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly [[Matthew Restall]] and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation "The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.'' Matthew Restall, 1995. Lancaster CA: Labyrinthos&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850''. Matthew Restall. 1997, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sources for the Ethnohistory and Afrohistory of Postconquest Yucatan," Matthew Restall.''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled ''Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca'' was followed by his 2001 monograph ''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Terraciano,''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Nudzahui History, sixteen through eighteenth centuries''. 2001, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used "Aztec" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than "Nahua", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Lauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their "central premise [as] the idea that [[codex]] is not merely a neutral container for its texts." She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of "textual cultures" "posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Lambert Jennings, "Tracing Voices: Song as Literature in Late Medieval Italy" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Pennsylvania, 2012), p. 42, online at [https://usc.academia.edu/LaurenJennings/Books/1591293/Tracing_Voices_Song_as_Literature_in_Late_Medieval_Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garuda Pancasila Poster (color).jpg|thumb|280px|A depiction of the [[National emblem of Indonesia|Garuda Pancasila]] on a c. 1987 poster; each tenet of the Pancasila is written beside its symbol.]] 
'''Pancasila''' ({{IPA-id|pantʃaˈsila|langid}}) is the official, foundational [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory of the [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/pancasila-plan-to-affect-foreigners/ |title=Pancasila Plan to Affect Foreigners |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |date= |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pancasila comprises two [[Old Javanese]] words originally derived from [[Sanskrit]]: "''pañca''" ("five") and "''sīla''" ("principles"). Thus it is composed of five principles and contends that they are inseparable and interrelated:

# Belief in the One and Only God &lt;br&gt;(in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] "''Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa''"),
# A just and civilized humanity &lt;br&gt;(in Indonesian "''Kemanusiaan Yang Adil dan Beradab''"),
# A unified Indonesia &lt;br&gt;(in Indonesian "''Persatuan Indonesia''"),
# [[Democracy]], led by the wisdom of the representatives of the People &lt;br&gt;(in Indonesian "''Kerakyatan Yang Dipimpin oleh Hikmat Kebijaksanaan, Dalam Permusyawaratan Perwakilan''")
# [[Social justice]] for all [[Indonesians]] &lt;br&gt;(in Indonesian "''Keadilan Sosial bagi seluruh Rakyat Indonesia''").

==History==
===First iteration of Sukarno===
[[File:20 tahun kemerdekaan RI.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Five Pancasila symbols on Indonesian stamps (1965)]]
Desirous of uniting the diverse archipelago of [[Indonesia]] into one state in 1945, the future President [[Sukarno]] promulgated Pancasila as the foundational philosophical theory of the new Indonesian state (in Indonesian "Dasar Negara"). His political philosophy was fundamentally an amalgamation of elements of [[monotheism]], [[nationalism]], and [[socialism]]. Sukarno consistently stated that Pancasila was a philosophy of Indonesian indigenous origin that he developed under the inspiration of Indonesian historical philosophical traditions, including indigenous Indonesian, Indian Hindu, Western Christian, and Arab Islamic traditions. "Ketuhanan" to him was originally indigenous, while "Kemanusiaan" was derived from the Hindu concept of [[Tat Tvam Asi]], the Islamic concept of "fardhukifayah", and the Christian concept of neighborly love. Sukarno further explained that "Keadilan sosial", i.e. [[social justice]], was derived from the Javanese concept of "Ratu Adil", i.e., the Just Leader, being a messianic Javanese ruler who would liberate that people from all kinds of oppression. Pancasila was intended to resolve contrasting [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[Muslim]], [[nationalist]], and [[Christian]] priorities.

The iteration of Pancasila that Sukarno presented on 1 June 1945 to the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (''Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan'' (BPUPK)) &lt;ref&gt;

===Second iteration of the Founding Fathers===
Sukarno gave the first iteration of the Pancasila in his speech of 1 June 1945 to the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schindehütte|first1=Matti Justus|title=Zivilreligion als Verantwortung der Gesellschaft. Religion als politischer Faktor in der Entwicklung der Pancasila Indonesiens|publisher=Université|isbn=|page=151|url=http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2006/2915/|accessdate=30 October 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and omitted the word "Indonesia".&lt;ref name="SAAFROEDIN6384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KUSUMA1 "&gt;Kusuma (2004), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee of Nine (''Panitia Sembilan''), composed of Sukarno, [[Mohammad Hatta]], [[Mohammad Yamin]], [[Alexander Andries Maramis]], Ahmad Subardjo, Ki Hadikusumo, Wachid Hasyim, [[Agus Salim]], and Abikusno, formulated the second iteration of the Pancasila for the [[Jakarta Charter]] and the Preamble of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] of 1945&lt;ref&gt;Saafrudin Bahar et al., 1995 and Kusuma, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; by reordering their original enumeration by Sukarno thus: the fifth ''sila'' of [[monotheism]] and [[religiosity]] was promoted as the first ''sila''; the second  ''sila'' remained, the original first ''sila'' was re-numbered as the third ''sila'', and the original third and fourth ''sila'' were re-numbered as the fourth and fifth ''sila''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Sukarno accepted this proposition of the other members. Further, the first ''sila'' of the [[Jakarta Charter]] and the Preamble of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] of 1945, being the first of the original ''sila'' of Sukarno, was amended to read ''"Ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariah Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya"'' ("Belief in Almighty God with the obligation for its Muslim adherents to carry out the Islamic law/Syari'ah"). On 18 August 1945 the BPUPK amended it further by deleting "with the obligation for its Muslim adherents to carry out the Islamic law/Syari'ah" and therefore left the first ''sila'' as simply "Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa".&lt;ref name="SAAFROEDIN301"&gt;Saafroedin Bahar et al. (1995), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Indonesia]] of 1945 defined the Pancasila as the fundamental principles of the independent Indonesian state.&lt;ref name="SAAFROEDIN6384"&gt;Saafroedin Bahar et al. (1995), pp. 63–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KUSUMA150166 "&gt;Kusuma (2004), pp. 150–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation by the New Order administration===
{{quote|Pancasila democracy endeavors to strike a balance between the interests of the individual and those of society. It seeks to prevent the oppression of the weak by the strong, whether by economic or political means. Therefore, we hold that Pancasila is a socio-religious society. Briefly its major characteristics are its rejection of poverty, backwardness, conflicts, exploitation, capitalism, feudalism, dictatorship, colonialism[,] and imperialism. This is the policy I have chosen with confidence.|Suharto&lt;ref&gt;Suharto to G. Dwipayana and Ramadhan K. H., in ''Soeharto: My Thoughts, Words[,] and Deeds: An Autobiography'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] administration of [[Suharto]], the second President of Indonesia, strongly supported Pancasila. His government promoted the five principles as a key national ideology.  They were outlined as representing the ancient wisdom of the Indonesian people, pre-dating the introduction of foreign religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]]. In a July 1982 speech which reflected his attachment to [[Javanese beliefs]], [[Suharto]] glorified Pancasila as a key to reach the perfect life ("ilmu kasampurnaning hurip") of harmony with God and fellow men.&lt;ref name="epress.anu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Ward, 'Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila', Ch 2 in |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |title=Soeharto’s New Order and Its Legacy: Essays in Honour of Harold Crouch |publisher= edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &amp;#124; ANUE PressEpress.anu.edu.au |date= |quote=([[Harold Crouch]])|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially being careful not to offend the sensitivities of Muslim scholars who feared that the Pancasila might develop into a quasi religious cult, [[Suharto]] secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 (Tap MPR No. 11/1983) that obligated all organizations in [[Indonesia]] to adhere to Pancasila. He also instituted a mandatory program to indoctrinate all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers, in the Pancasila, which program was denominated "Penataran P4". In practice, however, the administration of Suharto exploited the vagueness of the Pancasila to justify its acts and to condemn opponents as "anti-Pancasila".&lt;ref name="epress.anu.edu.au"/&gt;

===Political Islam under Suharto ===
Under Suharto [[Islamism|political Islam]]ists were suppressed, and religious Muslims were carefully watched by the Indonesian government. Several [[Christianity|Christian]] Generals who served under Suharto like [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani|L.B. Moerdani]] actively persecuted religious Muslims in the Indonesian military.  Their approach, described as being "anti-Islamic", allegedly involved denying religious Muslims promotions, preventing them from praying in barracks, and banning them from even using the Islamic greeting "assalamu'alaikum".  These anti-Islamic policies were said to be supported by Suharto, despite Suharto being a Muslim himself, since he considered political Islam as a threat to his power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/rinvol3no1/east_timor.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian General Theo Syafei, who also served under Suharto, spoke out against political Islam coming to power in Indonesia, and insulted the Qur'an and Islam in remarks described as Islamophobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015415/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505023724/http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505002903/http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The formulation of Pancasila took place in the mid-20th century near the end of the [[Second World War]]. Thus, the ideology reflects the socio-political condition of the late colonial period in Indonesia and the ensuing great war. Its concept derived and synthesized from the ideas and ideals of Indonesia's founding fathers, most prominently Sukarno's. The historical period that influenced Indonesia's founding fathers, was the socio-political conditions of [[Dutch East Indies]] in the early 20th century all the way to the outbreak of the Second World War. 

By the first half of 20th century, some ideologies had been established or made their way into Dutch East Indies includes; [[imperialism]] and its antithesis [[anti-colonial nationalism]], traditional Javanese statecraft, [[Islamism]], [[democracy]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. Proponents of these ideologies had formed political organization or party to forward their cause. Islamist [[Sarekat Islam]] was established in 1905 followed by [[Masyumi]] in 1943. [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communist Party]] was established in 1914, while Sukarno's nationalist [[Indonesian National Party]] was established in 1927. Favouring one ideology over another would not satisfy the whole components of Indonesian people, thus it was decided that the new republic need to compose a new ideology derived from indigenous Indonesian values as well as common shared values derived from various ideologies.&lt;ref name="Kompasiana-Prasandi"&gt;{{cite web | title = Keunggulan Ideologi Pancasila | date = 25 September 2014 | author = Nanda Prasandi | work = Kompasiana | url = http://www.kompasiana.com/nandaudin/keunggulan-ideologi-pancasila_54f97581a3331191658b4689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism and inclusiveness===
Indonesia is a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation, a diverse country composed of numbers of ethnic groups with different languages, culture, religions and way of life. The founding fathers had decided that the state ideology should encompass and shelter the whole spectrum of Indonesian society, in which consensus for common good must be strived to achieve and justice is served and satisfied. As the result, Pancasila is often viewed {{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a form of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and [[Moderate|moderation]], a potpourri of different ideologies, ranging from the socialist, nationalist to religiosity. 

Some compromises were made during the formation of Pancasila to satisfy elements of Indonesian society. For example, despite its overwhelming [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim population]], Indonesia did not adopt [[Islamist|political Islam]] nor proclaim [[Islam]] as its official religion. Other than Islam, Indonesia also recognizes several world religions: 

* [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christianity]] (Catholicism and Protestantism) 
* [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hinduism]] (which also serves as an umbrella for various animist traditions)
* [[Buddhism]]
* [[Confucianism]] (added early in the 21st century), and

The adoption of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] instead of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as the national language had practical value as a [[lingua franca]] and reduced concerns about favoring the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Invention of ‘Lingua Franca’, Language and Indonesian Nationalist Movement | date = May 11, 2012 | work = Bahasa Kita | url = http://www.bahasakita.com/the-invention-of-lingua-franca-language-and-indonesian-nationalist-movement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancasila was influenced and copied some aspects of world's values and ideologies, including [[nationalism]], [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]], [[representative democracy|democracy]], [[socialism]] and [[religiosity]].&lt;ref name="Kompasiana-Prasandi"/&gt; The need to unify this diverse country also has led to the formulation of the national motto, [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]], which can be translated as [[unity in diversity]]. It declares the essential unity of its members despite ethnic, regional, social or religious differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bhineka Tunggal Ika | date = January 29, 2011 | work = Bahasa Kita | url = http://www.bahasakita.com/bhineka-tunggal-ika/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderation and tolerance===
In 1945, during the formation of Pancasila, there was much debate between nationalists who called for a pluralistic state and Islamists who wanted a religious state ruled by Islamic law or [[sharia]]. The nation's founders chose religious tolerance.&lt;ref name="Bajoria"&gt;{{cite news | title =  Indonesia's view of tolerance is a blueprint for others | author = Jayshree Bajoria | date = 7 July 2011 | work = The National | url = http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/indonesias-view-of-tolerance-is-a-blueprint-for-others}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pancasila encourage its proponent to practice [[moderation]] and [[toleration]], thus [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] and [[extremism]] are discouraged. In order to live harmoniously in a plural society, one's membership to a religious, ethnic or social group does not mean that they could dominate, discriminate or be prejudiced in their relations with other groups.&lt;ref name="Bajoria"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) has criticized the first ''sila'' because it does not define a right to [[atheism]], i.e., a rejection of theistic belief, and enables a culture of repression against [[Atheism in Indonesia|atheists]]. The IHEU argued that as long as Indonesian law only recognized the religions of [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], persons who did not identify with any of them, including atheists, would "continue to experience official discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/pancasila-blasted-for-repression-of-atheists/|title=Pancasila Blasted for Repression of Atheists|date=11 December 2012|work=The Jakarta Globe|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar to the controversy surrounding the United States [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]'s wording, the sila has been employed as a tool to repress against people falling outside of the government's classification system. Additionally, [[LGBT people]] are also routinely attacked under the guise of enforcing it in the courts and in other public spheres by organizations of all positions on the political spectrum and even by (at the time) a sitting Supreme Court justice, Patrialis Akbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/en/national-politics/13/07/04/mpd87d-muslim-organization-samesex-marriage-is-contrary-to-religion-and-pancasila|title=Muslim organization: Same-sex marriage is contrary to religion and Pancasila {{!}} Republika Online|work=Republika Online|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''papal slippers''' are a historical accoutrement worn by the [[Pope]]. The papal slippers were a form of [[episcopal sandals]] worn by [[bishop]]s. However, unlike the (rarely seen) episcopal sandals, which change with the [[liturgical colour]], the papal slippers were always [[red]].

Usually elaborate, papal slippers were made by hand with red [[satin]], red [[silk]], and gold [[yarn|thread]]; they featured an embroidered [[cross]] garnished with [[ruby|rubies]] and the soles were made of [[leather]]. Until the first half of the 20th century, it was customary for pilgrims having an audience with the Pope to kneel and kiss one of his slippers.

The pope traditionally wore the slippers inside the papal residence, while red leather [[papal shoes]] were worn outdoors. [[Pope Paul VI]] discontinued the use of the papal slippers but continued to wear the red outdoor [[papal shoes]], which were abandoned by [[Pope John Paul II]] in favour of [[Cordovan (color)|cordovan]] brown leather walking shoes made in his native [[Poland]]. 

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] restored the use of the red outdoor [[papal shoes]], similar to those worn by Paul VI. However, it would seem that the papal slippers have not been restored as photographs of Benedict show him wearing red shoes inside the confines of the Vatican. The Pope was reported to have been wearing red slippers upon his arrival in Scotland on 16 September 2010.

[[Pope Francis]] has since, once again, discontinued the use of the shoe. He wears simple black shoes.

'''Pasma''' (from Spanish ''espasmo'') refers to a "[[folk illness]]" unique to the [[Filipino culture]] that is said to be most commonly brought about by exposure of "cold" and water in many forms: water is believed to facilitate the unhealthy coldness that enters the body in the Filipino culture. There are distinct signs, symptoms, perceived causes and treatments which are recognized in the [[folk medicine]] of the Philippines, but these are not described in medical textbooks, discussed in medical schools, or generally recognized by contemporary medical science. Although, these symptoms have been perceived and testified as verifiable by Filipinos who have experienced sickness after a long hard day of work and abruptly taking a cold shower. &lt;ref name="jocano"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jocano |first=F.

[[University of the Philippines]] anthropologist [[Michael Tan]] points out:&lt;ref name="tan1"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been lecturing in several medical schools for several years now and I keep urging health professionals to be more inquisitive about these illnesses because even if these are not recognized by mainstream medicine, the ailments are very real as far as people are concerned, causing suffering and may even be cited as the cause of death, as in the case of "[[bangungot]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alongside numerous diseases recognized by Filipino folk medicine, pasma is attributed to an interaction of "init" (heat) and "lamig" (cold).&lt;ref name="deleon"/&gt; Under certain conditions, the body's muscles (kalamnan) are said to be "hot" and should not be too quickly brought into contact with "cold," in this case usually meaning cold water or air conditioner.&lt;ref name="jocano"/&gt;

==Symptoms and causes==
The most common symptoms of pasma are hand tremors, sweaty palms, numbness and pains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palis | first1 = F. | last2 = Flor | first2 = R. | last3 = Warburton | first3 = H. | last4 = Hossain | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Our farmers at risk: behavior and belief system in pesticide safety | url = | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 43–48 | doi = 10.1093/pubmed/fdi066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pasma" is thus very different from the Spanish term from which it takes its root: ''espasmo'', which means "spasm."

Aside from the traditional cause of "init" and "lamig," which is a traditional concept sufficiently intact in the contemporary Philippine psyche to be accepted, alone as a cause for pasma, some correlation has been noted with diseases already recognized by contemporary medicine. For example, symptoms of pasma are similar to those found in people with diabetes mellitus
and thyroid dysfunction. It has also been suggested that the complaints are often neurological in nature and may be linked to some kind of nervous dysfunction.There are several ways that a person is believed to be able to prevent Pasma. These include avoiding tiresome, repetitive movements of the upper extremities, showering and bathing in the morning, and avoiding washing clothes after ironing. Folkloric treatments for Pasma include massages using ginger, coconut oil, alcohol, garlic, and camphor oil. Soaking in lukewarm salted water or rice water is believed to cure Pasma, as well is Pasmang-bituka, a daily salted decoction of solasi (Holy basil).

A '''poupou''' is a wall panel located underneath the veranda of a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[wharenui]] (meeting house).{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=22–23}} It is generally built to represent the spiritual connection between the [[iwi|tribe]] and their ancestors and thus each poupou is carved with emblems of the tohunga [[whakairo]]’s (carver's) particular lineage.{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=22–23}} The poupou may also be decorated with representations of the tribe's ancestral history, legends and migration stories to [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marae - Māori meeting grounds|url=http://www.newzealand.com/ca/feature/marae-maori-meeting-grounds|website=Pure New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such each wharenui, and by extension the poupou, are thus treated with the utmost respect, as if it were an ancestor.

== Tohunga whakairo (carver) ==

For Māori the ability to carve wooden crafts is both a spiritual and intellectual endeavour.{{sfn|Mead|1961|p=11}}

The tohunga whakairo had to be well versed in his tribal lineage and history to carve something that was commemorative of his ancestors.{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=11f}} At the same time particularly amongst the traditionalists, he had to be cognizant of the proper protocols.{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=11f}} For example, in traditional times, the tohunga whakairo never blew the shavings of his work or the ancestors would curse the piece.{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=11f}} In other instances, if he allowed women or food near his work the [[mana]] (spiritual power) would be destroyed.{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=11f}}

In the contemporary period Māori carvers have struggled to maintain the same traditional protocol in a state that has become increasingly Westernised. As a result, today, many Māori have made an attempt to resurge traditional patterns and carvings within mainstream art through programs like the [[New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute|Māori Arts and Crafts Institute]].{{sfn|Metge|2004|p=274}} They have made it their mission to preserve traditional toi whakairo, and have opened various programs and classes to pass their traditions to younger generations.{{sfn|Metge|2004|p=274}}

== Styles ==

According to Sidney Mead’s ''The Art of Carving'', there are three classical styles typically used in Māori carvings:{{sfn|Mead|1961|pp=11f}}

== The poupou at the Royal Ontario Museum ==

The poupou at the Royal Ontario Museum was made in the nineteenth century. It was built in the style of the Te Ati Awa people of the North Island of New Zealand. It has a dark brown complexion rather than the traditional black, white and red pigments.

It is currently being displayed in the Oceania exhibit on the third floor of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. It is housed amongst various other Polynesian, Micronesian, and Australian indigenous artifacts like [[Tapa cloth|tapa]] or siapo cloths and Polynesian weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=[[Royal Ontario Museum]] |title=Shreyas and Mina Ajmera Gallery of Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific opens April 5, 2008 |url= http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/shreyas-and-mina-ajmera-gallery-of-africa-the-americas-and-asia |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyebaek''' is a [[Marriage in South Korea|Korean wedding]] custom that is traditionally held a few days after the official ceremony, with only family members present.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The ceremony begins with the older couple seated on cushions behind a table in front of a painted screen, with the newlyweds opposite them. The newlyweds perform a deep bow which begins standing and ends with the newlyweds pressing their foreheads to their hands while kneeling on the floor. The [[bride]] may present the [[Bridegroom|groom]]'s parents with [[Jujube|jujubes (Korean dates)]] and [[chestnut]]s, which symbolize [[child]]ren. A variation will have the newlyweds offering cups of wine, usually [[cheongju]]. The bride offers the cup to the father, and the groom offers the cup to the mother. Sometimes the parents will then also offer the newlyweds cups of [[cheongju (beverage)|cheongju]] or ''[[soju]]''. The older couple then shares some wisdom on marriage from their advanced experience. Finally they will throw the jujubes and chestnuts back at the bride, who has to try catching them with her wedding skirt.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the [[United States]], this ritual is held a few days before the ceremony. The bride may also receive gifts of money in white envelopes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Modern Korean weddings have incorporated the Pyebaek ceremony after the reception. The original Pyebaek was exclusively for the groom's side of the family to be introduced to the new family member, the bride. In current day Korean weddings, they have also allowed for the Pyebaek ceremony to be with the brides side of the family also.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Commercial services exist to assist those unfamiliar with how the ceremony is performed.

== The Bachelor ==
It is said in ancient Korean customs that one must have a bachelor party in every month leading up to the wedding day, with each month's gathering successively greater than the last for fortune, health, and wisdom will be brought to those who attend, their families, to the bachelor, and lifelong youthfulness and beauty to the lovely bride.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Reverse Acculturation ==
YoungHee Kim and Sung-Yeon Park, professors at [[Bowling Green State University]], view the resurgence of this traditional wedding practice as an example of reverse [[acculturation]] and cultural [[Racial integration|integration]] in which individuals both adapt to a new culture while maintaining a connection to the native culture.  By adding the Pyebaek ceremony to their wedding festivities, [[Korean-Americans]], whether they are marrying another individual of [[Koreans|Korean]] heritage or not, have begun to introduce their heritage culture into the mainstream culture of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="PyeBaek Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Younghee|last2=Park|first2=Sung-Yeon|title=Reverse Acculturation: A New Cultural Phenomenon Examined Through an Emerging Wedding Practice of Korean Americans in the United States|journal=Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal|date=March 2009|volume=37|issue=3|pages=359–375|doi=10.1177/1077727X08330758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In the prologue, several senior officers of the ''Intrepid'', flagship of the Universal Union, lament the unusually high number of casualties of [[Redshirt (character)|low-ranking crew members]] during recent away missions and conclude that they will need more crewmen to replace them.

Docking at a spaceport, the ''Intrepid'' takes on five new [[Ensign (rank)|ensigns]] including Andrew Dahl, an expert in alien religions and [[Astrobiology|xenobiology]]; Dahl quickly discerns that the crew is extremely phobic of being near the senior officers and of going on away missions due to their unusually high fatality rate. Over the course of several away missions, various crew members suggest that the deaths are due to [[Military incompetence|incompetence]], [[superstition]], or [[Destiny|cosmic forces]], requiring [[Sacrifice|“sacrifices”]] of some crew members so that others will survive.

After several [[Near miss (safety)|close calls]], Dahl meets Jenkins, a crew member who offers a different theory: their reality and timeline are under periodic influence of a badly written television show from the past. As the writers create the plot, characters' free will temporarily ceases in order to progress [[Plot (narrative)|“the Narrative”]] of the show. This is why otherwise good officers occasionally seem incompetent, Ensigns make poor decisions, and the ship has mysterious technology on board to produce last-minute inventions and medicines which would otherwise be [[Deus ex machina|impossible to produce]]. Jenkins explains that with Dahl and the other Ensigns' otherwise [[Bit part|routine duties]], their colorful histories will inevitably make them targets of "the narrative" when the writers need [[Supporting actor|"glorified extras"]] to kill for emotional impact.

The Ensigns kidnap a senior officer and proceed to travel to the past with the mission of convincing them to stop the show. Once there, they meet their actor doubles and realize that they are exact parallels, down to their scars and skin blemishes. Even their imagined [[Backstory|backstories]] became integral events of the Ensigns’ lives. Using this to their advantage, Dahl strikes a deal with the show’s producer and head writer, who happens to be Jenkins’ double, to save the life of the producer's [[coma]]tose son by switching him with his crew member [[doppelgänger]]. Because the producer’s son appeared on the show as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]], one of the crew members is effectively his identical twin, and will revert to the young man’s personality by staying in the past. Conversely, Dahl reasons that bringing the comatose son into the future will allow them to use "the Narrative" to their advantage, letting the advanced technology and reality-altering properties of the writing revive him.

Dahl and the Ensigns return to the future and live out the new revised plot created by the head writer, which includes saving the “injured crewman” they had on board. While saving the ship, Dahl sacrifices himself to save a senior officer for the sake of the narrative. Awakening later, Dahl receives a message from the writers and producers explaining his recovery, and they promise to make the lives of the crew meaningful instead of using death as a quick plot device. Dahl then compares the close calls he has had with those of the TV show's protagonists, and deduces that there is another narrative protecting him, which means that he is actually the protagonist of another story. 

The novel features three epilogues. In the first one the head writer deals with [[writer's block]] as a consequence of his bad writing choices. In the second one the producer’s son, having reverted to his personality from the crewman who switched with him, determines to do something useful with the second chance at life he's been given. In the third one an actress, who once played an extra on the show, receives a message showing intimate details of the woman whose life—and death—she helped create. She memorializes her lost “sister” on a beach and meets the head writer of the show, with both realizing that their characters on the show were married.

== Characters ==
New Recruits on the ''Intrepid'':
* Ensign Andrew Dahl, the hero of the novel. 
* Ensign Maia Duvall, Kerensky's love interest.
* Ensign Jimmy Hanson, Dahl's best friend. His father is stated to be one of the richest men in the galaxy. 
* Ensign Jasper Hester. He's the only character without a detailed backstory because he was only created to allow the son of the show's producer to appear in the show. He trades places with the comatose son to save his life. 
* Ensign Finn, the only main character of the novel to die, protecting Abernathy from an assassination attempt. 

Senior officers of ''Intrepid'' and protagonists of the TV show:
* Captain Lucius Abernathy
* Science Officer Q’eeng
* Chief Engineer Paul West. Field missions including him are stated to be the most lethal to supporting characters. 
* ([[Astrogation|Astrogator]]) Anatoly Kerensky . Receives life-threatening injuries in nearly every mission, but heals with great speed in order to be ready for the next mission. 
* Medical Officer Hartnell

Other crew in the ''Intrepid'':
* Officer Jenkins. Suffers a breakdown when his wife dies to advance the show's plot. He hides in the cargo tunnels and monitors all activity on the ship. He develops the theory that the ''Intrepid''{{'}}s events are influenced by the TV show, and devices the means to travel to the past to stop it. 
* Lieutenant Collins, Dahl's direct officer at the exobiology laboratory. 
* Dahl’s lab mates Ben Trin, Jake Cassaway and Fiona Mbeke. They use Jenkin's alerts to avoid being assigned to field missions with the senior officers, but a failure of this system leads to Cassaway and Mbeke dying in a field mission with Q'eeng. 
* Ensign Davis, shown in the prologue as devoured by land worms to generate a plot point for the TV show. 

TV show cast and crew: 
* Charles Paulson, head producer of the show.
* Matt Paulson, Charles' son and the actor playing Hester, in coma due to a motorcycle accident. 
* Nick Weinstein, chief writer of the show and the actor who played Jenkins. 
* Mark Corey, the actor who plays Kerensky. 
* Brian Abnett, the actor who plays Dahl. 
* Samantha Martinez, the actress that played Jenkins' wife.

==Themes==
The novel satirises the tropes of [[Redshirt (character)|redshirt]] and [[Black box (fiction)|black box]] in television science fiction writing.

==Reception==
The novel won the RT Reviewer's Choice Award for 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtbookreviews.com/rt-awards/nominees-and-winners#Sci-Fi/Fantasy|title=RT - AWARD NOMINEES &amp; WINNERS|accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2013 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Novel,&lt;ref name="Hugo13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |title=2013 Hugo Awards | publisher=World Science Fiction Society| accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Locus Award]] for Best Science Fiction Novel, and the [[Geffen Award]] for Best Translated Science Fiction Novel.

John Schwartz of the ''New York Times'' noted that the plight of the Ensigns as they realize their situation as characters in a television drama as similar to ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', where the story tells what happens when its characters  find out they are not in the "real" storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/books/in-redshirts-john-scalzi-gives-expendables-a-life.html?_r=0|title=The Extras Get a Life|first=John|last=Schwartz|date=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine praised the novel saying "You don’t have to be a hardcore sci-fi fan to enjoy Redshirts, though there are plenty of Easter Eggs for those who are. And the beauty of the book is that it works on multiple levels. If you’re looking for a breezy, fun read for the beach, this is your book. If you want to go down a level and read it as a surreal meditation on character and genre like ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', this is your book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Forbes]]|first=Alex|last=Knapp|date=2012-05-30|title=John Scalzi's Redshirts Is A Great Tribute To The Unsung Grunts Of Science Fiction|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/05/30/john-scalzis-redshirts-is-a-great-tribute-to-the-unsung-grunts-of-science-fiction/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruthenian''' or '''Old Ruthenian''' ({{Script/Slavonic|рүскій єзыкь}}, see [[#Nomenclature|other names]]) was the group of [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[East Slavic language|East Slavic]] spoken in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and later in the East Slavic territories of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The written form is also called '''Chancery Slavonic''' by Lithuanian and Western European linguists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Elana Goldberg Shohamy and Monica Barni, ''Linguistic Landscape in the City'' (Multilingual Matters, 2010: {{ISBN|1847692974}}), p. 139: "[The Grand Duchy of Lithuania] adopted as its official language the literary version of Ruthenian, written in Cyrillic and also known as Chancery Slavonic"; Virgil Krapauskas, ''Nationalism and Historiography: The Case of Nineteenth-Century Lithuanian Historicism'' (East European Monographs, 2000: {{ISBN|0880334576}}), p. 26: "By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Chancery Slavonic dominated the written state language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania"; Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction Of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999'' (Yale University Press, 2004: {{ISBN|030010586X}}), p. 18: "Local recensions of Church Slavonic, introduced by Orthodox churchmen from more southerly lands, provided the basis for Chancery Slavonic, the court language of the Grand Duchy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars do not agree whether Ruthenian was a separate language, or a Western dialect or set of dialects of [[Old East Slavic]], but it is agreed that Ruthenian has a close genetic relationship with it. Old East Slavic was the colloquial language used in [[Kievan Rus']] (10th–13th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074133 Ukrainian language], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ruthenian is seen as a predecessor of modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. Indeed, all these languages, from Old East Slavic to Rusyn, have been labelled as ''Ruthenian'' ({{Lang-uk|Рутенська мова, русинська мова}}) at some point in history.

==Nomenclature==

In modern texts, the language in question is sometimes called "Old Ukrainian" or "Old Belarusian" ({{Lang-uk|“Староукраїнська мова”}}) and ({{Lang-be|“Старабеларуская мова”}}). {{cn|date=May 2018}} As Ruthenian was always in a kind of [[diglossia|diglossic]] opposition to [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], this vernacular language was and still is often called ''prosta(ja) mova'' ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] проста(я) мова), literally "[[simple speech]]".

;Names in contemporary use
* ''Ruthenian'' (Old Belarusian: руски езыкъ) — by the contemporaries, but, generally, not in contemporary Russia.&lt;!-- 1588 роздел 4, артыкул 1; тамсама, напр., 1/33, літары {{angle bracket|э}} і {{angle bracket|ы}} для Бунчыча --&gt;
** (variant) ''Simple Ruthenian'' or ''simple talk'' (Old Belarusian: простый руский (язык) or простая молва, про́ста мова) — publisher Grigoriy Khodkevich (16th century).
* ''Lithuanian'' ({{lang-ru|Литовский язык}}) — possibly, exclusive reference to it in the contemporary Russia. Also by Zizaniy (end of the 16th century), Pamva Berynda (1653).

As [[Eastern Europe]] gradually freed itself from the "[[Tatar yoke]]" in the 14th century, 2 separate mainly East Slavic states emerged: the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (Muscovy), which eventually evolved into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and subsequently the [[Russian Empire]]; the [[Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Many of Ruthenic lands conquered by the Lithuanians were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which covered roughly the territories of modern [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], and western Russia, and later united with [[Poland]] to form the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Linguistically, both states continued to use the regional varieties of the literary language of [[Kievan Rus']], but due to the immense [[Polish language|Polish]] influence in the west and to the [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] influence in the east, they gradually developed into two distinct literary languages: Ruthenian in Lithuania and the Commonwealth, and [[History of the Russian language#The Muscovite period (15th-17th centuries)|(Old) Russian]] in Muscovy. Both were usually called ''Ruskij'' (of Rus’) or ''Slovenskij'' (Slavonic); only when a differentiation between the literary language of Muscovy and the one of Lithuania was needed was the former called ''Moskovskij'' 'Muscovite' (and, rarely, the latter ''Lytvynskij'' 'Lithuanian').

This linguistic difference is confirmed by the need for translators during the mid-17th-century negotiations for the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], between [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], ruler of the [[Zaporozhian Host]], and the Tsardom of Russia.

&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the [[Torah]] used by [[Jews]]. In addition to the Samaritan Torah, Samaritans also revere their version of the [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Book of Joshua]] and recognize some of the Biblical figures such as [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]].

Samaritanism is internally described as the religion that began with [[Moses]], unchanged over the millennia that have since passed. Samaritans believe [[Judaism]], as well as the Jewish Torah, has been corrupted by time and thus is no longer serving the [[Sinaitic revelation|duties God mandated]] on [[Mount Sinai]]. Additional differences with Judaism center on the place of worship which in Samaritanism is recognized as Mount Gerizim in Samaria, as opposed to Mount Moriya in Judea within Judaism.

==History==
Samaritanism holds that the summit of [[Mount Gerizim]] is the true location of God's Holy Place, as opposed to the [[Foundation Stone]] on the [[Temple Mount]] as Judaism teaches. As such, Samaritans trace their history as a separate entity from the Jews back to the time of Moses, where they believe [[Joshua]] laid the foundation for their temple. Samaritan historiography traces the schism itself to the [[High Priest]] [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] abandoning Moses' Tabernacle in favor of Mount Gerizim following Joshua's death.

[[Abu l-Fath]], who in the 14th century wrote a major work of Samaritan history, comments on Samaritan origins as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Keepers, An Introduction to the History and Culture of the Samaritans'', by Robert T. Anderson and Terry Giles, Hendrickson Publishing, 2002, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A terrible civil war broke out between Eli son of Yafni, of the line of Ithamar, and the sons of Pincus ([[Phinehas]]), because Eli son of Yafni resolved to usurp the High Priesthood from the descendants of Pincus. He used to offer sacrifices on an altar of stones. He was 50 years old, endowed with wealth and in charge of the treasury of the Children of Israel. ...

He offered a sacrifice on the altar, but without salt, as if he were inattentive. When the Great High Priest Ozzi learned of this, and found the sacrifice was not accepted, he thoroughly disowned him; and it is (even) said that he rebuked him.

Thereupon he and the group that sympathized with him, rose in revolt and at once he and his followers and his beasts set off for Shiloh. Thus Israel split in factions. He sent to their leaders saying to them, ''Anyone who would like to see wonderful things, let him come to me.'' Then he assembled a large group around him in Shiloh, and built a Temple for himself there; he constructed a place like the Temple (on [[Mount Gerizim]]). He built an altar, omitting no detail—it all corresponded to the original, piece by piece.

At this time the Children of Israel split into three factions. A loyal faction on [[Mount Gerizim]]; a heretical faction that followed false gods; and the faction that followed Eli son of Yafni in Shiloh.}}

Further, the ''Samaritan Chronicle Adler'', or New Chronicle, believed to have been composed in the 18th century using earlier chronicles as sources states:

{{quote|And the Children of Israel in his days divided into three groups.  One did according to the abominations of the [[Gentile]]s and served other gods; another followed Eli the son of Yafni, although many of them turned away from him after he had revealed his intentions; and a third remained with the High Priest Uzzi ben Bukki, the chosen place.}}

Samaritanism emerged as an independent ethnic culture following its survival of the [[Assyrian captivity]] in the 8th century BC. Jewish sources attest their own narrative of the origins of the Samaritans. From here there are conflicting proposals, including the Samaritans being the people of [[Kutha]] described in the [[Talmud]]. The traditional Jewish narrative, formed based off [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 9.277–91&lt;/ref&gt; details the people of Israel were removed by the king of the Assyrians ([[Sargon II]])&lt;ref&gt;See the wording of 2 Kings 17 which mentions [[Shalmaneser V|Shalmaneser]] in verse 3 but the "king of the Assyrians" from verse 4 onward.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Halah]], to [[Tell Halaf|Gozan]] on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] and to the towns of the [[Medes]]. The king of the Assyrians then brought people from [[Babylon]], Kutha, [[Avah]], Emath, and [[Sepharvaim]] to place in Samaria. Because God sent lions among them to kill them, the king of the Assyrians sent one of the priests from Bethel to teach the new settlers about God's ordinances. The eventual result was that the new settlers worshiped both the God of the land and their own gods from the countries from which they came. However, genetic studies showed the Samaritans are almost definitely descendants of the historical Israelite population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15300852|url=http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Shen2004.pdf|year=2004|last1=Shen|first1=P|last2=Lavi|first2=T|last3=Kivisild|first3=T|last4=Chou|first4=V|last5=Sengun|first5=D|last6=Gefel|first6=D|last7=Shpirer|first7=I|last8=Woolf|first8=E|last9=Hillel|first9=J|title=Reconstruction of patrilineages and matrilineages of Samaritans and other Israeli populations from Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA sequence variation|volume=24|issue=3|pages=248–60|doi=10.1002/humu.20077|journal=Human Mutation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Genes, Polymorphisms and the Making of Societies: How Genetic Behavioral Traits Influence Human Cultures |last=Kiaris |first= Hippokratis |publisher=Universal Publishers |year=2012 |isbn=978-1612330938 |publication-date=April 1, 2012 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit isolated given the people's reclusive history. This casts doubt into, if not totally disproves, this historical theory that Samaritans originated from Assyria.

Furthermore, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea scroll]] 4Q372, which recounts the hope that [[Ten Lost Tribes|the northern tribes]] will return to the land of Joseph, remark that the current dwellers in the north are referred to as fools, an enemy people, but are not referred to as foreigners. It goes on to say that these people, the Samaritans, mocked Jerusalem and built a temple on a high place (Gerizim) to provoke Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZSl64Or5UMC&amp;dq=4Q372&amp;q=4Q372#v=snippet&amp;q=4Q372&amp;f=false| title=The Origin of the Samaritans| author=Magnar Kartveit |publisher=BRILL |year=2009 |pages=168–171|accessdate=30 January 2014| isbn=9004178198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict between the Samaritans and the Jews were numerous between the end of the Assyrian diaspora and to the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. The [[Tanakh]] describes multiple instigations from the Samaritan population against the Jews and disparages them, Jesus' [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] also gives evidence of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;John 4:9, namely, ''"For Jews do not associate with Samaritans."''&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of Mount Gerizim's Samaritan temple is attributed to the High Priest [[John Hyrcanus]].

Following the failed revolts, Mount Gerizim was rededicated with a new temple, which was ultimately again destroyed during the [[Samaritan Revolts]]. Persecution of Samaritans was common in the following centuries.

==Beliefs==
The principle beliefs of Samaritanism are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/religion/|title=Religion of the Israelite Samaritans : The Root of all Abrahamic Religions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesamaritanupdate.com|title=Religion of the Israelite Samaritans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/bible/bible-general/samaritan|title=Samaritan - Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is one [[God]], [[Yahweh|YHWH]], the same God recognized by the [[prophet#The Hebrew and Jewish concepts of prophet|Hebrew prophets]]. Faith is in the unity of the Creator which is absolute unity. It is the cause of the causes, and it fills the entire world. His nature can not be understood by human beings, but according to his actions and according to his revelation to his people and the kindness he showed them.
* The [[Torah]] is the only true holy book, and was given by God to [[Moses]]. The Torah was created before the creation of the world and whoever believes in it is assured a part in the World to Come. The status of the Torah in Samaritanism as the only holy book causes Samaritans to reject the [[Oral Torah]], [[Talmud]], and all prophets and scriptures except for Joshua, whose book in the Samaritan community is significantly different from the Book of Joshua in the Tanakh/[[Old Testament]]. Essentially, the authority of all post-Torah sections of the Tanakh, and classical Jewish [[Rabbi]]nical works (the [[Talmud]], comprising the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Gemara]]) is rejected. Moses is considered the only prophet who ever arose.
* Mount Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the one true sanctuary chosen by Israel's God. The Samaritans do not recognize the sanctity of Jerusalem and do not recognize Mount Moriah.
* The apocalypse, called "the day of vengeance". At the end of days, in which a figure called the Taheb (essentially the Samaritan equivalent of the [[Jewish Messiah]]) from the tribe of Joseph, be it Ephraim or Manessah, who will be a prophet like Moses (though some say he will ''be'' Moses) for forty years, and bring about the return of all the Israelites, following which the dead will be [[resurrection|resurrected]]. The Taheb will then discover the tent of Moses' Tabernacle on Mount Gerizim, and will be buried next to Joseph when he dies.

==Festivals and Observances==
The Samaritans have retained an offshoot of the [[Samaritan alphabet|Ancient Hebrew script]], a [[High Priest of Israel|High Priesthood]], the slaughtering and eating of [[Lamb and mutton|lambs]] on [[Passover]] eve, and the celebration of the first month's beginning around springtime as the New Year. Yom Teru'ah (the Biblical name for "[[Rosh Hashanah]]"), at the beginning of [[Tishrei]], is not considered a [[New Year]] as it is in Rabbinic Judaism. The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] differs from the Jewish [[Masoretic Text]] as well. Some differences are doctrinal: for example, the Samaritan Torah explicitly states that Mount Gerizim is "the place that God ''has chosen''" to establish His name, as opposed to the Jewish Torah that refers to "the place that God ''chooses''". Other differences are minor and seem more or less accidental.

Passover is particularly important in the Samaritan community, climaxing with the sacrifice of up to 40 sheep. The [[Counting of the Omer]] remains largely unchanged; however, the week before [[Shavuot]] is a unique festival celebrating the continued commitment Samaritanism has maintained since the time of Moses. Shavuot is characterized by nearly day-long services of continuous prayer, especially over the stones on Gerizim traditionally attributed to Joshua. During [[Sukkot]], the sukkah is built inside houses as opposed to traditional outdoor settings. The restrictions of [[Yom Kippur]] are more universal in Samaritanism, with even breastfeeding and the feeding of children being disallowed, and the separation of gender during services is never enforced.

==Religious texts==
[[File:Shma yisrael.png|thumb|"[[Shema Yisrael]]" written in [[Samaritan Hebrew]] calligraphy]]
Samaritan law differs from [[Halakha]] (Rabbinic Jewish law) and other Jewish movements. The Samaritans have several groups of religious texts, which correspond to Jewish Halakha. A few examples of such texts are:

[[File:Samaritan High Priest and Old Pentateuch, 1905.png|thumb|350px|[[Samaritan High Priest]] Yaakov ben Aharon and the [[Abisha Scroll]], 1905]]
* '''[[Samaritan Pentateuch]]''': There are some 6,000 differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch text; and, according to one estimate, 1,900 points of agreement between it and the Greek LXX version. Several passages in the [[New Testament]] would also appear to echo a Torah textual tradition not dissimilar to that conserved in the Samaritan text. There are several theories regarding the similarities. The variations, some corroborated by readings in the Old Latin, Syriac and Ethiopian translations, attest to the antiquity of the Samaritan text,&lt;ref&gt;James VanderKam, Peter Flint, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA95 ''The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity,''] A&amp;C Black, 2nd ed. 2005 p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Michael Law, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZoeAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 ''When God Spoke Greek: The Septuagint and the Making of the Christian Bible,''] Oxford University Press, USA, 2013 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isac Leo Seeligmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BHYnIhREtzgC&amp;pg=PA64 ''The Septuagint Version of Isaiah and Cognate Studies,'']. Mohr Siebeck 2004 pp.64ff.&lt;/ref&gt; although the exact date of composition is still largely unclear. Granted special attention is the so-called "[[Abisha Scroll]]", a manuscript of the Pentateuch tradition attributed to [[Abishua]], grandson of [[Aaron]], traditionally compiled during the Bronze Age. However, testing on the scroll revealed it was created no earlier than the 14th century CE, in fact around a century younger than the world's oldest Torah scroll.

A '''slide library''' is a library that houses a collection of photographic [[reversal film|slides]], either as a part of a larger [[library]] or standing alone within a larger organization, such as an academic department of a college or university, a museum, or a corporation.  Typically, a "slide library" contains slides depicting [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[architecture]], or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of [[art history]], architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as [[biology]] and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as "Visual Resources Collections," as they may be responsible for all "visual" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:

* 35mm slides
* lantern slides
* mounted study photographs
* born digital images
* 35mm, 8mm film
Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously [[Library catalog|cataloged]] and [[Archive|inventoried]] slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, [[Digitizing|digitized]] slides and placed them online via [[content management systems]]. 

== History of visual resources collections ==

The first American [[lantern slide]] collections, developed by [[museum]]s to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: [[DePauw University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Rochester]]. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.

The first illustrated architectural history course west of the [[Mississippi]] was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1905.  The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides.  In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3"x 4.25".

The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film.  Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2"x2" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.

The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960.  The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.

== Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.==

1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25" x 4.0" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required [[lime light]] which was dirty and dangerous
 
1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed
 
1888. First perforated film stock developed
 
1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock
 
1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film

1905. UC Berkeley’s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher’s book, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''

1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust
 
1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography
 
1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film
 
1930.  Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)
 
1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle
 
1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base
 
1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets

1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides

[[Image:Soap in blue dish.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;A blue soap dish&lt;br&gt;holds a bar of soap while it dries&lt;/center&gt;]]

A '''soap dish''' is a shallow, open container or platform where a bar of [[soap]] may be placed to dry after use. Soap dishes are usually located in or near a [[sink]], [[shower]], or [[bathtub]]. Most soap dishes are made from waterproof materials such as plastic, ceramic, metal, or glass, though some are made from [[bamboo]]. A china [[saucer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/how-to-give-household-clutter-a-new-life/2017/07/11/8cde295e-6190-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html|title=How to give household clutter a new life|last=Mayhew|first=Elizabeth|date=12 July 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=2 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|department=Home &amp; Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] may serve as a soap dish. A soap dish accommodates bar soap, whereas a [[soap dispenser]] accommodates [[Soap#Liquid soap|liquid soap]] or [[Foam pump|foam soap]].

==Design elements==
[[Image:Waschbecken mit Seifenhalter fcm.jpg|thumb|right|190px||&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;An unbreakable plastic&lt;br /&gt;soap dish&lt;br /&gt;with ventilating ridges,&lt;br /&gt;self-draining contours, and&lt;br /&gt;suction cup attachment&lt;/div&gt;]]

Elements in the [[Industrial design|design]] of a soap dish include safety, ventilation, cleanliness, placement, [[Aesthetics#Applied aesthetics|aesthetics]], and cost. When a soap dish is part of a bath accessories set, coordinated group design may be utilized. Notable soap dish designs include Leonard L Hierath's May 2018 US Patent #US-9962042 Article Support (soap dish) US Patent and Trademark Office; Robert A. Pitton's 1956 US patent for a reversible, hemispherical soap dish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitton|first1=Robert A.|title=US Patent #US-2867940-A:  Soap Dishes|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2867940|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=4 September 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bernard Cohen's October 2017 design for the "SoapAnchor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raskin|first1=Randy|title=How My Father-in-Law Disrupted the Soap Dish: His 5 steps for designing a better version of anything|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/how-my-father-in-law-disrupted-the-soap-dish-35ee2bb927e|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=The Mission|publisher=Medium|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (patent pending).

===Safety===
Because of their intended use in wet and potentially hazardous environments, most soap dishes are designed with safety in mind. Such features include unbreakable materials, non-slip surfaces, rounded edges, and secure installation elements (e.g., wall mount hardware, a [[suction cup]], or non-skid feet). Depositing or retrieving a slippery bar of soap is facilitated by an open (or semi-open) sided design or by a shallow lip.

===Ventilation===
A bar of wet soap relies on ventilation to dry. A number of design elements may be used to increase ambient [[airflow]] around the soap, including vented surfaces or surfaces interspersed with bumps, ridges, or slats. Mechanical ventilation has not yet become a widespread design element in soap dishes.

===Cleanliness===
[[File:Soap dish - built-in - white sink.jpg|thumb|right|160px|&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;A sink with two&lt;br&gt;built-in soap dishes&lt;br&gt;(aside the faucets)&lt;/div&gt;]]

Because of their association with [[hand washing]] and [[hygiene]], soap dishes themselves are often the focus of cleanliness. To aid in cleanup, some self-draining soap dishes are designed to allow soapy residue to collect in a compartment below the raised bar of soap.  Other such soap dishes funnel the soapy reside directly to the adjacent sink or bathtub, necessitating strategic placement of the soap dish.

===Placement===
Most soap dishes are standalone accessories whose placement is at the user's discretion, though some are a built-in feature of a sink, shower, or bathtub. Standalone soap dishes may be entirely portable or may include options for semi-permanent or permanent installation on a horizontal or vertical surface. Locating a soap dish outside the perimeter of a faucet's or showerhead's stream helps the soap to avoid excess [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Truini|first1=Joseph|title=How to Install a Soap Dish|url=https://www.thisoldhouse.com/how-to/how-to-install-soap-dish|website=This Old House|publisher=Old House Ventures LLC|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics===
Though utilitarian in purpose, soap dishes may be given aesthetic treatment.  A soap dish in the form of a whale, for example, was patented in 1961 by Sonia Adelson, with "the mouth portion thereof being adapted to receive and dispense a bar of soap in an amusing, novel and useful manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adelson|first1=Sonia|title=US Patent #US-3063190-A: Soap Receptacle|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US3063190|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=1 January 2018|date=16 January 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the "[[Bodoni]] Soap Dish", a February 2013 design by David Strauss that was inspired by the legacy of [[Massimo Vignelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=David|title=Vignelli chair inspires typeface soap dish|url=https://www.rit.edu/news/athenaeum_story.php?id=49757|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=University News|agency=RIT Athenaeum|publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology|date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=David|title=Bodoni Soap Dish|url=http://activatingthearchive.rit.edu/projects/gradid01/bodoni-soap-dish/|website=Activating the Vignelli Archive|publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A soap dish played a role in a seminal event in the 7th century when Byzantine Emperor [[Constans II]] (630-668) was assassinated with one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203917304574412984059644024|title=A Soap Dish That Changed History: The enduring yet seldom-appreciated significance of a seventh-century emperor's bath|last1=Brownworth|first1=Lars|date=24 October 2009|work=|accessdate=2 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|department=Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of national, international and topic-based studies have been made of [[Waldorf education]]. In 2005, British educational researchers Philip Woods, Martin Ashley and Glenys Woods evaluated Steiner-Waldorf schools for the United Kingdom's [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]. As part of their study, the authors evaluated the state of research as of 2005 and said

:"The research studies reviewed give a cumulative sense of a positive relationship between Steiner schools and learning, achievement and pupils' development of academic, creative, social and other capabilities important in the holistic growth of the person. The research evidence has to be interpreted with caution, however. Studies are often small scale and conducted in different cultural and national contexts that may affect the confidence with which findings can be generalized to other settings. Overall, there is a lack of rigorous research on the impact of Steiner school education on learning and achievement and little research which systematically compares Steiner and mainstream schools."&lt;ref name="education.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite | title = Steiner Schools in England: Research Report RR645 | author1 = Philip Woods | author2 = Martin Ashley | author3 = Glenys Woods | publisher = Department for Education and Skills | year = 2005 | url = http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RR645.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003 [[California State University]] study on science literacy of Waldorf-educated students==
A 2003 study conducted by David Jelinek and Li-Ling Sun, both of the College of Education at [[California State University, Sacramento|CalState - Sacramento]], investigated empirically the quality of science education at a series of Waldorf schools. They also examined the curriculum of the first Waldorf school as designed by Rudolf Steiner. These curricula were evaluated in comparison to the the traditional criteria of [[Experiential learning]], Developmentalism, Spiral curriculum, Triarchic intelligence, and Multiple intelligences. The authors also used a number of cognitive and academic tests to evaluate the performance of Waldorf-educated students in comparison to age-matched public school-educated peers. Attempts were made to remove the influence of researcher bias by involving analysts with no prior Waldorf background and by using multiple methods to gather quantitative and qualitative data, which was then analyzed using a variety of different statistical measures including central tendency, variability, frequency distributions, correlations, regression, t-tests and chi-square tests. 

The results of Jelinek and Sun's study are complex. For one, it became clear to the study authors early on that Waldorf schools do not match the national standards for science education well. That being said, they also described that there were some benefits of a Waldorf education in terms of open-ended thinking and inquiry. Even so, there were numerous theories and ideas prevalent throughout the curricula studied that were patently [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] and steeped in [[magical thinking]]. These ideas included the evolutionary idea that animals develop from humans, that human spirits are physically incarnated into "soul qualities that manifested themselves into various animal forms," that the current geological formations on Earth have evolved through so-called "Lemurian" and "Atlantiean" epochs, or that the 4 kingdoms of nature are "mineral, plant, animal, and man." All of these are directly contradicted by mainstream scientific knowledge and have no basis in any form of conventional science. The authors contend that these notions are distinct from any factual inaccuracies found in modern public school textbooks, as the inaccuracies in the latter are of a specific and minute nature that results from the progress of science. The latter (those inaccuracies present in Waldorf textbooks), however, are the result of a mode of thinking that has no valid basis in reason or logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jelinek |first1=David |last2=Sun |first2=Li-Ling |title=Does Waldorf Offer a Viable Form of Science Education?

==2012 US Study==
A 2012 study compared the reading and math standardized test scores obtained in public Waldorf schools in the United States with scores for their districts as a whole, as well as scores in matched comparison schools. Public Waldorf school scores were lower than those of regular public schools in earlier grades (second and third), but higher in seventh and eighth grade. The authors suggested that "the Waldorf experience provided a slower academic build-up resulting in poorer test scores in the lower grades followed by higher levels of advanced performance in the 8th grade." The authors concluded that a content analysis of parents' comments about the schools supports the impression that public Waldorf schools offer a more holistic approach to education, "with greater emphasis on the arts, community and developmentally appropriate practice." &lt;ref name = larrison&gt;{{cite journal| title = Twenty Years and Counting: A Look at Waldorf in the Public Sector Using Online Sources | author1 = Abigail L.

==2012 German study==
A 2012 study of Waldorf pupils in Germany concluded that, in comparison to state school pupils, Waldorf students are significantly more enthusiastic about learning, report having more fun and being less bored in school, more often feel individually met, and learn more from school about their personal academic strengths. 85% of the Waldorf students reported that their school environment was pleasant and supportive, compared to 60% of the state school students. More than twice as many Waldorf students report having good relationships with teachers. Waldorf pupils also have significantly less physical ailments such as headaches, stomach aches, or disrupted sleep. There was no statistically significant difference between the state and Waldorf pupils’ achievement on state examinations;&lt;ref name=Welt2012&gt;Fanny Jiminez, [https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article109484661/Namen-tanzen-fit-in-Mathe-Waldorf-im-Vorteil.html "Namen tanzen, fit in Mathe - Waldorf im Vorteil"]. ''Die Welt'' Sept 26, 2012, citing Barz, et. al, ''Bildungserfahrungen an Waldorfschulen: Empirische Studie zu Schulqualität und Lernerfahrungen'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; this is also true when test scores are compared based on the type of high school diploma granted.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;Fanny Jiménez, "Wissenschaftler loben Waldorfschulen", ''Die Welt'', 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 PISA study==
 	
A 2009 [[PISA]] study found that, compared to state school students, European Waldorf students are significantly more capable in the sciences,&lt;ref name=Welt2012/&gt; slightly less capable in mathematics; and comparable in reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erziehungskunst.de/artikel/pisa-belegt-die-naturwissenschaftliche-kompetenz-der-waldorfschule/ "pisa belegt die naturwissenschaftliche kompetenz der waldorfschule"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 study of later introduction of reading==
A 2009 study comparing Waldorf and public school students in New Zealand found that the Waldorf students, who had no formal instruction in reading in pre-school or kindergarten, caught up in reading ability by around age 10, at which point there was "no difference in reading achievement between children who had been given early instruction in reading and those who had not".&lt;ref&gt;
Sebastian P. Suggate, Elizabeth A. Schaughency, Elaine Reese (2013). "Children learning to read later catch up to children reading earlier", ''Early Childhood Research Quarterly'', v. 28, Nr. 1, pp. 33–48&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2008 report by the Cambridge-based ''Primary Review'', found that "educational alternatives, including Steiner-Waldorf schools and home schooling, produce better academic results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQ6QhUpdZd4SiSrplf_qjQ693KMg "Primary schools exert unnecessary pressure on students"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226125506/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQ6QhUpdZd4SiSrplf_qjQ693KMg |date=2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Austrian study==
A 2006 [[PISA]] study of Austrian students found that Austrian Waldorf students are above average in science. The Waldorf students did best in understanding the questions raised by science and the ability to solve scientific problems and were also above the [[OECD]] average for their joy and interest in science.&lt;ref name=PISA2006&gt;{{cite book |authors=Claudia Schreiner and Ursula Schwantner |title=PISA 2006: Austrian Report with a Focus on the Sciences |year=2009 |chapter=Section 9.6 Comparison of Skills and Individual Characteristics of Waldorf Students |url=https://www.bifie.at/buch/815/9/6 |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LuyNS9bX?url=https://www.bifie.at/buch/815/9/6 |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }} {{language icon|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors concluded "The relatively high expertise in science among Waldorf students, in combination with their very high motivation and interest in these subjects, as well as the various pedagogical principles, suggest that regular schools can learn from the Waldorf schools, particularly with regard to concrete application to the sciences."&lt;ref name=PISAtrans&gt;{{language icon|de}} "Auf Grund der relativ hohen Naturwissenschafts-Kompetenz der Waldorfschüler/innen in Kombination mit äußerst hohen motivationalen Merkmalen und selbstbezogenen Kognitionen in diesen Fächern sowie den unterschiedlichen didaktischen Prinzipien liegt der Schluss nahe, dass die Regelschule von der Waldorfschule lernen kann, insbesondere was den konkreten Anwendungsbezug in der Naturwissenschaft betrifft."&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Health study==
Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of [[allergies]] and [[atopy|allergic-like symptoms]], an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an "anthroposophic lifestyle" generally - in particular with reduced use of [[antibiotics]], and [[antipyretics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Allergic disease and sensitization in Steiner school children |publisher= 'Journal of Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology'' |date= January 11, 2006 |url= http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(05)02128-7/fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 UK comparison with mainstream education==
A UK [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] report noted significant differences in curriculum and pedagogical approach between Waldorf/Steiner and mainstream schools and suggested that each type of school could learn from the other type's strengths: in particular, that state schools could benefit from Waldorf education's early introduction and approach to modern foreign languages; combination of block (class) and subject teaching for younger children; development of speaking and listening through an emphasis on oral work; good pacing of lessons through an emphasis on rhythm; emphasis on child development guiding the curriculum and examinations; approach to art and creativity; attention given to teachers’ reflective activity and heightened awareness (in collective child study for example); and collegial structure of leadership and management, including collegial study. Aspects of mainstream practice which could inform good practice in Waldorf schools included: management skills and ways of improving organizational and administrative efficiency; classroom management; work with secondary-school age children; and assessment and record keeping.&lt;ref name="education.gov.uk"/&gt;

==1998-2008 Australian studies==
A major quantitative and qualitative study of senior secondary students in the three largest Steiner schools in Australia was undertaken by Jennifer Gidley in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gidley, J. (1998). "Prospective Youth Visions through Imaginative Education." Futures: The journal of policy, planning and futures studies 30(5): 395–408.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gidley, J. (2002). Holistic Education and Visions of Rehumanized Futures. Youth Futures:  Comparative Research and Transformative Visions. J. Gidley and S. Inayatullah. Westport, Connecticut, Praeger: 155-168.&lt;/ref&gt; It investigated the Steiner-educated students’ views and visions of the future, replicating a major study with a large cross-section of mainstream and other private school students undertaken a few years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, F. (1992). Futures consciousness and the school: Explorations of broad and narrow literacies for the 21st-century with particular reference to Australian young people. Armidale NSW, University of New England: 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings as summarised below contrasted markedly in some areas with the research from mainstream students at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gidley, J. and G. Hampson (2005). "The Evolution of Futures in School Education." Futures: The journal of policy, planning and futures studies 37: 255–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Steiner-educated students were able to develop richer, more detailed images of their 'preferred futures' than mainstream students.
*About three-quarters were able to envision positive changes in both the environment and human development; almost two-thirds were able to imagine positive changes in the socio-economic area;
*They tended to focus on ‘social’ rather than ‘technological’ ways of solving problems;
*In envisioning futures without war, their visions primarily related to improvements in human relationships and communication through dialogue and conflict resolution rather than a 'passive peace' image;
*75% had many ideas on what aspects of human development (including their own) needed to be changed to enable the fulfilment of their aspirations. These included more activism, value changes, spirituality, future care and better education;
*In spite of identifying many of the same concerns as other students – global-scale environmental destruction, social injustice and threats of war – most of the Steiner students seemed undaunted in terms of their own will to do something to create their 'preferred future';
*There were no gender differences found in the students’ preferred futures visions or in the richness and fluidity of their creative images.

In 2008, the Rudolf Steiner Schools Association of Australia funded a research project to investigate the relationships between Steiner pedagogy and related 21st century academic discourses. The report on the project is called "Turning Tides: Creating Dialogue between Rudolf Steiner and 21st Century Academic Discourses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosejourn.com/index.php/rose/article/viewFile/17/58 "Turning Tides: Creating Dialogue between Rudolf Steiner and 21st Century Academic Discourses"]&lt;/ref&gt; A bibliography&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/880124/International_Steiner_Research_Database Bibliography of Gidley Steiner Project]&lt;/ref&gt; of all the studies that were identified is also available online as is the extended project data.&lt;ref&gt;Including abstracts for many of the [http://www.steineroz.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Gidley_Steiner_Project_Data_20080618.pdf  Steiner-related PhD and Masters dissertations] and some academic articles. The project data has not been updated since 2008 and some of the 'in progress' theses are now complete.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity and artistry==
A study comparing the drawing ability of children in Steiner/Waldorf, [[Montessori method|Montessori]] and traditional schools concluded that "the approach to art education in Steiner schools is conducive not only to more highly rated imaginative drawings in terms of general drawing ability and use of color but also to more accurate and detailed observational drawings,"&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Cox and Anna Rolands, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191183 "The Effect of Three Different Educational Approaches on Children's Drawing Ability"], ''British Journal of Educational Psychology'' 70, pp. 485–503 (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; while another study found that Waldorf pupils average higher scores on the [[Ellis Paul Torrance#Torrance on creativity|Torrance Test of Creative Thinking Ability]] than state-school students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED400948&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED400948 Earl J. Ogletree, ''The Comparative Status of the Creative Thinking Ability of Waldorf Education Students'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative study of moral development==
An American study found that Waldorf-educated students scored significantly higher on a test of [[morality|moral]] reasoning than students in public high schools and students in a religiously affiliated high school. Waldorf students were also far more likely to volunteer opinions about the survey and research in general, suggesting possible improvements in the survey technique and offering alternative ways of resolving the moral dilemmas raised in the survey.&lt;ref name=Hether&gt;pp. 113-118&lt;/ref&gt;

;1999 study of Waldorf methods for at-risk students
The [[Thomas E. Mathews Community School]] in [[Yuba County]], [[California]] serves high-risk juvenile offenders, many of whom have [[learning disabilities]]. The school switched to Waldorf methods in the 1990s. A 1999 study of the school found that students had "improved attitudes toward learning, better social interaction and excellent academic progress."&lt;ref&gt;Arline Monks, [http://www.steinercollege.edu/files/content/pdf/BreakingDownBarriers.pdf "Breaking Down the Barriers to Learning: The Power of the Arts"], ''Journal of Court, Community and Alternative Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Babineaux&gt;Babineaux, R., ''Evaluation report: Thomas E. Mathews Community School'', Stanford University 1999, cited in Monks, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; This study identified the integration of the arts "into every curriculum unit and almost every classroom activity" of the school as the most effective tool to help students overcome patterns of failure. The study also found significant improvements in reading and math scores, student participation, focus, openness and enthusiasm, as well as emotional stability, civility of interaction and tenacity.&lt;ref name=Babineaux/&gt;

== 1995 South African Case Study ==
A Masters degree Case Study was conducted in 1995 in South Africa entitled: ''The Rudolf Steiner approach to education: A qualitative study with particular reference to the pre-primary and primary phase of a Waldorf school in KwaZulu-Natal''. Abstract of thesis: The location of this work within the holistic world view or the symbolic science paradigm indicates that the case study approach will be most likely to maximize valid findings. The theoretical and evaluative demands of this study precluded the use of more quantitative methods. The aim was to attempt a demystification of Waldorf Education by means of in-depth interpretation and reconstruction, in other words, using descriptions which have contextual validity.

==1995 U.S. Waldorf schools survey==
A 1995 survey of U.S. Waldorf schools found that parents overall experienced the Waldorf schools as achieving their major aims for students, and described the education as one that "integrates the aesthetic, spiritual and interpersonal development of the child with rigorous intellectual development", preserving students' enthusiasm for learning so that they develop a better sense of self-confidence and self-direction. Some parents described upper grades teachers as overextended, without sufficient time to relate to parental needs and input, and wished for more open and reciprocal parent-school support. Both parents and students sometimes described colleges of teachers as being insular and unresponsive.[[File:Rudolf Steiner School E79 jeh.JPG|thumb|Rudolf Steiner School, New York City]]
The students overall were positive about the school and its differences; experienced the school as a "community of friends"; and spoke of the opportunity to grow and develop through the broad range of activities offered, to learn when they were ready to learn, to develop imagination, and to come to understand the world as well as oneself. Many students spoke of the kindness of their peers and of learning to think things through clearly for themselves, not to jump to conclusions, and to remain positive in the face of problems and independent of pressure from others to think as they do. Improvements the students suggested included more after-school sports programs, more physical education classes, more preparation for standardized testing, a class in world politics and computer classes. Faculty, parents and students were united in expressing a desire to improve the diversity of the student body, especially by increasing representation of minority groups such as [[African-Americans]] and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic Americans]].&lt;ref name="Easton"&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf impulse in education:Schools as communities that educate the whole child by integrating artistic and academic work'', Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University Teachers College, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardized testing: USA and Germany==
Waldorf students are less exposed to standardized testing; such tests are generally absent in the elementary school years. Despite this, U.S. Waldorf pupils' [[SAT scores]] have usually come above the national average, especially on verbal measures.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"&gt;Todd Oppenheimer, [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99sep/9909waldorf.htm ''Schooling the Imagination''], ''Atlantic Monthly'', September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Studies comparing students' performance on [[abitur|college-entrance examinations in Germany]] found that as a group, Waldorf graduates passed the exam at double to triple the rate of students graduating from the state education system,&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ullrich"&gt;Ullrich, Heiner, [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/steinere.pdf "Rudolf Steiner"] "''Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education'', UNESCO: International Bureau of education, vol XXIV, no. 3/4, 1994, pp. 555–572&lt;/ref&gt; and that students who had attended Waldorf schools for their entire education passed at a much higher rate (40% vs. 26%) than those who only had part of their education at a Waldorf school.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Spiegel'', December 14, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Educational successes of private Waldorf schools may partially reflect the social status of their students.&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt;

'''Sumpong''', in Filipino Psychology, refers to a range of short-term or temporary temperament, mood problem, or  illness wherein a person withdraws affection or cheerfulness from people in general.&lt;ref name="Red Lizard Dictionary"&gt;[http://rl.redlizard.tripod.com/id3.html Red Lizard English-Tagalog Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavior roots from Filipino culture, therefore the term has no English equivalent, but "having a bad day," "temperament problem," "mood," "tantrum," "neurosis" and even "chronic illness" may be considered close translations, depending on the context.
&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/love.htm Love, Courtship In Filipino Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ang Sumpong ng Hika"&gt;[http://www.inyourlanguage.gsk.com/Tagalog/pdf/MCM069_TAG.pdf Ang Sumpong ng Hika]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hika-Timog Forum"&gt;[http://www.timog.com/forum/showthread.php?t=25927 Timog Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIS Aug 26 Sumpong at Kiliti ni Marian at Dong"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLAJESVE3ds SIS Aug 26 Sumpong at Kiliti ni Marian at Dong]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manifestations of Sumpong ==
Sumpong is usually manifested by those who were not able to sleep well.  There is the absence of a cheerful behavior, and its expression is almost entirely nonverbal.  These manifestations include:
* refusing to eat, work, or play
* being unusually quiet
* simply keeping to one's self
* withdrawing from the group
* resisting expressions of affection
* locking one's self in his or her room 
* not joining friends in group activities
* not talking to the person concerned, or to people in general

These are usually efforts to get the offending party to go away, and if these behaviors do not work, the person with ''sumpong'' might choose to escalate them - foot stomping, door slamming, and shouting, for example.
&lt;ref name="review"&gt;[http://www.epinions.com/content_247551331972 Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Culture Shock!: Philippines at Epinions.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural reason for Sumpong==
While these external manifestations may indeed sound like a temperament or mood problem in the western sense, the underlying cultural reason for them is what sets ''sumpong'' apart.  While tantrums and moodiness have strong negative connotations in western countries, ''sumpong '' is understandable among Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/egads/showart?show=jaf.0032&amp;idonly=JAF&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''sumpong'' has positive connotations for the Filipino aside from the obvious negatives ones. Having ''sumpong'' is a manifestation of being able to feel and not being too passive.

Like ''[[tampo]]'', the cultural behavior ''sumpong'' roots from the nonconfrontational nature of Filipino culture.  That is to say, it is a way of expressing hurt feelings in a culture where the direct expression of anger or resentment is discouraged.&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"/&gt; The withdrawal behaviors in ''sumpong'' are indirect ways of expressing hostility or resentment.

It can also be seen as a way by which Filipinos "save face," as direct confrontation is usually a threat to "smooth interpersonal relationships" (SIR), which is a deeply valued in Philippine society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm Philippines - Social Values And Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dealing with Sumpong ==
The basic expectation of one who meets a person with ''sumpong'' is to go away or to refrain from jesting with the person. One way of dealing with a person with ''sumpong'' is to respond to the person with the mood problem with friendly overtures or expressions of concern. Not to do this may, however, cause spontaneous healing ("nawala na ang sumpong") after a short "cooling off" period.  In most cases of ''sumpong'', healing the inner, emotional relationship between two people is usually more critical than resolving the issue itself.

== Related Cultural Traits ==
Like other Asians, Filipinos believe strongly in [[tampo]] and in saving face. This is why, in response to an invitation, when a Filipino says yes, it might mean “yes”, but could mean “maybe”, or even “I don’t know.” It is often difficult for Filipinos to bring themselves to say no, and it is a good idea to confirm a dinner invitation several times to ensure that they did not say yes because they could not find a proper way to say no. Also tied to saving face are ''amor propio'', which means self-respect; and ''hiya'', which means shame. A Filipino would be thought of as lacking ''amor propio'' if, for example, they accepted criticism weakly or did not offer honored guests the proper hospitality. Hiya is felt by those whose actions are seen as socially unacceptable, and one of the ultimate insults in Philippine society is to be labeled walang-hiya, which roughly translates to being shameless. Everyone is expected to have hiya, and to win the respect of others by conforming to community norms.

== Term Usage ==
* May sumpong - the person has, currently, a temperament problem that may last for a while
* Sinusumpong - present participle form, or the person is currently not in good mood and doing tantrums
* Sinusumpong ng (asthma, or any other illness) - the person is not in good mood because of a recurring illness, say, asthma or any other illness.
* Susumpungin - future tense of the word, usually an affectionate threat.
* Sumpungan - meet the person head-on &lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"/&gt;
* Sumpungin - (accent on the second syllable) a humorous adjective that refers to frequent moodiness or temperament problems.
* Pasumpong-sumpong - a disease or an illness, such as allergy, that happens once in a while and quite unpredictable

'''Tales of the Cocktail''' (sometimes shortened to '''Tales''' or '''TotC''') is an annual [[trade conference]], [[festival]], and gathering of [[cocktail]] and [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] industry professionals in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. The conference was founded in 2003 by cocktail enthusiast Ann Tuennerman,&lt;ref name=DiffordsGuide1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diffordsguide.com/people/3194/ann-tuennerman|title=Ann Tuennerman|website=Difford's Guide|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2016 hosts between 15,000 and 17,000 ticketed attendants.&lt;ref name=nola.com1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/dining/index.ssf/2016/07/why_tales_of_the_cocktails_mak.html|title=How Tales of the Cocktail helps New Orleanians have a good time|website=nola.com|date=2016-07-15|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tales of the Cocktail began in 2002 as the New Orleans Original Cocktail Tour, a walking tour of historic New Orleans bars hosted by local cocktail aficionado Ann Tuennerman (née Rogers). In September 2003, Tuennerman celebrated the first anniversary of the tour by hosting Tales of the Cocktail, a small gathering of cocktail enthusiasts and industry professionals that included legendary [[bartender]] and writer [[Dale DeGroff]].&lt;ref name=DiffordsGuide1 /&gt;

After a hiatus following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Tales of the Cocktail returned to New Orleans in 2006 and resumed operation. The event was moved up to July to avoid overlapping with the anniversary of the hurricane, and has taken place in the summer ever since.&lt;ref name=Bevvy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bevvy.co/articles/tales-of-the-cocktail-why-you-should-care/2652|title=Tales of the Cocktail: Why You Should Care (and Attend)|website=Bevvy|date=2016-04-20|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Tuennerman retired from Tales of the Cocktail on September 25, 2017. Mrs. Tuennerman informed the diversity council that her husband Paul Tuennerman would be returning to work at Tales. Several members of the council resigned in protest at not being included in the decision. Mrs. Tuennerman resigned soon there after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/dining/tales-of-the-cocktail-ann-tuennerman-zulu.html|title=At Tales of the Cocktail, the Founder Steps Down|website=New York Times|date=2017-09-25|accessdate=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2018 the Solomon Family and Neal Bodenheimer purchased the trademarks for Tales of the Cocktail, Ann and Paul Tuennerman completely divested from the trademarks and all business associated with Tales of the Cocktail. Additionally, there was a complete overhaul of the Board of Directors for the non-profit called New Orleans Culinary and Cultural Preservation Society. The Tales of the Cocktail Foundation was officially formalized under new leadership, with a mission to educate, advance, and support our industry, on February 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/entertainment_life/food_restaurants/article_a2fca37e-1341-11e8-9b2e-232db93f15a8.html|title=Tales of the Cocktail, once on the rocks, finds new leaders, new calling as nonprofit|last=imcnulty@theadvocate.com|first=IAN MCNULTY {{!}}|work=The Advocate|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location==
Tales of the Cocktail is primarily hosted at the [[Hotel Monteleone]] in New Orleans’ [[French Quarter]], but many events take place at other nearby bars, hotels, and event venues.&lt;ref name=nola.com2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/dining/index.ssf/2016/07/tales_of_the_cocktail_2016_a_g.html|title=Guide to eating, drinking events at Tales of the Cocktail 2016|website=nola.com|date=2016-07-11|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocktailenthusiast.com/highlights-from-tales-of-the-cocktail-2016|title=Highlights from Tales of the Cocktail 2016|website=Cocktail Enthusiast|date=2016-07-27|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Tales of the Cocktail announced a new brick and mortar location in downtown New Orleans. The venue will serve as both an event space and full service cocktail bar. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://neatpour.com/2018/11/tales-goes-brick-n-mortar/|title=Tales Goes Brick n’ Mortar|work=Neat Pour|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirited Awards==
In 2007, Tales of the Cocktail launched the Spirited Awards, an annual awards ceremony honoring bars, bartenders, and other industry professionals from around the world. Some of the top awards include American and International categories of Best Cocktail Bar, Bartender of the Year, Best Cocktail &amp; Spirits Publication, World’s Best Cocktail Menu, and numerous others.&lt;ref name=DiffordsGuide2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/1014/cocktails/tales-of-the-cocktail-spirited-awards-winners-since-2007|title=Tales of the Cocktail Spirited Awards winners since 2007|website=Difford's Guide|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by many as the most prestigious awards ceremony in the cocktail and spirits industry.&lt;ref name=Bevvy /&gt;

==International Events==
In 2011, Tales of the Cocktail launched their international event Tales of the Cocktail on Tour (sometimes shortened to Tales on Tour) in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The event has since taken place annually in various cities, including [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. In 2017, Tales of the Cocktail on Tour is slated to take place in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=SpiritsBusiness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2016/07/tales-on-tour-heads-to-edinburgh/|title=Tales on Tour Heads to Edinburgh|website=The Spirits Business|date=2016-07-26|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Flying Sorcerers''''' is a humorous 1971 [[science fiction]] novel by American writers [[David Gerrold]] and [[Larry Niven]]. It was originally serialized in 1970 as ''The Misspelled Magishun'' in ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'' magazine.

The book is about the efforts of a stranded astronaut to escape from a primitive world, showing how [[sufficiently advanced technology]] could be perceived as magic by its natives.

==Plot summary==

The plot concerns the efforts of an [[astronaut]] and [[geologist]]/[[anthropologist]], known to the natives as "Purple", to escape from a primitive world on which he is stranded and return to his people.  The events are seen from the perspective of Lant, one of the natives, who becomes, in the course of the novel, Speaker (chieftain) of his people.

The natives, a fur covered people, believe in magic and the book shows how [[sufficiently advanced technology]] would be perceived by a primitive society.

Purple lands in an egg-shaped vehicle.  He casually disrupts the lives of Lant's people, and thoughtlessly demeans Shoogar, the village magician.  Shoogar gets revenge by destroying Purple's vehicle, which results in an atomic explosion.  Many of the villagers are dead or injured: the rest, including Lant and Shoogar, are forced to flee.  Purple is presumed dead.

The villagers eventually wind up on a fertile peninsula, which, as the summer approaches, is rapidly becoming an island (thanks to the influence of the two suns, the shorelines on this world are somewhat variable).  To the annoyance of the existing inhabitants of the area, the villagers contrive to be trapped in the verdant area by the rising seas.  The villagers are less happy when they learn that Purple is here, serving ineffectively as local magician, having succeeded the incumbent, Dorthi, by killing him by landing on him in a fall from the sky in an impact suit.

Lant's people wish to flee, but have nowhere to go.  Lant, who becomes Speaker of the villagers more or less by default, and the local Speaker persuade the two magicians to swear to a peace treaty.

Purple can call his mother ship to get him, but must return to the distant area of the old village to do so.  Everyone is stranded on the island for a considerable length of time.  Purple conceives the idea of fabricating a flying machine to return him to the area.  He persuades his villagers (who are actually anxious to get rid of him) and Lant's, to join in the scheme.

The ship will have balloons, sails, and pedal-driven steering.  A good part of the book deals with the tribulations of Purple in trying to create this work, beyond the technology of the local people.  He creates 'aircloth' (a thin, airtight cloth), a rubber-equivalent, and splits water into hydrogen and oxygen.  He is successful in building the ship.

But in so doing, he has changed the lives of the villagers forever.  Not only do they have these new technologies, but he has created problems with crime, intoxication, the ecology, and has altered the relationship between the sexes.  In addition, he has introduced money into the culture.

Purple, Shoogar, Lant, and Lant's adult two sons take off for the old village.  They get there, and Purple is able to summon the mother ship and depart.  There is a brief epilogue---after the return home, Lant notes that a new flying machine, much larger than the first, is to be built, thus continuing the industrial revolution started by Purple.

==Reception==
[[Lester del Rey]] gave the novel a mixed review, finding the comedy of the novel's first segment incongruous with the more seriously played finish, concluding "It's not at all a bad book -- but it isn't all a good one."&lt;ref&gt;"The Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], February 1972, p.157-58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Nicoll]] has described it as "dreadful [[:wikt:tosh|tosh]]",&lt;ref name=Nicoll-Gardner&gt;[http://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/soon-found-out-i-was-losing-my-mind Soon Found Out I Was Losing My Mind], by [[James Nicoll]], at James Nicoll Reviews; published April 7, 2017; retrieved May 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and noted its "astoundingly horrible treatment of women".&lt;ref name=Exhibit&gt;[http://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/exhibit-a Exhibit A], by [[James Nicoll]], at James Nicoll Reviews, published May 29, 2016; retrieved May 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Most of the names in the book are jokes primarily dealing with the Science Fiction universe. This is known as [[Tuckerization]]. [[David Langford]] says "Some sort of record for over-the-top Tuckerization was set by David Gerrold and Larry Niven in their very silly novel ''The Flying Sorcerers'' (1971)." &lt;ref name=Langford&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/sfx149.html|author=[[David Langford]]|accessdate=2007-05-16|title=Product Placement|work=Ansible (a column in SFX maxazine)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The LuLu Sessions''''' is a feature-length documentary film by S. Casper Wong about a prominent cancer researcher who is dying of breast cancer at the age of 43. Shot during the last 15&amp;nbsp;months of the life of Dr. Louise ("LuLu") Nutter, the film starts from the moment LuLu learns that her cancer is malignant and traces the emotional roller-coaster and the eye-opening process of dying. It explores human fears and presumptions, family ties and forgiveness, love and friendships, including that between Casper and LuLu, who was a professor of pharmacology at the [[University of Minnesota]]. The film has been shown in the U.S. and internationally at numerous film festivals and in conjunction with [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]] (October).

== Production ==

The LuLu Sessions started by accident. In 2000, Casper, then a MFA Directing student at [[Tisch School of the Arts|New York University's Tisch School of the Arts]], made an impromptu visit to LuLu's home in Minneapolis on her way to a wedding shoot. When an oncologist called to tell LuLu that she had breast cancer, Casper started to film.
Casper continued in follow-up trips to film LuLu until LuLu's death in 2001, including accompanying the researcher to her childhood farm in Vermont and as she lived her final days at the Vermont Respite House. Casper completed The LuLu Sessions in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LuLu Sessions Website|url=http://lulusessionsfilm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2014}}

In [[astrology]], a '''triplicity''' is a group of three signs belonging to the same [[classical element|element]].

==Trines==
Western astrology assumes that each sign of the same triplicity is 120 degrees apart, forming [[angle (astrology)|angle]]s to one another called [[Trine (astrological aspect)|trine]]s, which are each equivalent to the 360 degrees of the circle divided by three. Trines are considered to be very powerful and yet very comfortable, free-flowing connections.  This suggests that the signs in each element are very comfortable and compatible with one another and tend to have many of the same qualities in common.

==Method of organization==
In traditional astrology, the concept of triplicity embodied several factors concerning the four classical elements and were considered of particular importance. Besides the four classical elements, two other ways triplicity could be organized were by ''rulership'' type and by ''season''. However, neither are given much attention by modern astrologers. However, astrology by season, in particular has been adopted by astrologers who practice in modern [[Neopaganism]], [[Druidism]] and [[Wicca]].

===Classical elements===
[[File:Four elements representation.svg|right|Four Classical Elements; this classic diagram has two squares on top of each other, with the corners of one being the classical elements, and the corners of the other being the properties]]
In traditional [[Western astrology]] there are four triplicities based on the [[Astrology and the classical elements|classical elements]]. Beginning with the first sign Aries which is a Fire sign, the next in line Taurus is Earth, then to Gemini which is Air, and finally to Cancer which is Water -- in Western astrology the sequence is always Fire, Earth, Air, &amp; Water in that exact order.  This [[rotation|cycle]] continues on twice more and ends with the twelfth and final [[astrological sign]], Pisces. The elemental rulerships for the twelve astrological signs of the [[zodiac]] (according to Marcus Manilius) are summarized as follows:

* '''Fire''' — [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] - hot, dry
* '''Earth''' — [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] - cold, dry
* '''Air''' — [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] - hot, wet
* '''Water''' — [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] - cold, wet

===Rulerships===
In traditional astrology, each triplicity has several planetary ''rulers,'' which change with conditions of [[astrology of sect|sect]]--that is, whether the chart is a day chart or a night chart.

Triplicity rulerships are a very important [[essential dignity]]--one of the several factors used by traditional astrologers to weigh the strength, effectiveness and integrity of each planet in a chart.  Many [[Hellenistic]] astrologers (for example, [[Dorotheus of Sidon]]&lt;ref&gt; Dorotheus of Sidon, ''Carmen Astrologicum'', tr. by [[David Pingree]]. Originally published in Teubner series (Leipzig, 1976). Re-published by Ascella Publications (London, 1993). Re-published by Astrology Classics (Bel Air, MD), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;) considered triplicity rulership the most powerful and demonstrable of the several essential dignities of a planet.

Triplicity rulerships (using the "Dorothean system"&lt;ref&gt; ''Late Classical Astrology: Paulus Alexandrinus and Olympiodorus (with the Scholia of later Latin Commentators)''. [Translated by Dorian Gieseler Greenbaum.] Archive for the Retrieval of Historical Astrological Texts [ARHAT] {{cite web |url=http://www.robhand.com/availpub.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002064247/http://www.robhand.com/availpub.htm |archivedate=2007-10-02 |df= }}, 2001. P.6. (This is a translation of [[Paulus Alexandrinus|Paulus]]' ''Introduction'' along with the ''Commentary'' by [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] and related Byzantine scholia.)&lt;/ref&gt;) are as follows:

Pp. 79-83. &lt;/ref&gt; later modified the rulerships of Water triplicity, making '''Mars''' the ruler of the water triplicity for both day and night charts--and [[William Lilly]] concurred.)''&lt;ref&gt; William Lilly, ''Christian Astrology, Book 3: An Easie And Plaine Method Teaching How to Judge upon Nativities'', 1647. 2nd ed., 1659. Re-published by Astrology Classics (Bel Air, Maryland), 2004; by Ascella Publications, ed. D. Houlding, London, 2000; and [in facsimile of 1647 edition] by Regulus Press, London, 1985.  [orig.] P. 104.  &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/div style&gt;

One way in which triplicity rulerships were used by earlier astrologers was to divide a person's life into three periods:  early, middle, and late.  The condition of the triplicity ruler that is ''in sect'' in the chart is evaluated when considering the tenor of the early part of life; the ruler out of sect is examined for the middle of life; and the last third of life is evaluated by looking at the condition of the participating triplicity ruler.&lt;ref&gt; Crane, Joseph Crane, ''A Practical Guide to Traditional Astrology.''  ARHAT publications (Reston, VA).  1997, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-0-9662266-1-4}}.  Pp.6-10. &lt;/ref&gt;  "Participating" rulers were not used after the [[Hellenistic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval]] systems of astrology, each [[essential dignity]] was given a different weight.  [[domicile (astrology)|Domicile rulers]] were given 5 points of weight; [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]] rulers were given 4 points; and triplicity rulers were assigned 3 points of weight.  This gives some idea of how much power medieval astrologers accorded to each essential dignity.&lt;ref&gt; J. Lee Lehman, ''Essential Dignities.''  Whitford Press (West Chester, PA), 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-924608-03-2}}. Pp. 132-138. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Actual seasons===
Traditional astrology also organizes triplicities according to the actual season in which the zodiac rose.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} For example, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini appear during the spring season.

The triplicities of seasonal elements in ancient astrology were the following:

* Spring - Aries - Taurus - Gemini (March 20 and June 20)
* Summer - Cancer - Leo - Virgo (June 21 and September 21)
* Autumn - Libra - Scorpio - Sagittarius (September 22 and December 20)
* Winter - Capricorn - Aquarius - Pisces (December 21 and March 19)

In the [[southern hemisphere]], it is reversed.

* Spring - Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius (September 23 and December 21)
* Summer - Capricorn - Aquarius - Pisces (December 22 and March 20)
* Autumn - Aries - Taurus - Gemini (March 21 and June 21)
* Winter - Cancer - Leo - Virgo (June 22 and September 22)

==Early life and education==
William McNeill was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the son of theologian and educator [[John T. McNeill]], where he lived until age ten. The family then moved to [[Chicago]], while spending summers on a family farm on Canada's [[Prince Edward Island]].&lt;ref name = "uchicago"/&gt;

He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938 from the [[University of Chicago]], where he was editor of the student newspaper and "was inspired by the anthropologist [[Robert Redfield]]". He earned a Master of Arts degree in 1939, also at the University of Chicago, and wrote his thesis on [[Thucydides]] and [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He began working towards a Ph.D. in history at [[Cornell University]] under [[Carl L. Becker]]. In 1941, he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] and served in [[World War II]] in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1008/features/a-germ-of-an-idea.shtml |title=A germ of an idea |work=University of Chicago Magazine |date=|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he returned to Cornell for his Ph.D., which he earned in 1947.&lt;ref name="McNeill1979bio" /&gt;

==Career==
===Teaching===
In 1947, McNeill began teaching at the [[University of Chicago]], where he remained throughout his teaching career. He chaired the university's Department of History from 1961 to 1967, establishing its international reputation. During his tenure as chair, he recruited [[Henry Moore]] to cast a [[bronze]] statue called ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'' commemorating the University of Chicago as the place where the world's first manmade [[nuclear chain reaction]] took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Alice|title=Nuclear Energy, Henry Moore (1898-1986)|url=https://arts.uchicago.edu/public-art/by-work/nuclear-energy|website=UChicago Arts|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he was a visiting professor at [[Williams College]], where he taught a seminar on ''The Rise of the West''.&lt;ref name="25years"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=William H. McNeill|title=''The Rise of the West'' after Twenty-Five Years|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|date=Spring 1990|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–21|url= http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh011p001.pdf |accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that teaching "is the most wonderful way to learn things".&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; According to [[John W. Boyer]], the University of Chicago's Dean and a former student of McNeill's, McNeill was "one of the most important historians to teach at the University of Chicago in the twentieth century". He retired from teaching in 1987 and moved to [[Colebrook, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name = "uchicago"/&gt;

===Writing===
McNeill's best-known work is ''[[The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community]]'', which was published in 1963, relatively early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McNeill, William H.|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explored [[world history]] in terms of the effect different old world civilizations had on one another, and cites the deep influence of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on the rest of the world to argues that societal contact with foreign civilizations is the primary force in driving historical change. It had a major impact on historical theory by emphasizing cultural fusions, in contrast to Spengler's view of discrete, independent civilizations. [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] wrote a glowing review in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; McNeill's ''Rise of the West'' won the U.S. [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#History and Biography|in History and Biography]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="nba1964"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1964 |title=National Book Awards |date= 1964|website=[[National Book Foundation]]|accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 to 1980, he served as the editor of ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]''. His ''[[Plagues and Peoples]]'' (1976), was an important early contribution to the impact of disease on human history. In 1982, he published ''The Pursuit of Power'', which examined the role of military forces, [[military technology]], and [[Military history|war in human history]].&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Stanley Hoffmann|authorlink1=Stanley Hoffmann|title=Weapons to the End|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/28/books/weapons-to-the-end.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=28 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he published a biography of his mentor [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arnold J. Toynbee: A Life William H. McNeill, Author|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-19-505863-5|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=1 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "erasmus"/&gt;

In 1992 review, he disagreed with [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s argument in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' that the end of the [[Cold War]] meant that the American model of a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[liberal democracy]] had become the "final form of human government", as Fukuyama put it. In 1997 he disagreed with the central thesis of [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' for overlooking the importance of human "cultural autonomy" in determining human development versus Diamond's focus on environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jared Diamond|author2=William H.

R. McNeill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=McNeill, William H. &amp; McNeill, J.
