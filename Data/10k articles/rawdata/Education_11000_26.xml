'''''Absolutely American: Four Years at West Point''''' is a 2003 book by American author [[David Lipsky]].

==Summary==
The book recounts four years in the lives of students at the [[West Point|United States Military Academy]].

==Plot==
The book's genesis was a piece Lipsky wrote for [[Rolling Stone]]&lt;ref name="brooks2003"&gt;Brooks, David, "Huah!" ''The New York Times Book Review'', July 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;—the longest article published in that magazine since Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The book follows cadets in one West Point company, G-4, from their arrival to graduation. As ''[[Newsweek]]'' noted, composition of the book required "14,000 pages of interview transcripts, 60 notebooks and four pairs of boots."&lt;ref&gt;Gegax, Trent, "Getting The Point," ''Newsweek'', July 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, Lipsky was not initially well disposed toward the military: "He was, like most young people, entirely cut off from military life. The Army was the one profession his father absolutely refused to let him consider."&lt;ref name="brooks2003"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Absolutely American'' was enthusiastically received. In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', novelist and critic [[Lev Grossman]] wrote that it was "fascinating, funny, and tremendously well-written. Take a good look: this is the face America turns to most of the world, and until now it's one that most of us have never seen. A mesmerizing and powerfully human spectacle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005180,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=Life On The Long Gray Line |first=Lev |last=Grossman |publisher=Time |date=2003-07-06 |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newsweek]] called the book "addictive." In the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] called the book "wonderfully told," praising it as both "a superb description of modern military culture, and one of the most gripping accounts of university life I have read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/huah.html |title=Huah! |first=David |last=Brooks |publisher=New York Times Book Review |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was a ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller, and was selected as required reading for the incoming class at the [[University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "UNC committee picks book about West Point for reading program," February 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Film and television rights were acquired by [[Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;Sauriol, Patrick, "ABC Goes West Point," Variety, August 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
The book was an [[Amazon.com]] and ''Time'' magazine best book of the year.

'''The Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC)''' is an American national membership organization of approximately 70 major [[Academic health science centre|academic medical centers]] and health systems committed to quality [[patient care]], [[medical education]] and [[research]].  AIAMC members regard medical education and research as strategic assets in providing [[patient-centered care]]; operate independently of [[medical school]] ownership or governance while maintaining major medical school affiliations; care for a patient population that mirrors their local communities; and provide teaching and research that is innovative, applicable to practice and community responsive.

==History ==
The AIAMC was formed in 1989 to provide a forum for those institutions whose governance and academic leadership were distinct from that of their associated medical schools.  Since that time, the organization’s prestige and influence have grown progressively.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Meetings. [http://meetingsnet.com/medicalmeetings/news/3-ways-aiamc-changed-up-its-annual-conference-0419/.] "3 Ways AIAMC Changed Up Its Annual Conference."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered a national resource, with Alliance members participating in leadership and governance roles in key groups as the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]], [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|ACCME]], [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], [[American Hospital Association|AHA]], [[American Medical Association|AMA]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/history.php AIAMC History.] "AIAMC."&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Initiative to Improve Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education ==
===National Initiative I===
In early 2007, the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC) launched Improving Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education: A National Initiative of Independent Academic Medical Centers. Nineteen AIAMC-member institutions participated in this charter effort. The National Initiative (NI) featured five meetings over the course of 18 months which served as touchstones for ongoing quality improvement in AIAMC participating organizations. These meetings, as well as the monthly collaborative calls held in-between, provided structure, discussion and networking opportunities around specific quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;ACGME. [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928070626/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} ''ACGME Bulletin.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This 18-month "NI-I" was supported by a grant from the foundation of [[HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education]], an AIAMC member institution located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/ni-overview.php National Initiative Overview.] ''AIAMC.''&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Carl Patow, MD, Executive Director of HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education. 

As a result of these efforts, AIAMC has initial findings that demonstrate the efficacy of integrating GME into patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. These findings have been organized into a series of articles that were published in the December 2009 issue of Academic Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1749–56 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf686f |title=Integrating Quality Improvement and Residency Education: Insights from the AIAMC National Initiative About the Roles of the Designated Institutional Official and Program Director |year=2009 |last1=Jenson |first1=Hal B. |last2=Dorner |first2=Douglas |last3=Hinchey |first3=Kevin |last4=Ankel |first4=Felix |last5=Goldman |first5=Stuart |last6=Patow |first6=Carl |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=19940584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative II===
In 2009, AIAMC launched the second National Initiative and expanded participation to 35 AIAMC-member teaching hospitals from Seattle to Maine.  Each participating hospital developed a quality improvement team led by a resident or faculty member, and included their respective quality improvement leader. These teams met four times and participated in monthly conference calls over an 18-month period. Quality improvement projects focused on the following areas: Communication, Hand Offs, Infection Control, Readmissions and Transitions of Care. The objectives of this second phase were: 
* to align and integrate academic programs with quality initiatives to accelerate the efforts of quality and patient safety;
* assist residency program directors and house staff in the teaching, learning and assessment of the core competencies focused on Practice-Based Learning and Systems Based Practice;
* inform hospital and policy leaders about the contributions that can be made by faculty and house staff in expediting patient safety; and
* integrate house staff into multidisciplinary team-based safety initiatives as a national priority.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Harris. [https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb11/174758/residents_quality_improvement.html] "Residents Help Drive Quality Improvement". 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Initiative III launched in the fall of 2011, and will directly address the ACGME Common Program Requirements for Professionalism, Personal Responsibility and Patient Safety by educating program directors, faculty members and residents in a train-the-trainer approach. The structure and content of NI III will also meet directives for Teamwork by providing training in effective communication as part of inter-professional teams. The structure of the National Initiative III will resemble the previous two initiatives, with quarterly meetings for quality improvement didactics and leadership training, conference calls to assess progress, and local hospital team initiatives to improve patient care.

===National Initiative IV===
The fourth National Initiative recognized the importance of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education initiative entitled the "Clinical Learning Environment Review".  Teams from over 35 teaching hospitals across the United States participated in a two year learning collaborative to improve performance in six focus areas: patient safety, quality imrpvoement, transitions of care, supervision, fatigue management and professionalism. 

===National Initiative V===
National Initiative V began in 2015, and focused on the role of teaching hospitals' response to health care disparities. Findings from the National Initiatives are published in the Oschner Journal.

The '''Clore Social Leadership Programme (Clore Social)''' was established in 2008 to develop and strengthen leadership skills and capacity across the social sector. Clore Social was initiated by the [[Clore Duffield Foundation]] and inspired by its sister programme, the Clore Leadership Programme for the creative and cultural sectors. Its founding director was [[Mary Marsh|Dame Mary Marsh]].

Clore Social identifies, connects and develops leaders through its fully funded fellowship programme and works with people, partners and funders across all sectors to offer a holistic approach to developing leaders for social impact. So far 101 fellows have joined its network. It is run by a small staff team from its office in Kings Cross, London.

'''Collegiate a cappella''' (or '''college a cappella''') ensembles are college-affiliated [[singing]] groups, primarily in the [[United States]] and, increasingly, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], that perform entirely without [[musical instruments]]. The groups are typically composed of, operated by, and directed by students. In the context of collegiate a cappella, the term ''a cappella'' typically also refers to the [[music genre]] performed by [[pop music|pop-centric]] student singing groups. Consequently, an ensemble that sings unaccompanied classical music may not be considered an a cappella group, even though technically it is performing ''a cappella''.

According to the nonfiction book ''Pitch Perfect'', a cappella music is one of the oldest forms of music in existence, "the kind made without any accompaniment at all," and descended from the tradition of Gregorian chant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rapkin, Mickey. "Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory"- Gotham Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A cappella music as a form joined this early form with a later Puritan style, known as shape-note singing, which further extended into the American Gospel tradition. Further permutations leaked into the American pop landscape.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Today, by some accounts, there exist as many as “twelve hundred collegiate a cappella groups in the United States alone.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==History==
It is not known exactly when or where collegiate [[a cappella]] began. The RPI Glee Club of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], established in 1873, was one of the earliest known collegiate a cappella groups.&lt;ref name=RPI&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The longest continuously-operating group is thought to be [[The Whiffenpoofs]] of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://www.singers.com/collegiate/whiffenpoofs.html
 | title = The Yale Whiffenpoofs
 | accessdate = 2007-09-14
 | publisher = United Singers International}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which was formed in 1909 to create a musical group with a more "modern" sound than that of the Yale Glee Club, and named for the lyrics to ''Little Nemo'', a popular Broadway song at the time.&lt;ref name="An Authentic Account of the Founding of the Whiffenpoofs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Rev. James|title=An Authentic Account of the Founding of the Whiffenpoofs|url=http://www.whiffenpoofs.com/storage/Whiffenpoofs_History.pdf|publisher=The Whiffenpoofs of Yale|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such names, normally intended for comedic effect, have come to define in some part the irreverent attitude found in modern collegiate a cappella. The first a cappella groups at other American [[Ivy League]] Universities include the [[Princeton Nassoons]] (c.1941), the [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] Aires (1946), the Harvard [[Krokodiloes]] (1946), Cayuga's Waiters of Cornell University (1949) and the [[Jabberwocks]] of [[Brown University]] (1949).

In recent years, online a cappella communities have burgeoned, allowing for greater discourse involving the shaping of modern a cappella music, including stylistic trends. Among the most prominent online a cappella presences are The A Cappella Blog, Varsity Vocals, and CASA (The Contemporary A Cappella Society). According to The A Cappella Blog’s information section, “The A Cappella Blog was founded in January 2007. Since that time, the site has reviewed over 40 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella competitions. In addition, the site has featured interviews with over 50 a cappella groups and major figures in the a cappella community, including Ben Folds, Jerry Lawson, and Straight No Chaser. The A Cappella Blog has also published guest posts by a cappella luminaries such as Mickey Rapkin, Deke Sharon, Amanda Newman and Bill Hare.”&lt;ref name="About The A Cappella Blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Mike|title=About The A Cappella Blog|url=http://acappellablog.com/about|publisher=The A Cappella Blog|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Varsity Vocals compose an international a cappella organization based around their two main competitions, the ICCAs (International Competition of Collegiate A Cappella) and the ICHSA (International Competition of High School A Cappella). According to their website, “owned and operated by Varsity Vocals, the competitions receive applications each fall. For groups accepted to the tournament, ICCA shows are held in three rounds – Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals. Roughly, Quarterfinals are held in January and February, Semifinals in March, and Finals in April in New York City. ICHSA shows are held in Semifinal and Final rounds throughout the spring, culminating with Finals in April in New York City.” &lt;ref name="FAQ Varsity Vocals"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ Varsity Vocals|url=http://varsityvocals.com/about/faq/|publisher=Varsity Vocals|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern growth===
College a cappella has grown rapidly since 1980. This growth was fueled in part by stylistic changes that had widespread appeal, and in part by the founding in 1991 of [[The Contemporary A Cappella Society]] (CASA) by [[Deke Sharon]] and Rex Solomon, which enabled interaction and collaboration of a cappella groups across the United States for the first time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Deke Sharon]], a member of the Tufts a cappella group The Beelzebubs, co-created CASA after two years spent tenured as the historic group’s musical director. Deke Sharon sought to bring a cappella into the musical mainstream, popularizing a more pop format for the music, as well as helping to contribute to a standardization of a cappella performance through the founding of CASA.&lt;ref name="Board of Directors and Program Managers CASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors and Program Managers CASA|url=https://www.casa.org/boardmembers|publisher=CASA|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of CASA’s core values in its promotion of the a cappella community is that of innovation, stating “We develop new methods for singers, groups, fans, and educators to sing, learn, connect, and interact with one another.”&lt;ref name="Mission, Vision, &amp; Core Values CASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission, Vision, &amp; Core Values CASA|url=https://www.casa.org/mission|publisher=CASA|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, marking a shift away from the more traditional sounds of jazz or classical ensembles and [[glee clubs]] to [[contemporary a cappella]], with groups focusing on modern pop music, complete with complex textures and a driving beat (see [[vocal percussion]]). Today, even some glee clubs have a largely pop-music repertoire supplemented only in small part by the traditional genres.

Collegiate A Cappella is by far most common in the United States from which it originated; however in recent decades the trend has spread beyond to Universities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in Europe as well as up North into Canada and across the Pacific into Australia, New Zealand and a few nations in Asia.

==Performance styles==
Collegiate a cappella spans many music genres and styles including alternative and hard rock, comedy, Jewish (including mostly Yiddish or Hebrew songs), Christian (including Christian pop and rearranged hymns), South Asian fusion (mainly composed of youth of South Asian origin or heritage), jazz-influenced pop, fusion, barbershop, Rhythm and Blues, madrigals, and jazz. Differences in musical styles and individual group preferences result in a great diversity of music arrangements and performances.

Live performances of collegiate a cappella may incorporate choreographed movements.

===Arch sing===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PrincetonArchSingBlair.jpg|thumb|right|An arch sing at Princeton University's Blair Arch.]] --&gt;
An "arch sing" is a casual, public performance, often held in an [[arch]]way for reasons of [[acoustics]] and shelter from the weather. Typically, one or more a cappella groups will perform for a small audience, either as a concert or to promote upcoming concerts. The term is also sometimes used to describe similar casual, outdoor performances not held under arches.

===Live techniques===
In recent years, with the advent of more advanced audio equipment and the ability of a cappella groups to attract income with live performances for pay, there has been increased exploration into the importance of microphones. Whereas groups at schools with older campuses find themselves with arches and naturally acoustically accentuated spaces in which to perform, many groups find themselves lacking spaces such as these. As has been documented and encouraged by various a cappella organizations, such as CASA, Varsity Vocals, and The A Cappella Blog, individual microphone use for each member of an ensemble has risen in popularity, allowing for, as Mike Chin of the A Cappella Blog states, a “big,” “clear,” “crisp” sound in an otherwise acoustically dull performance space.&lt;ref name="Measure for Measure: Should Everyone Get a Mic?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Mike|title=Measure for Measure: Should Everyone Get a Mic?|url=http://acappellablog.com/mform/measure-measure-should-everyone-get-mic|publisher=The A Cappella Blog|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group structure and culture==
Most collegiate a cappella groups, whether all-male, all-female, or mixed, share similar traits. The groups often benefit from the talent of non-music majors who have significant experience with music, choral singing, or both. Participation in such groups provides both a social and creative outlet for students who are pursuing other academic fields. Groups are generally self-sustaining and often entirely run by students. Some groups receive financial support from their educational institution while others are entirely self-supporting.
[[Image:MadHatters Fall 2013.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[UW MadHatters|The MadHatters]], from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have a 16-member group.]]

Unlike professional groups, which typically have four to seven members, collegiate groups typically perform with eight to sixteen members, with full group rosters measuring up to 30 members in some cases. This large roster size is often driven by necessity, as college groups tend to see high turnover due to graduation and changing student commitments. A large member count enables a group to maintain continuity over time and it also affects the group's aural aesthetic. For example, a large group may be able to perform arrangements that have more than a dozen separate parts, an impossible feat for smaller groups.

Some groups record albums of their music, typically at intervals of two or three years. The quality of such albums has recently improved markedly due to an increased focus on multi-track recording and the emergence of professional a cappella production specialists. Achievements in collegiate a cappella recording are recognized by awards programs (e.g., the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards, awarded by [[Contemporary A Cappella Society|CASA]]) and compilation albums, such as the long-running Best of College A Cappella series.

Many college groups compete in annual competitions organized by the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] (ICCA), which conducts various regional competitions, with winners of regional competitions advancing to a national competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17241">'''Educational inequalities in South Sudan''' can be attributed to a number of factors. The lack of funds and infrastructure, along with a poor and mostly illiterate population makes establishing an effective [[education]] system challenging. There are also certain traditional cultural ideas about women which make it more difficult for girls to get an education than their male counterparts.

==History of education in South Sudan==
As a [[United Kingdom|British]] colony from 1899 to 1956, there was not much effort on the part of the [[Empire|imperial]] power to establish schools. [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] provided limited schooling. However, these schools were taught in the [[vernacular]] which did not help children become permanently [[literate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akrawi|first=Matta|title=Educational Planning in a Developing Country: the Sudan|journal=International Review of Education|year=1960|volume=6|issue=3|pages=261, 273|doi=10.1007/bf01416699}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sudan's [[independence]] in 1956, the ineffective church-run schools were shut down in a wave of [[Islamisation]]. New [[nationalized]] schools were created, and schools used [[Arabic]] instead of local languages. The new schools were also inaccessible to most of the population. The educational opportunities became even more dismal once the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-and-off civil warfare devastated educational prospects for generations of Sudanese, due to high costs, lack of buildings, and [[Security|insecurity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] of 2005 parents are pushing for their children to attend school. While facilities are still widely lacking, 500 new schools have been built.{{when|date=April 2013}} These new structures serve the 1.4 million children who are now{{when|date=April 2013}} attending [[primary school]], which is a two-fold increase from five years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Gordon|author2=Kevin Watkins|title=Education in South Sudan: investing in a better future|journal=Gordon and Sarah Brown Education for All Campaign|year=2012|pages=15, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[South Sudan]]'s official independence in 2011 left Africa's newest country without a basic infrastructure in place, with some of the worst [[human development (humanity)|human development]] indicators in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sudan: Education|url=http://www.usaid.gov/south-sudan/education|publisher=USAID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Many issues prevent the educational infrastructure in South Sudan from reaching its full potential, including poverty, governmental failures, ongoing [[violence]], poor health of its citizens, and inaccessibility to schools that are overcrowded, underfunded, and operated by unqualified teachers. South Sudan has the worst [[gender equality]] in education in the world.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Gordon|author2=Kevin Watkins|title=Education in South Sudan: investing in a better future|journal=Gordon and Sarah Brown Education for All Campaign|year=2012|pages=8,16,18–24,26,31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General challenges===
Poverty and lack of government funds greatly limits the extent to which [[education]] can be improved. According to the [[World Bank]], more than half of the South Sudanese people live below the [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name="South Sudan Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sudan Overview|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southsudan/overview|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[government of South Sudan]] lacks the money and institutional framework to offer much help.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|author=UNESCO|title=Building a better future: Education for  an independent South Sudan|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report|date=June 2011|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Sudan is rich in [[natural resources]] with oil as their main [[export]], representing 98% of government [[revenue]]. However, recently [[oil exports]] have been completely cut off, due to a high [[tax]] which [[Sudan]] sought to levy upon oil flowing through their pipelines. It is predicted that the educational budget could be decreased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ministry of General Education and Instruction|title=General Education Strategic Plan 2012-2017|year=2012|page=13|url=http://www.globalpartnership.org/media/docs/countries/SouthSudan/Education_Plan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability of the government to fund schools leads to high education costs that most families cannot afford. 
An additional challenge faced by students in certain [[regions]] like [[Warrap, South Sudan|Warrap]] and [[Upper Nile (state)|Upper Nile]] is the continual fighting between different factions.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; [[Armed conflict|Conflict]] displaces citizens and unhinges government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=UNESCO|title=Building a better future: Education for  an independent South Sudan|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report|date=June 2011|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, there were 300,000 such [[refugees]] in South Sudan.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; These [[regions]] with ongoing violence are bound to suffer more later because, as [[Jeffrey Sachs]] has stated, conflict disallows children from attending school and building the skills needed to be a productive society member.
Conversely, many refugees from the civil war are returning in droves to South Sudan. Only established in 2011, South Sudan's infrastructure is not up to par yet. However the repatriates put an even greater strain on the slim resources.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; Many of these refugees had received better education during their time in refugee camps in places like [[Kenya]]. The result is that this [[:wikt:influx|influx]] of more educated persons is increasing the overall net [[literacy]] rates of South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deng|first=Luka Biong|title=Education in Southern Sudan: War, status, and challenges of achieving Education for All Goals|journal=Respect, Sudanese Journal for Human Rights' Culture and Issues of Cultural Diversity|date=November 2006|issue=4|page=11|url=http://w.sudan-forall.org/sections/ihtiram/pages/ihtiram_issue4/luka_biong_deng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Challenges faced in the classrooms include language disparities, un-unified [[curriculum]], teacher absenteeism, teachers who are untrained, and overcrowded classrooms. South Sudan had decided to use [[English language|English]] as the preferred language in schools. Currently teachers lack English educational material or the capability to teach in that language. There is presently no unified standard of curriculum for the whole country. This leads to differences in outcome for the students. Teacher absenteeism has also been shown to be an issue where in certain areas of the country, very little time is actually spent learning in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; Even when teachers are present, there is a good chance that the teacher is untrained. Estimates show that as many as 7,500 teachers are not qualified to teach primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=UNESCO|title=Building a better future: Education for  an independent South Sudan|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report|date=June 2011|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overcrowding is yet another problem in classrooms, and in 2009, it was judged that there were on average 129 students per classroom.&lt;ref name="South Sudan Overview"/&gt;

===Additional challenges for girls===
While all of the above described issues apply generally to students in South Sudan, certain cultural practices add greater difficulty for girls seeking education at any level. South Sudan currently has one of the lowest globally ranked levels of [[gender equality]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=UNESCO|title=Building a better future: Education for  an independent South Sudan|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report|date=June 2011|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the biggest reasons for girls dropping out of school include early marriage and early [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; The [[dowry]] associated with marriage can be a lucrative incentive for parents to marry their daughters off at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudan: Improvements in Education—but mainly for the boys|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/85255/SUDAN-Improvements-in-education-but-mainly-for-the-boys|publisher=IRIN: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is especially common in [[rural]] areas.&lt;ref name="Faye 2010 29"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prioritization of boys' education over girls' leads to girls being removed from school earlier. If a family cannot afford to send all of their children to school, the interests of the boys' education will be favored.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; Further, girls' domestic responsibilities within the household increase with age, which leaves less time for girls to attend school and to study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can be a deterrent for parents considering sending their daughters to school in South Sudan. If the distance to school is large, fear of attacks by men while on the way to or from school is a huge concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirk|first=Jackie|title=Gender, education, and peace in southern Sudan|journal=Forced Migration Review|date=November 2005|volume=24|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of facilities also prevents girls from attending school. Most schools do not have separate [[latrines]] for girls, and those without access to sanitary napkins are more likely to not attend school while menstruating.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt;

With a 16% female [[literacy]] rate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook: South Sudan|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/od.html|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Sudan ranks lowest in the world. Two-thirds of the approximately two million illiterate South Sudanese are women and a girl is more likely to die in [[pregnancy]] or [[childbirth]] than to [[graduation|graduate]] from primary school.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; In 2005, the female:male enrollment rate in primary school was 35:100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional levels of education available to women==

===Primary and secondary schools===
Girls are more likely to be enrolled later and removed from primary school earlier than their male student counterparts. [[Primary schools]] have a male graduation rate of about 16%, while girls' graduation rates lag behind at 9%.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; For the reasons discussed above, girls are at a clear disadvantage in education. Completing [[secondary school]] has been found to deter early marriage and provide opportunity for girls by producing [[skilled workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Tim|title=Education Crisis in south Sudan|journal=Forced Migration Review|date=November 2005|volume=24|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
During the civil war, the four major universities in South Sudan relocated to [[Khartoum]]. Since independence, the universities have been slowly moving back to the region. The process is hindered by the cost of rebuilding, and many faculty members are unwilling to move to South Sudan, where the cost of living is significantly higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sawahel|first=Wagdy|title=Ambitious higher education reform plans for Africa’s newest nation|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120329103110290|publisher=University World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other challenges include the increasing enrollment rates, a 50% increase to 6,000 at the [[University of Juba]] from the '08/'09 school year to the '09/'10 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universities are not yet equipped with the facilities to operate with so many students. Available facilities for on-campus housing are insubstantial and this can be a deterrent to parents sending daughters to receive a university education. Safety and protection worries are still an issue at this level of education for women. The complete lack of latrines for women on campus can be another barrier to high education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faye|first=Reidun|title=Barriers to higher education for women in Southern Sudan|journal=Bergen University College Journal|year=2010|volume=1|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women have found that having [[higher education]] is also an obstacle to their [[marriage]] prospects. Some [[traditional values|traditionalists]] believe that women should not be educated, and others are dissuaded by the assumed increase in [[dowry]] price that would come with a more educated woman.&lt;ref name="Faye 2010 29"/&gt;

==International and NGO involvement==
International involvement in South Sudan's education reform has been vast, including various [[United Nations]] agencies, [[NGOs]], and individual [[Western world|Western]] countries. While these efforts have been met with mild successes like the increase in enrollment, a much greater commitment will be required to bring South Sudan up to international standards.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; Some of the major donors include the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[European Union]], and [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; These donors typically allocate their money to building classrooms, sending textbooks, and training teachers in areas affected by conflict.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; Teacher training institutions are particularly effective long-term, because they can affect exponential change. One trained teacher can make a difference to a multitude of students. While these modest improvements are significant, international aid has been criticized for being too little, and too slow to take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=UNESCO|title=Building a better future: Education for  an independent South Sudan|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report|date=June 2011|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future development plans===
The [[Millennium Development Goals]] are a cornerstone to South Sudan's future plans for education. The plan is to be within reach of the goals by 2015. The [[Constitution of South Sudan]] has a provision for "free and compulsory education at the primary level."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; South Sudan also seeks to build more [[secondary schools]], increase access to education for adults and adolescents, improve the quality of education, and close the [[Sex ratio|gender gap]] in education through [[scholarships]] for girls.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt; In April 2012, South Sudan became a member of the [[World Bank]] after several years in the application process. The new membership status allowed for the creation of the South Sudan Transition Fund, amounting to 75 million (USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Bank Group Reiterates its Commitment to South Sudan’s Development as the Country Becomes the Bank’s Newest Member|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/04/18/world-bank-reiterates-commitment-to-south-sudans-development-as-the-country-becomes-the-banks-newest-member|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current plans by major donors include:
* [[United States]]: 30 million (USD) program to build three teacher training facilities
* [[United Kingdom]]: South Sudan Education Programmes plans for the building of 32 primary and 4 secondary schools, the delivery of millions of [[textbooks]], and to target impediments to girls' [[education]]
* [[European Union]]: plans for 100 new schools to be built

The biggest problem facing these [[international aid]] efforts is underfunding. There is a large gap between what South Sudan will require to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]] by 2015 and the amount of international aid received by South Sudan. This gap amounts to about 400 million (USD) annually, most of which would be used to build schools, and post-2015 this cost would greatly decrease.&lt;ref name="Brown, Gordon." /&gt;

'''Emory Entrepreneurship &amp; Venture Management''' (EEVM) is a student-run organization dedicated to encouraging [[entrepreneurship]] and business development in the [[Atlanta, Georgia]] area.  EEVM was founded in 2012 by [[Emory University]] undergraduates. Today, EEVM members include Emory [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], professional students, and faculty, as well as several hundred Emory alumni around the world.

== HackATL ==
HackATL is EEVM's annual three-day hackathon competition.  The event is open to all college students as well as working professionals. The inaugural HackATL event was held at the Goizueta Business School and had over 400 participants from 80 different universities.

== StartupCrunch ==
StartupCrunch is a monthly dinner event open to the Atlanta community focused on fostering the entrepreneurship community. The event has invited speakers from around the United States as well as provided an opportunity for local startups to pitch and receive advice.

== Emory Entrepreneurial Excellerator ==
Founded in 2014 by Nihar Parikh, the Emory Entrepreneurial Excellerator is designed to coax talent and results out of Emory’s entrepreneurial community. The program takes Emory-founded startups from conception to the initial pitch phase, and culminates with the companies in the program pitching to Atlanta venture capital firms. The program will help Emory and The Goizueta Business School establish themselves as a force in the South’s vibrant startup community.

The pre-accelerator has three components to it: Work sessions, a speaking series and a mentoring program.

=== Work Sessions ===
A primary component of the program is ensuring the startups maintain a consistent work schedule so they can accomplish their goals in a timely fashion. Work sessions will feature resources including computer lab type rooms work rooms, either in the library or the business school, resource materials compiled by EEVM only available during work sessions, and an EEVM mentor present to mediate the meeting as well as offer basic suggestions. Teams will be required to submit deliverables on specific topics after each work sessions. 

=== Speaker Series ===
EEVM will bring in speakers twice a month, prioritizing startup veterans or members of other incubators like Hypepotamus, ATDC, Tech Village, etc. Topics will focus on early stage startup development, including but not limited to determining market potential, assigning roles, and incorporating and other legal advice. 

=== Mentor Open Hours ===
Goizueta professors and faculty members will be available for limited periods every week for guidance. Startups can use these resources to test ideas on more experienced individuals as well as ask for guidance on specific technical topics, such as market research techniques and financial modeling. To best utilize mentor schedules, startups must ask for an appointment with the mentor and come prepared with a problem statement.

The '''European Joint Master degree in Economics''' provides a rigorous education in fundamental quantitative tools by combining economic theory with related quantitative disciplines such as [[Econometrics]], [[Finance]], [[Actuarial Science]], [[Probability]], [[Statistics]], Mathematical Modeling, [[Computation]] and [[Simulation]], [[Experimental Design]], and [[Political Science]], managed by consortia of higher education institutions from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index_en.php|title=The Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency of the European Commission - EACEA|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European Joint Master degree in Economics was the Erasmus Mundus [[QEM]] - Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://erasmusmundus-qem.univ-paris1.fr/|title=Master QEM Erasmus Mundus: Master Economics QEM Erasmus Mundus France|author=Master QEM Erasmus Mundus - Pantheon Sorbonne university|work=univ-paris1.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was  approved by the European Union in 2006 as international graduate degree program  designed by a Consortium of European Universities. The number of European universities or institutions making up a consortia varies from the degree awarding program. The nature of the degree differs from other [[master's degree]] in Economics or finance.  Compared to the [[Master of Finance]] or [[Master of Economics]], this European degree is joint and prepares graduate for a wide range of careers which utilize their competency in economics, including [[economic theory]], [[macroeconomics]] and financial forecasting, financial engineering and risk management, quantitative asset management, computational economics, quantitative trading, and applied and theoretical research. Unlike programs which are substantially quantitative, this degree provide a merge of both theory and empirics useful in practice.

Closely related degrees include the "Master of Quantitative Finance and Economics" and "Master of Finance and Economics".

Often, the degree prepares graduates for  both research orientation for further studies and in the job market for positions in government organizations, private companies or financial institutions. This joint degree is officially recognized as a master degree in each university and each country with the same rights and duties with the national degree.

The degree is gaining in recognition as graduate placements have increased over the past few years.

== Structure ==
European Joint Master degree in Economics is usually two years in duration, and typically include a [[thesis]], an [[internship]] or [[research]] component. The programs require a [[bachelor's degree]] or an equivalent qualification at the same level, i.e. 180 ECTS credits in the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] prior to admission.
A typical requirement is exposure to economics, mathematics, applied mathematics, quantitative economics or finance. Like many master programs in Economics or finance, a review of [[statistics]], [[probability]] theory, [[linear algebra]] and [[calculus]] are provided as a preliminary course. The curriculum is distributed between theory, applications, and simulations, with the emphasis on each differing by university in the [[consortium]]. The degree programs are usually funded by the [[Erasmus Mundus]] Scholarship.

'''Fred Iltis''' ([[Brno]], [[Czechoslovakia]], April 20, 1923 – [[San Jose, California]], December 11, 2008) was an American [[entomology|entomologist]]. His research focused on the biosystematics and life cycle of [[mosquito]]es.

==Life and work==
He was born '''Wilfred Gregor Iltis''' to Anni (née Liebscher) and [[Hugo Iltis]], a botanist and geneticist who was a life sciences teacher at the German-language [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of [[Brno#20th century and Greater Brno|Brünn (Brno)]]. His father was also the first biographer of [[Gregor Mendel]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Turda and P.J. Weindling, eds.

Budapest: Central European University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and a vocal opponent of [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi "racial science"]]. In the fall of 1938, the Iltis family was granted visas to enter the United States thanks to the intercession of the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]], along with affidavits of endorsement from [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Franz Boas]]. In January 1939, when [[Hitler]]'s military was preparing the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia#Second Republic (October 1938 to March 1939)|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], fifteen-year-old Wilfred escaped with his mother and his younger brother [[Hugh Iltis|Hugh]] on a harrowing train ride that traversed [[Nazi Germany]] to France. During a midnight stop at the [[Stuttgart]] station, [[Gestapo]] officers combed the train, removing ten passengers; the Iltises survived because the boys pretended to be asleep while their mother pretended to be the wife of a French diplomat. In [[Cherbourg]], they were joined by Hugo Iltis and boarded the passenger ship [[RMS Aquitania]] for the Atlantic crossing. They settled in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where the senior Hugo Iltis was soon appointed to a professorship in biology at [[Mary Washington University|Mary Washington College]].

Iltis began his undergraduate studies in 1941 at [[George Washington University]] but after one semester transferred to [[Western Kentucky State Teachers College]], pursuing a major in agriculture.&lt;ref name = autogenerated3&gt;http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlsc_ua_records/3851/&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Fred Iltis served in the Army in the South Pacific. In 1948, he married Julia Patricia Zrinyi (Judy) (1926-2004), a graphic artist and scientific illustrator.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He went on to earn a Ph.D. in [[entomology]] at [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/news/bugbytesspring09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610052203/http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/news/bugbytesspring09.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iltis worked briefly at Harvard in 1967-1968 as a research fellow in Tropical Public Health for the Harvard School of Public Health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-346295035/harvard-school-of-public-health-cambridge-mass-annual-catalog-vol&lt;/ref&gt; After settling in [[San Jose, California]], in the 1960s, Iltis taught in the Biology Department at [[San José State University]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Iltis was a skilled photographer. He developed and printed photos in a basement darkroom, using the slow and complicated archival process system yielding prints that last many decades. In his journeys south of the border (where he met the Mexican photographer [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]]), Iltis portrayed the life of the Mexican Indians, particularly in [[Michoacán]]. Many photos of his vast archive document the [[Civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, student protests against the [[Vietnam War]], the struggle of the Chicano agricultural workers led by [[César Chávez]] and [[Dolores Huerta]], as well as the strikes and boycott of American fruit companies. He met and befriended the renowned photojournalists [[Hansel Mieth]] and [[Otto Hagel]], who had documented the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. From them Iltis learned that "a photo can express one’s ideas and ideals far better than a thousand words".

The '''Fronimo Dialogo di Vincentio Galilei''' ([[Vincenzo Galilei]]) is an instructional book on playing, composing and intabulating vocal music for the [[lute]].

The first edition was printed by [[Girolamo Scotto]] in [[Venice]] with the full title ''FRONIMO DIALOGO / DI VINCENTIO GALILEI FIORENTINO, / NEL QUALE SI CONTENGONO LE VERE, / et necessarie regole del Intavolare la Musica nel Liuto''. While the title page bears the date 1568, the final page confusingly bears the date 1569. Apparently, although the manuscript was completed by Galilei in the Autumn of 1568, the official letter of privilege allowing the publication of the book was received only in December, and the printing actually took place in 1569. In addition, still in 1569, Girolamo Scotto broke the book into two parts, selling a collection of 30 musical selections from near the end of the book and the Dialogo separately. A second edition of the complete Dialogo, with significant revisions, was printed in 1584 by the “heir of Girolamo Scotto,” under the title ''FRONIMO / DIALOGO / DI VINCENTIO GALILEI / NOBILE FIORENTINO, / SOPRA L'ARTE DEL BENE INTAVOLARE, / ET RETTAMENTE SONARE LA MUSICA / Negli strumenti artificiali si di corde come di fiato, &amp; in particulare nel Liuto''.

Unlike other lute instruction manuals of the 16th century, each of the editions of Fronimo contains quite a large amount of music. Galilei provided examples in order to illustrate how he believed compositions should be structured and how intabulations should be made from existing compositions. The examples range from a few notes or measures in length up to complete compositions in either mensural notation or lute tablature. In the 1584 edition, for example, there are 48 pieces in tablature form sprinkled throughout the text (including a set of 24 ricercars in all the possible tonalities) and a collection of 60 more pieces placed all together at the end. The 1568 edition includes a total of 96 complete pieces, many of which are different from those chosen for the 1584 edition.

'''Fürsteneck Castle''' ({{lang-de|Burg Fürsteneck}}) is a [[castle]], situated in central [[Germany]] between [[Fulda]] and [[Bad Hersfeld]]. It belongs to the commune of [[Eiterfeld]]. The castle is at an elevation of 406 metres on a small [[plateau]].

==History==
Fürsteneck Castle belonged to the [[monastery]] of Fulda. The first written mention of it dates to 1309, but it might have been built one or two hundred years before. After [[secularization]] in 1802, it became the property of the German state of [[Hesse]].

==Akademie Burg Fürsteneck==
Since 1952 the castle has been used as an [[academy]] for [[vocational education|vocational]] and cultural [[continuing education]]. It was rebuilt by the architect [[Otto Bartning]]. Each year about 4,000 participants take part in one of nearly 200 courses, with 15,000 overnight stays.

'''Games for Good''' is a [[non-profit]] charitable organization which raises funds and products from within the entertainment industry and donates them to child-centric partners. Started in 1998 by a group of volunteers, GfG was led by industry veteran Lynne Killey.&lt;ref name="AVS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avsim.com/press/index.shtml |title=Games for Good Press Release |work=AVSIM |date=April 6, 2000 |accessdate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152415/http://www.avsim.com/press/index.shtml |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It raises money and requests that game publishers donate video and computer games to them for re-distribution to children's charities. It hosts dinners, silent auctions and parties.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.videogames.yahoo.com/news-1094121 |title=Games For Good Trying For $250,000 |work=Yahoo Games: News |author=[[IGN]] |date=April 6, 2000 |accessdate=13 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In just a few years, the small undertaking had grown too large for a volunteer staff to handle and the effort was left dormant. In the following years several other game industry charities took up the effort of supporting individual children's charities in meaningful and productive ways, but none utilizing the repository model of supporting other charities.

The IEMA ([[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association]]), the U.S. trade association which represents the game industry's leading retailers, began receiving in three finished copies of each and every computer game manufactured due to a royalty-free licensing agreement that the association has with publishers. That agreement standardized the PC game box - reducing it from the oversized software standard, down to the now double-thick DVD size that we're all used to - and also standardized the PC CD and PC DVD icons (the small black and white logos that indicate the platform the game is created for). The IEMA has been donating the games to children's hospitals and local area charities and schools when long-time friends Lynne Killey (the founder of GfG) and [[Hal Halpin]] (the president of the IEMA) decided to restart the organizations.

Now re-launched, Games for Good is being run by the IEMA's staff. In addition to asking game publishers and developers to provide the three finished copies of each PC game they make, GfG is also asking for them to commit to providing three finished copies of all games they create on all platforms AND to help them with sponsorship funds.

An '''in-service program''' is a professional training or staff development effort, where professionals are trained and discuss their work with others in their peer group.

It is a key component of [[continuing medical education]] for [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, and other medical professionals. It is also common among public servants including educators&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsaw.com/news/education/headlines/104310863.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and public safety officials.

In-service program also refers to some programs offered to enlisted members of the [[military]] while they are in service.

In-service programs also refers to [[educator]]s, where they discuss methods and cases and work loads.

[[File:International Image Interoperability Framework logo.png|thumb|right|IIIF logo]]

The '''International Image Interoperability Framework''' (IIIF) defines several [[Application_programming_interface|application programming interfaces]] that provide a standardised method of describing and delivering images over the web, as well as "presentation based metadata"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiif.io/technical-details/|title=Technical Details — IIIF - International Image Interoperability Framework|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (that is, structural metadata) about structured sequences of images.  If institutions holding artworks, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials provide IIIF endpoints for their content, any IIIF-compliant viewer or application can consume and display both the images and their structural and presentation metadata.  

There are many digitisation programmes that have resulted in a particular collection’s content exposed on the web in a particular viewer application,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/sechard/512digms.htm|title=Medieval Manuscripts on the Web (digitized manuscripts)|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these various collections have not typically been interoperable with one another,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diglib.org/forums/2012forum/transcending-silos-leveraging-linked-data-and-open-image-apis-for-collaborative-access-to-digital-facsimiles/ Presentation on "Transcending Silos" at 2012 Digital Library Federation Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; and end users or institutions cannot substitute a viewer of their choice to consume the digitised material. The IIIF aims to cultivate shared technologies for both client and server to enable interoperability across repositories, and to foster a market in compatible servers and viewing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiif.io/about.html|title=Redirecting…|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image API==
{{quote|The IIIF Image API specifies a web service that returns an image in response to a standard HTTP or HTTPS request. The URI can specify the region, size, rotation, quality characteristics and format of the requested image. A URI can also be constructed to request basic technical information about the image to support client applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/|title=Image API 2.1 — IIIF - International Image Interoperability Framework|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One major use of an Image API endpoint for a given high resolution source image is to allow clients to request low resolution tiles for use in a [[Deep Zoom]] style viewing tool such as OpenSeadragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openseadragon.github.io/examples/tilesource-iiif/|title=IIIF Tile Source - OpenSeadragon|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation API==
{{quote|The IIIF Presentation API specifies a web service that returns JSON-LD structured documents that together describe the structure and layout of a digitized object or other collection of images and related content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/|title=Presentation API 2.0 — IIIF - International Image Interoperability Framework|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
An institution would publish a Manifest (a [[JSON-LD]] document) that describes the structure of each book, artwork, manuscript or other artefact. The manifest contains references to Image API endpoints. A viewer application consuming the manifest can produce a coherent user experience for the artefact by implementing features such as page by page navigation, deep zooming into images and annotations on images.

==Search API==

The IIIF Search API allows for "searching annotation content within a single IIIF resource, such as a Manifest, Range or Collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiif.io/api/search/1.0/|title=IIIF Content Search API 1.0 — IIIF - International Image Interoperability Framework|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example use case==
A manuscript that has been dismembered in the past, with its leaves now scattered across various collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/scattered-leaves|title=Scattered Leaves|date=6 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If each collection exposes its digitised images via the Image API, then a scholar can construct and publish a manifest that digitally recombines the leaves to present a single coherent user experience for the manuscript in any compatible viewer.

==History==
The Image API was proposed in late 2011 as a collaboration between The [[British Library]], [[Stanford University]], the [[Bodleian Libraries]] (Oxford University), the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], [[Nasjonalbiblioteket]] (National Library of Norway), [[LANL_Research_Library|Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library]], and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cni.org/topics/information-access-retrieval/international-image-interoperability-framework/|title=The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF): Laying the Foundation for Common Services, Integrated Resources and a Marketplace of Tools for Scholars Worldwide|date=8 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 1.0 was published in 2012.

Version 1.0 of the Presentation API was published in 2013 and of the Search API in 2016.

==Early education==
John Burland attended [[Parktown Boys' High School]] and then received a First Class Honours [[BSc]] degree in [[Civil Engineering]] from Witwatersrand University in 1959. Then he moved to the [[University of Cambridge]] where he carried out research in [[Soil Mechanics]] under the supervision of [[Professor]] [[Kenneth H. Roscoe]] which led to the award of a [[PhD]] degree in 1967. His thesis title was ''Deformation of soft clay''. He then moved to [[Imperial College London]] where he served as [[Professor]] of [[Soil Mechanics]] for over 20 years and Head of the [[Geotechnics]] Section.

==Achievements==
Burland is best known as the engineer who prevented the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] from toppling over,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burland | first1 = J.

Burland worked also on the construction of a large underground park at the [[Palace of Westminster]] and the stabilising of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] of [[Mexico City]]. His team was also involved in the extension of the Jubilee line and he has advised on many geotechnical aspects of that project, including ensuring the stability of the [[Big Ben]] [[Clock Tower]].

He is very well known for his work on [[Critical state soil mechanics]] and the development of the [[Modified Cam-Clay Model|Modified Cam Clay]] constitutive model for reconstituted clays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = J. | last2 = Tanaka | first2 = N. | last3 = Crilly | first3 = T. | last4 = Alfaro | first4 = M. | title = Modified Cam-Clay modelling of temperature effects in clays | doi = 10.1139/cgj-38-3-608 | journal = Canadian Geotechnical Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 608 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
His contribution to [[Soil Mechanics]] has been greatly acknowledged and he was invited to deliver the 30th [[Rankine Lecture]] of the [[British Geotechnical Association]] titled ''On the compressibility and shear strength of natural clays''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burland | first1 = J.

A '''Master of Advanced Studies''' or '''Master of Advanced Study''' ('''MAS''', '''M.A.S.''', or '''MASt''') is a postgraduate degree awarded in various countries. Master of Advanced Studies programs may be non-consecutive programs tailored for "specific groups of working professionals with well-defined needs for advanced degree work"&lt;ref&gt;University of California Academic Initiatives [http://www.ucop.edu/acadinit/mas.html "Master of Advanced Study"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222142812/http://www.ucop.edu/acadinit/mas.html |date=1999-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or advanced research degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Example of Research Master of Advanced Studies at the University of British Columbia {{cite web |url=http://www.sala.ubc.ca/programs/landscape-architecture/masla |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911104607/http://www.sala.ubc.ca/programs/landscape-architecture/masla |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the UK, advanced studies programs tend to be interdisciplinary and tend to be focused toward meeting the needs of professionals rather than academics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/links/National-reports-2009/National_Report_Liechtenstein_2009.pdf|title=Vlaams Ministerie van Onderwijs en Vorming - Onderwijs - databanken|author=|date=|website=www.ond.vlaanderen.be|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.aic.lv/bolona/2005_07/Nat_reps/LiechtensteinNationalReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
The [[University of Cambridge]] began offering the Master of Advanced Study in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/arrangements.html|title=Award of the Master of Mathematics and the Master of Advanced Study in Mathematics|author=T.

Cambridge currently offers Master of Advanced Study degrees in four fields of study. The [[University of Warwick]] has approved the introduction of a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) degree in Mathematics for the 2013/2014 year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/gov/atoz/bgs/minutes/bgs_minutes_january_12_revised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/postgrad/current/courseinfo/masms/|title=Master of Advanced Study in Mathematical Sciences|author=|date=|website=www2.warwick.ac.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Master of Advanced Study or the Master of Advanced Studies&lt;ref&gt;Example of Master of Advanced Studies degree in the United States: [http://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/registration/spring-2012/MAS-registration-fees-static.html List of Master of Advanced Studies offered at the University of California San Diego] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325011657/http://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/registration/spring-2012/MAS-registration-fees-static.html |date=2012-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; degree is a [[post-graduate]] [[professional degree]] issued by numerous academic institutions, but most notably by the [[University of California]]. M.A.S. programs tend to "concentrate on a set of coordinated coursework with culminating projects or papers rather than emphasizing student research" and frequently are structured as interdisciplinary offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Brad. [http://www1.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/98-99/07-27/degree.htm "UC to offer 'Master of Advanced Study' degree"], ''The University of California, Santa Cruz Currents'', July 27, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== France and francophone countries ==
The ''Diplôme d'études approfondies'' or DEA (Degree of Profound Studies / Degree of in-Depth Studies) was a doctoral programme degree delivered in France from 1964 to 2005 (5-year+ higher education). It was a postgraduate degree (''diplôme de troisième cycle''), aimed to prepare for advanced doctoral studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topia.fr/images/documents/lexical_of_european_doctorates.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920071420/http://www.topia.fr/images/documents/lexical_of_european_doctorates.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to award a government sanctioned degree (diplôme national) for a DEA, the university or institution had to require its students to complete a minimum 90-page thesis with a [[bibliography]] based on the students' original research, and a thesis defense.&lt;ref name=DEA-DESS1&gt;{{cite web|last=Aujourdhui.fr|first=Etudiant|title=Qu'est-ce qu'un DEA, un DESS ou un DOCTORAT ??|url=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/info/qu-est-ce-qu-un-dea-un-dess-ou-un-doctorat.html|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the research thesis, and its defense, delivery of the DEA required one-year of classroom study, an internship, particularly difficult written exams, and an oral exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Livret d'accueil de l'étudiant|date=2002|publisher=[[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN)]]|location=Paris, France|edition=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It often took these students two to three years to receive the diploma.  Entrance in DEA programs was permitted only to holders of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|maîtrise universitaire|fr}}'', a master's degree aimed to be an initiation to research methods. Given the thesis requirement, the DEA is considered higher level than the North American "All But Dissertation" or [[Candidate of Philosophy|ABD]] status within a doctoral program or a [[master of philosophy]] (M.Phil.), but lower level than a PhD. Holders of a DEA were considered to have acquired the theoretical technical knowledge equivalent to a PhD, albeit with less practical research experience. As a result, DEA graduates would often enter the job market without the need to do a PhD, and be offered much more attractive jobs and conditions, compared to Masters degree graduates.

The [[Bologna Process]] was implemented in France in 2002. In 2005, the DEA and the ''maîtrise'' were fused into a lower level two-year degree called "Master".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000267752&amp;dateTexte=]&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the first year of the Master (Master 1 or M1 in everyday speech) was in fact a one-year stand-alone research program and the second year (Master 2 or M2) an introduction to further research. This was gradually overturned by more Bologna-compliant programs, where the M1 introduces to research methods and M2 culminates in actual research. One can say that the old DEA idea is now extinct in France, having been replaced by a lower level Masters degree.

The DEA and ''Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées'' (DESS) were offered in many places and may continue to be offered in countries that apply the French university style, sometimes with some minor differences, such as [[Algeria]], Belgium, [[Lebanon]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Morocco]], [[Canada]] ([[Quebec]]), Spain, [[Tunisia]], and most [[Francophone]] countries.

In the French-speaking universities of Switzerland, the DEA, now master of advanced studies, was equivalent to the [[master's degree]] in [[English-speaking countries]], and it was a one-to-two-year degree taken after a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licence]] (4-year Swiss graduate degree). It generally consisted of a number of courses, with examinations and grades, followed by research in a scientific laboratory. The students would then write a substantial [[thesis]] about the scientific work they did, and defend this thesis in front of a committee. The master of advanced studies remains a common post-graduate degree in Switzerland.

In Europe, the DEA degrees are progressively subsumed into the Bologna process [[master's degree]]s and research-oriented master of advanced studies degrees.

The degree of Master of Advanced Studies is awarded in Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein as a continuing education (''Weiterbildung'') degree.
[[File:Master of Advanced Studies MAS Konzept.jpg|thumb|350px|Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) Program]] In Switzerland, the degree is recognized by federal law.

In Switzerland there are three levels of continuing education qualifications: the Certificate of Advanced Studies, the Diploma of Advanced studies and the Master of Advanced Studies. The Master of Advanced Studies is the highest of these qualifications.[http://www.swissuniversity.ch/system-master-of-advanced-studies.htm Swissuniversity - Master of Advanced Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
This degree also exists in Spain under the name "Diploma de Estudios Avanzados" or "DEA". It confers a higher qualification credential than a [[Master of Philosophy]] or [[Master of Studies]] but lower than [[doctorate]]. The so-called "DEA" was achieved in two years: one year of coursework, which included research methods and theoretical approaches of the discipline at stake (depending on the area of specialization) and one year of research. All the work of the first and second years was defended before a panel. The DEA was a prerequisite for the preparation of the PhD proposal and the commencement of PhD research in Spain.

==European Union==
Students of the College of Europe (an independent university institute of postgraduate European studies with its campuses in Bruges (Belgium) and Natolin (Poland) receive an advanced master's degree (formerly called Diploma and Certificat) following a one-year intense programme.The one-year study programme at the College of Europe leads to an accredited degree of 66 ECTS. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coleurope.eu/admission/recognition-diploma|title=Recognition of the diploma - College of Europe|author=|date=|website=www.coleurope.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40097">'''Mastery learning''' (or, as it was initially called, "'''learning for mastery'''") is an instructional strategy and educational philosophy, first formally proposed by [[Benjamin Bloom]] in 1968. Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.

Mastery learning methods suggest that the focus of instruction should be the time required for different students to learn the same material and achieve the same level of mastery. This is very much in contrast with classic models of teaching, which focus more on differences in students' ability and where all students are given approximately the same amount of time to learn and the same set of instructions.

In mastery learning, there is a shift in responsibilities, so that student's failure is more due to the instruction and not necessarily lack of ability on his or her part. Therefore, in a mastery learning environment, the challenge becomes providing enough time and employing instructional strategies so that all students can achieve the same level of learning.&lt;ref name="Bloom1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine1985"/&gt;

==Definition==
Mastery learning is a set of group-based, individualized, teaching and learning strategies based on the premise that students will achieve a high level of understanding in a given domain if they are given enough time.&lt;ref name="Anderson1975"/&gt;

===Motivation===
The motivation for mastery learning comes from trying to reduce achievement gaps for students in average school classrooms. During the 1960s [[John B. Carroll]] and [[Benjamin S. Bloom]] pointed out that, if students are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with respect to aptitude for a subject and if they are provided uniform instruction (in terms of quality and learning time), then achievement level at completion of the subject is also expected to be normally distributed. This can be illustrated as shown below:
[[File:Uniform Instruction.svg|upright=1.5|frameless | center | Comparison between normal curve for aptitude and normal curve for achievement after learning]]
Mastery Learning approaches propose that, if each learner were to receive optimal quality of instruction and as much learning time as they require, then a majority of students could be expected to attain mastery. This situation would be represented as follows:

[[File:Optimal instruction.svg|upright=1.5 | frameless | center | Comparison between normal curve for aptitude and normal curve for achievement after optimal learning]]
In many situations educators preemptively use the [[normal curve]] for grading students. Bloom was critical of this usage, condemning it because it creates expectation by the teachers that some students will naturally be successful while others will not. Bloom defended that, if educators are effective, the distribution of achievement could and should be very different from the normal curve. Bloom proposed Mastery Learning as a way to address this. He believed that by using his approach, the majority of students (more than 90 percent) would achieve successful and rewarding learning.&lt;ref name="Bloom1968"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  As an added advantage, Mastery Learning was also thought to create more positive interest and attitude towards the subject learned if compared with usual classroom methods.&lt;ref name= Block1971 /&gt;

===Related terms===
[[Individualized instruction]] has some elements in common with mastery learning, although it dispenses with group activities in favor of allowing more capable or more motivated students to progress ahead of others while maximizing teacher interaction with those students who need the most assistance.

[[Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem]] is an educational phenomenon observed where the average student tutored one-to-one (using mastery learning techniques) performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods.

More recently, the idea of "Flipped Mastery" gained some popularity. The term was coined by [[Jonathan Bergmann|Jon Bergmann]] and [[Aaron Sams]], both chemistry teachers. They suggest an implementation model for Mastery Learning that is mixed with [[flipped classroom]]. The idea is to use technology to time-shift the individual instruction and eliminate whole-class lectures. The students watch [[online lecture]]s and move through the content at their own pace.  In this way technology frees up the teachers to individualize the learning for each student.&lt;ref name=NYTOct2013 /&gt;

==History==
The idea of learning for mastery is not new. In the 1920s there were at least two attempts to produce mastery in students' learning: the [[Winnetka Plan]], by [[Carleton Washburne]] and associates, and another approach by [[Henry C. Morrison]], at the [[University of Chicago Laboratory School]]. Both these projects provided school situations where mastery of particular learning tasks - rather than time spent - was the central theme. While these ideas were popular for a while, they faded due primarily to the lack of technologies that could sustain a successful implementation.&lt;ref name="Block1971"/&gt;

The idea of mastery learning resurfaced in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a corollary of [[programmed instruction]], a technology invented by [[B.F. Skinner]] to improve teaching.&lt;ref name="Block1971"/&gt; Underlying programmed instruction was the idea that the learning of any behavior, no matter how complex, rested upon the learning of a sequence of less-complex component behaviors.&lt;ref name="Skinner1954"/&gt;

Around that same time, [[John B. Carroll]] was working on his "Model of School Learning". This was a conceptual paradigm which outlined the major factors influencing student success in school learning, indicating also how these factors interacted.&lt;ref name="Carroll1963"/&gt; Carroll's model stemmed from his previous work with foreign language learning. He found that a student's aptitude for a language predicted not only the level to which he learned in a given time, but also the amount of time he required to learn to a given level. Carroll then suggests that aptitudes are actually a way to measure the amount of time  required to learn a task up to a certain level (under ideal instructional conditions). So  Carroll's model is actually suggesting that, if each student was allowed the time they needed to learn to some level, then he could be expected to attain that level.&lt;ref name="Block1971"/&gt;

Later in the 1960s [[Benjamin Bloom]]  and his graduate students were researching individual differences in school learning. They observed that teachers displayed very little variation in their instructional practices and yet, there was a lot of variation in student's achievements. Bloom used Carroll's conceptual model to create his own working model of Mastery Learning. Bloom realized that, if aptitudes were predictive of the rate at which a student can learn (and not necessarily the level to which), it should be possible to fix the degree of learning expected to some mastery level and then systematically manipulate the variables in Carroll's model such that all or almost all students attained that level.

Also in the 1960s, [[Fred S. Keller]] was collaborating with colleagues developing his own instructional methods of Mastery Learning. Keller's strategies were based on the ideas of [[reinforcement]] as seen in [[operant conditioning]] theories. Keller formally introduced his teaching method, [[#Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)|Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)]] - sometimes referred to as [[Keller Plan]]), in his 1967 paper, "Engineering personalized instruction in the classroom".&lt;ref name = "Keller1967"/&gt;

From the late 1960s to the early 1980s, there was a surge of research on both Keller's and Bloom's instruction methods.&lt;ref name="Grant2003"/&gt; Most of these studies showed that mastery learning has a positive effect on achievement, for all subjects and at all levels. Also, mastery learning brings positive affective outcomes for both students and teachers. These studies also showed that there are many variables that are either affected by mastery learning or that influence it somehow: student entry variables, curriculum, type of test, pacing, level of mastery, and time.&lt;ref name="Anderson1994"/&gt;

Despite those mostly positive research results, interest in mastery learning strategies decreased throughout the 1980s, as reflected in publication activity in professional journals and presentations at conferences. Many explanations were put forward to justify this decline, like alleged recalcitrance of the educational establishment to change,&lt;ref name="Buskist1991"/&gt; or the ineffective implementations of mastery learning methods,&lt;ref name="Sherman1992"/&gt; or the extra time demanded in setting up and maintaining a mastery learning course&lt;ref name="Buskist1991"/&gt; or even concerns that behavioristic-based models for teaching would conflict with the generally humanistic-oriented teachers and the surrounding culture.&lt;ref name="Horton1979"/&gt;

Mastery learning strategies are best represented by [[#Learning For Mastery (LFM)|Bloom's Learning For Mastery (LFM)]] and [[#Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)|Keller's Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)]]. Bloom's approach was focused in the schoolroom, whereas Keller developed his system for higher education. Both have been applied in many different contexts and have been found to be very powerful methods for increasing student performance in a wide range of activities. Despite sharing some commonalities in terms of goals, they are built on different psychological principles.

==Learning For Mastery (LFM)==

===Variables of LFM===
Bloom, when first proposing his mastery learning strategy in 1968, was convinced that most students can attain a high level of learning capability if the following conditions are available: 
* instruction is approached sensitively and systematically
* students are helped when and where they have learning difficulties
* students are given sufficient time to achieve mastery
* there is some clear criterion of what constitutes mastery.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;
Many variables will influence achievement levels and learning outcomes:

==== Aptitude ====
Aptitude, measured by standard aptitude tests, in this context is interpreted as "the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of a learning task".&lt;ref name="Carroll, J. 1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = J | year = 1963 | title = A model of school learning | url = | journal = The Teachers College Record | volume = 64 | issue = 8| pages = 723–723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several studies show that majority of students can achieve mastery in a learning task, but the time that they need to spend on is different.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, R. (1968). Adapting the elementary school curriculum to individual performance. Learning Research and Development Center, University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atkinson | first1 = R. C. | year = 1968 | title = Computerized instruction and the learning process | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 225–239 | doi=10.1037/h0020791}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bloom argues that there are 1 to 5 percent of students who have special talent for learning a subject (especially music and foreign languages) and there are also around five percent of students who have special disability for learning a subject. For other 90% of students, aptitude is merely an indicator of the rate of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S. (1968). Learning for Mastery. Instruction and Curriculum. Regional Education Laboratory for the Carolinas and Virginia, Topical Papers and Reprints, Number 1. Evaluation comment, 1(2), n2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, Bloom argues that aptitude for a learning task is not constant and can be changed by environmental conditions or learning experience at school or home.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S. (1964). Stability and change in human characteristics. New York, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, J. M. (1961). Intelligence and experience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quality of instruction ====
The quality of instruction is defined as the degree to which the presentation, explanation, and ordering of elements of the task to be learned approach the optimum for a given learner.&lt;ref name="Carroll, J. 1963"/&gt;
Bloom insists that the quality of instruction has to be evaluated according to its effect on individual students rather than on random groups of students.
Bloom shows that while in traditional classrooms, the relationship between students' aptitude test for mathematics and their final grade in algebra is very high, this relationship is almost zero for students who are receiving tutorial instruction in the home. He argues that a good tutor tries to find the quality of learning best fit to the given students, thus the majority of students would be able to master a subject if they have access to a good tutor.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

==== Ability to understand instruction ====
According to Bloom the ability to understand instruction is defined as the nature of the task that a learner is to learn and the procedure that the learner is to follow. Verbal ability and reading comprehension are two language abilities that are highly related to student achievements. Since the ability to understand instruction varies significantly among students, Bloom recommends that teachers modify their instruction, provide help, and teaching aids to fit the needs of different students. Some of the teaching aids that could be provided according to the ability of the learner are:
* Alternative Textbooks
* Group Studies and Peer Tutoring
* Workbooks
* Programmed Instruction Units
* Audiovisual Methods
* Academic Games
* Laboratory experiences
* Simple demonstrations
* Puzzles&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

==== Perseverance ====
Perseverance in this context is defined as the time the learner is willing to spend in learning. According to Bloom, a student who demonstrates a low level of perseverance in one learning task might have a very high level of perseverance in a different learning task. He suggests that students' perseverance be enhanced by increasing the frequency of reward and providing evidence of success in learning. He recommends that teachers use frequent feedback accompanied by specific help to improve the quality of instruction, thus reducing the perseverance required for learning.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

==== Time allowed for learning ====
According to the International Study of Education in 12 countries, if the top 5% of students are omitted, the ratio of the time needed for slower and faster learners of a subject such as mathematics is 6 to 1 while there is zero or slightly negative relationship between the final grades and the amount of time spent on homework.&lt;ref&gt;Husén, T. (1967). INTERNATIONAL STUDY OF ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS, A COMPARISON OF TWELVE COUNTRIES, VOLUME I.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the amount of time spent on homework is not a good indicator of mastery in a subject. Bloom postulates that the time required for a learner to achieve mastery in a specific subject is affected by various factors such as:
* the student's aptitude for that subject, 
* The student's verbal ability, 
* the quality of instruction, and 
* the quality of the help provided.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

===LFM strategy===
LFM curricula generally consists of discrete topics which all students begin together. After beginning a unit, students will be given a meaningful and formative assessment so that the teacher can conclude whether or not an objective has been mastered. At this step, instruction goes in one of two directions. If a student has mastered an objective, he or she will begin on a path of enrichment activities that correspond to and build upon the original objective.  Students who do not satisfactorily complete a topic are given additional instruction until they succeed. If a student does not demonstrate that he or she has mastered the objective, then a series of correctives will be employed. These correctives can include varying activities, individualized instruction, and additional time to complete assignments.&lt;ref name="Guskey2007"/&gt;  These students will receive constructive feedback on their work and will be encouraged to revise and revisit their assignment until the objective is mastered.

==== Preconditions ====
There are some preconditions for the process of mastery learning. First, the objectives and content of instruction have to be specified and clarified to both the students and the teacher. Another precondition is that the summative evaluation criteria should be developed and both the teacher and the learner should be clear about the achievement criteria. Bloom suggests that using absolute standards rather than competitive criteria, helps students to collaborate and facilitates mastery.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

==== Operating procedures ====
The operating procedures are the methods used to provide detailed feedback and instructional help to facilitate the process of mastery in learning.
The main operation procedures are:
* Formative Evaluation, and
* Alternative Learning Resources&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

===== Formative evaluation =====
Formative Evaluation in the context of mastery learning is a diagnostic progress tests to determine whether or not the student has mastered the subject unit.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven, M. (1967). The methodology of evaluation (AERA Monograph series on curriculum evaluation, No. 1). New York: Rand Mc Nally.&lt;/ref&gt; Each unit is usually a learning outcome that could be taught in a week or two of learning activity.
The formative tests are administered at the learning units. Bloom insists that the diagnostic process has to be followed by a prescription and the result of formative assessment is better to express in not-grade format since the use of grades on repeated progress evaluations prepare students for accepting a level of learning less than mastery.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

===== Alternative learning resources =====
The progress tests should be followed by detailed feedback and specific suggestions so that the students could work on their difficulties. Some of the alternative learning resources are:
* Small groups of students (two or three) meet and work together
* Tutorial help
* Reviewing the instructional material
* Reading alternative textbooks
* Using workbook or programmed texts
* Using selected audiovisual materials&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

==== Outcomes ====
The outcomes of mastery learning could be summarized into two groups:
1- Cognitive Outcomes
2- Affective Outcomes&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

===== Cognitive outcomes =====
The cognitive outcomes of mastery learning are mainly related to increase in student excellence in a subject. According to one study, applying the strategies of mastery learning in a class resulted in the increase of students with the grade of A from 20 percent to 80 percent (about two standard deviation, and using the formative evaluation records as a base for  quality control helped the teacher to improve the strategies and increase the percent of students with a grade of A to 90% in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S., &amp; Carroll, J. B. (1971). Mastery learning: Theory and practice. J. H. Block (Ed.). New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Affective outcomes =====
Affective outcomes of mastery are mainly related to the sense of self-efficacy and confidence in the learners. Bloom argues that when the society (through education system) recognizes a learner's mastery, profound changes happen in his or her view of self and the outer world. The learner would start believing that he or she is able to adequately cope with problems,  would have higher motivation for learning the subject in a higher level of expertise, and would have a better mental state due to less feeling of frustration. Finally, it is argued that in a modern society that lifelong learning is a necessity, mastery learning can develop a lifelong interest and motivation in learning.&lt;ref name="Bloom1976"/&gt;

==Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)==
Personalized System of Instruction, also known as the [[Keller Plan]] was developed in the mid 1960s by Fred Keller and colleagues. It was developed based on the idea of [[reinforcement]] in teaching processes.

Keller gives the following description to a group of psychology students enrolled in his course developed using mastery learning theory: "This is a course through which you may move, from start to finish, at your own pace. You will not be held back by other students or forced to go ahead until you are ready. At best, you may meet all the course requirements in less than one semester; at worst, you may not complete the job within that time. How fast you go is up to you" (Keller, 1968, pg 80-81).&lt;ref name = "Keller1968" /&gt;

=== Five elements of PSI ===
There are five main elements in PSI as described in Keller's paper from 1967:
# "The go-at-your-own-pace feature, which permits a student to move through the course at a speed commensurate with his ability and other demands upon his time.
# The unit-perfection requirement for advance, which lets the student go ahead to new material only after demonstrating mastery of that which preceded.
# The use of lectures and demonstrations as vehicles of motivation, rather than sources of critical information.
# The related stress upon the written word in teacher-student communication.
# The use of proctors, which permits repeated testing, immediate scoring, almost unavoidable tutoring, and a marked enhancement of the personal-social aspect of the educational process".&lt;ref name="Keller1967"/&gt;

==Assessment==
In a mastery learning environment, the teacher directs a variety of group-based instructional techniques, with frequent and specific feedback by using diagnostic, [[Educational assessment|formative tests]], as well as regularly correcting mistakes students make along their learning path. Assessment in the mastery learning classroom is not used as a measure of accountability but rather as a source of evidence to guide future instruction. A teacher using the mastery approach will use the evidence generated from his or her assessment to modify activities to best serve each student. Teachers evaluate students with [[criterion-referenced test]]s rather than [[norm-referenced test]]s. In this sense, students are not competing against each other, but rather competing against themselves in order to achieve a personal best.

==Criticism==

===Time-achievement equality dilemma===
The goal of mastery learning is to have all students reach a prescribed level of mastery (i.e. 80–90% on a test). In order to achieve this, some students will require more time than others, either in practice or instruction, to achieve success. The Time-Achievement Equality Dilemma refers to this relationship between time and achievement in the context of individual differences. If you hold achievement constant, time will need to vary. If time is held constant (as with modern learning models), achievement will vary. Mastery Theory doesn't accurately address this relationship.&lt;ref name="Arlin1984a"/&gt;

Bloom's original theory assumes that with practice, the slower learners will become faster learners and the gap of individual differences will disappear. Bloom believes these differences in learning pace occur because of lack of prerequisite knowledge and if all children have the same prerequisite knowledge, then learning will progress at the same rate. Bloom places the blame on teaching settings where students aren't given enough time to reach mastery levels in prerequisite knowledge before moving on to the new lesson. He also uses this to explain why variance in student learning is smaller in the first grade when compared to students in the 7th grade (the smart get smarter, and the slower fall further behind). He referred to this learning rate variance as the Vanishing Point.&lt;ref name="Bloom1971"/&gt;

Studies have found support for both sides of Bloom's argument. {{citation needed|reason=Support for the argument is claimed, but only contradictory studies are referenced.|date=December 2015}}

A four-year longitudinal study by Arlin (1984)&lt;ref name="Arlin1984b"/&gt; found no indication of a vanishing point in students who learned arithmetic through a mastery approach. Students who required extra assistance to learn material in the first year of the study required relatively the same amount of additional instruction in the 4th year. Individual differences in learning rates appear to be impacted by more than just method of instruction, contrary to Bloom's opinions.

===Methodology errors in research===

====Experimental vs. control groups====
In studies investigating the effectiveness of mastery learning, control and experimental groups were not always valid. Experimental groups typically consisted of courses that were developed to adhere to the best principles of mastery. However, control groups were sometimes existing classes to use as a comparison. This poses a problem since there was no way to test the effectiveness of the control group to begin with - it could have been a poorly constructed course being compared against a strictly designed mastery course.{{citation needed|reason=Need a reference where these issues are discussed|date=December 2015}}

====Measurement tools====
In studies where the largest effect sizes were found, experimenter made tests were used to test the mastery levels of students in the experiments. By using tests designed for the experiment, the mastery instruction intervention may have been able to better tailor the learning goals of the class to align with the measurement tool.&lt;ref name = "Kuliketal1990"/&gt; Conversely, these dramatic effect sizes essentially disappeared when standardized tests were used to measure mastery levels in control and experimental groups

====Study duration====
There are very few studies that investigate the long-term effects of mastery learning. Many studies included an arbitrary 3-4 week intervention period and results were based on findings from this time period. It's important to consider the length of time students were immersed in a mastery learning program to get a greater understanding of the long-term effects of this teaching strategy.&lt;ref name = "Arlin1984b"/&gt;

===General concerns and opinions===
Typical mastery programs involve providing class instruction then testing using reliable tools (i.e. multiple choice unit test). This format of learning may only be beneficial to learners who are interested in surface rather than deep processing of information.&lt;ref name ="laiandbiggs1994"/&gt; This contradicts many of today's modern learning approaches which focus less on direct assessment of knowledge, and more on creating meaningful applications and interpretations of the obtained knowledge (see [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)]])

The Chicago Mastery Learning Reading program  was criticized for a focus on testing. A concern is that children were taught to pass tests without a focus on enduring skills.The duration of the retention of skills was questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/09/education/mastery-learning-on-a-grand-scale-chicago.html|title = MASTERY LEARNING ON A GRAND SCALE; CHICAGO|last = Saiter|first = Susan|date = 1983-01-09|newspaper = The New York Times|issn = 0362-4331|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A love of reading was not promoted. Students rarely read books or stories. Student failure was an aspect of the program design. 80% was required on 80% of the test to pass. This resulted in huge retention levels. Ultimately, the program was not practical to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1985/10/09/06250017.h05.html|title = Chicago Mastery Learning Reading:'A Program With Three Left Feet' - Education Week|last = Goodman|first = Kenneth S.|date = 1985-10-09|newspaper = Education Week|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of having all children achieve mastery brings into question our general view of success. If the goal of education became having children become experts, grades would become much less varied. That is, you would theoretically have a high school graduating class all with grades above 90%. Universities would have to make selections from a pool of applicants with similar grades, how would admission requirements have to change to account for uniform ratings of intelligence? Would time it took to reach mastery become a new measure of success? These questions about the wider implications of mastery as a new standard raise discussion about its actual value.&lt;ref name="Arlin1984a"/&gt;

==Mastery learning today==
Mastery Learning has been one of the most highly investigated teaching methods over the past 50 years. While it has been the subject of high criticism, it has also been found to have resounding success when implemented correctly.&lt;ref name="Guskey2009"/&gt; A meta-analysis by Guskey &amp; Pigott (1988)&lt;ref name = "Guskey1988"/&gt; looked at 46 studies that implemented group-based mastery learning classrooms. Results found consistently positive effects for a number of variables including "student achievement, retention of learned material, involvement in learning activities, and student affect".&lt;ref name = "Guskey1988"/&gt; However, a notable variation was found within student achievement and it was believed this was due mainly to the subject being taught. Courses such as science, probability, and social studies yielded the most consistent positive results, while other subjects were varied.&lt;ref name = "Guskey1988"/&gt;

Another large-scale meta analysis conducted by Kulik et al. (1990)&lt;ref name = "Kuliketal1990"/&gt; investigated 108 studies of mastery programs being implemented at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary level. Results revealed positive effects in favour of these teaching strategies, with students also reporting positive attitudes toward this style of learning. This study also found mastery programs to be most effective for weaker students.

Despite the empirical evidence, many mastery programs in schools have been replaced by more traditional forms of instruction due to the level of commitment required by the teacher and the difficulty in managing the classroom when each student is following an individual course of learning.&lt;ref name = "Grittner1975"/&gt; However, the central tenets of mastery learning are still found in today's teaching strategies such as [[differentiated instruction]]&lt;ref name ="Tomilson2003"/&gt; and [[Understanding by Design|understanding by design]].&lt;ref name = "Wiggins2005"/&gt;

Researchers at Northwestern University pioneered the use of mastery learning in the health professions.  In 2006 they investigated mastery learning vs. traditional medical education in advanced cardiac life support techniques and showed that internal medicine resident trainees significantly improved adherence to American Heart Association protocols after mastery training.&lt;ref name="JGIM 2006"/&gt;  Subsequent investigations showed improved patient care practices as a result of this rigorous education including reduced patient complications and healthcare costs.&lt;ref name="Archives 2009"/&gt;  The approach designed by Northwestern investigators is currently in use at other institutions and medical schools throughout the US and the world.

The '''Melkonian Educational Institute (MEI)''' ({{lang-hy|'''Մելգոնեան Կրթական Հաստատութիւն''' ('''ՄԿՀ''')}}) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[boarding school]] of high academic standard located in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Melkonian issue raised at Western Armenian conference in Cyprus |date=April 25, 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=38926&amp;archive=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528011852/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=38926&amp;archive=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 28, 2009 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2008-04-26 |language= |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1926 by the [[Melkonian brothers]], it was the only remaining boarding school servicing students of the Armenian Diaspora from nearly 40 countries.

Melkonian's current status is uncertain.{{why|date=September 2013}}

Formerly financed by the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]], a decision to cut off funding in 2005 caused controversy among the Armenian community and especially among former pupils.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Melkonian Institution was created as an orphanage in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915–1923.
Zaven Patriarch of Constantinople was the first director of this institution, who in April 1926 undertook the heavy task of traveling and collecting over 300 orphans, boys and girls, amongst thousands of children left destitute on the plains of  Eastern Anatolia and in the neighboring countries as a result of the Armenian Genocide.

The Melkonian Institution as a safe haven is therefore regarded as being closely connected with the dark pages of the early 20th century Armenian History. The hundreds and thousands of orphans that were provided with shelter, sustenance and schooling by dint of the enormous gift bequeathed by  Garabed &amp; Krikor Melkonian benefactor brothers, confirm this.
On Friday, February 15, 1924 the foundational stone was laid and the construction of Melkonian Establishments began in Nicosia.
Melkonian School opened its gates two years later in 1926.

=== The Melkonian Brothers ===
Krikor Melkonian and Garabed Melkonian are widely regarded as the greatest benefactors of the Armenian nation.  They were prominent tobacco traders from Egypt.  In the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide they decided to establish this school in Cyprus.  To that end, they liquidated all their assets and established the Melkonian Fund and entrusted the management (and not the ownership) of the Melkonian School to the AGBU.

Both brothers are buried at the School grounds, at the open space between the two main buildings. A beautifully designed marble monument with intricate engravings and the bronze busts of the Melkonian Brothers prominently stand as a gesture of eternal gratitude to their memory.  For thousands of Melkonian graduates and friends this is a sacred place.

=== The Forest of Remembrance ===
[[File:Melkonian panoramic 1986.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the Melkonian Educational Institute (1986) and "The Forest of Remembrance" on the right.]]
Along the Limassol Highway, occupying the foreground of the Melkonian campus, there is a grove of cypress trees, hundreds and thousands of them.
This grove is a significant landmark and has a historic and sentimental value to the Armenian Nation.  These trees were planted in the early years of the Melkonian Institute by the orphan students in memory of their loved ones and  of the  millions that perished during the Genocide.  Nowhere else in the world, not even in Armenia, the Armenian Genocide  is memorialized in this manner.
Cyprus government has officially listed this forest.

=== Recent history ===

In the summer of 1974 as a result of [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] numerous bombs were dropped on Melkonian grounds and buildings causing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melkonian Timeline|url=http://www.melkoniannews.org/page003.aspx|publisher=Melkonian Alumni and Friends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 a quarter of the Melkonian Estate was sold off at, what many regard as a ridiculously low prices (the legality of this act is also questioned).  The aim was to reinvest the money in a new Boarding House, a closed sports complex and a commercial centre. All these projects went ahead.

At the time, the 6-storey Melkonian Commercial Centre (MCC) was built on Melkonian territory so as to generate income for the school in order to make it financially less dependent from the AGBU. By 1989, the rent started to trickle in and eventually the CYP 1.75 million loan was paid off.

In recent years the MCC was generating enough money to support the school.  According to 2003 figures MCC generates over $650,000 annually as it collects rent from Cyprus Tourism Organisation (offices), the Army Officers’ Cooperative, the firm of Philipou &amp; Guevherian, a tutoring centre, a restaurant (Crescendo) and a row of shops (Elements of Style, Constantinou Communications, Duxiana, a toy store, an advertising agency, an Internet café, etc.), all of them tenants at the Melkonian Commercial Centre.

The AGBU has been heavily criticized for the fact that the income from the MCC rent has never reached Melkonian School and has been going directly to the AGBU.

=== Closure ===
The first rumors about the closure of Melkonian Educational Institute started circulating in the Summer of 2003.  On November 17, 2003 an alumnus led and well-coordinated campaign to resist the rumored closure was established.
After months of paid advertisements and heavily funded PR campaigns by the AGBU informing the public that they do not intend to close down and sell the Melkonian, on March 14, 2004 AGBU CB voted unanimously in favor of the closure.  The official decision was published 2 days afterwards on March 16, 2004.
The school was closed in June 2005.

=== Lawsuit ===
In an effort to stop the closure of Melkonian, Patriarch Mesrob Mutafian of Constantinople, with the cooperation of Melkonian Alumni &amp; Friends, based in Los Angeles, California, instigated lawsuits against the AGBU Central Board. Ninety five percent of Melkonian Alumni supported
the Patriarch's lawsuit and wanted the School to remain open.
Although the lawsuits failed in the United States and the Republic of Cyprus, they irreparably damaged AGBU's public image as one of the pillars of the Armenian Diaspora. Also it prevented AGBU from selling the huge Melkonian property.

== Boarding Section ==
[[File:Melkonian_kisherotig.JPG|thumb|The boarding section of the Melkonian Educational Institute in [[Nicosia]]]]

The new boarding houses were constructed in early 1990s for both boys and girls living in opposite wings of the complex. [[Alex Manoogian]]'s statue is prominently featured at the centre of the courtyard.  The boarding section has a capacity of accommodating circa 400 boarding students. Boys and girls accommodations are in separate building with supervisors at the doors at all hours.  The houses also include a cafeteria, where boarding students would receive their breakfasts, lunches, dinners and suppers.  There are also various areas dedicated to indoors recreational activities within this building, the largest of which is above the cafeteria with a game room, canteen and TV area.

The on-call supervisors and the resident nurse also have their offices and quarters inside this complex.

== School magazines and Publications ==
In 1969 and 1970 the discontinued magazine was reinstated and printed. It was called AIG. To start the magazine a cover page was needed. A competition was set up and allowed the students to turn in artwork for the cover page. The competition was won by a graduating student – Haro Bayandorian – from Iran. The same artwork was used for the next 3 years. Copies of these early magazine still exists.
Melkonian students used to publish Hayatsk, which was a newspaper run by and edited by the students themselves.
AIG was the annual yearbook for Melkonian graduates.

== Celebrations ==
Hokehankist - a ceremony dedicated to remembering the Melkonian brothers and their charitable deed is carried out to annually to this day.

== Old Melkoniantsis, The MEI Alumni and [http://www.MEI1970.org www.MEI1970.org] ==
Growing up in close near-familial environment, Melkonian graduates (Melkoniantsi) remain friends many years after their graduation.  Many Melkoniantsis, both old and young, see themselves as being part of the same "[http://MEI1970.org Melkonian family]".  A number of well organised and very active MEI Alumni chapters are established in all continents of the globe.  Of all Armenian schools Melkonian has produced a widely disproportionate share of Armenian Diaspora’s prominent writers, intellectuals, academics, doctors, musicians, politicians, community leaders, persons of political influence and public figures on international stage. Some of prominent names associated with Melkonian include [[Vahan Tekeyan]], [[Moushegh Ishkhan]], Apraham Manoogian, [[Benon Sevan]], [[Vahan Bedelian]] and Vahram Mavian.

== The Campaign to Save Melkonian ==
In 2003 an Alumni led campaign to resist the closure of Melkonian began. SaveMelkonian.org was established as campaign’s information outlet, and soon attracted the attention of press, TV, political parties and numerous cultural and charity organization both in Armenia and Diaspora. Joined with Melkonian Alumni &amp; Friends in California and many other like-minded organizations, SaveMelkonian campaign has a series of achievements in resisting AGBU’s decision, which many in Armenian Diaspora regard as purely profit-driven.

=== The Melkoniantsi Club ===
On April 8, 2008, www.Melkoniantsiclub.com, an official Melkoniantsi Social Network Website was established by Mher Asadourian to keep all the Melkoniantsis, Melkonian teachers and staff united and let them communicate and keep in touch. Melkoniantsis, teachers and staff can sign up for free, upload their picture, invite friends, chat, blog, advertise, post an event, create groups and read the news.

UPDATE: The above website is no longer on line. Try [http://www.MEI1970.org www.MEI1970.org] with above focus.

=== Petition ===

A renewed campaign appeals to the whole Armenian nation through a petition (www.midk.org) that advocates AGBU central board in New York to finally respond and start a discussion on how the school can be reopened as soon as possible. Both management and financial resources have been made available for the reopening of the school and ensuring the successful fulfillment of its mission but AGBU central board in New York so far refuses to discuss the issue at all cost even though many of the local AGBU chapters have privately or publicly raised their concerns.

'''Meritocracy''' (''merit'', from [[Latin]] ''mereō'', and ''-cracy'', from [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος ''{{transl|el|kratos}}'' "strength, power") is a [[political philosophy]] which holds that certain things, such as [[Goods|economic goods]] or [[Power (social and political)|power]], should be [[vested]] in [[individual]]s on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than factors such as sexuality, race, gender, or wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of merit|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meritocracy?s=t|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was first created in 1958 by the sociologist [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]].&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary shows the first use in 1956 and gives this citation. "1956 A. Fox in Socialist Comm. May 13/1 The ‘meritocracy’; the society in which the gifted, the smart, the energetic, the ambitious and the ruthless are carefully sifted out and helped towards their destined positions of dominance."  Young's entry is listed as "1958 M. Young Rise of Meritocracy iv. 71 Before the meritocracy was fully established, age-stratification as a substitute for the hereditary order may have been necessary for the sake of social stability."

==Definitions==
===Early definitions===
The "most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by [[IQ]] or standardized achievement tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=Alan R.|title=Education and Sociology: An Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436|quote=most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms tested competency and power, and most likely as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; In government and other administrative systems, "meritocracy" refers to a system under which advancement within the system turns on "merits", like performance, intelligence, [[credential]]s, and education. These are often determined through evaluations or examinations.&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt;

In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like "[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]]" and "[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]", the word "meritocratic" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meritocracy|title=Definition of Meritocracy|work=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to the original, condemnatory use of the term in 1958 by Michael Young in his work "''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''", who was satirizing the ostensibly merit-based [[Tripartite System]] of education practiced in the United Kingdom at the time; he claimed that, in the Tripartite System, "merit is equated with intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors are identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education, and there is an obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought|year=1988|publisher=Fontana Press|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in its wider sense, may be any general act of judgment upon the basis of various demonstrated merits; such acts frequently are described in [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. Supporters of meritocracy do not necessarily agree on the nature of "merit"; however, they do tend to agree that "merit" itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation. Thus, the merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental or physical [[wikt:talent#Noun|talent]] or to [[work ethic]]. As such meritocracy may be based on [[soft skills|character]] or [[intelligence|innate abilities]]. Meritocrats therefore reject evaluation on the basis of race, wealth, family circumstances, and similar criteria.

In [[rhetoric]], the demonstration of one's merit regarding mastery of a particular subject is an essential task most directly related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] term ''[[Ethos]]''. The equivalent Aristotelian conception of meritocracy is based upon [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] structures, rather than in the context of the modern [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Pol. 2.1261b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, (351 BC) ''Politics''. Book Three Part IV. (Jowett, B., Trans)&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent definitions===

In the United States, the assassination of President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881 prompted the replacement of the American [[Spoils System]] with a meritocracy. In 1883, The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was passed, stipulating government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;

The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree. Higher education is an imperfect meritocratic screening system for various reasons, such as lack of uniform standards worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;What's College For?: The Struggle To Define American Higher Education; Zachary Karabell; {{ISBN|978-0-465-09152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning – May 2008 Volume 5, Number 5 AACSB Accreditation&lt;/ref&gt; lack of scope (not all occupations and processes are included), and lack of access (some talented people never have an opportunity to participate because of the expense, most especially in [[developing country|developing countries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Higher education and social justice |author1=Furlong, Andy|author2=Cartmel, Fred|isbn=978-0-335-22362-6|publisher=Open University Press|location =Maidenhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, academic degrees serve some amount of meritocratic screening purpose in the absence of a more refined methodology. Education alone, however, does not constitute a complete system, as meritocracy must automatically confer power and authority, which a degree does not accomplish independently.

==Etymology==
Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term "meritocracy" is relatively new. It was used pejoratively by [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] in his 1958 [[satire|satirical]] [[essay]]&lt;ref name="riseofmeri"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Young (politician)|title=The rise of the meritocracy, 1870-2033: An essay on education and inequality|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London| oclc=3943639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Down with meritocracy: The man who coined the word four decades ago wishes Tony Blair would stop using it|last=Young|first=Michael|date=29 June 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ford, Boris|year=1992|title=The Cambridge cultural history of Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-42889-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamolnick, Paul|year=2005|title=The just meritocracy: IQ, class mobility, and American social policy|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport CT|page=87|isbn=978-0-275-97922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Best, Shaun|year=2005|title=Understanding Social Divisions|publisher=Sage|page=32|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-4296-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]'', which pictured the United Kingdom under the rule of a government favouring intelligence and aptitude (merit) above all else, being the combination of the root of Latin origin "merit" (from "mereō" meaning "earn") and the Ancient Greek suffix "-cracy" (meaning "power", "rule").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=meritocracy|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|accessdate=3 July 2013|title="meritocracy" in the Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''purely'' Greek word is axiocracy (αξιοκρατία), from axios (αξιος, worthy) + "-cracy" (-κρατία, power).)
In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.
The essay, written in the first person by a fictional historical narrator in 2034, interweaves history from the politics of pre- and post-war Britain with those of fictional future events in the short (1960 onward) and long term (2020 onward).&lt;ref name="young_p11"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay was based upon the tendency of the then-current governments, in their striving toward intelligence, to ignore shortcomings and upon the failure of education systems to utilize correctly the gifted and talented members within their societies.&lt;ref name="young_p13"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's fictional narrator explains that, on the one hand, the greatest contributor to society is not the "stolid mass" or majority, but the "creative minority" or members of the "restless elite".&lt;ref name="young_p15"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he claims that there are casualties of progress whose influence is underestimated and that, from such stolid adherence to natural science and intelligence, arises arrogance and complacency.&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt; This problem is encapsulated in the phrase "Every selection of one is a rejection of many".&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt;

It was also used by [[Hannah Arendt]] in her essay "Crisis in Education",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf "Crisis in Education"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014030134/http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf |date=14 October 2013 }} (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; which was written in 1958 and refers to the use of meritocracy in the English educational system.  She too uses the term pejoratively.  It was not until 1972 that [[Daniel Bell]] used the term positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littler|first1=Jo|title=Meritocracy: the great delusion that ingrains inequality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/meritocracy-inequality-theresa-may-donald-trump|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times: China===
{{further information|Chinese Legalism}}
According to scholarly consensus, the earliest example of an administrative meritocracy, based on civil service examinations, dates back to Ancient China.&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Chung|first2=Yinzheng|last2=Geng|title=

This sets in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sienkewicz|first=Thomas J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Ancient World:|year=2003|publisher=Salem Press|page=434|quote=Confucius invented the notion that those who govern should so because of merit and not inherited status, setting in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qin and Han dynasties developed a meritocratic system in order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the [[civil service examination]]s, and education became the key for social mobility.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;Burbank and Cooper (2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the [[nine-rank system]] was established during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

According to the [[Princeton University|Princeton Encyclopedia on American History]]:&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China. Tracing back to 200 B.C., the Han Dynasty adopted Confucianism as the basis of its political philosophy and structure, which included the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with one of virtue and honesty, and thereby calling for administrative appointments to be based solely on merit. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position that would bring wealth and honor to the whole family. In part due to Chinese influence, the first European civil service did not originate in Europe, but rather in India by the British-run East India Company... company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism.}}

Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] advocated meritocracy, Plato in his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', arguing that the wisest should rule, and hence the rulers should be [[philosopher king]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Estlund (2003) for a summary and discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century: spread to Europe===
The concept of meritocracy spread from China to British India during the seventeenth century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; With the translation of Confucian texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancient regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;

The first European power to implement a successful meritocratic civil service was the [[British Empire]], in their administration of India: "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; British colonial administrators advocated the spread of the system to the rest of the commonwealth, the most "persistent" of which was Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. Meadows successfully argued in his ''[[Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China]]'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde,|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice later was adopted in the late nineteenth century by the British mainland, inspired by the "Chinese mandarin system".&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Huddleston, Mark W. Boyer, William W.''The higher civil service in the United States: quest for reform''. (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1996), 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated meritocracy in his book, ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]''. His model was to give more votes to the more [[Education|educated]] voter. His views are explained in Estlund (2003:57–58):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Mill's proposal of plural voting has two motives. One is to prevent one group or class of people from being able to control the political process even without having to give reasons in order to gain sufficient support. He calls this the problem of class legislation. Since the most numerous class is also at a lower level of education and social rank, this could be partly remedied by giving those at the higher ranks plural votes. A second, and equally prominent motive for plural voting is to avoid giving equal influence to each person without regard to their merit, intelligence, etc. He thinks that it is fundamentally important that political institutions embody, in their spirit, the recognition that some opinions are worth more than others. He does not say that this is a route to producing better political decisions, but it is hard to understand his argument, based on this second motive, in any other way.

So, if Aristotle is right that the deliberation is best if participants are numerous (and assuming for simplicity that the voters are the deliberators) then this is a reason for giving all or many citizens a vote, but this does not yet show that the wiser subset should not have, say, two or three; in that way something would be given both to the value of the diverse perspectives, and to the value of the greater wisdom of the few. This combination of the Platonic and Aristotelian points is part of what I think is so formidable about Mill's proposal of plural voting. It is also an advantage of his view that he proposes to privilege not the wise, but the educated. Even if we agreed that the wise should rule, there is a serious problem about how to identify them. This becomes especially important if a successful political justification must be generally acceptable to the ruled. In that case, privileging the wise would require not only their being so wise as to be better rulers, but also, and more demandingly, that their wisdom be something that can be agreed to by all reasonable citizens. I turn to this conception of justification below.

Mill's position has great plausibility: good education promotes the ability of citizens to rule more wisely. So, how can we deny that the educated subset would rule more wisely than others. But then why shouldn't they have more votes?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Estlund goes on to criticize Mill's education-based meritocracy on various grounds.

===19th century===
In the United States, the federal bureaucracy used the [[Spoils System]] from 1828 until the assassination of United States President [[James A. Garfield]] by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. Two years later in 1883, the system of appointments to the United States Federal Bureaucracy was revamped by the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], partially based on the British meritocratic civil service that had been established years earlier. The act stipulated that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit, through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government employees for political reasons.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3115 |title=Civil Service Reform |work=Digital History |publisher=[[University of Houston]] |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; In the modern American meritocracy, the president may hand out only a certain number of jobs, which must be approved by the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]].

Australia began establishing public universities in the 1850s with the goal of promoting meritocracy by providing advanced training and credentials. The educational system was set up to service urban males of middle-class background, but of diverse social and religious origins. It was increasingly extended to all graduates of the public school system, those of rural and regional background, and then to women and finally to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Horne, and Geoffrey Sherington, "Extending the educational franchise: the social contract of Australia's public universities, 1850-1890,"  ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2010) 46#1 pp 207-227&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the middle classes and the working classes have promoted the ideal of meritocracy within a strong commitment to "mate-ship" and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Henry|title=Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_FSMpdmK3oC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to today===
[[Singapore]] describes meritocracy as one of its official guiding principles for domestic public policy formulation, placing emphasis on academic credentials as objective measures of merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html Speech by Singapore Ambassador to France], 28 August 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193448/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is criticism that, under this system, Singaporean society is being increasingly stratified and that an elite class is being created from a narrow segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|title=Singapore's elites|author=Ngiam Tong Dow|date=28 October 2006|publisher=Little Speck|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101220026/http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|archive-date=1 November 2006|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has a growing level of tutoring for children,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wyomingfreelibrary.org/growing-trend-of-uplifting-education-business-in-singapore/|title=Growing trend of uplifting education business in Singapore|newspaper=Free Library and Tuition|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and top tutors are often paid better than school teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/1-billion-spent-tuition-one-year|title=$1 billion spent on tuition in one year|newspaper=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.epigami.sg/blog/2015-private-tuition-rates-singapore/|title=2015 Private Tuition Rates in Singapore {{!}} Epigami Blog|date=2015-01-21|newspaper=Epigami Blog|access-date=2016-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants{{Who|date=May 2018}} recall the ancient Chinese proverb "Wealth does not pass three generations" ({{zh|c=富不过三代}}), suggesting that the [[nepotism]] or [[cronyism]] of elitists eventually will be, and often are, replaced by those lower down the hierarchy.

Singaporean academics are continuously re-examining the application of meritocracy as an ideological tool and how it's stretched to encompass the ruling party's objectives. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that  "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=January 2008|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=29|issue=7-27|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in the Singaporean context relates to the application of pragmatism as an ideological device which combines strict adherence to market principles ''without'' any aversion to social engineering and little propensity for classical social welfarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/16/how-singapore-is-fixing-its-meritocracy/|title=Opinion {{!}} How Singapore is fixing its meritocracy|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is further illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan in subsequent articles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a strong ideological quality in Singapore's pragmatism, and a strongly pragmatic quality in ideological negotiations within the dynamics of hegemony. In this complex relationship, the combination of ideological and pragmatic maneuvering over the decades has resulted in the historical dominance of government by the PAP in partnership with global capital whose interests have been advanced without much reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=9 Dec 2011|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Within the [[Ecuador]]ian Ministry of Labor, the Ecuadorian Meritocracy Institute&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014509/http://www.meritocracia.gob.ec/ Web page of "Instituto Nacional de Meritocracia de Ecuador"] , 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was created under the technical advice of the [[Singapore]]an government.

Most contemporary political theorists, including [[John Rawls]], reject the ideal of meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Justice|last=Rawls|first=John|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, Thomas Mulligan has defended meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Meritocratic State|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|date=|title=Plural Voting for the Twenty First Century|url=https://academic.oup.com/pq/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pq/pqx046/4157866|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=What's Wrong with Libertarianism: A Meritocratic Diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a just society is one in which there is equal opportunity and people are judged on their merits.

==Modern meritocratic movements==

===The Meritocracy Party===
In 2007 an anonymous British group called The Meritocracy Party published its first manifesto, to which they have now added more than two million words on the subject (discussing [[Hegel]], [[Rousseau]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], and various other philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries). In summary, The Meritocracy Party wants to achieve the following:

# A world in which every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life.
# The abolishment of party politics.
# Only those with a relevant education and work experience should be allowed to vote, rather than just anyone who has reached the age of 18 or 21.
# The introduction of 100% inheritance tax, so that the super-rich can no longer pass on their wealth to a select few (their privileged children). This would mean the end of the elite dynasties and hereditary monarchy.
# A radically reformed educational system, based on the [[MBTI]] personality types, and insights from radical innovators such as [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Maria Montessori]].
# To replace [[free market capitalism]] with [[social capitalism]] and to replace democracy with a fully transparent meritocratic republic, under a meritocratic constitution.
# The end of [[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], discrimination, privilege and unequal chances.

On their website The Meritocracy Party lists five meritocratic principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=ug4xDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=meritocracy+party+uk+principles+and+goals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqxj2wdXhH&amp;sig=g7sp7-a428BizCKj3GroxrLX4LQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ0KaV4KTWAhVF3IMKHQ9lBhMQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=meritocracy%20party%20uk%20principles%20and%20goals&amp;f=false|title=The Citizen Army|last=Spartacus|first=Brother|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|year=|isbn=9781326642167|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thirteen primary aims. The Meritocracy International is the host of all meritocratic political parties in the world and the place where these may be found by country of origin.&lt;ref name="keran"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Just-world hypothesis}}
The term "meritocracy" was originally intended as a negative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Michael Young, 86, Scholar; Coined, Mocked 'Meritocracy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/michael-young-86-scholar-coined-mocked-meritocracy.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary concerns with meritocracy is the unclear definition of "merit".&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Bowles and Durlauf. ''Meritocracy and Economic Inequality''. Princeton, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered as meritorious can differ with opinions as on which qualities are considered the most worthy, raising the question of which "merit" is the highest—or, in other words, which standard is the "best" standard. As the supposed effectiveness of a meritocracy is based on the supposed competence of its officials, this standard of merit cannot be arbitrary and has to also reflect the competencies required for their roles.

The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern. As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities. [[Standardized test]]ing, which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]], commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.

The level of education required in order to become competitive in a meritocracy may also be costly, effectively limiting candidacy for a position of power to those with the means necessary to become educated. An example of this was Chinese student self-declared messiah, [[Hong Xiuquan]], who despite ranking first in a preliminary, nationwide [[imperial examination]], was unable to afford further education. As such, although he did try to study in private, Hong was ultimately noncompetitive in later examinations and unable to become a bureaucrat. This economic aspect of meritocracies has been said to continue nowadays in countries without free educations, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], for example, consisting only of justices who attended [[Harvard]] or [[Yale]] and generally only considering clerkship candidates who attended a top-five university, while in the 1950s the two universities only accounted for around one fifth of the justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death by Degrees|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-14/the-intellectual-situation/death-by-degrees/|website=[[n+1]]|publisher=n+1 Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if free education were provided, the resources that the parents of a student are able to provide outside of the curriculum, such as tutoring, exam preparation, and financial support for living costs during higher education will influence the education the student attains and the student's social position in a meritocratic society. This limits the fairness and justness of any meritocratic system.

Another concern regards the principle of incompetence, or the "[[Peter Principle]]". As people rise in a meritocratic society through the social hierarchy through their demonstrated merit, they eventually reach, and become stuck, at a level too difficult for them to perform effectively; they are promoted to incompetence. This reduces the effectiveness of a meritocratic system, the supposed main practical benefit of which is the competence of those who run the society.

In his book ''Meritocratic Education and Social Worthlessness'' (Palgrave, 2012), the philosopher [[Khen Lampert]] argued that educational meritocracy is nothing but a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] version of social Darwinism. Its proponents argue that the theory justifies [[social inequality]] as being meritocratic. This [[social theory]] holds that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] is a model, not only for the development of biological traits in a population, but also as an application for human [[social institution]]s—the existing social institutions being implicitly declared as [[normative]]. Social Darwinism shares its roots with early [[progressivism]], and was most popular from the late nineteenth century to the end of [[World War II]]. Darwin only ventured to propound his theories in a biological sense, and it is other thinkers and theorists who have applied Darwin's model normatively to unequal endowments of human ambitions.

{{efn|name=fna|This is the history of the meritocracy in the technical sense. The vaguer definition of a meritocracy as a "rule by intelligence" has been applied to many ancient Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Jewish thinkers and statesmen.

The '''Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Respublikasının Təhsil Nazirliyi}}) is a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan]] in charge of regulating the [[Education in Azerbaijan|education system in Azerbaijan]]. The ministry is headed by Jeyhun Bayramov.&lt;ref name="Management"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-10-08|title=Management|url=https://edu.gov.az/en/page/38|website=Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/world-leaders-1/AJ.html |title=Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments |website=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Education Ministry was one of the government agencies established on May 18, 1918 when [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] declared independence. The first agency named the ''Ministry of Public Enlightenment'' consisted of three departments: General Secondary Education, Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, Vocational Schools. [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan]] approved the motion on June 30, 1920. 
[[File:Azerbaijani students in Paris 1920.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Group of Azerbaijani students studying in [[Paris]] in 1920]]
After Soviet rule was established in Azerbaijan on April 28, 1920, the ministry was transformed into the ''Commissariat of Public Enlightenment'' by the decree No.1 of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR bringing all educational institutions in the republic under its direct supervision.
In 1940, Council of Ministers approved creation of a separate government agency ''Department of Labour Reserves'' which would oversee the activities of vocational institutions. In 1959, the authorities transformed the entity into ''State Committee of Vocational Education'' which functioned until 1988. In 1959, Council of Ministers also approved establishment of the ''Committee of Higher and Secondary Special Education'' transferring all institutions of secondary and higher education under its control which from 1964 until 1988 acted as an independent government agency. In 1988 all education agencies were abolished by the decree of the Council of Ministers and ''Ministry of National Education'' was founded in their place. The Ministry was reorganized into ''Ministry of Education'' by the [[President of Azerbaijan|Presidential order]] on September 3, 1993. The ministry regulations were approved by the Presidential decree dated March 1, 2005. In 2013 Mikayil Cabbarov was appointed the Minister of Education.

'''Moi University''' is a [[public university]] located in Kesses, Uasin Gishu county, in the former Rift Valley Province of [[Kenya]]. It was established in 1984 by the Moi University Act of the [[Parliament of Kenya]], after recommendations from the McKay Commission.

The current chancellor of the university is [[Professor]] [[Miriam Were]] while the vice-chancellor is Professor Isaac Sanga Kosgey.

==History==
Moi University was first established in 1984. In its first year of existence, there was only one department - the Department of Forestry, which had been transferred from the [[University of Nairobi]]. The enrollment that year was 83.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150318000224/https://mu.ac.ke/index.php/bonus-page/typography Vision, Mission and Core Values: Introducing Moi University], Moi University&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's first VC was Professor D. Odhiambo, who served from 1984 to 1988. 

The university's school of medicine was established in 1996, and was the second school of medicine established in [[Kenya|the country]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mu.ac.ke/index.php/bonus-page/schools/113-chs Schools and Colleges: College of Health Sciences], Moi University&lt;/ref&gt;

===MU in the 21st century===
Most of the university's campuses became fully fledged universities in the early 2010s.

The [[Garissa University College attack]] of 2015 happened at the university's Garissa campus and this helped so much in academic accommodation of students who were the victims of the attack and this shows more golden side of understanding power and compassion by the entire moi university fraternity. 

From its founding, the University had no officially recognised mascot. However, in early 2017, students from the School of Engineering chose the [[Nandi Bear]] to be their mascot and, pending consensus from other Schools, the University's mascot. {{fact|date=December 2018}} It was chosen for its legendary status among the [[Nandi people]] (the university was founded in Kesses, which was predominantly settled by the Nandi) and was given a temporary name - "Kerit the Bear".{{fact|date=December 2018}}

The '''Northeast Ohio Master of Fine Arts Program''' ('''NEOMFA''') is a three-year graduate level consortial [[creative writing]] program located in [[Northeast Ohio]]. The NEOMFA has a unique collaborative design in which students attend all four universities in the consortium: [[Cleveland State University]], [[The University of Akron]], [[Kent State University]], and [[Youngstown State University]]. Poet [[Mary Biddinger]] is current director of the program.  Students are able to take classes at any of the four campuses, while being part of one unified writing program. The NEOFMA offers courses in poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, playwriting, and literary translation. 

Since its inception in 2005, the NEOMFA has offered small-group workshops, open readings, summer travel fellowships, and high-profile visiting writers in addition to career-preparing internships and competitive graduate funding. Students have the opportunity to intern with literary presses at all four universities, in theater at the [[Cleveland Public Theater]], and in arts management through outreach programs.

'''Openness''' is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and free, unrestricted access to knowledge and [[freedom of information|information]], as well as collaborative or cooperative management and [[decentralized decision-making|decision-making]] rather than a central [[authority]].&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Michael|title=The Idea of Openness: Open Education and Education for Openness|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|work=The Encyclopaedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|accessdate=1 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20140501132743/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|archivedate=1 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Openness can be said to be the opposite of [[secrecy]].&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;

== In government ==
{{Main article|Open government}}
'''Open government''' is the governing [[doctrine]] which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public [[Regulation|oversight]].&lt;ref name="ruma"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Lathrop |editor2-first=Laurel |editor2-last=Ruma |title= Open Government: Transparency, Collaboration and Participation in Practice |publisher= O'Reilly Media |date=February 2010  |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24435672M/Open_Government |isbn= 978-0-596-80435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Openness in government applies the idea of [[freedom of information]] to information held by authorities and holds that citizens should have the right to see the operations and activities of government at work.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkinshaw|first=Patrick|title=FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND OPENNESS: FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS?|journal=Administrative Law Review|volume=58|issue=1|pages=177–218|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=ac4899af-cdac-4b67-8b67-d0f7951e70b3%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=20477744&amp;anchor=AN0020477744-10|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since reliable information is requisite for accountability, freedom of access to information about the government supports government accountability and helps protect other necessary rights.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"/&gt;

[[Open content]] and [[free content]] both refer to creative works that lack restrictions on how people can use, modify, and distribute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Definition |title=Definition of Free Cultural Works |accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html |title=Free Software and Free Manuals |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = New Free License to Cover Content Online| work = Netly News|accessdate = 2010-01-12| date = 1998-07-18| url = http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619122406/http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archivedate = 2000-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The terms derive from [[open source software]] and [[free software]], similar concepts that refer specifically to software.&lt;ref name="Open Content"&gt;{{cite web

== In education ==
{{Main article|Open education}}
Open education refers to institutional practices and programmatic initiatives that broaden access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.  By eliminating [[barriers to entry]], [[open education]] aids freedom of information by increasing accessibility.

Open Education advocates state people from all social classes worldwide have open access to high-quality education and resources. They help eliminate obstacles like high costs, outmoded materials, and legal instruments. These barriers impede collaboration among stakeholders. Cooperation is crucial to open education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-education|title=What is open education?|work=Opensource.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Open Education Consortium claims “Sharing is a fundamental attribute of education. Education means the sharing of knowledge, insights, and information with everybody. It is the foundation of new wisdom, ideas, talents, and understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oeconsortium.org/|title=The Open Education Consortium {{!}} The Global Network for Open Education|website=www.oeconsortium.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.”Open Educational Resources refer to learning materials that educators can improve and modify with permission from their publishers or authors. Creators of OERs are allowed to include a variety of items such as lesson plans, presentation slides, lecture videos, podcasts, worksheets, maps, and images&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-are-open-educational-resources-oers/|title=What are Open Educational Resources (OERs)? {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== In information technology ==
{{Main article|Code of Openness}}
Openness is a capability provided by an IT system, and it is characterized by interoperability, portability and extensibility. These capabilities are implemented using IT interfaces, standards and the [[Information technology architecture|IT architecture]]. All these are technical aspects of openness. Openness is also based on non-technical aspects, which are related to the partnership between the involved partners (IT customers, IT vendors and/or IT service providers).&lt;ref name="CPO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Vettermann|title=Code of Openness|url=http://www.prostep.org/en/cpo.html|website=CPO|publisher=ProSTEP iViP|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18293">{{Accounting}}
The '''philosophy of accounting''' is the conceptual framework for the professional preparation and auditing of [[financial statement]]s and [[accounting|accounts]].  The issues which arise include the difficulty of establishing a ''true and fair'' [[Value (economics)|value]] of an [[Business|enterprise]] and its [[asset]]s; the [[morals|moral]] basis of disclosure and discretion; the standards and laws required to satisfy the [[politics|political]] needs of [[investor]]s, [[employee]]s and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.

The discipline of accounting insists that transparency is achievable. Fairness has an important role in the practice of accounting. Accordingly, it seems appropriate that philosophy as a relevant way of understanding truth and fairness in accounting is well considered. Some authors have already underlined the key role played by philosophy in accounting such as social justice, ethical conscience, economic entitlement etc. Thus concepts like fairness, justice, equity, and truth have a due place in accounting.

== Introduction ==
Often, accountants are trusted to provide the knowledge such as financial statement in which financial/managerial decisions are based. According to the [[IASB]] project, conceptual framework, it states the role of financial report as &lt;blockquote&gt;'The primary users need information about the resources of the entity not only to assess an entity's prospects for future net cash inflows but also how effectively and efficiently management has discharged their responsibilities to use the entity's existing resources'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2010|url = http://www.iasplus.com/en-gb/standards/other/framework|website = www.iasplus.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Such great significance is put on the role of accounting in business industry yet the issue of trust has always been the fundamental problem. Mackenzie says 'Trust in numbers, however, works only if those who produce the numbers can be trusted.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Empty Cookie Jar|last = Mackenzie|first = D|publisher = London Review of Books 25|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluating and understanding the fundamental ideas of accounting is extremely important as they establish the foundational structures of accounting in which most of the constructed knowledge is based on. It introduces the principles of accounting which provide the understanding of reasons behind all decisions.

== Objectives of accountancy ==
Financial reporting aims to provide information about firms' financial performance of which the firm uses to record the past transactions and apply changes to the future financial plan.

=== [[IASB]] (International Accounting Standard Board) ===
The ultimate aims of the IASB and other accounting standard-setters are:
* to develop, in the public interest, a single set of high quality, understandable and enforceable global accounting standards that require high quality, transparent and comparable information in financial statements and other financial reporting to help participants in the world’s capital markets and other users make economic decisions;
* to promote the use and rigorous application of those standards;
* in fulfilling the objectives associated with (a) and (b), to take account of, as&lt;br&gt;- appropriate, the special needs of small and medium-sized entities and emerging&lt;br&gt;- economies; and to bring about convergence of national accounting standards and IFRSs to high quality solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Working relationships with local standard -setters|url = http://www.ifrs.org/Use-around-the-world/Pages/Working-relationships-with-local-standard-setters.aspx|website = www.ifrs.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Ifrs|IFRS]] (International Financial Reporting Standard) ===
The mission of IFRS is to bring transparency, accountability and efficiency to financial markets around the world. It aims to build trust in the society and also to provide long-term financial stability. 
* IFRS brings '''transparency''' by enhancing the international comparability and quality of financial information, enabling investors and other market participants to make informed economic decisions.
* IFRS strengthens '''accountability''' by reducing the information gap between the providers of capital and the people to whom they have entrusted their money.   Our standards provide information that is needed to hold management to account. As a source of globally comparable information, IFRS is also of vital importance to regulators around the world.
* IFRS contributes to economic '''efficiency''' by helping investors to identify opportunities and risks across the world, thus improving capital allocation. For businesses, the use of a single, trusted accounting language lowers the cost of capital and reduces international reporting costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IFRS - Mission Statement|url = http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Pages/IFRS-Foundation-and-IASB.aspx|website = www.ifrs.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundational perspectives ==

=== Art versus science perspective ===
Art is defined as the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = art - definition of art in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[philosophy of art]] also deals with the nature of human creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cambridge dictionary of philosophy|last = Audi|first = Robert|publisher = Cambridge Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is defined as the knowledge acquired through observation and experimentation which is critically tested, systematised and brought under general principles. The philosophy of science is the investigation of questions that arise from reflection upon the science and scientific practice.

Mattessich says making the accounting discipline more scientific would not be achievable. 'In its functional perspective, accounting can be defined as the generic term for the activities carried out by accountants but also as a broad term that covers the preparation, analysis and audit for all financial information thus as the art of accounting.'&lt;ref&gt;Buys, P. (2008). In pursuit of a foundational accountancy philosophy. ''Koers Koers - Bulletin For Christian Scholarship''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== True income versus decision usefulness ===
This perspective discusses whether the financial paper should provide the information that reflects the true income or that supports decision making which is not necessarily objective or factually true.

==== True income thought ====
‘Measurement of wealth and its effectiveness is judged based on how well it approximates the value of the wealth items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A note on the information perspective and the conceptual framework|last = Sundem|first = G.L|publisher = Springer: Science and Business Media|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 282–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;' Although one can argue that the meaning of 'true value' needs to be defined and it is true, but at least there exists a value and the accountants attempt to measure it.

==== Decision usefulness thought ====
'This approach focuses on measuring and disclosing business in effectiveness is judged based on how well such disclosure and communication are concluded.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Financial accounting theory and analysis|last = Schroeder|first = R.G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New Jersey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the businesses try to reduce uncertainty, the multidimensionality of any businesses makes the effective communication difficult to achieve.

== Approaches ==
In accounting, it is obligatory to follow the prescribed structure that the pre-factual controversies can be engaged in. In science, the knowledge can be principle negotiable and changeable but in accounting, standards are pre-established in the allowable form of knowledge which must be followed. This may seem insignificant as most other sciences operate in a given paradigm yet it provides different motivation: scientists can pursue to seek knowledge at a paradigmatic level yet accountants are restricted and only able to know about particularities in a way that is consistent with their existing knowledge.

=== Technocratism ===
The word ''technical'' is in relation to accounting work as applying techniques of knowledge construction that are generally and mostly factual. It can be derived from various accepted readings of accounting standards, or from generally accepted accounting principles. Hence, technocratism refers to a belief that the best method of crystallising and resolving the controversies is a technical one.

==== Economic rationalisation ====
Max Weber adopts the term ''rationalisation'' to illustrate the gradual increase in what he calls ''rationality'' in societies. Formal rationality is described as 'calculability of means and procedures'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The limits of rationality: An Essay on theSocial and Moral Thought of Max Weber|last = Brubaker|first = R|publisher = London: George Allen and Unwin|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber defines economic rationalisation as&lt;blockquote&gt;'The extent of quantitative calculation or accounting which is technically possible and which is actually applied.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology|last = Weber|first = Max|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1968|isbn = |location = CA|pages = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nowadays, there are many evidence of economic rationalisation in the society. Accounting practice is becoming more complex and strictly monitored. This is also accompanied by an increasing contribution of accounting to firms’ managerial actions.

==== Problematic consequence ====
Due to the limitation of scope, it can promote a limited conception of the responsibilities in constructing new knowledge, accounting being heavily based on pre-established and factual standards. Also when accountants argue, technocratic authority can deny any other perspectives. Although technocratism encourage a mechanical, quantitative, and factual way of thinking, this can lead to an elimination of all grey area which can have detrimental effect on firms’ financial/managerial decisions.

=== [[Pragmatism]] ===
Unlike technocrats, pragmatic accountants are rather liberal and accept various possible means when a controversy can be resolved. Matthew Gill argues that&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Accountants’ training tends to establish a distinction between technical knowledge that can be transmitted in a training centre’s classroom, and a capacity for judgement that can only be acquired on the job. Additionally (and ironically), the more complex and technocratic accounting regulation becomes, the more pragmatically  accountants must approach their work in order to get anything done.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = accountants' truth knowledge and ethics in the financial world|last = Gill|first = Matthew|publisher = Oxford|year = 2009|isbn = |location = United States|pages = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pragmatic accountants also argues that there needs to be a balance between being fair and allowing the business to operate without too many disruptions.

==== Strategic pragmatism ====
Technocratism and strategic pragmatism don’t always contradict each other. Especially in risk assessment, risk bridges the gap between technicality and pragmatic strategy by making strategy a technical matter. [[Niklas Luhmann]] states that&lt;blockquote&gt;‘The individualism of risk-calculating merchants, learning from experience, attentive to news, making decisions on the basis of a well-judged mix of trust and distrust…’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Familiarity, Confidence, Trust: Problems and Alternatives|last = Luhmann|first = N|publisher = Oxford|year = 1988|isbn = |location = Blackwell|pages = 94–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This discussion extends to the technocratic project of making things quantifiable by calculating and evaluating the possibilities of probable consequences.

== Ethics in accounting ==
The nature of accounting establishes a unique position of trust in relation to the clients, employers and general public, who count on accountants' professional judgment and advice in making financial/managerial decisions.'They have the responsibility to ensure that their duties are performed in conformity with the ethical values of honesty, integrity, objectivity, due care, confidentiality, and the commitment to the public interest before one’s own.'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The role of  ethics in accounting|url = http://www.cimaglobal.com/Thought-leadership/Newsletters/Regional/The-CIMA-Edge-South-Asia-and-Middle-East/20111/July--August-2011/The-role-of-ethics-in-accounting/|website = www.cimaglobal.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories of ethics ===
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|Jeremy Bentham is the founder of utilitarianism]]

==== [[Utilitarianism]] ====
&lt;blockquote&gt;'The doctrine that an action is right in so far as it promotes happiness, and that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should be the guiding principle of conduct.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Organizational Ethics in Accounting:  A Comparison of Utilitarianism and Christian Deontological Principles|last = Masten|first = Katherine|publisher = Liberty University|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of the idea, argues that the more happiness there are in the decision, the better decision it is. However, happiness is an unquantifiable concept. [[John Stuart Mill]] supported the idea of utilitarianism but he developed an idea into more detailed one. He believes that there exists a different levels of happiness. &lt;blockquote&gt;'It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to beSocrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is only because they only know their own side of the question.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Utilitarianism|last = Mill|first = John Stuart|publisher = Hackett Publishing Co|year = 1879|isbn = |location = Lonodn|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Theory of rights ====
The theory of rights derives from the belief that people have certain rights as they are being born as human beings which must be respected. Hence, according to this theory, an ethical decision is one that considers the rights of others. On the other hand, a decision is unethical to the extent that it violates another person’s rights. Generally, there are two categories of rights:

(1) natural rights- rights that exist independently of any legal obligations, often known as human rights and

(2) Legal rights and contractual rights- rights that are respected due to social agreement.

Amongst natural rights, the right of truth is the most significant in the function of accounting. The clients who request financial statements have the right to be provided with truthful and accurate financial information in order to make choices in constructing financial strategies. This right enforces a moral obligation on the accountants to produce legitimate and objective/true financial statements. On the other hand, legal and contractual rights are well-regarded in the relationship between accountants and employers and between accountants and clients.

[[File:Logo de Enron.svg|thumb|Enron was one of the biggest energy companies in America
]]

==== [[Enron]] ====
Enron's bankruptcy in December 2001 provides a significant example of the issues of trust in accounting.

===== Golden era of Enron =====
In 1985, Enron was formed by [[Kenneth Lay]] merging the natural gas pipeline companies of [[Houston Natural Gas]] and [[InterNorth]].  From 1990s to 1998, Enron's stock increased  311% percent which was only slightly higher than the average growth. Then the stock increased by 56% in 1999 and a further 87% in 2000. By December 31, 2000, Enron's stock was valued at $83.13.  In addition, Enron was rated the most innovative large company in America in ''Fortune'''s Most Admired Companies survey.
[[File:EnronStockPriceAug00Jan02.jpg|thumb|falling stock of Enron]]

===== Downfall =====
August 22, 2001 - [[Sherron Watkins]] gives Kenneth Lay a six-page letter further explaining Enron's accounting issues.

October 16, 2001 - Enron announces a third quarter loss of $618 million.

October 31, 2001 - The SEC opens a formal investigation into Enron's transactions.

November 9, 2001 - Enron and [[Dynegy]] announce the $7.8 billion merger agreement. It would form Dynegy Corp, in which Dynegy would own 64% and Enron 36%.

November 28, 2001 - Dynergy announces it has terminated merger talks with Enron.

December 2, 2001 - Enron files for Chapter 11 protection, becoming the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at that time and leaves thousands of workers with worthless stock in their pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enron Fast Facts - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/02/us/enron-fast-facts/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Maestro Planning Solutions early origins was in providing [[supply chain management software]]. The company was founded in early 2003 after winning the Venture 2002 Business Plan Writing competition.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This competition was organized by McKinsey &amp; Co and supported by Malaysia's largest [[venture capital]] company, [http://www.mavcap.com Mavcap] and the Ministry of Finance of Malaysia. With the publicity and support garnered from the win, the company was born.

In 2006, Maestro made an exploratory move into the schools market via a project for a premier Malaysian private school, Kolej Tuanku Ja'afar. Maestro used the same optimalOne platform and injected supply chain ideas into the creation of a School Management System for this project. This cross-fertilization of ideas from supply chain into the school management system was recognized by KTJ as being different from several school management systems it was evaluating at the time.

In January 2008, Maestro decided to embark on launching this school administrative software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Maestro's ongoing journey| url=http://www.maestrosolutions.com/www/news12.htm| accessdate=2009-03-20 |date=February 2009| first=Karamjit| last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an online system, and it was subsequently branded as QuickSchools.com a fully online school management system for small schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maestro makes inroads in US with software for schools |url=http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/quickschool/Article/ |accessdate=2009-07-20 |date=July 2009 |first=Azlan |last=Abu Bakar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819143608/http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/quickschool/Article |archivedate=August 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Maestro Planning Solutions raised 4.5 million [Malaysian Ringgit] in [[venture capital]] funded by [https://web.archive.org/web/20090410144900/http://www.dtacapital.com/ourportfolio.html DTA Growth Capital], Malaysia. The financing will support QuickSchool.com's expansion into the US school market and strengthen the company's R&amp;D as well as its sales &amp; marketing efforts.

Also in April 2009, Maestro received a grant of 1.06 million [[Malaysian Ringgit]] to spearhead the R&amp;D of a [Web 2.0] timetable scheduling software that will eventually be a part of QuickSchools.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Giving small companies big dreams| url=http://www.maestrosolutions.com/www/news14.htm| accessdate=2009-09-02 |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant was awarded by Mdec ([[Multimedia Development Corporation]], Malaysia).

On August 17, 2009, QuickSchools released a brand new version of its school management system based on extensive feedback from the current user base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=QuickSchools’ latest release is out| url=http://blog.quickschools.com/2009/08/18/quickschools-latest-release-is-out/| accessdate=2009-08-18 |date=August 2009| first=Anne| last=Fernando}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to software design was decided upon as best way forward because it focused more on improving the user experience. Therefore, more attention was give to introducing a simple [[user interface]] with extensive feature hiding.

One of the key improvements is to allow users to be up and running in minutes. The administrator simply registers his/her school on the website along with a custom domain for the school. The software then automatically creates and publishes a fully functional school management system in real time. The admin can then proceed to 'invite' teachers and other faculty to test out the system. Another improvement involves a 'LiveFeed' feature that creates notifications when certain activities take place.

The essential [[paradigm shift]] achieved here is the way the software reformats to match to the user's requirements. Only the features required by a specific school are made available - making the software very easy to use. This makes the [[barriers to entry]] almost negligible. QuickSchool's long-term goal is to create software that will require no [[technical support]] and no training, and this release goes a long way to achieving this.

==Service details==

===Manage school applications===
The system allows users to log details of inquiries from parents or guardians and keep track of their contact details. Student applications can also be maintained along with grades achieved during any entrance exams.

===Student information management===
Details such as picture, subjects taken, classes attended, grades and extra-curricular activities can be tracked. Student grading can also be done for end of term reports and can be printed out in [[PDF]].

===Parents' portal===
Parents can track the progress of their children on a daily basis. This makes it very hard if the student wants to cut, is missing an assignment, or is just plain tardy. The system will be sending parents e-mail  notification as soon as the teacher marks a student late/absent.

===Other features===
Schedules can be generated for students, teachers, subjects and classrooms. Flexible to the type of information that the school wants to track about students. Foreign language character support for Arabic &amp; Chinese are currently available.

==Business model==
{{Empty section|date=November 2012}}

'''Sylvan Learning, Inc.''' (formerly '''Sylvan Learning Corporation''') consists of [[franchising|franchised]] and corporate supplemental learning centers which provide personalized instruction in [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], study skills, homework support, and [[test preparation]] for college entrance and state exams. Sylvan provides personalized learning programs and primarily serves students in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] education.

==History==

Sylvan Learning began in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1979 at the Sylvan Hill Medical Center Building.  It was founded by former school teacher W. Berry Fowler, who had also worked with the educational company The Reading Game.  By 1983, Sylvan had dozens of franchises and moved its headquarters to [[Bellevue, WA]]. In 1986, having over 500 franchises, Sylvan went public on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange and used funds to develop corporate learning centers in key cities. By July 1987, [[KinderCare]], then based in Montgomery, AL, owned the majority of stock and moved the company to Alabama. Most of the staff did not relocate.

In 1991 the company was taken over by R. Christopher Hoehn-Saric and Douglas L. Becker. In 1997 the company had an annual revenues of $246 million, and in addition to tutoring centers, Sylvan had expanded to offer teacher training, computerized testing, distance learning, and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sylvan's Fast Learners|url = http://pages.jh.edu/~jhumag/0998web/sylvan.html|website = Johns Hopkins Magazine|accessdate = 2015-02-22|date = September 1998|last = Cavanaugh|first = Joanne P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as Unabomber, [[Theodore Kaczynski]] criticized Sylvan Learning and alike companies in his manifesto, that was posted by [[New York Times]]. He claimed, that companies like Sylvan Learning brain-wash children to fit the society, without being able to think freely. &lt;ref&gt;Theodore Kaczynski: ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sylvan Learning was purchased by [[Apollo Management]] from Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., its parent company.&lt;ref name=walsh&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=Sylvan Learning, Changing Focus, Sells K-12 Sector|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2003/03/19/27sylvan.h22.html|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=Education Week|date=19 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=renamed /&gt; (Sylvan Learning Systems Inc. shifted focus to [[post-secondary education]], and to reflect that change was renamed [[Laureate Education]] in 2004.)&lt;ref name=renamed&gt;{{cite news|title=Sylvan Learning Renamed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/18/business/sylvan-learning-renamed.html|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, John McAuliffe was named as Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sylvan Learning Franchise Opportunities {{!}} Meet Our Leadership Team|url = http://franchiseblog.sylvanlearning.com/leadership-team|website = franchiseblog.sylvanlearning.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = Sylvan|last = Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sørlandet.JPG|thumb|right|''Sørlandet'' at the [[SAIL Amsterdam]] event in 2010]]

'''''Sørlandet''''' is a Norwegian heritage [[Tall Ship]] and the world’s oldest [[full rigged ship]] still in operation. The Sørlandet  is one of the very few full rigged ship in the world. She is the senior of the existing Norwegian built square riggers, and for more than 50 years she held a central position in the education and training of young people. She is the second oldest of three Norwegian tall ships, the “Great Trio of Norway”, which besides her includes [[Statsraad Lehmkuhl]] and [[Christian Radich]].

==History==
Construction on the Sørlandet was started in 1925 at Høivolds Mek shipyard in the city of [[Kristiansand]] on the south coast of [[Norway]] based on a £25,000 grant from ship owner O.A.T. Skjelbred. Completed in May 28, 1927, she measured 210 feet in length and 577 gross tons. She was given the name Sørlandet after the Norwegian region from where she originates.

==== Maiden voyage ====
On her maiden voyage to Oslo in 1927, Sørlandet was inspected by King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav. Later in the same year, she set sail for London with 90 young trainees on board

==== Training vessel: Sørlandet’s Seilend Skoleskibs Institution ====
The original intention behind mr. SKjelbreds grant was the establishment of a training institution called Sørlandets Seilende Skoleskibs Institusjon for young sailors, and with it the construction of a fully rigged tall ship with a steel hull that could house 80 cadets and their officers. As part of “Sørlandet’s Seilend Skoleskibs Institution,” the Sørlandet played a vital role in the education of young seamen from the southern region of Norway. The young men who received their training onboard disembarques as seamen and went in to service in the Norwegian Merchant Marine or in the Royal Navy.

==== World Exhibit 1933 ====
She sailed to Chicago to take part in the World Fair in 1933. Being the first Norwegian training ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, she actually served as the Norwegian pavilion during the exhibition "Century of Progress".

==== World War II ====
The ship was in continuous service as a training vessel for the Norwegian Merchant Marine until 1939, when World War II started. The same year, she was chartered by the Royal Norwegian Navy and used as a depot ship in the naval port of Horten where the Germans seized her in April 1940. She was damaged during the war and served as an accommodation vessel for German submariners. At the end of the war she was in a degrading condition. She was restored and ready to sail in 1948.

In 1958 she was equipped with an engine, as one of the last European tall ships.

==== The 1970s ====
In 1974 she was no longer used as a public training vessel and was sold to ship owner Jan Staubo. She was registered in Arendal and laid up at anchor in Kilsund for three years. In 1977 she was again bought by Skjelbreds Rederi A/S and presented as a gift to the city of Kristiansand.  She was in great need for repairs, and through governmental and municipal funds, plus extensive voluntary labour and personal donations, she was completely restored.

==== The 1980s ====
After the repairs of the late 1970s, she was again back in service in July 1980. Some 300 trainees from 10 different nations took part in her international friendship cruises that year. Most of the foreign trainees came from the UK and USA. Both young women and men were that time on accepted.

In 1981 a foundation was established; "Stiftelsen Fullriggeren Sørlandet" has been the owner and operator of the vessel since. From 1980 to 1983 Sørlandet was the only operating Norwegian sail training ship, and the first open to men and women of all ages and nationalities.

Since 1982 she has made several Atlantic crossings, visiting ports in the USA and Canada and in the Caribbean. In all these years she has carried out a series of summer cruises in the North  and Baltic Sea and visited ports on the European  continent. She was also features in an American film shoot for Shearson American express.
In 1982, Sørlandet hosted the exhibition "Women of the Coast" whilst visiting some 60 seaside destinations along Norwegian shoreline, sailing as far north as Kirkenes. A total of 83,000 people visited Sørlandet during this tour. In 1986 she once again crossed the Atlantic to take part in the 100th Anniversary of the Statue of Liberty in New York City. From 1986 to 1988 about 500 cadets from the Royal Norwegian Navy got their first life-at-sea experience through six-week courses, sailing and training aboard Sørlandet.

==== The 1990s ====
In the latter half of the 1990s she was affiliated with the Royal Norwegian Navy, Norwegian Ship Owners' Association and the local public employment office with which she offered six-week courses in sailing and seamanship to bolster the recruitment of young seafarers.

==== The 2010s ====
From 2010 to 2014, Sørlandet hosted the Canadian school West Island College International for its program, "Class Afloat"; it offered high school and university courses in addition to sail training on board. The foundation established its own high school, A+ World Academy, the following year.

==== Restorations ====
In keeping with International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules of the 1969 convention that dictate the measurement of vessels of her class, Sørlandet is now 499 gross tons. She is well equipped with air-conditioning but is otherwise in her original condition. The main engine is of 560 HP. In 1980, Sørlandet went through a full restoration. She had extensive repairs in 1988 and again from 2003 to 2007. In the summer of 2012, Sørlandet spent four months in dry-dock at Tuzla, Istanbul, for a major restoration project which included the replacement of many of her riveted steel hull plates, support systems and a complete rebuild of the main ‘Banjer’ area, where students sleep and attend classes. 
She currently holds class *1A1 E0 in  Det Norske Veritas and a worldwide trading certificate for carrying trainees.

== High School ==
In 2015 the Foundation established its own boarding high school, A+ World Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.aplusworldacademy.org/about/history|website=A+ World Academy|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is a university preparatory secondary school, and classes are taught onboard while the Ship sails to different locations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High School at Sea (Learning Environment)|url=http://www.aplusworldacademy.org/academic/highschoolatsea|website=A+ World Academy|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has a capacity of 60-62 students in grades 11 and 12.

In the first two years of the school, they undertook a circumnavigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blog |url=http://www.aplusworldacademy.org/blog |website=A+ World Academy |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school year started in Kristiansand, Norway in August 2015 and sailed to Hong Kong via Portugal, Morocco, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Tobago, Curaçao, Colombia, Panama, Galapagos, Easter Island, Tahiti, New Caledonia, Fiji, Indonesia and Singapore. The School year ended in June 2016.  The second school year started in Hong Kong August 2016 and sailed to Kristiansand, Norway via Vietnam, Brunei, Indonesia, Christmas Island, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, South Africa, Namibia, Saint Helena, Brazil, Dominica, Puerto Rico, USA, Azores, France and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aplusworldacademy.org/admission/newsletters-magazines |title=Newsletters &amp; Magazines |website=A+ World Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the school year 2017/2018 the students are sailing from Kristiansand, Norway to Kristiansand, Norway via the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. 
The foundation oversees the A+ World Academy from its offices in Kristiansand.

==== Curriculum ====
Students follow an academic program based on Advanced Placement courses and may study subjects such as mathematics, calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, English, Spanish, politics, economics and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aplusworldacademy.org/academic/courses|title=Courses |website=A+ World Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life at the school ====
Students at the school take an active part in the day-to-day operation of the Ship. They take day- and night watches that include cleaning, maintenance, sail manoeuvring, helming, lookout, galley and safety rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aplusworldacademy.org/studentlife/Dailylife|title=Daily life |website=A+ World Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Academic Decathlon]] (USAD) is an academic competition for high school students in the United States. The Academic Decathlon consists of 10 events: [[Art]], [[Economics]], [[Essay]], [[Interview]], [[Language]] and [[Literature]], [[Math]], [[Music]], [[Science]], [[Social sciences|Social Science]], [[Speech (public address)|Speech]] and Super Quiz. Each year, one of the ten subjects is chosen as the Super Quiz, which uses a different format than the other events. The topics and theme of the competition are released in March of every year, giving students time to prepare for the competition season which runs from November to April.&lt;ref name=theme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usad.org/Curriculum/theme.asp|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Curriculum Topics and Theme|accessdate=2008-06-07|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FCurriculum%2Ftheme.asp&amp;date=2009-04-03|archive-date=2009-04-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events are split up into two groups: the seven objective tests (Art, Economics, Language and Literature, Math, Music, Science and Social Science) and the three subjective events (Essay, Interview and Speech). They are designated as such because the former seven are multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. Students are given half an hour to answer each multiple choice exam. These exams consist of 50 questions, with the exception of Math and Super Quiz which have 35 and 52 questions respectively.&lt;ref name=essential_info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usad.org/Directors/Essential.asp|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Essential Information|accessdate=2008-06-07|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603135108/http://usad.org/Directors/Essential.asp|archive-date=2008-06-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Graz''' ({{lang-de|Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz}}), located in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], is the largest and oldest [[university]] in [[Styria]], as well as the second-largest and second-oldest university in Austria.

The university was founded in 1585 by Archduke [[Charles II of Austria]]. The bull of 1 January 1586, published on 15 April 1586, was approved by [[Pope Sixtus&amp;nbsp;V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06733d.htm|title=University of Graz|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)|date=1909|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of its existence it was controlled by the Catholic Church, and was closed in 1782 by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a ''lyceum'', where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-instituted as a university by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], thus gaining the name ''Karl-Franzens-Universität'', meaning ''Charles Francis University''. Over 30,000 students are currently enrolled at the university.

The university is divided into six faculties, the two largest are the Faculty of [[Arts]] and [[Humanities]] and the Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]]. The other faculties are the Faculty of [[Law]]; the Faculty of Business, Economic and [[Social sciences]]; the Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences; and the Faculty of  [[Catholic]] [[Theology]]. The Faculty of Medicine was separated from the university by state legislation in 2004 and became an independent university – the [[Medical University of Graz]]. The faculties offer a wide range of undergraduate (BA, BSc), graduate (MA, MSc), and doctoral degree (PhD) programmes, as well as special teaching degrees in their specific areas of expertise.

Since its re-installation, the university has been home to many internationally renowned scientists and thinkers. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] was professor at the university twice, first from 1869 to 1873 and then from 1876 to 1890, while he was developing his statistical theory of heat. Nobel Laureate [[Otto Loewi]] taught at the university from 1909 till 1938 and [[Victor Franz Hess]] (Nobel prize 1936) graduated in Graz and taught there from 1920 to 1931 and from 1937 to 1938. The physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] briefly was chancellor of the university in 1936.

The University of Graz does not have a distinct faculty of engineering, however, [[Graz University of Technology]], which is focused on engineering and technology, offers inter-university undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in cooperation with the university's Faculty of Natural Sciences under the name "NAWI Graz". The main intention behind the cooperation was to avoid duplication of efforts and infrastructure, especially in cost-intensive subjects such as chemistry, industrial chemistry, physics, and geosciences, as both universities are located in close proximity to each other. Students enrolled in one of these programmes attend lectures and seminars at both universities and are awarded a combined degree at the end of their studies.

Because of the university's geographical location close to the Slovenian border and the two major Slovenian cities, [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]], it has traditionally attracted many students from Slovenia and served as a gateway to South-East Europe for Austrian scholars, scientists and businesses. The establishment of the Department for Slovene Language and Literature at the University of Graz, for example, laid the foundation for scholarly studies of Slovenian culture, literature, and language bundled in the so-called [[Slovene studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}}http://london.veleposlanistvo.si/index.php?id=3162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:University Graz.jpg|thumb|left|Front view of the central building.]]

Historically speaking, for most of its existence the University of Graz was controlled by the [[Catholic Church]]. Even after its re-installation in 1827, it took until 1848 for the university's basic principles to be readjusted in accordance with the ideals of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], meaning that the university became autonomous from the state as well as from the church and their influence as far as possible.&lt;ref name="history title=History of the University of Graz publisher=University of Graz url=http://archiv.uni-graz.at/de/geschichte/geschichte-der-universitaet"&gt;History of the University of Graz&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Catholic Theology has been retained as a part of the university ever since it was established, however, its importance in terms of number of students and its influence on the university board have been diminishing. Evidently, relations between the Catholic Church, especially the local bishop, and the university's Faculty of Theology remain strong, yet general policy is not influenced by these connections. To demonstrate the university's independence and its shift of focus, the [[Holy Name of Jesus|Christogram]] IHS on the very top of the university's seal has been replaced with the sun, symbolising the Enlightenment and von Humboldt's ideas.&lt;ref name="motto/hymn"&gt;{{cite web| title = The university's symbols: Coat of arms and hymn | publisher = University of Graz | url = http://archiv.uni-graz.at/de/geschichte/wappen-insignien-symbole-der-universitaet/ | accessdate = 13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Oslo Library''' ({{lang-no|Universitetsbiblioteket i Oslo}}, UBO) is a library connected to the [[University of Oslo]].

Like the university, it was established in 1811 with [[Georg Sverdrup]] as the first head librarian. It originally doubled as the Norwegian [[List of national libraries|national library]], and was located at the old University of Oslo campus.

In 1913 the current library building in ''Henrik Ibsens gate'' was completed. Head librarian at the time, from 1876 to 1922, was [[Axel Drolsum]].

In 1989 the institution [[National Library of Norway]] was established. It finally took over the national library tasks from the University Library in 1998, allowing the latter to concentrate on university matters. The same year, the University Library left the building in ''Henrik Ibsens gate'' for the newly constructed Georg Sverdrup's House, located at the modern University of Oslo campus at [[Blindern]].

'''Virginia A. Myers''' (8 May 1927 - 7 December 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Iowa|url=https://art.uiowa.edu/people/virginia-myers|website=University of Iowa Education Virginia Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] artist, professor, and inventor. She was born in [[Greencastle, Indiana|Greencastle]], [[Indiana]], and grew up with her parents and younger sister mostly in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where her father taught at various colleges and schools.

She studied at [[George Washington University]] and the [[Corcoran School of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and received her B.A. in drawing and painting in 1949. Then, in 1951 she went on to earn an M.F.A. in Painting from The [[California College of Arts and Crafts]], Oakland. Myers completed post-graduate work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] (Urbana) and in 1955 came to the [[University of Iowa]] to study [[printmaking]] with [[Mauricio Lasansky]]. From 1961-1962, Myers studied in Paris at [[Atelier 17]] with [[Stanley William Hayter]] under a [[Fulbright Scholarship]].

In 1962 Myers became a University of Iowa faculty member, where she taught printmaking in the School of Art and Art History. Myers taught intaglio printmaking and foil imaging, made possible by her invention of the Iowa Foil Printer, which makes use of the commercial [[foil stamping]] process.  After the invention of the press, she worked in conjunction with community members and students to improve and document the printmaking process of foil stamping using the Iowa Foil Press, and they collectively produced a book, ''Foil Imaging...A New Art Form'', in 2001.

She presented in more than 100 one-person exhibitions in the United States and abroad, and participated in more than 150 juried exhibitions and traveling shows nationally and internationally. Her work is included in collections at the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], [[Toledo, Ohio]]; and the [[Des Moines Art Center]], [[Des Moines, Iowa]], among others.

[[Virtual world]]s are playing an increasingly important role in education, especially in [[language learning]]. By March 2007 it was estimated that over 200 universities or academic institutions were involved in [[Second Life]] (Cooke-Plagwitz, p.&amp;nbsp;548).&lt;ref&gt;Cooke-Plagwitz, Jessamine (2008) "New Directions in CALL: An Objective Introduction to Second Life", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=716&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Miller, Linden Lab Vice President of Platform and Technology Development, claimed in 2009 that "Language learning is the most common education-based activity in Second Life".&lt;ref&gt;Team Engage, "8D taps language learners, bots, microtransactions", ''EngageDigital'', 20 May 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/2009/05/29/out-of-stealth-8d-taps-language-learners-bots-microtransactions/&lt;/ref&gt; Many mainstream language institutes and private language schools are now using 3D [[virtual environment]]s to support language learning.

==History==
[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. These early adventure games and simulations led on to [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains) and [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as ''Traveler'' and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. ''Traveler'' included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of ''Active Worlds'' as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adobe Atmosphere]] software platform was also used to promote language learning in the Babel-M project (Williams &amp; Weetman 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Williams C. &amp; Weetman C. (2003) Babel-M: A virtual environment for the promotion of language learning, [http://www.parapal-online.co.uk/prof/atmosphere_design.html ''Paragraph PAL''], 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the attention of language teachers. 2005 saw the first large-scale language school, [[Languagelab.com]], open its doors in Second Life. By 2007, Languagelab.com's custom [[VoIP]] (audio communication) solution was integrated with Second Life. Prior to that, teachers and students used separate applications for voice chat.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Erard M. (2007) "A Boon to Second Life Language Schools: New Technology will Allow High-Quality Audio in a Virtual World", ''Technology Review'', 10 April 2007: http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18510/page1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities, such as Monash University,&lt;ref&gt;Monash University: http://www.monash.edu.au/international/dvc/virtualworlds/monashsecondlife.html&lt;/ref&gt; and language institutes, such as [[British Council|The British Council]], [[Confucius Institute]], [[Instituto Cervantes]] and the Goethe-Institut,&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; have islands in Second Life specifically for language learning. Many professional and research organisations support virtual world language learning through their activities in Second Life. [[EUROCALL]] and [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]], two leading professional associations that promote language learning with the aid of new technologies, maintain a joint Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group (VW SIG) and a headquarters in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds SIG: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples of creating sims in virtual worlds specifically for language education include VIRTLANTIS, which has been a free resource for language learners and teachers and an active community of practice since 2006,&lt;ref&gt;VIRTLANTIS: Free Virtual World Language Learning - Come speak with the world!: http://www.virtlantis.com&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded NIFLAR project,&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded AVALON project,&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands, which have been set up as a community of educators aiming to provide information about and facilities for language learning and teaching.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;EduNation Islands wiki: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com/&lt;/ref&gt; NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;NIFLAR (Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research): http://niflar.ning.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other examples are described by Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Molka-Danielsen J. &amp; Deutschmann M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Tapir Academic Press, Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2012) Introduction to the Internet. Section 14.2.1 (Second Life) of Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm#secondlife&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007 a series of conferences known as SLanguages have taken place, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life for a 24-hour event to celebrate languages and cultures within the 3D virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slanguages.net/home.php|title=slanguages.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of second life due to increasing support for open source platforms&lt;ref&gt;Karlov, Maria (2012) "OpenSim gains record-breaking 2,177 regions",http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/09/opensim-gains-record-breaking-2177-regions/&lt;/ref&gt; many independent language learning grids such as English Grid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishgrid.com|title=keating.me Secure Email|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chatterdale&lt;ref&gt;Trombly, Anastasiahave (2012): http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/virtual-worlds-offer-variety-less-stress-for-language-learners/&lt;/ref&gt; have emerged.

==Approaches to language education in virtual worlds==
Almost all virtual world educational projects envisage a [[blended learning]] approach whereby the language learners are exposed to a 3D virtual environment for a specific activity or time period.  Such approaches may combine the use of virtual worlds with other online and offline tools, such as 2D virtual learning environments (e.g. [[Moodle]]) or physical classrooms. SLOODLE. for example, is an open-source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] with the Moodle learning-management system.&lt;ref&gt;SLOODLE is a free and open source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or OpenSim with the Moodle learning-management system: http://www.sloodle.org/moodle/&lt;/ref&gt; Some language schools offer a complete language learning environment through a virtual world, e.g. [[Languagelab.com]] and [http://www.avatarlanguages.com/home.php Avatar Languages].

Virtual worlds such as Second Life are used for the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Canfield |title=Using Immersive Learning Environments in Foreign Language Classes: Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessamine |last=Cooke-Plagwitz |title=Conversing in the Metaverse: Language Teaching and Learning in Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and task-based, game-like&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Chan |title=Developing a Meaning-focused and Task-based Virtual Learning Reality |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; opportunities they offer language learners.  As such, virtual world language learning can be considered to offer distinct (although combinable) learning experiences.

* '''Immersive''': Immersive experiences draw on the ability to be surrounded by a certain (real or fictitious) environment that can stimulate language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery A. &amp; Collins, M. (2008). Immersive Learning and Role Plays in Second Life. In K. McFerrin et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference 2008 (pp. 2628-2632). Chesapeake, VA: AACE: Retrieved from http://www.editlib.org/p/27616, 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social''': Almost all 3D virtual spaces are inherently social environments where language learners can meet others, either to informally practice a language or to participate in more formal classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Johnson|title=Virtual Worlds: Inherently Immersive, Highly Social Learning Spaces |url=http://immersiveeducation.org/library/Immersive_Learning-Johnson_and_Levine.pdf |work=The Immersive Education Initiative |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Creative''': A less-developed approach to language learning in virtual worlds is that of constructing objects as part of a language learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gavin |last=Dudeney |title=A Coffee with Gavin Dudeney |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLpb7f06LmI |work= Recording of live event at EduNation in Second Life |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is currently little documentation of such activities.

===Six learnings framework===
The "Six learnings framework" is a pedagogical outline developed for virtual world education in general. It sets out six possible ways to view an educational activity.&lt;ref&gt;Lim K. (2009) "Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds", '' Journal of Virtual Worlds Research 2,1'': http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Exploring''': learners explore a virtual world's locations and communities as fieldwork for class.
* '''Collaborating''': learners work together within a virtual world on collaborative tasks.
* '''Being''': learners explore themselves and their identity through their presence in a virtual world, such as through role-play.
* '''Building''': learners construct objects within a virtual world.
* '''Championing''': learners promote real life causes through activities and presentations in a virtual world.
* '''Expressing''': learners represent activities within a virtual world to the outside world, through blogs, podcasts, presentations and videos.

===Learning in 3D worlds===
*''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll illustrates how a 3D environment makes learning fundamentally different.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3amL-BXZRk&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''3D Virtual Worlds Learning Archetypes'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll describes 14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNjV8Fvre4U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist approaches===
3D virtual worlds are often used for [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning because of the opportunities for learners to explore, collaborate and be immersed within an environment of their choice.  Some virtual worlds allow users to build objects and to change the appearance of their avatar and of their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tuncer |last=Can |title=Learning and Teaching Languages Online: a Constructivist Approach |url=http://www.novitasroyal.org/Vol_3_1/can.pdf |work=Novitas-ROYAL |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivist approaches such as [[#Task-based language learning|task-based language learning]] and [[#Dogme language teaching|Dogme]] are applied to virtual world language learning because of the scope for learners to socially co-construct knowledge, in spheres of particular relevance to the learner.

===Task-based language learning===
[[Task-based language learning]] (TBLL) has been commonly applied to virtual world language education. Task-based language learning focuses on the use of authentic language and encourages students to do real life tasks using the language being learned.&lt;ref&gt;Nunan D. (2004) ''Task-based language teaching'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks can be highly transactional, where the student is carrying out everyday tasks such as visiting the doctor at the Chinese Island of Monash University in Second Life. Incidental knowledge about the medical system in China and cultural information can also be gained at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Island is an initiative by the Chinese Studies Program at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia designed to compliment traditional classroom-based learning with context-based, hands on learning in the virtual environment of Second Life: http://www.virtualhanyu.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tasks may focus on more interactional language, such as those that involve more social activities or interviews within a virtual world.

===Dogme language teaching===
[[Dogme language teaching]] is an approach that is essentially communicative, focusing mainly on conversation between learners and teacher rather than conventional textbooks. Although Dogme is perceived by some teachers as being anti-technology, it nevertheless appears to be particularly relevant to virtual world language learning because of the social, immersive and creative experiences offered by virtual worlds and the opportunities they offer for authentic communication and a learner-centred approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=Dogme 2.0: What "Teaching 2.0" Can Learn from Dogme ELT |url=http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/dogme-elt-web20-dogme20 |work= Avatar Languages Blog |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate = 2009-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual world WebQuests (also referred to as SurReal Quests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=SurReal Quests: Enriched, purposeful language learning in Second Life |url=http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life |work=The Knowledge Tree |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605045109/http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life/ |archive-date=5 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) combine the concept of 2D WebQuests with the immersive and social experiences of 3D virtual worlds.  Learners develop texts, audios or podcasts based on their research, part of which is within a virtual world.

===Language villages===
The concept of real-life [[English village|language villages]] has been replicated within virtual worlds to create a language immersion environment for language learners in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ton |last=Koenraad |title=How can 3D Virtual Worlds contribute to language education? |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71947093/worldcallpdf-2 |work= Paper presented at WorldCALL 2008 |accessdate = 2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Digitale School has built two virtual language villages, Chatterdale (English) and Parolay (French), for secondary education students on the OpenSim grid.&lt;ref&gt;3DLES (3D Learning Experience Services): http://www.3dles.com/en/projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual classrooms===
Hundsberger (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref&gt;Hundsberger S. (2009) ''Foreign language learning in Second Life and the implications for resource provision in academic libraries'', Arcadia Fellowship Programme, Cambridge University Library: http://arcadiaproject.lib.cam.ac.uk/docs/second_life.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; defines a virtual classroom thus:

"A virtual classroom in SL sets itself apart from other virtual classrooms in that an ordinary classroom is the place to learn a language whereas the SL virtual classroom is the place to practise a language. The connection to the outside world from a language lab is a 2D connection, but increasingly people enjoy rich and dynamic 3D environments such as SL as can be concluded from the high number of UK universities active in SL."

To what extent a virtual classroom should offer only language practice rather than teaching a language as in a real-life classroom is a matter for debate. Hundsberger's view (p.&amp;nbsp;18) is that "[...] SL classrooms are not viewed as a replacement for real life classrooms. SL classrooms are an additional tool to be used by the teacher/learner."

===Virtual tourism===
Language learning can take place in public spaces within virtual worlds. This offers greater flexibility with locations and students can choose the locations themselves, which enables a more constructivist approach.

The wide variety of replica places in Second Life, e.g. Barcelona, Berlin, London and Paris, offers opportunities for language learning through virtual tourism. Students can engage in conversation with native speakers who people these places, take part in conducted tours in different languages and even learn how to use Second Life in a language other than English.

The Hypergrid Adventurers Club is an open group of explorers who discuss and visit many different OpenSim virtual worlds. By using ''hypergrid'' connectivity, avatars can jump between completely different OpenSim grids while maintaining a singular identity and inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Hypergrid Adventurers Club: http://becunningandfulloftricks.com/hypergrid-adventurers-club/&lt;/ref&gt;

The TAFE NSW-Western Institute Virtual Tourism Project commenced in 2010 and was funded by the Australian Flexible Learning Framework's eLearning Innovations Project. It is focused on developing virtual worlds learning experiences for TVET Tourism students and located on the joycadiaGrid.&lt;ref&gt;TAFE-NSW Virtual Tourism Project: http://jokaydia.com/2010/07/20/wit-jokaydiagrid/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous learning===
Virtual worlds offer exceptional opportunities for [[Self-paced instruction|autonomous learning]]. The video ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'' by Helen Myers (Karelia Kondor in SL) is a good illustration of an adult learner's experiences of her introduction to SL and in learning Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Myers H. ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'': http://kareliakondor.blip.tv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem learning (buddy learning)===
[[Tandem learning]], or buddy learning, takes autonomous learning one step further. This form of learning involves two people with different native languages working together as a pair in order to help one another to improve their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Little D. (2001) "Learner autonomy and the challenge of tandem language learning via the Internet". In Chambers A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) ''Information and Communications Technology: a European perspective'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger&lt;/ref&gt; Each partner helps the other through explanations in the foreign language. As this form of learning is based on communication between members of different language communities and cultures, it also facilitates [[intercultural learning]]. A tandem learning group, Teach You Teach Me (Language Buddies), can be found in Second Life.

===Holodecks===
The term [[holodeck]] derives from the ''Star Trek'' TV series and feature films, in which a holodeck is depicted as an enclosed room in which simulations can be created for training or entertainment. Holodecks offer exciting possibilities of calling up a range of instantly available simulations that can be used for entertainment, presentations, conferencing and, of course, teaching and learning. For example, if students of hospitality studies are being introduced to the language used in checking in at a hotel a simulation of a hotel reception area can be generated instantly by selecting the chosen simulation from a holodeck ''rezzer'', a device that stores and generates different scenarios. Holodecks can also be used to encourage students to describe a scene or to even build a scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nergiz |last=Kern |title=Holodecks and language learning |url=http://slexperiments.edublogs.org/2009/04/22/holodecks-and-language-learning  |work=Teaching in Second Life - Reflections of a language teacher |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Holodecks are commonly used for a range of role-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Lim |title=Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds |url=http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466 |work= Journal of Virtual Worlds Research |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAVE technology===
A [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where projectors are directed to three, four, five or six of the walls of a room-sized cube. The CAVE is a large theatre that sits in a larger room. The walls of the CAVE are made up of rear-projection screens, and the floor is made of a down-projection screen. High-resolution projectors display images on each of the screens by projecting the images onto mirrors which reflect the images onto the projection screens. The user will go inside the CAVE wearing special glasses to allow the 3D graphics that are generated by the CAVE to be seen. With these glasses, people using the CAVE can actually see objects floating in the air, and can walk around them, getting a realistic view of what the object would look like when they walk around it.

O'Brien, Levy &amp; Orich (2009) describe the viability of CAVE and PC technology as environments for assisting students to learn a foreign language and to experience the target culture in ways that are impossible through the use of other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, M., Levy R. &amp; Orich, A. (2009) "Virtual Immersion: The Role of CAVE and PC Technology", ''CALICO Journal'' 26, 2: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=746&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice chat===
Earlier virtual worlds, with the exception of ''Traveler'' (1996), offered only text chat. Voice chat was a later addition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Kathleen (2006) "Voice Chat Comes to Online Games", ''Wired'', 7 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life did not introduce voice capabilities until 2007. Prior to this, independent [[VoIP]] systems, e.g. [[Ventrilo]], were used. Second Life's current internal voice system has the added ability to reproduce the effect of distance on voice loudness, so that there is an auditory sense of space amongst users.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Other virtual worlds, such as ''[[Twinity]]'', also offer internal voice systems. Browser-based 3D virtual environments tend to only offer text-chat communication, although voice chat seems likely to become more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Joey (2009) "Vivox Launches Toolbar For Browser-Based Voice Chat", ''EngageDigital'', 18 March 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/blog/2009/03/18/vivox-launches-toolbar-for-browserbased-voice-chat/&lt;/ref&gt; Vivox&lt;ref&gt;Vivox online communications services: http://www.vivox.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the leading integrated voice platform for the social web, providing a Voice Toolbar for developers of virtual worlds and multiplayer games. Vivox is now spreading into OpenSim at an impressive rate, e.g. Avination is offering in-world Vivox voice at no charge to its residents and region renters, as well as to customers who host private grids with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011) "Avination first with Vivox voice on OpenSim", ''Hypergrid Business'', 11 March 2011: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/03/avination-first-opensim-grid-to-offer-vivox-voice/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid began offering language learning and voice chat for language learners using Vivox in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011)"English learning grid launched" May 7, 2012: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/english-learning-grid-launched/&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of voice chat in Second Life in 2007 was a major breakthrough. Communicating with one's voice is the ''sine qua non'' of language learning and teaching, but voice chat is not without its problems. Many Second Life users report on difficulties with voice chat, e.g. the sound being too soft, too loud or non-existent – or continually breaking up. This may be due to glitches in the Second Life software itself, but it is often due to individual users' poor understanding of how to set up audio on their computers and/or of inadequate bandwidth. A separate voice chat channel outside Second Life, e.g. [[Skype]], may in such cases offer a solution.

==Owning and renting land in virtual worlds==
Owning or renting land in a virtual world is necessary for educators who wish to create learning environments for their students. Educators can then use the land to create permanent structures or temporary structures embedded within [[#Holodecks|holodecks]], for example the EduNation Islands in Second Life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The land can also be used for students undertaking building activities. Students may also use public sandboxes, but they may prefer to exhibit their creations more permanently on owned or rented land.

Some language teaching projects, for example NIFLAR, may be implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The Immersive Education Initiative revealed (October 2010) that it would provide free permanent virtual world land in OpenSim for one year to every school and non-profit organization that has at least one teacher, administrator, or student in attendance of any Immersive Education Initiative Summit.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2010) "Initiative: free land for educators migrating from Second Life", ''Hypergrid Business'', 15 October 2010:
http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2010/10/initiative-free-land-for-educators-migrating-from-second-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative 3D worlds==
Many islands in Second Life have language- or culture-specific communities that offer language learners easy ways to practise a foreign language (Berry 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Berry C. D (2009) [http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2009-04-06.1814922901/article.2009-04-07.1692917645 "Virtual reality and high-tech simulations breathe second life into language classes"], ''Focus'', Rutgers University: USA, NJ. Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life is the widest-used 3D world among members of the language teaching community, but there are many alternatives. General-purpose virtual environments such as Hangout and browser-based 3D environments such as ExitReality and 3DXplorer offer 3D spaces for social learning, which may also include language learning. [[Google Street View]] and [[Google Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Language Resource Center at UNC Charlotte |title=Google Earth Activities for Foreign Language Classes |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2496396767023982994&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=true |work=Presentation at Instructional Technology Showcase |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also have a role to play in language learning and teaching.

''Twinity'' replicates the real life cities of Berlin, Singapore, London and Miami, and offers language learners virtual locations with specific languages being spoken. Zon has been created specifically for learners of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Zon: A multiplayer, online learning environment designed to teach Chinese language and culture through gameplay: http://enterzon.com/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid&lt;ref&gt;English Grid: http://englishgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by education and training professionals as a research platform for delivering English language instruction using opensim.

[[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] is employed as free open source standalone software, thus enabling a decentralized configuration of all educators, trainers, and users. Scott Provost, Director at the Free Open University, Washington DC, writes: "The advantage of Standalone is that Asset server and Inventory server are local on the same server and well connected to your sim. With Grids that is never the case. With Grids/Clouds that is never the case. On OSGrid with 5,000 regions and hundreds of users scalability problems are unavoidable. We plan on proposing 130,000 Standalone mega regions (in US schools) with Extended UPnP Hypergrid services. The extended services would include a suitcase or limited assets that would be live on the client".&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Worlds Tool Ranking: http://immersive-worlds-tool-ranking.grouply.com/message/474&lt;/ref&gt; Such a standalone sim offers 180,000 prims for building, and can be distributed pre-configured together with a virtual world viewer using a USB storage stick or SD card. Pre-configured female and male avatars can also be stored on the stick, or even full-sim builds can be downloaded for targeted audiences without virtual world experience. This is favorable for introductory users who want a sandbox on demand and have no clue how to get started.

There is no shortage of choices of virtual world platforms. The following lists describe a variety of different virtual world platforms, their features and their target audiences:
*ArianeB's list of 3D Virtual Worlds: A useful list of virtual worlds and multiplayer games, including embedded videos that show how they look.&lt;ref&gt;ArianeB's list of 3D Virtual Worlds: http://arianeb.com/more3Dworlds.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chris Smith's list of virtual worlds: A comprehensive list of virtual worlds, including some embedded videos.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Smith's list of virtual worlds: http://www.shambles.net/pages/learning/ict/virtual/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Virtual Worlds List by Category: As the title suggests, a categorised list of virtual worlds. Links only, no descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds List by Category: http://www.virtualworldsreview.com/info/categories.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual world conferences==
*The first SLanguages conference took place on 23 June 2007. The SLanguages conference is now a free annual 24-hours event, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: A series of annual conferences for language teachers in Second Life: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt;
*SL Experiments is a group managed by Nergiz Kern (Daffodil Fargis in Second Life) for collecting and sharing ideas on how to use Second Life for teaching foreign languages. The group meets twice a month in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;SL Experiments: A group of language teachers interested in or already teaching in Second Life: http://slexperiments.pbworks.com/w/page/11306631/FrontPage&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Round Table conference takes place twice a year, focusing on language teaching technologies. A substantial part of the conference takes place in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Round Table: A semi-annual live online conference on language learning technologies: http://www.virtual-round-table.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education (VWBPE) is a global grass-roots community event focusing on education in immersive 3D environments.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education (VWBPE): http://www.vwbpe.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Worlds Education Roundtable (VWER) group meets each week to talk about issues that concern educators with regard to using virtual worlds as a teaching and learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds Education Roundtable (VWER): http://www.vwer.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Immersive Education Initiative (iED) Summits are conferences organized specifically for educators, researchers, and administrators. iED Summits consist of presentations, panel discussions, break-out sessions and workshops that provide attendees with an in-depth overview of immersive learning platforms, technologies and cutting-edge research from around the world. iED Summits feature new and emerging virtual worlds, learning games, educational simulations, mixed/augmented reality, and related teaching tools, techniques, technologies, standards and best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Education Inititiative (iED): http://mediagrid.org/summit/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual World Conference is an annual conference exploring the uses of virtual worlds for learning, collaborative work and business. The first event was held on 15 September 2010 and hosted entirely in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual World Conference: http://www.thevirtualworldconference.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond virtual worlds==
Virtual World Language Learning is a rapidly expanding field and it converges with other closely related areas, such as the use of MMOGs, SIEs and Augmented Reality Language Learning (ARLL).

===Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs)===
MMOGs (massively multiplayer online games) are also used to support language learning, for example the World of Warcraft in School project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowinschool.pbworks.com/w/page/5268731/FrontPage|title=World of Warcraft in School / FrontPage|publisher=WoWinSchool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic immersive environments (SIEs)===
SIEs are engineered 3D virtual spaces that integrate online gaming aspects.  They are specifically designed for educational purposes and offer learners a collaborative and constructionist environment. They also allow the creators/designers to focus on specific skills and pedagogical objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes J., Oskoz A. &amp; Thorne S. (2008) "Web 2.0, Synthetic Immersive Environments, and Mobile Resources for Language Education", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: pp. 528-546: https://calico.org/html/article_715.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augmented reality language learning (ARLL)===
[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is the combination of real-world and computer-generated data so that computer generated objects are blended into real time projection of real life activities. Mobile AR applications, such as Blippar, [[Layar]] and [[Wikitude]] enable immersive and information-rich experiences in the real world and are therefore blurring the differences between real life and virtual worlds. This has important implications for m-Learning ([[Mobile Assisted Language Learning]]), but hard evidence on how AR is used in language learning and teaching is difficult to come by.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers H. (2009) "Augmented Reality Language Learning – virtual worlds meet m-learning", Avatar Languages Blog: http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/arll/&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim is to promote social integration among users located in the same physical space, so that multiple users may access to a shared space which is populated by virtual objects while remaining grounded in the real world. In other words, it means:
*Communication
*Locked view
*Keep control
*Security

'''Ward Farnsworth''' (born 1967)&lt;ref&gt;''The AALS Directory of Law Teachers'' (West Pub. Co., 2005), p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; is the dean of the [[University of Texas School of Law]] and holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law. He is the Reporter for the [[American Law Institute]]’s [[Restatement of the Law]] Third, Torts: Liability for Economic Harm, and the author of books on law, rhetoric, philosophy, and chess.

==Education and clerkships==
Farnsworth graduated from [[Wesleyan University]], Middletown, Connecticut in 1989 (B.A.) and with high honors from the  [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1994 (J.D.).

Immediately after law school, Farnsworth served as a law clerk for Judge [[Richard A. Posner]] on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]] and then clerked for Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. He then worked as a Legal Adviser to the [[Iran-United States Claims Tribunal]] in The Hague.

==Academic career==
Prior to beginning his tenure as dean at Texas, Farnsworth taught for 15 years at [[Boston University School of Law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/farnsworth-new-dean-of-university-of-texas-school-of-law/ Farnsworth New Dean of University of Texas School of Law] Leslie Friday, BU Today&lt;/ref&gt; and served several years as associate dean for academic affairs. At BU, he taught civil procedure, torts, contracts, and rhetoric. At Texas, he teaches analytical methods, a course that offers a survey of tools that are useful for analyzing and arguing about multiple areas of law, organized around ideas from economics, cognitive psychology, jurisprudence, and rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/law/faculty/wf2794/courses/ University of Texas Law - Course Taught (Farnsworth)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in May 2012. He has received many teaching awards over the years, including the United Methodist Scholar/Teacher of the Year Award in 2009 from Boston University.

==Publications==
Farnsworth has written on a wide range of subjects.  His legal writing includes articles on economic analysis of law, constitutional law, statutory interpretation, and legal applications of cognitive psychology.  He is author of ''Restitution:  Civil Liability for Unjust Enrichment'' (Chicago 2014), and ''The Legal Analyst: A Toolkit for Thinking About the Law'' (Chicago 2007), an acclaimed guide to interdisciplinary approaches to legal thought.  He is Reporter for the American Law Institute’s Restatement Third, Torts:  Liability for Economic Harm.  He also is the co-author, with Mark F. Grady, of a casebook on the law of torts.

Farnsworth is also the author of ''Farnsworth’s Classical English Rhetoric'' (2010) and ''Farnsworth’s Classical English Metaphor'' (Godine 2016), both of which received critical acclaim.  He has written a two-volume treatise on chess, ''Predator at the Chessboard'', and is the author of a book on philosophy, ''The Practicing Stoic'' (Godine 2018).

A '''whiteboard''' (also known by the terms '''marker board''', '''dry-erase board''', '''wipe board''', '''dry-wipe board''', '''pen-board''', and '''grease board''') is any glossy, usually white surface for nonpermanent markings. Whiteboards are analogous to [[blackboard]]s, but with a smoother surface allowing rapid marking and erasing of markings on their surface. The popularity of whiteboards increased rapidly in the mid-1990s and they have become a fixture in many offices, meeting rooms, school classrooms, and other work environments.

The term ''whiteboard'' is also used metaphorically to refer to features of computer software applications that simulate whiteboards. Such "virtual Tech whiteboards" allow one or more people to write or draw images on a simulated canvas. This is a common feature of many virtual meeting, [[collaborative software|collaboration]], and [[instant messaging]] applications. The term ''whiteboard'' is also used to refer to [[interactive whiteboard]]s.

== History ==

Albert Stallion invented whiteboards while working at Alliance in the 1960s. Alliance (now known as [[PolyVision (company)|PolyVision]]) produced enameled steel for architectural cladding, but Stallion noted it could also potentially be used as a writing surface. Stallion later left Alliance to form his own whiteboard production company, MagiBoards.&lt;ref name="Whiteboards History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClean|first1=Garry|title=Whiteboards History|url=http://www.theworkplacedepot.co.uk/news/2014/08/20/whiteboards-history/|website=The Workplace Depot|accessdate=24 October 2016|date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Alliance International Group|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=24608|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiteboards became commercially available in the early 1960s, but did not become widely used until 40 years later. Early whiteboards needed to be wiped with a damp cloth and markers had a tendency to leave marks behind, even after erasing the board. &lt;ref name="Whiteboards History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClean|first1=Garry|title=Whiteboards History|url=http://www.theworkplacedepot.co.uk/news/2014/08/20/whiteboards-history/|website=The Workplace Depot|accessdate=24 October 2016|date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Whiteboard Learning"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Whiteboard Learning|url=https://www.magnatag.com/blog/2014/12/17/the-history-of-whiteboard-learning/|website=Magnatag Visible Systems|accessdate=24 October 2016|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry-erase markers for whiteboards were invented in 1975.&lt;ref name="Whiteboards History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClean|first1=Garry|title=Whiteboards History|url=http://www.theworkplacedepot.co.uk/news/2014/08/20/whiteboards-history/|website=The Workplace Depot|accessdate=24 October 2016|date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiteboards started becoming commonly used by businesses in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/11/12/google-releases-jamboard-a-high-tech-whiteboard-for-office-meetings.html "Google releases Jamboard, a high-tech whiteboard for office meetings"]. ''Toronto Star'', November 12, 2016. pageB4. Steven Overly.&lt;/ref&gt; They became more common in classrooms during the 1990s due to concerns over health problems in children with dust allergies and the potential for chalkdust to damage computers. By the late 1990s, about 21% of American classrooms had converted from [[Chalkboard|chalkboards]] to whiteboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wojenski|first1=Jerry|title=Erasing the Past, Typing the Future: Timeline of the Chalkboard|url=http://people.ischool.illinois.edu/~chip/projects/timeline/1801wojenski.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The first whiteboards were very expensive and were made of an enameled steel. Cheaper versions were then produced, including laminated chipboard, high-pressure laminates and steel boards with a white, usually polyester or acrylic, coating. Enameled whiteboards, also referred to as porcelain, and sometimes glass boards, have the advantage that markings can be erased completely; other materials tend to become stained over time. Enameled boards are more expensive and less used in commercial environments, but in more demanding environments with heavier use, such as educational establishments, porcelain boards are considered superior.

Other types of dry marker boards are also available, such as high gloss vinyl and [[coated paper]], which can be rolled up, high-density two-part high gloss paints, glass and coated acrylics and polypropylene magic whiteboards which use static electricity to cling to walls, windows, and doors.

Clear marker surfaces, made of glass or specially coated acrylic, became available around the [[2000s (decade)|mid-2000s]]. They are generally manufactured from technical glass, e.g. for monitor screen filters, which is optically coated.

=== Adhesive whiteboards ===
Whiteboard material can be bought in rolls, sheets, and pre-formed boards. Adhesive whiteboards come in either a sheet or a roll and feature a stick back enabling the user to create a custom size board or project with the material. Although adhesive whiteboard material does not come in a thick, hard glass or painted steel plate, the melamine allows for a flexible material while preserving the high-quality whiteboard attributes of other surface materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Adhesive whiteboards allow for custom projects such as dry erase wall calendars, whiteboard tables, cupboard grocery lists, indoor games for kids, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discountmagnet.com/informationcenter/resources/5-ways-to-use-whiteboards|title=5 Creative Ways to Use Dry Erase &amp; Adhesive Whiteboards|website=www.discountmagnet.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Erasable marker ===
The whiteboard pen (also called a [[whiteboard marker]] or dry erasable marker) was invented by Jerry Woolf of Techform Laboratories and later patented by [[Pilot Pen]] in 1975. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Writing surface and ink composition for marking thereon|date=Feb 16, 1971|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3563782|inventor-last=D|inventor2-last=U|inventor3-last=A|inventor-first=Atchley Raymond|inventor2-first=Liberman Isaiah|inventor3-first=Woolf Jerome|issue=US3563782 A|accessdate=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is a non-permanent marker and uses an erasable ink that adheres to the writing surface without binding to or being absorbed by it. Applications range from temporary writing with acetate sheets (for use with overhead projectors) to whiteboards and similar glossy surfaces. The erasable ink does not contain the toxic chemical compounds xylene and/or toluene, unlike permanent markers.

== Surface materials ==
There are six types of materials commonly used for whiteboard surfaces:

; [[Melamine resin|Melamine]]: A [[resin]]-infused paper which is typically used over a substrate that can range from particle board to MDF (medium density fiberboard).  Melamine boards range in quality primarily because of the amount of resin deposited on the base material.  Some melamine boards remain clean (no ghosting) for a long time, others less so.  Generally, this least expensive type of whiteboard is most commonly found in use in non-institutional applications.  They are available in any [[office supply]] stores. Performance varies widely. These boards are not suitable for heavy use, as in many educational cases, with time the paint erodes and the original surface reappears.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=How It works|url=https://www.remarkablecoating.com/how-it-works/|website=Remarkable Coating|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Painted [[steel]] or [[aluminum]]: Painted steel and aluminum dry erase also have a wide range of quality.  Painted surfaces tend to be smoother, which leads to better methods of erasing.  The painted surface is generally a multiple layer of coatings made up of a base coat in color (most commonly white) and a clear performance coating that is the dry erase component.  Paint varies from electron beam cured coatings to UV and other coating systems.  Good commercial grade painted steel or aluminum has excellent dry erase properties and many will be able to have permanent marker cleaned from the surface.  Any coated surface is susceptible to scratching.  Painted steel surfaces are magnetic and allow the use of magnets. Painted aluminum surfaces are rarely used as a base for whiteboards as they are not magnetic and are more expensive than steel.  Painted steel whiteboards are most commonly used for custom printed whiteboards.  These products are used as tracking boards, patient information boards and tournament and training boards.
; Hardcoat laminate: Here again the performance varies over a wide range depending on the amount of resin used in the manufacturer.  Basically, this category primarily uses melamine as its dry erase performance coat and therefore falls into the melamine universe.  Depending on the manufacturer (and the price) these laminate often are less porous and highly resistant to staining. Less common than other whiteboard surfaces, because they usually are used in combination with something else (a cabinet, doors or table tops for example). (This statement applies to Porcelain steel which is the only lifetime warranty available on the market)
; [[Porcelain]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]-on-[[steel]]: [[Ceramic]] fired onto a steel surface in a kiln.  They are the most durable surfaces, and most carry a lifetime [[warranty]].  They are very common in heavy-use industrial settings. They are highly scratch-resistant, although materials harder than glass, such as [[diamond]], can scratch them. They do not absorb dry erase or permanent marker ink.  They allow the use of [[magnets]].  The surface can be cleaned with any non-abrasive cleaner suitable for porcelain, then rinsed off with water to prevent smearing.  Permanent marker can be removed using a polar solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol or acetone, or by writing over it with a dry-erase marker and erasing it.
; Tempered glass:[[Tempered glass]] is easier to erase.  Most tempered glass white boards have no frame.

=== Polypropylene film ===

Innovation resulted in the use of polypropylene film. Polypropylene film has the ability to get statically charged which enable users to cling it to every surface. It works with dry whiteboard markers and wipes. Whiteboards are reusable and materials are recyclable.

[[File:William Mackey of the Jesuits.jpg|thumb|right|Father Mackey]]
'''William Joseph Mackey''' (1915 in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]] - October 18, 1995 in [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]]) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]] who was responsible for establishing the modern [[education]] system in [[Bhutan]], including its first [[high school]] (which is now its first accredited [[university]], [[Sherubtse College]]).

==Early life==
Mackey joined the Jesuits in 1932, and was [[ordained]] [[Catholic priest|priest]] in 1945. In 1946, he left Canada for the Jesuit [[mission (Christian)|mission]] in [[Darjeeling district]] of [[India]]. He served there for 17 years, during which time he participated in many education programs and was [[headmaster]] of two high schools. However, he also became unpopular with local authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jesuit+and+the+dragon:+the+life+of+Father+William+Mackey+in+the...-a030534615 The Jesuit and the dragon: the life of Father William Mackey in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan (book review)] from [[Catholic Insight]]; published September 1, 1996; retrieved November 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1963 he was ordered to leave the country.

When the [[King of Bhutan|King]] of [[Bhutan]], [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], learned of Mackey's imminent expulsion from India, he invited Mackey to become an educator in Bhutan, as part of that country's ongoing modernization efforts. Mackey accepted the invitation. As a preemptive measure, he had all his [[teeth]] removed, because he would have no access to modern [[dentistry]] in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/pubFiles/10-Spdr&amp;Pglt.pdf British-Indian Medical Service Officers in Bhutan, 1905-1947: a historical outline], by Alex McKay; published 2004 in ''The Spider and the Piglet: Proceedings of the First International Seminar on Bhutan Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Bhutan==

When Mackey arrived in Bhutan in October 1963, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] became the first [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious order]] allowed in the officially-[[Buddhist]] nation. During the three decades that followed, Mackey performed no [[conversion to Christianity|conversions]] of Bhutanese citizens, as that was forbidden under Bhutanese law.

His first school, in [[Tashigang]], was based in an abandoned cowshed and had 7 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhutanmajestictravel.com/news/2007/the-12th-death-anniversary-of-father-william-mackey.html The 12th death anniversary of Father William Mackey] at Bhutan Majestic Travel; published October 19, 2007; retrieved November 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Mackey was awarded the royal [[Royal Order of Bhutan|Druk Thuksey]] medal for his services to education in Bhutan. In 1985, he was granted honorary Bhutanese citizenship, and  in 1988, when the Jesuits had to leave the country, their schools being taken over by the Government of Bhutan, he was allowed to remain.

After his death in 1995, his obituary on Bhutanese national radio lasted 15 minutes. &lt;!-- this was mentioned in the CBC documentary. How do I cite a documentary? --&gt; Despite his wishes to be buried in Bhutan, the Darjeeling Jesuits claimed his body for burial in their own cemetery.
