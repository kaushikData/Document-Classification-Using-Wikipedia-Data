      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10539">'''Ann Rockley''' is one of Canada's foremost experts in organizing and presenting information online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/21-Rockley Ann Rockley, content management expert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216074223/http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/21-Rockley |date=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the founder and President of The Rockley Group, based in the greater Toronto Area. She regularly presents papers and workshops on subjects involving the efficient creation, management and delivery of content for organizations in North America and Europe. 
She was the lead analyst for ''The XML &amp; Component Content Management Report''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmswatch.com/CCM/Report/ ''The XML &amp; Component Content Management Report 2008''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204093144/http://www.cmswatch.com/CCM/Report/ |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Content Management Systems Watch.

==Education and early career ==
At university, Ann Rockley took a Bachelor of Science degree in Astronomy. In the early 1980s, she got her first permanent job as a junior technical writer at [[I. P. Sharp Associates]]. She went on to work for Cemcorp, Unisys, and American Express, then formed Information Design Solutions with two partners, Heather Fawcett and Sam Ferdinand. According to Gerlinde Schuller, [[information design]] is a complex, interdisciplinary, and experimental art. The partnership consulted in usability, document analysis, [[SGML]],&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Heather J. ''Using Tagged Text to Support Online Views.'' Technical Report OED-89-04. Waterloo, Ontario: University of Waterloo Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary, July 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and large-scale online documentation projects.&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann. "Ontario Hydro and SGML." ''Technical Communication: Journal of the Society for Technical Communication 40/3'' (Third Quarter, August 1993) 383-386. {{ISSN|0049-3155}}. Author affiliation: Information Design Solutions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Rockley left Information Design Solutions to start The Rockley Group. She took a master's degree in [[information science]] at the University of Toronto while continuing to work at The Rockley Group full-time.

==Involvement with the STC==
In the mid-1980s, Rockley took the initiative to revive the Toronto chapter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stctoronto.org Toronto STC]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Society for Technical Communication]], a professional organization for [[Technical communication|technical communicators]], by getting in touch with the international organization's representative for her area, Rennie Charles. The chapter was founded in 1959 but had been dormant for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stctoronto.org/membership/mem-chapter-history.htm History of Toronto STC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175401/http://www.stctoronto.org/membership/mem-chapter-history.htm |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Michelle Hutchinson, another technical communicator, assembled a group of their colleagues and presented a plan to hold regular meetings, find speakers of interest, and develop services for technical communicators. The chapter has been active ever since. Among other things, Rockley served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and was general manager for a very successful three-day, multi-stream conference in 1989. (Hutchinson served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and organized the hosting of the international society's annual conference in 1997.)

When Toronto hosted the international conference, Rockley proposed producing the conference proceedings on CD as well as in book form. She also volunteered to produce the CDs for the 2500 attendees. That was the first time it had been done. The machine-readable format proved to be so popular that it has been provided in one form or another ever since.

Rockley regularly presents papers and workshops at the annual meeting of the [http://www.stc.org international Society for Technical Communication]. She was named an Associate Fellow of the STC for her contributions to the profession, and in 2005 became a Fellow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stc.org/PDF_Files/fellows2007.pdf STC list of fellows (PDF file)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Society's highest honor.

==Teaching and writing==
Ann Rockley helped to develop the Information Design certificate program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She has taught courses in the program (information design and [[enterprise content management]]).

Rockley is the lead author of a 2002 book,&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann; Kostur, Pamela; Manning, Steve. ''Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy.'' October, 2002. 582 pages. New Riders Press, Berkeley, CA. {{ISBN|0-7357-1306-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy'', co-authored with Pamela Kostur and Steve Manning, who both worked with Ann at The Rockley Group. It has become a standard reference manual for content management. Her methodology includes [[return on investment]] calculations, which can justify the content management effort to executives.

She is also the lead author of a 2009 book,&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann; Cooper, Charles; Manning, Steve. "DITA 101: Fundamentals of DITA for Authors and Managers." May, 2009. 148 pages. The Rockley Press, Schomberg, ON, Canada. {{ISBN|0-557-07291-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;''DITA 101: Fundamentals of DITA for Authors and Managers'', co-authored with Charles Cooper and Steve Manning. It is a beginner's guide to understanding the [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] (DITA), an XML-based architecture for authoring, producing, and delivering information.

Rockley's 2015 book,&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann; Cooper, Charles; Abel, Scott. "Intelligent Content: A Primer" September, 2015. 144 pages. XML Press, Laguna Hills, CA {{ISBN|978-1937434465}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intelligent Content: A Primer'', was co-authored with Charles Cooper and [[Scott Abel]]. It is a beginner's guide to creating intelligent content—defined as content which is not limited to one purpose, technology or output—and overcoming the challenges to its adoption. Intelligent Content was published by XML Press.

==Innovation==
Facing challenges such as putting online 10,000+ pages of documentation for a nuclear power plant, Rockley has been an innovator in devising ways to handle large quantities of online information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/sigdoc/sigdoc1993.html#Rockley93 Rockley, Ann.

[[Image:Atoms for Peace stamp.jpg|thumb|American stamp of 1955 in allusion to the program Atoms for Peace]]

"'''Atoms for Peace'''" was the title of a speech delivered by U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to the [[UN General Assembly]] in New York City on December 8, 1953.
{{quote|I feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new – one which I, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have preferred never to use.

That new language is the language of atomic warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9774 | title =Address Before the General Assembly of the United Nations on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, New York City | author =Gerhard Peters, John T. Woolley | author2 =''[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]'' | publisher =ucsb.edu | date =December 8, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United States then launched an "Atoms for Peace" program that supplied equipment and information to schools, hospitals, and research institutions within the U.S. and throughout the world.  The first nuclear reactors in [[Iran]], [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb510/ |title=The Eisenhower Administration and the Discovery of Dimona: March 1958-January 1961 |last1=Cohen |first1=Avner |last2=Burr |first2=William |date= 15 April 2015|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu |publisher=National Security Archive |access-date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pakistan]] were built under the program by [[American Machine and Foundry]], a company more commonly known as a major manufacturer of bowling equipment.

==Philosophy==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
{{Eisenhower series}}
The speech was part of a carefully orchestrated media campaign, called "[[Project Candor|Operation Candor]]", to enlighten the American public on the risks and hopes of a nuclear future. It was a [[propaganda]] component of the Cold War strategy of [[containment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira Chernus. Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace. College Station TX: Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower's speech opened a media campaign that would last for years and that aimed at "emotion management,"&lt;ref&gt;Chernus 2002, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; balancing fears of continuing nuclear armament with promises of peaceful use of uranium in future nuclear reactors.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Cooke. In Mortal Hands. A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age. Bloomsbury USA, 2009,106-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was a tipping point for international focus on peaceful uses of atomic energy, even during the early stages of the [[Cold War]]. Eisenhower, with some influence from [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], may have been attempting to convey a spirit of comfort to a terrified world after the horror of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and of the [[nuclear test]]s of the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Chernus 2002, 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

It presented an ostensible antithesis to [[brinkmanship]], the international intrigue that subsequently kept the world at the edge of war.
[[File:Atoms For Peace symbol.png|thumb|left|The Atoms for Peace symbol mounted over the door to the American swimming pool reactor building during the 1955 ''International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy'' in Geneva, often called the Atoms for Peace conference.]]

However, recent historians{{Who|date=February 2018}} have tended to see the speech as a cold war maneuver directed primarily at U.S. allies in Europe. Eisenhower wanted to make sure that the European allies would go along with the shift in [[NATO]] strategy from an emphasis on conventional weapons to cheaper nuclear weapons. Western Europeans wanted reassurance that the U.S. did not intend to provoke a nuclear war in Europe, and the speech was designed primarily to create that sense of reassurance. Eisenhower later said that he knew the Soviets would reject the specific proposal he offered in the speech.

Eisenhower's invoking of "those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so clearly etched in" the [[UN Charter]] placed new emphasis upon the U.S. [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for its nuclear actions—past, present and future. This address laid down the rules of engagement for the new kind of warfare: the [[cold war]].

Two quotations from the speech follow:

{{Quote|text=It is with the book of history, and not with isolated pages, that the United States will ever wish to be identified. My country wants to be constructive, not destructive. It wants agreement, not wars, among nations. It wants itself to live in freedom, and in the confidence that the people of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life.|sign=[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]|source=}}{{Quote|text=To the making of these fateful decisions, the United States pledges before you—and therefore before the world its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma—to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.|sign=[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]|source=}}

===Effects of the speech===

Prior to Eisenhower's speech, the state of atomic development in the world was under strict secrecy. The information and expertise needed for atomic development was bound by the secret [[Quebec Agreement]] of 1943 and thus not devoted to peaceful processes, but instead as a weapon to defend against other countries which were developing and using the same weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/ManhattanProject/Quebec.shtml|title=Quebec Agreement|work=atomicarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With atomic development thus far under wraps, there were no safety protocols and no standards developed.

Eisenhower's speech was an important moment in political history as it brought the atomic issue which had been kept quiet for "national security" into the public eye, asking the world to support his solution. Eisenhower was determined to solve "the fearful atomic dilemma" by finding some way by which "the miraculous inventiveness of man would not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life." Unfortunately, Eisenhower was not completely effective in his repurposing; Eisenhower himself approved the National Security Council (NSC) document which stated that only a massive atomic weapon base would deter violence from the Soviet Union. The belief that to avoid a nuclear war, the United States must stay on the offensive, ready to strike at any time, is the same reason that the Soviet Union would not give up its atomic weapons either. During Eisenhower's time in office the nuclear holdings of the US rose from 1,005 to 20,000 weapons.

The "Atoms for Peace" program opened up nuclear research to civilians and countries that had not previously possessed nuclear technology. Eisenhower argued for a nonproliferation agreement throughout the world and argued for a stop of the spread of military use of nuclear weapons. Although the nations that already had atomic weapons kept their weapons and grew their supplies, very few other countries have developed similar weapons—in this sense, it has been very much contained. The "Atoms for Peace" program also created regulations for the use of nuclear power and through these regulations stopped other countries from developing weapons while allowing the technology to be used for positive means.

"Atoms for Peace" created the ideological background for the creation of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], but also gave political cover for the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear weapons build-up]], and the backdrop to the [[Cold War]] arms race. Under programs related to "Atoms for Peace," the U.S. exported over 25 tons of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) to 30 countries, mostly to fuel [[research reactor]]s, and is now regarded as a [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] and terrorism risk. Under a similar program, the [[Soviet Union]] (now Russia and some countries which are separated  from it ) exported over 11 tons of HEU.&lt;ref&gt;David Albright, Kimberley Kramer, "Civil HEU Watch: Tracking Inventories of Civil Highly Enriched Uranium," August 2005 (revised), p. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Better Place''' was a [[venture capital|venture-backed]] international company that developed and sold battery-charging and [[Battery swapping|battery-switching]] services for [[electric car]]s. It was formally based in [[Palo Alto, California]], but the bulk of its planning and operations were steered from [[Israel]], where both its founder [[Shai Agassi]] and its chief investors resided.

The company opened its first functional charging station the first week of December 2008 at Cinema City in Pi-Glilot near [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energyefficiencynews.com/transport/i/1688/ |title=Japan to work with Better Place on electric vehicles |publisher=Energy Efficiency News |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2009-04-19 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102951/http://www.energyefficiencynews.com/transport/i/1688/ |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first customer deliveries of [[Renault Fluence Z.E.]] electric cars enabled with battery switching technology began in Israel in the second quarter of 2012,&lt;ref name=Deliveries2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1075300_early-better-place-customer-on-israel-electric-car-experience|title=Early Better Place Customer On Israel Electric-Car Experience|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-09-13|publisher=Green Car Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at peak in mid September 2012, there were 21 operational battery-swap stations open to the public in Israel.&lt;ref name=BWSet12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.walla.co.il/?w=/111/2567559|title=מנכ"ל בטר פלייס: "מחיר הדלק עוזר לרכב החשמלי" - וואלה! עסקים וצרכנות|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by mismanagement, wasteful efforts to establish toeholds and run pilots in too many countries, the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, and a market penetration far lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi.&lt;ref name=totaled&gt;{{cite book|

==History==

===Launch===
The company was publicly launched on October 29, 2007, as Project Better Place, by [[Shai Agassi]], the company's founder and CEO at the time.&lt;ref name=totaled/&gt; According to Agassi, his vision was inspired by a question asked by [[Klaus Schwab]] at the 2005 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]]: "How do you make the world a ''better place'' by 2020?"&lt;ref&gt;Better Place: [http://www.betterplace.com/company/leadership-detail/shai_agassi/ „leadership team: Shai Agassi“] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506075955/http://www.betterplace.com/company/leadership-detail/shai_agassi/ |date=2010-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2011 it had raised $700 million, and about a third was spent in setting up the [[Battery exchange station#Battery swapping|battery switch stations]]. Also, several countries and states had offered [[tax breaks]].&lt;ref name="NYT0409"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iy4l9vBRRJme8SfFrQATcXkhDq-g?docId=d3d7f6c0b68e4a32b5269192bd725a7a  | title=AP Interview: Electric car boss sees global change | accessdate=2011-01-28 | date=2011-01-28 | agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://wwwreuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSL2716086020071227 | title=Ofer to invest $30 mln in electric car deal | accessdate=2008-12-12 | date=2007-12-27 | publisher=Reuters }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Better Place announced a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) with [[Renault-Nissan]] to build the world's first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) model for Israel. Under the agreement, Better Place would build the electric recharge grid, and [[Renault-Nissan]] would provide the [[electric vehicle]]s.

===Bankruptcy===
[[File:תחנת החלפת סוללות קצרין.JPG|thumb|A shut-down battery swap station in Israel.]]
In early October 2012, Agassi resigned from his role as worldwide Better Place CEO, and was replaced by [[Evan Thornley]], CEO of Better Place-Australia. Agassi briefly remained on the company board, but a week later he resigned from that position as well. A few days after Thornley's appointment, Better Place asked its investors for a round of emergency funding, totalling about $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

In late January 2013, Thornley was fired by Chairman Idan Ofer, and Dan Cohen was named acting CEO by the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000816321 |title=Dan Cohen appointed Better Place acting CEO |publisher=Globes |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503151511/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000816321 |archivedate=2013-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the financial problems, the Australian rollout was put on hold, as the company decided to concentrate on its two existing markets.&lt;ref name=Austonhold/&gt;
However, on 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084406_better-place-electric-car-service-files-for-bankruptcy|title=Better Place Electric-Car Service Files For Bankruptcy|author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision of the Board of Directors of the global company, Better Place Danmark A/S also decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings on the same date.&lt;ref name=BPDenmark01/&gt;&lt;ref name=BPDenmark02/&gt;

The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about {{USD|850}} million in private capital, and market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi, who expected 100,000 cars on Israeli roads by 2010.&lt;ref name=totaled/&gt; Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 cars in Denmark.&lt;ref name=NYT052613/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPost052613/&gt; Under Better Place's business model, the company owned the Fluence Z.E. batteries, so the court liquidator would have to decide what to do with customers who do not have ownership of the battery and risk being left with a useless car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000846696&amp;fid=1725 |title=Better Place CEO: A missed opportunity |author=Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu |work=[[Globes]] |date=2013-05-26 |accessdate=2013-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609030158/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000846696&amp;fid=1725 |archivedate=2013-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, an attempt to acquire Better Place was made by the Sunrise group that comprised entrepreneur Yosef Abramowitz and the [http://www.goelectric.org.il/ Association for the Advancement of Electric Transportation in Israel]. Court filings showed that the acquisition would be worth 18 million Israeli shekels ({{USD|5 million}}) for Better Place’s assets in Israel, and 25 million Israeli shekels ({{USD|7 million}}) for its intellectual property, held by Better Place Switzerland. The deal was canceled by the court after the Sunrise group failed to make the first agreed payment of 3.52 million shekels ({{USD|976,300}}), even after an extension.&lt;ref name=Globes082013/&gt;

In August 2013, the Central District Court ruled that Better Place Israel would be sold to Success Assets Ltd., owned by [[Tsahi Merkur]], for 11 million shekels ({{USD|3}}million). To effect the acquisition, Merkur was to sign a personal guarantee within seven days for the full amount of the acquisition, and a personal guarantee for a letter of indemnification covering the guarantees made by Better Place Israel's subsidiaries to the Ministry of Transport. Within 21 days, Merkur was to deposit with the company's special managers an opinion on a property on which a commitment to register a lien of up to 5 million shekels would be placed. By 30 September 2013 he was to make a payment of 2 million shekels.&lt;ref name=Globes082013/&gt; On 17 October 2013 the deal was canceled after Success Assets failed to make the required payments.

In November 2013, the court-appointed receivers decided to sell the remaining assets of Better Place in parts and liquidate the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

===History of the battery swap concept===
{{See also|History of the electric vehicle}}
The [[steam car]], the [[internal combustion engine]] automobile, and the [[electric car]] emerged as the main competing technologies in the late 1890s until the 1920s. The concept of exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896 in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks.&lt;ref name=HistEV/&gt;

The concept was first put into practice by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] through the GeVeCo battery service and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period vehicles using it covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar service was operated in [[Chicago]] for owners of [[Milburn Wagon Company|Milburn Light Electric]] cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.&lt;ref name=HistEV&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], and [[London]]| year = 2000| pages= 153–162| publisher =[[Rutgers University Press]]| isbn=0-8135-2809-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric [[forklift truck#History|forklifts]] have used battery swapping since at least 1946&lt;ref name="backbone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forklift Trucks— The Backbone Of The Industry |publisher=The MHEDA Journal |date= |url=http://www.themhedajournal.org/content/3q04/lifttrucks.php |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901014848/http://www.themhedajournal.org/content/3q04/lifttrucks.php |archivedate=1 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forklift Battery Handling Equipment|url=http://www.mtcworldwide.com/Battery/BatterySolutionsHome.aspx|publisher=Materials Transportation Company|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to help maintain 50 electric buses at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.bit.edu.cn/NewsEvents/BITNews/16059.htm|title=BIT Attends the Delivery Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games -Alternative Fuel Vehicles|date=2008-07-18|publisher=Beijing Institute of Technology |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Better Place business model===
Better Place implemented a [[business model]] wherein customers entered into [[subscription]]s to purchase driving distance similar to the mobile telephone industry from which customers contract for minutes of airtime.  The initial cost of an electric vehicle might also have been subsidized by the ongoing per-distance revenue contract just as mobile handset purchases are subsidized by per-minute mobile service contracts. Better Place's goal was to enable electric cars to sell for $5,000 less than the price of the average gasoline car sold in the United States,&lt;ref name="www.cheatsheet.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/better-place |title=Are Electric Cars About to Deliver Electrifying Profits?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036789/#40471407 |title=Shai Agassi interviewed on MSNBC's Morning Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the impact of electric cars would be minimal. For example, the [[Prius]] [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] had been sold for 13 years at a price of $4,000 more than other gasoline cars and had captured less than 2% of the worldwide car market.&lt;ref name="euractiv.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/innovation/better-place-ceo-biggest-obstacle-electric-cars-auto-industry-interview-500451 |title=Better Place CEO: Biggest obstacle to electric cars is auto industry 'skepticism'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Better Place approach was to enable manufacturing and sales of different electric cars separately from their standardized batteries&lt;ref name="CBS Morning News"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXfqGL3C2uI|people= [[Shai Agassi]], [[David Pogue]], [[Gavin Newsom]]|date= 2009-03-19  |title= Making The World A 'Better Place'|medium= YouTube|publisher= CBS News Sunday Morning; CBS Interactive, Inc|location   = San Francisco, CA|time= 3:45|quote= Shai Agassi: "We [Better Place] don't let you [the customer] buy a battery; we [Better Place] buy the battery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same way that petrol cars are sold separately from their fuel. Petrol is not purchased upfront, but is bought a few times a month when the fuel tank needs filling. Similarly, the Better Place monthly payment would cover electric "fuel" costs including battery, daily charging and battery swaps.  Better Place was to allow customers to pay incrementally for battery costs including electric power, battery life, degradation, warranty problems, maintenance, capital cost, quality, technology advancement and anything else related to the battery. The per-distance fees would cover [[Electric vehicle battery#Leasing|battery pack leasing]], charging and swap infrastructure, purchasing [[sustainable energy|sustainable electricity]], profits, and the cost of investor capital.&lt;ref name="Agassi TED talk" /&gt; All battery problems would be handled by Better Place which would then bundle the costs and bill their customers monthly for providing all the infrastructure.

The Better Place electric car charging infrastructure network was based on a [[smart grid]] software platform using [[Intel]] Atom [[processors]] and [[.NET Framework]], or comparable vendors. This platform was first of its kind in the world and was to enable Better Place to manage the charging of hundreds of thousands of electric cars simultaneously by automatically time-shifting recharging away from peak demand hours of the day, preventing overload of the [[electrical grid]] of the host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIE06mdcXkc |title=Shai Agassi announces 100,000 electric cars mega deal/order}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better Place would be able to provide electricity for millions of electric cars without adding a single electricity generator or transmission line by using smart software that oversaw and managed the recharging of electric cars connected with Better Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hywFVhqyu6QVnz6NcTQxhgsu8YIg?docId=CNG.f6fcd5bb2a7f891c8156a12d7845d240.c11 |title=Israel gears up to go electric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place encouraged governments to mandate the use of international standards and open access to recharge across [[electric vehicle network|charging networks]] to facilitate competing networks.&lt;ref name="Agassi CNBC"&gt;{{cite video

==Energy sources==
Agassi stated that the company's plan was to have the network's [[electricity]] generated entirely by [[renewable energy]] from [[solar array]]s and [[wind farm]]s if necessary,&lt;ref name="NYT0409"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/shai_agassi_on_electric_cars.html | title=Shai Agassi's bold plan for electric cars | accessdate=2011-02-22| publisher= TED Talks}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus invalidating the "long-smokestack" accusation leveled against electric vehicles which rely on the nonrenewable sources of the electricity.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, achieving the 100% renewable energy goal would have depended on the local electric grid's energy sources.

In Israel, where the first Better Place deployment took place, the electric grid is based mostly on fossil fuels, rendering the renewable energy vision practically impossible in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://homocombustans.com/2009/11/15/%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%9b%d7%95%d7%a0%d7%99%d7%aa-%d7%94%d7%97%d7%a9%d7%9e%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%aa-%d7%99%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%90%d7%9c-%d7%95%d7%94%d7%aa%d7%97%d7%9e%d7%9e%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%92%d7%9c%d7%95%d7%91%d7%9c/ | title=The Electric Car (both Hebrew and English posts) | author=Dan Rabinowitz | date=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.energia.org.il/sites/default/files/post_files/20091119_israel_ghg_cost_curve.pdf | title=McKinsey's report for reducing greenhouse gas emission in Israel (Hebrew).

During 2010, Better Place operated a demonstration battery switch station in Tokyo allowing three specially equipped cabs to exchange their car's depleted battery pack for a {{Convert|100|mi}} fully recharged one in 59.1 seconds on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/08/27/better-place-expands-tokyo-battery-swap-trials-taxis-have-chang/|title=Better Place expands Tokyo battery swap trials; taxis have changed packs 2,122 times already|publisher=[[AutoblogGreen]]|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better Place used the same technology to swap batteries that [[F-16]] [[Jet aircraft|jet]] [[fighter aircraft]] use to load their bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/40th-anniversary/Charging-Ahead-With-a-New-Electric-Car.html | title=Charging Ahead With a New Electric Car}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place battery switch stations were claimed to support multiple battery types of all kinds of electric cars as long as the battery could be removed from under the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.betterplace.com/2010/12/myth-buster-can-our-switch-stations-accommodate-different-battery-types/ | title=Myth buster: can our switch stations accommodate different battery types? | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213021140/http://blog.betterplace.com/2010/12/myth-buster-can-our-switch-stations-accommodate-different-battery-types/ | archivedate=2010-12-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A battery switch station using only 15 batteries allegedly had the ability to swap batteries for 2,500 EV's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036789/#40471407 | title=Shai Agassi interviewed on MSNBC's Morning Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better Place claimed it had battery station installation teams who could install one battery switch station in just two days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk-aVB7LgFI | title=Shai Agassi: A Better Model? | location= (27m:02s) | publisher=commonwealthclub.org | accessdate=2010-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one every 25 miles in every route&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/opinion/2025603/uk-left-green-car-slow-lane | title=UK in the green car slow lane yet again}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the same cost of 7 days of oil in the United States, Better Place claimed it could cover all of the United States with battery switch stations and all the required infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/13/132020612/cost-savings-will-lure-americans-to-electric-cars | title=Savings Will Lure Americans To Electric Cars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battery switching versus DC fast charging===
The main alternative technology to the battery-switching technique promoted by Better Place is DC fast charging. A nationwide fast charging infrastructure is/was being deployed in the United States that by 2013 would cover the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theevproject.com/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004183059/http://www.theevproject.com/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2009-10-04 | title=The EV Project. The largest development of EVs and charge infrastructure }}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Fast Chargers are going to be installed at 45 [[BP]] and [[ARCO]] locations and will be made available to the public as early as March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.plugincars.com/bp-and-arco-install-45-electric-car-fast-charging-stations-part-ev-project-91336.html | title=BP and ARCO to Install 45 Electric Car Fast Charging Stations as Part of EV Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place claimed that its [[subscription]] model had customers effectively paying only the prorated mileage cost without any battery ownership problems, whereas the fast charging model involves the customer bearing all the battery purchase, ownership, maintenance, and replacement costs, in addition to the cost of the electricity to recharge the battery.

Better Place claimed that far fewer fast charging and battery switch stations would be needed than the current number of petroleum fuel refill stations, because drivers would usually recharge ("refuel") electric cars at home, offices, shopping centers, commercial areas, and the like. Drivers would only need alternatives if they forgot to recharge, couldn't get to a charge spot, had insufficient time at a charge spot, or were driving non-stop in excess of {{convert|160|km|mi|0|adj=on}}, typical of long distance vacations and business trips.

DC fast charging was at the time considerably slower than Better Place's claimed 59 second battery switchover, but while Better Place battery switch stations would have cost around $500,000 each, DC fast chargers that the [[EV Project|EV project]] is/was to deploy would cost only between $25,000 to $40,000.&lt;ref name="wheels.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/bp-and-arco-stations-to-get-electric-fast-chargers/ | title=BP and Arco Stations to Get Electric Fast Chargers | work=The New York Times | first=Jim | last=Motavalli | date=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demonstration projects===

====Yokohama====
On May 13, 2009, Better Place premiered their battery switching station to the public in [[Yokohama]] where they had been invited by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterplace.com/company/press-release-detail/better-place-unveils-first-automated-battery-switch-for-japan-ev-study Better Place Unveils First Automated Battery Switch for Japan EV Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520044837/http://www.betterplace.com/company/press-release-detail/better-place-unveils-first-automated-battery-switch-for-japan-ev-study/ |date=2009-05-20 }}, Press Release, May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The battery switching station demonstrated was set up similarly to a gas station automatic car wash.  The vehicle drove up on a ramp and was aligned on the swapping pad.  The battery shuttle then engaged and rose up toward the bottom of the vehicle.  It made contact with the battery, released it, lowered it, and moved the depleted battery pack away from the car.  The charged battery pack was then inserted.  The discharged battery was returned to the charging bay.  The battery switch was complete in less than two minutes and the vehicle drove away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.com/solution/charging/ |title=Charging electric vehicles (EVs) |publisher=Better Place |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111134013/http://www.betterplace.com/solution/charging/ |archivedate=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.com/company/video-detail/better-place-battery-switch-technology-demonstration/ |title=The global provider of electric vehicle services |publisher=Better Place |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201090600/http://www.betterplace.com/company/video-detail/better-place-battery-switch-technology-demonstration/ |archivedate=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The battery swap was designed to require less time than filling a tank of gas.&lt;ref name="Agassi TED talk"&gt;{{cite video|people     = Shai Agassi|date= February 2009|title=Shai Agassi's bold plan for electric cars|url= http://www.ted.com/talks/shai_agassi_on_electric_cars.html|medium=|publisher= [[TED (conference)|TED]]|location= Long Beach and Palm Springs, California|accessdate = 2009-10-05|time= 4m10s|quote= See we're bound by today's technology on batteries, which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations. 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. But you never want to get stuck. So what we added as a second element to our network is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on. You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in. Within two minutes you're back on the road. And you can go again. If you had charge spots everywhere, and you had battery swap stations everywhere, how often would you do it? And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. As a matter of fact, we add it to the contract. We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Loveday |url=http://www.allcarselectric.com/blog/1020693_better-place-unveils-battery-swapping-station-watch-it-in-action |title=Better Place Unveils Battery Swapping Station; Watch It In Action |publisher=All Cars Electric |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to keep electric vehicles in demand, Better Place was going to try to keep the vehicles competitive with the other cars on the market. By building infrastructure that made owning an electric car more practical, they hoped to increase demand.

The first prototype battery switch station opened in Yokohama, Japan on May 14, 2009, was designed by Yoav Heichal, chief engineer for Better Place research and development group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The company signed an agreement with Dor Alon Energy to install battery replacement points, which would run alongside the petroleum refueling station' normal business. Dor Alon CEO, Israel Yaniv, said, "Dor Alon is the first energy company that will enable owners of electric car owners of the future to obtain electric refueling services at its gas stations. We consider this agreement with Better Place to be a strategic partnership that will create real value and innovation for the company's activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000536835&amp;fid=942|title=Better Place signs charging station deal|date=2010-07-02|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=Globes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306000144/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000536835&amp;fid=942|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tokyo====
In April 2010, a 90-day switchable-battery electric taxi demonstration project was launched in [[Tokyo]], using three [[Nissan Rogue]] crossover utility vehicles, converted into [[electric car]]s with switchable batteries provided by [[A123 Systems]]. The battery switch station deployed in Tokyo was more advanced than the Yokohama switch system demonstrated in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/04/bptaxi-20100426.html#more|title=Better Place Launches Switchable-Battery Electric Taxi Project in Tokyo; Converted Crossovers with A123 Systems Packs|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2010-04-26|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/better-place-launches-tokyo-taxi-electric-car-test-2010-04-26 |title=Better Place launches electric-car test with Tokyo taxi firm |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2010-04-26|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.betterplace.com/2010/04/countdown-to-the-opening-of-the-world%E2%80%99s-first-switchable-battery-electric-taxi-operation/{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the three-month field test the EV taxis accumulated over {{Convert|25,000|mi}} and swapped batteries 2,122 times, with an average battery swap time of 59.1 seconds.

Following the announcement in Israel, Better Place said it had launched its network in Denmark, Australia and in two United States locations - Hawaii and Northern California. The company said it was in talks with more than 25 countries around the world.

In [[Australia]], Better Place announced agreements with AGL Energy and financial advisor Macquarie Capital Group to raise {{currency|{{formatprice|1000000000}}|AUD}} and begin deploying an electric vehicle (EV) network powered by renewable energy. According to Better Place, its model for sustainable mobility would help Australia move toward oil independence. With the world’s seventh highest per capita rate of car ownership, the country had nearly 15 million cars on the road after adding over a million new cars in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-pressroom-pressreleases-detail/index/id/better-place-partners-with-agl-and-macquarie-to-build-ev-infrastructure-in- | title=Betterplace.com | accessdate=2008-10-23 | date=2008-10-23 | publisher=Better Place Announcement | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901120130/http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-pressroom-pressreleases-detail/index/id/better-place-partners-with-agl-and-macquarie-to-build-ev-infrastructure-in- | archivedate=2010-09-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, as Israel Corporation completed its investment of {{US$|{{formatprice|100000000}}}} in the company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://israel21c.org/briefs/israel-corp-invests-further-millions-in-better-place More millions invested in Better Place] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123031309/http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/israel-corp-invests-further-millions-in-better-place |date=2010-01-23 }}, (January 13, 2010), in [http://www.israel21c.org/ ''Israel 21c Innovation News Service''], Retrieved 2010–01–26&lt;/ref&gt; a consortium of investors signed a Series-B funding round to invest a further {{US$|{{formatprice|350000000}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Form D, 2010-05-07|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1426900/000142690010000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml|work=SEC Form D, 2010-05-07, Better Place Inc., CIK 0001426900|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=13 May 2011|author=Better Place Inc.|date=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Better Place, citing their confidence that "Better Place has the technical and commercial solutions to allow for the mass adoption of electric cars in the near term." The Series-B round was led by [[HSBC]], which invested {{US$|{{formatprice|125000000}}}}, and included all Series-A investors plus [[Morgan Stanley| Morgan Stanley Investment Management]] and [[Lazard#Asset management|Lazard Asset Management]]. The deal represented one of the largest financial investments of its kind by HSBC, which gained a seat on the Better Place board of directors and approximately 10% of the company's shares.&lt;ref name=HSBC&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/better-place-wins-350-m-investment Better Place wins $350 m. investment], (January 26, 2010), in [http://www.israel21c.org/ ''Israel 21c Innovation News Service''], retrieved 2010–01–26&lt;/ref&gt;

From its early days, doubts were raised as to the effectiveness of Better Place's centralised model of providing charging infrastructure, with some anticipating that the model would not be widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LaMonica|first=Martin|title=Q&amp;A: Agassi's Better Place idea--brilliant or nuts?|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10225464-54.html|accessdate=2013-05-27|newspaper=cnet.com|date=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partners===
In May 2008, the company presented a prototype of its electric car at a press conference in [[Tel Aviv]]. Shai Agassi estimated that the company's partner, the Renault-Nissan alliance, would likely invest $500 million to $1 billion in developing the swappable-battery electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cleantech-israel.blogspot.com/2008/05/project-better-place-presents-prototype.html | title=Project Better Place presents prototype | accessdate=2008-05-12 | date=2008-05-11 | publisher= Cleantech Investing in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further partnerships with other manufacturers were not announced, and Peter Rawlinson, VP and Chief Engineer for Vehicle Engineering at Tesla was quoted as saying “Different batteries suit different cars. It’s far too simplistic to look at batteries as isolation,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/where-tesla-better-place-dont-agree/ |title=Where Tesla &amp; Better Place Don’t Agree — Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place also announced plans to develop electric recharge grids in the city of [[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cleantech-israel.blogspot.com/2008/06/project-better-place-in-talks-with.html | title=Project Better Place in talks with Mercedes, Hawaii, and San Francisco | accessdate=2008-06-21 | date=2008-06-21 | publisher= Cleantech Investing in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hawaii.gov/gov/news/releases/2008/governor-lingle-and-better-place-announce|title=Governor Lingle and Better Place announce partnership to offer national blueprint for clean energy in transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
In March 2008, [[Deutsche Bank]] analysts issued a glowing report on the company stating that its approach could be a "paradigm shift" that caused "massive disruption" to the auto industry, and which had "the potential to eliminate the gasoline engine altogether."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/autopia/2008/04/deutsche-bank-l/ | title=Deutsche Bank Loves Shai Agassi’s Plan to Bring Us EVs | accessdate=2009-10-20 | date=2008-04-14 | publisher=[[Wired Magazine]] |author=[https://www.wired.com/autopia/author/chuck-squatriglia/ Chuck Squatriglia]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three months later, the same institution issued a second report, finding "electric vehicles destined for much more growth than is widely perceived". The same report stated that "[i]mprovements in battery technology will allow for increased power, increased electrical propulsion, and bigger gains in fuel economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.d-incert.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/deutch_bank_electric_cars.pdf |format=PDF| title=Deutsche Bank Report 'Electric Cars: Plugged In' | accessdate=2008-06-09 | date=2008-06-09 | publisher= Deutsche Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2008, Shai Agassi testified before the [[United States House of Representatives]] Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. The hearing, titled "$4 Gasoline and Fuel Economy: Auto Industry at a Crossroads," dealt with the future role of the auto industry and the [[United States federal government|federal government]] in fighting gas prices and the fuel economy standards proposed in response to the enactment of the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007|Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2009, CBS Money Watch cast doubts on Better Place's business model, noting that it would cost up to $500,000 to construct a battery switching station&lt;ref name="station500k" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morrison|first=Chris|title=Better Place Plans World Domination, But Success Seems Unlikely|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-34241145/better-place-plans-world-domination-but-success-seems-unlikely/|accessdate=2013-05-27|newspaper=CBS Money Watch|date=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia a roll out of 500 charge stations was planned to begin in the major eastern coast cities before expanding nationally.  It was estimated that these would give comparable coverage to the existing 13,000 petrol stations then in operation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The total cost of this roll out was claimed to be between $1 to $1.25 billion AUD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,,24941094-36418,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121215164326/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,,24941094-36418,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-15 |title=Electric dream car won me: Evan Thornley &amp;#124; The Australian |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2009-10-17 |first=Rick |last=Wallace }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In 2011, Better Place announced an agreement with [[China Southern Power Grid Company]], the world’s eighth-largest utility company. Before the end of the year, Better Place was going to open a battery switch station and joint education center in the southern city of Guangzhou. Shai Agassi said that China Southern Grid was embracing battery switch as the primary means of range extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kraemer|first=Susan|title=Why China Could Prove to be the Better Place for EVs|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/04/china-better-place/|accessdate=2013-05-27|newspaper=Green Prophet|date=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/04/china-better-place/|title=Why China Could Prove to be the Better Place for EVs|author=Susan Kraemer |date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; China Southern Grid Chairman Zhao Jianguo said that the battery-switch model might become mainstream in China and that the joint visitor center and battery switch demonstration project with Better Place would help promote electric-car adoption in China by allowing potential customers to experience this innovative solution.

China Southern Power Grid pilot projects and other joint activities were supposed to explore the benefits that switchable-battery electric cars and the networked infrastructure that supports them might deliver to the electric grid in CSG's service area, which spanned five provinces, one million square kilometers, and 230 million people in Southern China.&lt;ref name="Better Place, China Southern Grid Sign Strategic Agreement Centered on Battery Switch Model"&gt;{{cite web

Electric utility [[State Grid Corporation of China]] planned to build over 2,351 electric-charging and battery-swap stations by 2016. These would have had 220,000 [[charging station|charging pole]]s, but they did not indicate how many, if any, of them would have been battery-swap stations. The director of the State Grid smart grid research center commented "The construction of a large-scale charging station costs 20 to 30 million yuan ($3.05-4.57 million) and a small-scale one costs less than 10 million yuan, but it costs more than 100 million yuan to build a battery-swap station."&lt;ref name="State Grid 2011 plans"&gt;{{cite press release

Better Place partnered with Denmark's leading energy company; [[Dong Energy]], in a €103 million Euro (770 million Danish Kroner) investment to introduce electric cars and infrastructure to [[Denmark]]. The country currently generates 20% of its electric power from [[Wind power in Denmark|wind energy]], but much of it is exported because there is currently no way for utilities to store the excess power. Using the Better Place model, Dong hoped to take advantage of the existing electric grid and electric vehicle batteries to harness and store the abundance of wind-generated power, and distribute it appropriately for transportation consumption.&lt;ref name="Dong Energy Press Release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dongenergy.com/EN/Media/Press%20releases/Pages/CisionDetails.aspx?cisionid=404494 |title=DONG Energy and California-based Project Better Place to introduce environmentally friendly electric vehicles in Denmark |publisher=Dong Energy Press Release |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231212646/http://www.dongenergy.com/EN/Media/Press%20releases/Pages/CisionDetails.aspx?cisionid=404494 |archivedate=2009-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.com/company/press-release-detail/better-place-dong-energy-investment-for-denmark-electric-car-network/+dong+betterplace |title=Better Place, Dong Energy Close 103M Euro (770M Danish Kroner) Investment for Denmark Electric Car Network |publisher=Better Place Press Release |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]] was the first nation in the world to partner with Better Place to build an electric car infrastructure. Shai Agassi, former Better Place CEO, claimed that by 2016, plus or minus a year, more than 50% of cars sold in Israel would be electric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4020489,00.html | title=Promoter of electric cars sees global change | publisher=ynetnews.com | date= |accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery switch stations were supposedly opening to customers almost weekly in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israellycool.com/2012/07/13/shai-agassi-did-what-he-said-he-would |title=Shai Agassi Did What He Said He Would |publisher=Israellycool |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; That map indicates with "orange circles" the handful of battery switch stations available in June 2012, and shows with "grey circles" the full buildout of battery switch stations expected by year's end.

According to the [[Financial Times]] around 400 corporations in Israel signed letters of intent to begin switching their fleets to Better Place electric car network as soon as the service becomes available.

Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in [[Kiryat Ekron]], near [[Rehovot]] in March 2011.

====Customer Qualifications====
Better Place wanted electric car customers who could make a successful transition from [[range anxiety]] to ordinary range awareness within the company's growing infrastructure. During the sales process, Better Place aimed to educate and assess each customer's electric car suitability. The company was going to exclude drivers frequently traveling irregular routes that span the country. Eventually, Israel was supposed to have enough battery switch stations and recharging spots at parking garages, shopping centers, hotels, commercial areas, and elsewhere, to cater for most drivers.

At minimum, customers needed dedicated off-road parking at home and, for higher mileage drivers, Better Place was going to install charging spots at people's workplace. The preferred high-mileage customer might commute {{convert|130|km|mi|0|adj=on}} each way between home and office. Lower distance customers might only need their home charging spot, with battery switching being infrequent.

====Israel Electric Grid====
Electric cars aren't allowed by law to directly plug into ordinary Israeli electrical outlets. Better Place charging stations were to have [[smart grid]] interactivity that automatically time shifted the charging process away from peak electrical demand hours.

PCB, polychorinated biphenyls, are a type of chemical that was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, and which is a contamination source of soil and water. They are fairly stable and therefore persistent in the environment. '''Bioremediation of PCBs''' is the use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, which can be either a soil or aqueous environment. It is a process relying on multiple microorganisms' co-metabolism. [[Anaerobic microorganism]]s dechlorinate PCBs first, and other microorganisms that are capable of doing [[BH pathway]] can break down the dechlorinated PCBs to usable intermediates like [[acyl-CoA]] or [[carbon dioxide]]. If no BH pathway-caple microorganisms are present, dechlorinated PCBs can be mineralized with help of fungi and plants. However, there are multiple limiting factors for this co-metabolism.

== Overview ==

=== PCBs ===
[[File:PCB_general_structure.svg|right|254x254px]]
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are various [[biphenyl]] based artificial products that are widely used as a [[dielectric]] fluid, industrial [[coolant]], and [[lubricant]]s in the 1960s and 1970s. There is no evidence its synthesis occurs naturally.  They are classified as persistent organic pollutants. PCBs share the basic chemical structure of biphenyl and one or more of the hydrogen atoms on the [[aromatic ring]]s are replaced by chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passatore|first=Laura|last2=Rossetti|first2=Simona|last3=Juwarkar|first3=Asha A.|last4=Massacci|first4=Angelo|date=2014-08-15|title=Phytoremediation and bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): State of knowledge and research perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389414003963|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=278|pages=189–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.05.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs is in viscous liquid form at normal temperature and has a poor solubility in water. The aromatic hydrocarbon structure gives PCBs relatively high molecular stability. The chlorine substitution further reinforces its insolubility and chemical stability. Hence, the degradation of PCBs in the natural environment is very slow, which can range from 3 to 37 years depending on the number of chloride substitutions and their positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Bioremediation ===
[[Bioremediation]] is a waste removal method that uses microorganisms to degrade or remove wastes like organic waste and heavy metal from contaminated sites including both soil and water. The advantages of bioremediation are that it is environment-friendly, inexpensive and can remove multiple wastes simultaneously comparing with traditional chemical and physical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/805006965|title=Bioremediation methods and protocols|last=P.,|first=Cummings, Stephen|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781607614395|oclc=805006965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation Process ==
Various microorganisms are involved in a two-stage process of degradation of PCBs, which happens in aerobic and anaerobic environments. Degrading PCBs is similar to the degradation of biphenyl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the chlorines on PCBs prevent them from being utilized as a substrate of biphenyl degradation. Due to high chemical stability, PCBs cannot be used as energy sources.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohtsubo|first=Yoshiyuki|last2=Kudo|first2=Toshiaki|last3=Tsuda|first3=Masataka|last4=Nagata|first4=Yuji|date=2004-08-01|title=Strategies for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=250–258|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the chlorination, PCBs can be used as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration to store energy, which is also the first stage of the degradation pathway, reductive dechlorination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the PCBs are dechlorinated to a certain degree, usually lower than five chlorines presenting in the structure and one aromatic ring has no chlorine,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they can undergo the biphenyl degradation pathway (BP pathway) to be degraded to accessible carbon or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the aerobic environment. BP pathway is a pathway that utilizes series of enzymes ([[BphA]], B, C, D, E, F, G) to convert biphenyl to [[TCA Cycle|TCA cycle]] intermediates ([[pyruvate]] and [[Acyl-CoA]]) and [[benzoate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there are few microorganisms that can dechlorinate substrate under natural conditions. Even with selective media, the accumulation of PCB dechlorinating microorganisms is still slow, which is one reason for the slow degradation rate. As a result, PCBs usually go through a co-metabolism pathway that involving different microorganism species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasilyeva|first=G. K.|last2=Strijakova|first2=E. R.|date=2007-12-01|title=Bioremediation of soils and sediments contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S002626170706001X|journal=Microbiology|language=en|volume=76|issue=6|pages=639–653|doi=10.1134/S002626170706001X|issn=0026-2617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, there are four steps in this process:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# In order for PCBs to enter the cell, they firstly need to be solubilized.
# PCBs are dechlorinated by anaerobic bacteria, then transport the metabolites to [[aerobic bacteria]] or fungi through a [[biofilm]].
# The presence of PCBs metabolites triggers the expression of enzymes in BP pathway.
# PCBs are broken down to Acetyl-CoA and then can be utilized or carbon dioxide.
The Figure below shows the complete degradation pathway.  [[File:PCBs' Degradation Pathway.jpg|thumb|495x495px]]

== Limiting Factors ==

=== PCBs entering the cells ===
PCBs have low water solubility, so they adhere tightly to soil and cannot be easily accessed by bacteria. Especially, if the contaminations site has been exposed to PCBs for long period, PCBs can be integrated into soil or sediment matrices, then further decrease their bioavailability. Some surfactants can help solubilize but cannot increase the rate of PCBs degrading. However, if PCBs are linked to surfactants tightly too, then this process cannot promote the absorption of PCBs and even lower it. Also, many surfactants have been proven to be toxic to cells and the high cost of surfactants is another issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== PCBs properties ===
PCBs are toxic to bacterial communities above 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. However, if the concentration is too low (lower than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), the degradation slows down significantly, for there is not enough material to stimulate the expression of required genes and support the growth of competent microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PCBs includes various different compounds with slightly different structures. Those slight differences make big differences in metabolic rate. Generally speaking, the more chlorines in a PCB molecule, the harder for it to be degraded. In particular,  microorganisms cannot degrade di- and tetra-ortho substituted well. It is possible that those structures prevent enzymes from accessing reaction sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Soil and sediment characteristics ===
First, the soil and [[sediment]] structures will determine how tightly PCBs are adhered to them and affect the absorption of PCBs into cells. The PCBs’ availability suffers from increasing organic carbon and clay content, for they promote the absorption of PCBs into soil or sediment matrices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Second, the soil contains necessary nutrition for the growth of microbes and anaerobic and aerobic environments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Finally, the local microbial population has significant impacts on the rate of degradation of PCBs, which varies based on the microbial strains and their activities. Then, if there is no history of exposure to PCBs, it may take months for microbes to activates their ability to dechlorinate PCBs and break them down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gene expression and bottleneck effect of metabolites ===
PCBs or biphenyl cannot provide energy for microbes, so they are primary energy and carbon sources. As stated before it takes months sometimes for microorganisms to activate their gene for dichlorine after the first exposure to PCBs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been proposed to use analogs to promote the activation of genes. However, even after the metabolic pathway is activated, the intermediates of the pathway create a bottleneck effect due to their toxicity. Also, there is the possibility that BP pathway leads to [[protoanemonin]] which is a dead-end metabolite that cannot be utilized by cells. Due to the high energy cost of this pathway, if no preferred energy source present in the system, cells will not activate this pathway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Carbon materials marketing began in 1866 by [[Joseph Swan]] which he subsequently sold to the Autotype Company in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Alternative Photographic Processes|pp=583–584|first=Christopher|last=James|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=978-1-305-46159-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ready-made tissues were in three colours black, sepia and purple-brown.&lt;ref name=carbon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy/&gt; This method was used in Europe and USA throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th.&lt;ref name=carbon/&gt; This market was almost closed in the 1950s although some companies produce small amount of carbon tissue and transfer papers for monochrome and three-color work until around 1990&lt;ref name=carbon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy/&gt;

== Method ==

The gelatinous emulsion is applied to a paper backing, and is rendered sensitive to light when immersed in a 3:4% {{Clarify|date=March 2015}} solution of [[potassium bichromate]]. After drying, it is ready for use. The carbon tissue is first exposed to a film positive. In those areas where the carbon tissue has received the most light (i.e., non-image areas and highlights) the emulsion becomes thick and hard, and the thickness and hardness decreases with decreasing exposure to the light source, the emulsion being thinnest and softest in image areas corresponding to shadows and solids. After developing the carbon tissue, it is adhered to the surface of the copper-plated cylinder.

A solution of [[ferric chloride]] etchant is applied to the surface of the cylinder, where it eats away the copper through the carbon tissue. In the highly exposed areas, where the carbon tissue photoresist is thickest and hardest, the etchant takes a long time to eat through the hard emulsion, while in the least exposed, thinnest regions the etchant eats through the resist into the copper very quickly. Thus, in a given period of etching, the cells etched into the copper will be deepest (and thus will print the darkest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the quickest, while the cells etched into the copper will be the shallowest (and thus print the lightest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the slowest.

== Usage ==
Carbon tissue resists were the first chemical etching media, but have been replaced by photopolymers, and chemical etching as a whole is being increasingly replaced by electromechanical engraving and computer-to-cylinder laser-cutting processes. (See Gravure Engraving.)

Carbon tissue resists have also been used extensively for the manufacture of photostencils in [[screen printing]].

A '''chassis''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|tʃ|æ|s|i}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chassis|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: chassis|last=Company|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|website=www.ahdictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ʃ|æ|s|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/chassis|title=Chassis definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; plural ''chassis'' {{IPAc-en|-|i|z}}) is the internal framework of an artificial object, which supports the object in its construction and use. An example of a chassis is a [[vehicle frame]], the underpart of a [[motor vehicle]], on which the body is mounted; if the [[running gear]] such as wheels and transmission, and sometimes even the driver's seat, are included, then the assembly is described as a [[rolling chassis]].

==Examples of use==
===Vehicles===
{{See also|Rolling chassis}}

[[File:Apple PowerMac G4 M8570 MDD sideopen.jpg|thumb|[[Power Mac G4|PowerMac G4]] chassis opened to expose computer components]]
In the case of vehicles, the term [[rolling chassis]] means the [[frame (vehicle)|frame]] plus the "running gear" like [[engine]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[drive shaft]], [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]].

An under body (sometimes referred to as "[[coachwork]]"), which is usually not necessary for integrity of the structure, is built on the chassis to complete the vehicle.

For [[commercial vehicle]]s, a [[rolling chassis]] consists of an assembly of all the essential parts of a truck (without the body) to be ready for operation on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Official Handbook of Automobiles|year=1922|publisher=National Automobile Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjRuEBUi9f0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=NACC+definition+of+standard+chassis+commercial#v=onepage&amp;q=NACC%20definition%20of%20standard%20chassis%20commercial&amp;f=false|author=Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers (U.S.)|accessdate=10 September 2010|page=180|oclc=6360726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of a pleasure car chassis will be different than one for commercial vehicles because of the heavier loads and constant work use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturmey|first=Henry|journal=Commercial Motor|title=The Use of Unsuitable Vehicles|volume=7|issue=160|date=2 April 1908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oDnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=Chassis+only+commercial+vehicle#v=onepage&amp;q=Chassis%20only%20commercial%20vehicle&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2010|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial vehicle manufacturers sell "chassis only", "cowl and chassis", as well as "[[chassis cab]]" versions that can be outfitted with specialized bodies. These include [[Recreational vehicle|motor homes]], [[fire apparatus|fire engines]], [[ambulance]]s, [[box truck]]s, etc.

In particular applications, such as [[school bus]]es, a government agency like [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) in the U.S. defines the design standards of chassis and body conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grenzeback|first=Lance R.|first2=Sandi|last2=Lin|first3=Jacob|last3=Meunier|title=Operational Differences and Similarities among the Motorcoach, School Bus, and Trucking Industries|year=2005|publisher=Transportation Research Board|isbn=978-0-309-08821-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdzIVGZASxAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=cowl+and+chassis+commercial+vehicle#v=onepage&amp;q=cowl%20and%20chassis%20commercial%20vehicle&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[armoured fighting vehicle]]'s hull&lt;ref&gt;Starry p. 45, 79, 129, 143, 153, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; serves as the chassis and comprises the bottom part of the AFV that includes the [[continuous track|tracks]], engine, driver's seat, and crew compartment. This describes the lower hull, although common usage might include the upper hull to mean the AFV without the [[gun turret|turret]]. The hull serves as a basis for platforms on [[tank]]s, [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, [[military engineering vehicles|combat engineering vehicle]]s, etc.

===Electronics===
In an electronic device, the chassis consists of a frame or other internal supporting structure on which the [[printed circuit board|circuit board]]s and other electronics are mounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khandpur|first=Raghbir Singh|title=Troubleshooting Electronic Equipment|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-147731-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzynnyINF20C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=electronic+chassis#v=onepage&amp;q=electronic%20chassis&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2010|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some designs, such as older  sets, the chassis is mounted inside a heavy, rigid cabinet, while in other designs such as modern [[computer case]]s, lightweight covers or panels are attached to the chassis.

The combination of chassis and outer covering is sometimes called an enclosure.

===Firearms===
In firearms, the chassis is a [[rifle bedding|bedding]] frame on [[long gun]]s such as [[rifle]]s to replace the traditionally wooden [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], for the purpose of better [[accurizing]] the gun.  The chassis is usually made from metallic material such as [[aluminium alloy]] due to the more superior [[stiffness]] and [[compressive strength]] of metals compared with wood or synthetic polymer, which are commonly used in conventional rifle stocks.  The chassis essentially functions as a more extensive pillar bedding, providing a metal-on-metal [[bearing surface]] for the that has reduced potential shifting under the stress of [[recoil]].  A [[gun barrel|barrel]]ed [[action (firearms)|action]] bedded into a metal chassis would theoretically operate more consistently during repeated firing, resulting in better [[accuracy and precision|precision]].

'''Edward René David Goldsmith''' (8 November 1928&amp;nbsp;– 21 August 2009), widely known as '''Teddy Goldsmith''', was an Anglo-French [[environmentalist]], [[writer]] and [[philosopher]].

He was a member the prominent [[Goldsmith family]]. The eldest son of Major [[Frank Goldsmith]], and elder brother of the financier [[James Goldsmith]]. Edward Goldsmith was the founding editor and publisher of ''[[The Ecologist]]''. Known for his outspoken views opposing industrial society and economic development, he expressed a strong sympathy for the ways and values of [[indigenous peoples|traditional peoples]].

He co-authored the influential ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'' with [[Robert Prescott-Allen|Robert Allen]], becoming a founding member of the political party "People" (later renamed the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]), itself largely inspired by the'' Blueprint''. Goldsmith's conservative view of environmentalism put him at odds with the socialist currents of thought, which came to dominate the Green Party.

A [[deep ecologist]] and [[systems theorist]], Goldsmith was an early proponent of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], having previously developed a similar [[cybernetic]] concept of a self-regulating [[biosphere]].

A talented [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]] and raconteur, Goldsmith was an articulate spokesman and campaigner,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/27/obituary-edward-goldsmith |title=The Guardian Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London | first=Walter | last=Schwarz | date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a number of awards for his work protecting the natural world and highlighting the importance and plight of [[indigenous peoples]], including an honorary [[Right Livelihood Award]] and the [[Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur]].

== Early life ==
Goldsmith (widely known as Teddy) was born in Paris in 1928 to a German Jewish father, [[Frank Goldsmith]], and French mother, Marcelle Mouiller.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page2.html |title=curriculum vitae |publisher=Edward Goldsmith |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822022558/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page2.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered [[Millfield School]], [[Somerset]], as a grammar student, and he later graduated with honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1947–1950).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; While studying at Oxford, Goldsmith rejected the reductionist and compartmentalised ideas taught at the time, and he sought a more holistic worldview with which to study societies and the problems facing the world at large.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page288.html |title=The Godfather of Green by Paul Kingsnorth |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fulfilling his [[National Service]] as a British Intelligence Officer in [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]], he involved himself unsuccessfully in a number of business ventures and devoted most of his spare time to the study of the subjects that were to preoccupy him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, he spent time travelling the world with his close friend, [[John Aspinall (zoo owner)|John Aspinall]], witnessing at first hand the destruction of traditional societies. He concluded that the spread of [[economic development]] and its accompanying industrialisation, [[Postdevelopment Theory|far from being progressive]] as claimed, was actually the root cause of social and environmental destruction.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. pp.28-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page279.html |title=Uncle Teddy by Fred Pearce, 1991 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date=10 January 1991 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Primitive People's Fund ===
{{main article|Survival International}}
In London, at meetings of the Primitive People's Fund (the committee that founded [[Survival International]]), Goldsmith teamed up with the fund's treasurer [[Robert Prescott-Allen]], the explorer [[Jean Liedloff]], and a writer from ''World Medicine'', [[Peter Bunyard]], to found ''The Ecologist'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"/&gt;

=== "Theory of a Unified Science" ===
After rejecting what he saw as the excessively reductionist and compartmentalised approach of mainstream academia, he spent much of his time researching and developing his own theories for the unification of the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978. p iv&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Theory of a Unified Science'' was heavily influenced by cybernetics, as well as the [[General Systems Theory]] of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], the [[holism]] of the early academic ecologists, and the [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] employed by many anthropologists.&lt;ref name="WayIntro"&gt;The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998. Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; His theory would later be published, in its final form, as ''The Way: an ecological world view.'' ([[#The Way|see below]])

Early on, Goldsmith had formulated a concept of the biosphere as an integrated cybernetic entity, the self-regulating parts (of which he included tribal societies) co-operating, largely unconsciously, for the mutual benefit of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Appendix A |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view that anticipated aspects of the Gaia thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/312409/teddy_goldsmith_a_tribute.html |title=Teddy Goldsmith: a tribute by Peter Bunyard. '&amp;#39;The Ecologist Online'&amp;#39;, 1st September, 2009 |publisher=Theecologist.org |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was to become a leading proponent.&lt;ref&gt;Gaia, the Thesis, the Mechanisms and the Implications, edited by Peter Bunyard and Edward Goldsmith. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldsmith was also a critic of [[neo-Darwinism]]. He claimed that it is a [[reductionist]] theory and that if you understand [[evolution]], it is necessary to "abandon the reductionistic and mechanistic paradigm of science".&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 20 No. 2, March–April 1990 [http://www.edwardgoldsmith.org/890/evolution-neo-darwinism-and-the-paradigm-of-science/ Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Ecologist'' ===
{{main article|The Ecologist}}
Having established ''The Ecologist'' in 1969 with founding editors Robert Allen, [[Jean Liedloff]], and Peter Bunyard,&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"/&gt; Goldsmith was to use the journal as a platform for his theoretical concerns with regular articles appearing under the heading "Towards a Unified Science". The journal also became an important forum for the early [[green movement]], with articles focusing on the relevance and survival of hunter-gatherer societies, alternative technology and organic farming, together with prescient articles about climate change,&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 1 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 2 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; resource depletion,&lt;ref&gt;Can Britain Survive? Edited by Edward Goldsmith. Tom Stacey, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear accidents. They were accompanied by the usual gamut of articles examining pollution, overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, corporate power, large dams, and, not least, the [[World Bank]]'s alleged role in "financing the destruction of our planet".&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol.1, Nos 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''A Blueprint For Survival'' ===
{{main article|A Blueprint for Survival}}
Signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day—l, including Sir [[Julian Huxley]], Sir [[Frank Fraser Darling]], Sir [[Peter Medawar]], Sir [[Peter Scott]], and [[C. H. Waddington]], Goldsmith and his fellow editor Robert Allen made headlines in January 1972 with ''A Blueprint for Survival''.

The ''Blueprint'' was a far reaching proposal for a radical [[Transition Towns|transition]] to a largely decentralised and deindustrialised society, an attempt to prevent what the authors referred to as " the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/page34.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Preface |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a key text for the early Green movement, selling over half a million copies, and it was translated into 16 different languages.&lt;ref name="Rev"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=3351185323669993067 |title=Edward Goldsmith—the Green Revolutionary. Goldhawk Films, 1990 |publisher=Video.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331100129/http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=3351185323669993067 |archivedate=31 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, it anticipated the concerns taken up by today's [[Transition Towns|Transition Movement]].

Goldsmith and Allen argued that rather than devise imaginary [[utopia]]s, as did Marxist and liberal political theorists of the time, they should instead look to the example of existing [[Indigenous peoples|tribal peoples]], who, the authors claimed, were real-life working models of societies perfectly adapted to both their long-term survival needs and the needs of the living world on which they depended. The tribal peoples alone, the authors argued, had demonstrated a viable means by which the most pressing problems facing humanity could be answered successfully.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p229-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Such societies were characterised by their small, human-scale communities, low-impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews and a high degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual fulfilment of their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1 |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The People Party ===
{{main article|History of the Green Party of England and Wales}}
The ''Blueprint'' was a major inspiration for the embryonic political party called "People" (later to become the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://another-green-world.blogspot.com/2006/10/short-history-of-green-party-of.html |title=A short history of the Green Party of England and Wales by Derek Wall, 1993 |publisher=Another-green-world.blogspot.com |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which invited Goldsmith to stand for the [[Eye (UK Parliament constituency)|Eye]] constituency in Suffolk as their candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].

The campaign focused on the threat of desertification from the intensive farming practised in the area, which Goldsmith emphasised with the help of a [[Bactrian camel]] supplied by Aspinall. Goldsmith was in turn accompanied by bearded supporters dressed in the garb of Arab sheiks, the implication being that if modern oil-intensive farming practises were allowed to continue, the camel would be the only viable means of transport left in [[Suffolk]]. Goldsmith lost his [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]], but his unorthodox campaign succeeded in attracting the media's attention and highlighted the issues.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt; He again stood for the now-renamed Ecology Party at the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)|European elections in 1979]], now winning a more respectable portion of [[Cornwall and Plymouth (European Parliament constituency)#Results|the vote]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== Cornwall ===
In 1973, buoyed by the success of the ''Blueprint'' and a sudden rise in public awareness of ecological issues, partly brought about by the [[Stockholm Conference]] and the publication of the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in the same year. Goldsmith and his editorial team moved from their offices in London to relocate to rural Cornwall, in the far west of England.&lt;ref&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p239&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith and his colleagues bought themselves farms, and for the following 17 years, they attempted to form a small-scale, relatively self-sufficient community of their own, and ''The Ecologist'' continued to be produced on-site, in between their other chores.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/6089129/Teddy-Goldsmith.html |title=The Daily Telegraph Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) threatened to site a nuclear reactor on farmland in [[Luxulyan]], Cornwall, Goldsmith was among those who organised a continuous [[sit-in]] of the land, with local people blocking the entrance and staffing round-the-clock garrisons to prevent CEGB contractors from starting their drilling work.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; An early example of an environmental [[protest camp]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of England and Wales eventually awarded in favour of CEGB allowing the drilling to go ahead. The CEGB never went on to develop the site, however.

=== The Gandhi Peace Foundation ===
In 1974, Goldsmith spent four months with the [[Gandhi Peace Foundation]] in [[New Delhi]], comparing the [[Gandhi]]an (''[[Sarvodaya]]'') movement with the Ecology movement in Europe.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt; This led Goldsmith to forge close links with Indian environmental activists, in particular with the [[Chipko]] movement, including [[Sunderlal Bahuguna]] and [[Vandana Shiva]]. That was to have a major influence on Goldsmith's approach to environmental activism and led to a [http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/5714/1/1/0/gandhi special issue of ''The Ecologist''] on the subject.&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 5 No. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===
In 1984, together with his colleague [[Nicholas Hildyard]], Goldsmith authored a multi-volume report on the destructive effects of large-scale, hydroelectric dams. It was the beginning of a long attack against the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[ World Bank]], which Goldsmith and his colleagues accused of financing the destruction of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/key41.html |title=The Social and Environmental Effects of Large Dams by Edward Goldsmith and Nicholas Hildyard. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1984 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830130051/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/key41.html |archivedate=30 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one episode, Goldsmith wrote an [https://web.archive.org/web/20100103211422/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page101.html open letter] to the then President of the World Bank, [[Alden W. Clausen]], demanding that the bank "stop financing the destruction of the tropical world, the devastation of its remaining forests, the extermination of its wildlife and the impoverishment and starvation of its human inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6809722.ece |title=The Times Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the connection between large-scale development projects and social and environmental destruction had not been widely recognised, even within the environmental movement.

=== Forests campaign ===
In 1989, Goldsmith helped to organise an international campaign calling for an immediate end to the [[deforestation|destruction of the world's remaining forests]] with its [[ethnocide|detrimental effects on indigenous cultures]], [[Biodiversity threats|biodiversity]] and [[global warming|global climate]]. The campaign raised over 3 million signatures, which were taken in wheelbarrows to the UN's headquarters in New York City. Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary General, [[Perez de Cuellar]], agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to tackle the global crisis of [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt; Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the [[US Senate]] with a group of senators, headed by [[Al Gore]], whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== The Goldsmith Foundation ===
In 1991, with the financial support of his brother James, Goldsmith established the Goldsmith (JMG) Foundation supporting a diverse range of non-governmental organisations campaigning against environmentally destructive activities, along with organisations providing sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== The Way ===
In 1990, urged on by [[Arne Næss]],&lt;ref name="WayIntro"/&gt; Goldsmith left the editorship of ''The Ecologist'' to Nicholas Hildyard, while taking time off to write his philosophical magnum opus ''The Way: an ecological worldview''.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;"The Ecologist Magazine 1970–2007: a case study" Master's thesis Kristen Harding. University of Plymouth, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Way'' (1992) was the culmination and synthesis of more than four decades of theoretical development,&lt;ref name="WayIntro"/&gt; embodying a "coherent worldview" by which Goldsmith would attempt to explain the self-inflicted problems facing the world and to propose a way out of them. Much of the work was already mature in Goldsmith's mind by the time that he published the first issues of ''The Ecologist'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Towards a Unified Science. The Ecologist Vol.1, Vol.2, Vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Appendices A &amp; B |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later life ===
In addition to the UK ''Ecologist'', Goldsmith later helped to found and support ''The Ecologist'' as independent enterprises in many parts of the world:

: ''Brazil'' (in Portuguese); ''France'' (in French); ''Asia'' (India); ''Italy'' (in Italian); ''Greece'' (in Greek); ''The Pacific'' (New Zealand); ''Lebanon'' (in Arabic); ''Latin America'' (in Spanish); and ''Colombia'' (in Spanish).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

He continued to attend key meetings around the world&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; and involved himself with a variety of campaign organisations by becoming President of the ''Climate Initiatives Fund'', Richmond, London;&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; a board member of the ''[[International Forum on Globalization]]'', San Francisco, USA;&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; a founder member of ''Marunui Conservation Ltd.'', [[Mangawhai]], New Zealand (1987);&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; and a founder member and vice-president of [[ECOROPA]], a European ecological club and think tank (1975).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 1997, after an acrimonious split with his editorial team, most notably with his former friend and colleague Nicholas Hildyard,&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; Goldsmith was left to run ''The Ecologist'' on his own. Having been absent for some years, he brought in the [[International Society for Ecology and Culture]] (ISEC) to act as the editorial team. His nephew [[Zac Goldsmith|Zac]], who was then working for ISEC, eventually took over the editorship on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt;

The split with Hildyard led to a period of often-bitter criticism from some members of the political left in the environmental movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hildyard |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/item.shtml?x=51967 |title="Blood" and "Culture" by Nicholas Hildyard |publisher=Thecornerhouse.org.uk |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monbiot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/04/30/black-shirts-in-green-trousers/ |title=Black Shirts in Green Trousers by George Monbiot |publisher=Monbiot.com |date=30 April 2002 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215053128/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, compounded with failing health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/gardens/article5623863.ece |title=The ecogardeners from Tuscany by Caroline Donald |publisher=Property.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a period of isolation from the British scene.

Goldsmith was accused of having affiliated himself with the [[Nouvelle Droite]], an intellectual voice of the European "New Right",{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} after addressing a symposium on Green issues organised in Paris by the GRECE (Research and Study Group on European Culture),&lt;ref&gt;"Eléments pour la Civilisation Européenne", quarterly issue 81, p. 51. November 1994, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; a school of political thought founded largely on the works of [[Alain de Benoist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Actes des Colloques nationaux du GRECE (with Alain de Benoist) including: ''États-unis: danger'', Paris, December 1992: ''Les Enjeux de l'Ecologie'' (The Challenges of Ecology), Paris, November 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It was the attending of that and another similar event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page285.html |title="Cooking up rightwing connections", '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, 18 July 2000 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had led to rising tensions with his colleague Nicholas Hildyard.&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; The title of Goldsmith's contribution in Paris being simply "Une société écologique: la seule alternative" (''An Ecological Society: The Only Alternative'').&lt;ref&gt;"Actes du XXVIIIème colloque national du GRECE: "''Gauche-Droite: la Fin d'un Systeme''", Paris. Published in December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in a controversial article for the ''Guardian'' newspaper, entitled "Black Shirts in Green Trousers", [[George Monbiot]] (a cofounder of the left-wing political party [[Respect – The Unity Coalition|Respect]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/17/iraq.iraq1 |title=Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens |work=The Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Tempest | date=18 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accused Goldsmith of having "advocated the enforced separation of Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda and Protestants and Catholics in Ulster, on the grounds that they constitute 'distinct ethnic groups' and are thus culturally incapable of co-habitation"&lt;ref name="Monbiot"/&gt; (a point rejected by Goldsmith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldsmith |first=Edward |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page197.html |title=Letter to the Guardian |publisher=Edward Goldsmith |date=2002-04-30 |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725090728/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page197.html |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). That, along with other attacks, eventually led Goldsmith to counter his critics with his indepth rebuttal [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215053128/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html ''My Answer''].&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;

Goldsmith's close association with his brother, Sir James Goldsmith, his lifelong friendship with the controversial casino owner and conservationist John Aspinall, along with his anti-[[modernity|modernist]] stance and support for [[indigenous peoples]], ensured that Goldsmith had many detractors throughout his life. Still, Goldsmith received affectionate support and respect from across the full spectrum of the environmental movement and from many of the people whose views and preoccupations were the focus of his theoretical and philosophical critique.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Goldsmith's message continued to be sponsored around the world, in particular through his work with the [[International Forum on Globalization]] (IFG), and, regardless of their previous acrimony, Hildyard and Goldsmith went on to restore their former friendship.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Elitegroup Computer Systems HQ 20130929.jpg|thumb|ECS headquarters building in Neihu District, Taipei City.]]

'''Elitegroup Computer Systems ''' Co., Ltd. ('''ECS''';{{zh|c=精英電腦股份有限公司|p= jīngyīng diànnǎo gǔfèn yǒuxiàn gōngsī}}) is a [[Taiwan]]-based [[electronics]] firm. It is the fifth largest{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[PC motherboard]] manufacturer in the world (after [[Asus]], [[Gigabyte Technology]], [[ASRock]], and [[Micro-Star International|MSI]]), with production reaching 24 million units in 2002.

The company has since concentrated on broadening its product range. After ECS's purchase of laptop manufacturer Uniwill in 2006, the company has been involved in the design and manufacture of [[laptops]], [[desktop replacement computer]]s and multimedia products.  ECS computers are sold by [[Fry's Electronics]] under the “Great Quality” (“GQ”) brand.

== Design &amp; Production ==
While Elitegroup Computer Systems is headquartered in Taiwan, the company has production facilities all over the world:

* [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] [[Shenzhen]]: (ECS Manufacturing) &amp; Golden Elite Technology &amp; China Golden Elite Technology
* Suzhou: (China ESZ)
* Juarez, Mexico: China EMX, Mexico EMX Plant

Design of the products is probably done in Taiwan.

== OEM ==
Many of these motherboards have been produced for [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] customers and are used in systems assembled and sold by such brand-name companies as [[IBM]], [[Compaq]] and [[Zoostorm]].  Its main competitors are [[Micro-Star International]] and [[ASRock]].

ECS also produces [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] computers.

== History ==
[[File:Pcchips-logo.svg|thumb|former PCChips Logo]]
Founded in 1987, ECS is headquartered in [[Taiwan]] with operations in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and the [[Pacific Rim]]. The company merged with '''PCChips''' (Hsing Tech Enterprise Co., Ltd), a major manufacturer of low-cost motherboards, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070608090451/http://www.ecsusa.com/aboutUs/pr_060105.cfm PCChips USA, Elitegroup Computer Systems Merger, Creating a New Era in the PC Industry] Fremont CA - 1 June 2005 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2003, ECS was selected for two years in a row for ''[[Business Week Magazine|Business Week]]'' magazine’s exclusive Information Technology 100 list.

On 10 April 2013, ECS unveiled ''Durathon'', where all ECS motherboards are tested beyond industry standards for durability, stability, and reliability, as well as materials used in the manufacture of its motherboards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Media/NewsRoom_Detail.aspx?NewsID=1574&amp;MenuID=45&amp;LanID=0 ECS Durathon: Shattering Durability Standards in PC Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=December 2015}} The name ''Durathon'' derives from the words durable and marathon, which refers to each motherboard's rigorous testing methods in extreme environmental conditions.

The '''European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites''' ('''EUMETSAT''') is an [[intergovernmental organisation]] created through an [[international convention]] agreed by a current total of 30 European Member States: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. These States fund the EUMETSAT programs and are the principal users of the systems. The convention establishing EUMETSAT was opened for signature in 1983 and entered into force on 19 June 1986.

EUMETSAT's primary objective is to establish, maintain and exploit European systems of operational [[meteorological]] [[satellite]]s. EUMETSAT is responsible for the launch and operation of the [[satellite]]s and for delivering satellite data to end-users as well as contributing to the operational monitoring of [[climate]] and the detection of [[global climate change]]s.

The activities of EUMETSAT contribute to a global [[meteorological satellite]] observing system coordinated with other space-faring nations.

Satellite observations are an essential input to numerical [[weather prediction]] systems and also assist the human forecaster in the diagnosis of potentially hazardous weather developments. Of growing importance is the capacity of weather satellites to gather long-term measurements from space in support of climate change studies.

EUMETSAT is not part of the [[European Union]], but became a signatory to the [[International Charter on Space and Major Disasters]] in 2012, thus providing for the global charitable use of its space assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disasterscharter.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=23109&amp;folderId=172718&amp;name=DLFE-4704.pdf|format=PDF|title=The International Charter : Space &amp; Major Disasters|website=Disasterscharter.org|accessdate=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111231659/http://www.disasterscharter.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=23109&amp;folderId=172718&amp;name=DLFE-4704.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EUMETSAT METOP model.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Model of a MetOp polar satellite (bottom up).]]

=== Geostationary satellites ===
{{main|Meteosat}}
{{summarize|from|Meteosat|date=January 2015}}
Two generations of active Meteosat geostationary satellites, Meteosat Transition Programme (MTP) and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), provide images of the full Earth disc, and data for weather forecasts.  More detail can be found on the [[Meteosat]] wiki.

=== Polar satellites ===

==== EUMETSAT Polar System ====
{{main|Metop}}
{{duplication|dupe=Metop|date=July 2014}}
While [[geostationary satellite]]s provide a continuous view of the earth disc from a stationary position in space, the instruments on [[Polar (satellite)|polar-orbiting satellites]], flying at a much lower altitude, provide more precise details about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, although with less frequent global coverage.

The lack of observational coverage in certain parts of the globe, particularly the [[Pacific Ocean]] and continents of the [[southern hemisphere]], has led to the increasingly important role for polar-orbiting satellite data in [[numerical weather prediction]] and climate monitoring.

[[EUMETSAT Polar System]] (EPS) Metop mission consists of three polar orbiting Metop satellites, to be flown successively for more than 14 years. The first, Metop-A, was launched by a [[Russia]]n [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2.1a]] rocket from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] on October 19, 2006, at 22:28 Baikonur time (16:28 UTC). Metop-A was initially controlled by [[ESOC]] for the [[LEOP]] phase immediately following launch, with control handed over to EUMETSAT 72 hours after lift-off. EUMETSAT's first commands to the satellite were sent at 14:04 UTC on October 22, 2006.

The second EPS satellite, Metop-B, was launched from Baikonur on 17 September 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/News/DAT_2027474.html?lang=EN |title=At 18:28 CEST (22:28 Baikonur time), Metop-B was successfully launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz 2.1a rocket.|publisher=EUMETSAT |accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the third, Metop-C, scheduled for launch in November 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Metop/index.html |publisher=EUMETSAT|title=General information on MetOP.|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Positioned at approximately 817&amp;nbsp;km above [[the Earth]], special instruments on board Metop-A can deliver far more precise details about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles than a geostationary satellite.

The satellites also ensure that the more remote regions of the globe, particularly in Northern Europe as well as the oceans in the Southern hemisphere, are fully covered.

The EPS programme is also the European half of a joint program with [[NOAA]], called the International Joint Polar System. NOAA has operated a continuous series of low earth orbiting meteorological satellite since April 1960. Many of the instruments on Metop are also operated on NOAA/[[POES]] satellites, providing similar data types across the IJPS.

===== Instruments on Metop =====
* [[Argos System|A/DCS (Advanced Data Collection System)]]
* [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU-A1 and AMSU-A2]]
* ASCAT Advanced [[Scatterometer]]
* [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer|AVHRR]] (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer)
* GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment)&amp;nbsp;— instrument to monitor [[ozone]] levels
* GRAS  ([[GNSS]] Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding: global navigation satellite systems [[GPS radio occultation|radio occultation]])
* HIRS  (High Resolution [[Infrared]] Sounder)
* IASI ([[Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer]])
* MHS ([[Microwave]] [[Humidity]] Sounder)
* SARP-3 and SARR (Search And Rescue Processor and Search And Rescue Repeater)
* SEM (Space Environment Monitor)

==== Jason ====
{{main|Ocean Surface Topography Mission}}

The Jason-2 programme is an international partnership across multiple organisations, including EUMETSAT, CNES, and the US agencies NASA and NOAA.

Jason-2 was launched successfully from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] aboard a [[Delta-II rocket]] on 20 June 2008, 7:46 UTC. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081116195520/http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/What_We_Do/Highlights/SP_1213708779383?l=en]
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081115115541/http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/What_We_Do/Satellites/Jason/index.htm?l=en Jason Satellites]

Jason-2 reliably delivers detailed oceanographic data vital to our understanding of weather forecasting and climate change monitoring. Jason-2 provides data on the decadal (10-yearly) oscillations in large ocean basins, such as the Atlantic Ocean; mesoscale variability, and surface wind and wave conditions. Jason-2 measurements contribute to the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]] (ECMWF) satellite data assimilation, helping improve global atmosphere and ocean forecasting.

Altimetric data from Jason-2 have also helped create detailed decade-long global observations and analyses of the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] phenomena, opening the way to new discoveries about ocean circulation and its effects on climate, and providing new insights into ocean tides, turbulent ocean eddies and marine gravity.

The next step is the Jason-3 Programme, which has been approved. It will ensure continuation of the series of measurements made by the Jason-2 satellite, and its predecessors, in support of meteorology, operational oceanography and, in particular, the monitoring of the sea-level trend, a key indicator of climate change.

'''Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Union''' was an [[Australia]]n [[trade union]]. It represented workers in food processing and manufacturing industries.

== Formation ==

The Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Union was formed through the amalgamation of two pre-existing unions, the [[Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Association of Australasia]] and the [[Manufacturing Grocers' Employees' Federation of Australia]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010. Trade Union Entry: Federated Millers &amp; Manufacturing Grocers Employees Association of Australasia. "http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0470b.htm". [[Australian Trade Union Archives]]. Retrieved 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Both unions represented relatively small memberships, and amalgamated as part of a period of union rationalisation encouraged by the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|ACTU]].

== Amalgamation==

The new union did not last long as a separate entity, and in 1992 it amalgamated with the recently formed [[National Union of Workers]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The new union was formed from several pre-existing organisations, the largest and most influential being the [[Federated Storemen and Packers Union]].

'''Gallium arsenide''' ('''GaAs''') is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of the elements [[gallium]] and [[arsenic]]. It is a [[boron group|III]]-[[nitrogen group|V]] [[direct bandgap]] [[semiconductor]] with a [[Zincblende (crystal structure)|Zinc blende]] crystal structure.

Gallium arsenide is used in the manufacture of devices such as [[microwave]] frequency [[integrated circuit]]s, [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s, [[infrared]] [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[laser diode]]s, [[solar cells]] and optical windows.&lt;ref name = "Moss"/&gt;

GaAs is often used as a substrate material for the epitaxial growth of other III-V semiconductors including [[indium gallium arsenide]], [[aluminum gallium arsenide]] and others.

==Preparation and chemistry==
In the compound, gallium has a +3 [[oxidation state]]. Gallium arsenide [[single crystal]]s can be prepared by three industrial processes:&lt;ref name = "Moss"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moss, S. J.  |author2=Ledwith, A. | title = The Chemistry of the Semiconductor Industry| publisher = Springer| year = 1987| isbn = 978-0-216-92005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The vertical gradient freeze (VGF) process (most GaAs wafers are produced using this process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheel, Hans J. |author2=Tsuguo Fukuda. | title = Crystal Growth Technology| publisher = Wiley| year = 2003| isbn = 978-0471490593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Crystal growth using a horizontal zone furnace in the [[Bridgman-Stockbarger technique]], in which gallium and arsenic vapors react, and free molecules deposit on a seed crystal at the cooler end of the furnace.
*Liquid encapsulated [[Czochralski process|Czochralski]] (LEC) growth is used for producing high-purity single crystals that can exhibit semi-insulating characteristics (see below).

Alternative methods for producing films of GaAs include:&lt;ref name = "Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Smart, Lesley  |author2=Moore, Elaine A. | title = Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction| publisher = CRC Press| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-7487-7516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chemical vapor deposition|VPE]] reaction of gaseous gallium metal and [[arsenic trichloride]]: 2 Ga + 2 {{chem|AsCl|3}} → 2 GaAs + 3 {{chem|Cl|2}}
*[[MOCVD]] reaction of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]]: {{chem|Ga(CH|3|)|3}} + {{chem|AsH|3}} → GaAs + 3 {{chem|CH|4}}
*[[Molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) of [[gallium]] and [[arsenic]]: 4 Ga + {{chem|As|4}} → 4 GaAs or 2 Ga + {{chem|As|2}} → 2 GaAs

Oxidation of GaAs occurs in air and degrades performance of the semiconductor. The surface can be passivated by depositing a cubic [[gallium(II) sulfide]] layer using a tert-butyl gallium sulfide compound such as ({{chem|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;|BuGaS)|7}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemical vapor deposition from single organometallic precursors" A. R. Barron, M. B. Power, A. N. MacInnes, A. F.Hepp, P. P. Jenkins {{US patent|5300320}} (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-insulating crystals===
If a GaAs [[Boule (crystal)|boule]] is grown with excess arsenic present, it gets certain [[Crystallographic defect|defects]], in particular arsenic antisite defects (an arsenic atom at a gallium atom site within the crystal lattice). The electronic properties of these defects (interacting with others) cause the [[Fermi level]] to be [[Fermi level pinning|pinned]] to near the center of the bandgap, so that this GaAs crystal has very low concentration of electrons and holes. This low carrier concentration is similar to an intrinsic (perfectly undoped) crystal, but much easier to achieve in practice. These crystals are called "semi-insulating", reflecting their high resistivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm (which is quite high for a semiconductor, but still much lower than a true insulator like glass).&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey, Matthew D. and Haller, Eugene E. (2012) ''Dopants and Defects in Semiconductors'', pp. 41 and 66, {{ISBN|978-1439831526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etching===
Wet etching of GaAs industrially uses an oxidizing agent such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[bromine]] water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brozel, M. R.  |author2=Stillman, G. E. | title = Properties of Gallium Arsenide| publisher = IEEE Inspec| year = 1996| isbn = 978-0-85296-885-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the same strategy has been described in a patent relating to processing scrap components containing GaAs where the {{chem|Ga||3+}} is complexed with a [[hydroxamic acid]] ("HA"), for example:&lt;ref&gt;"Oxidative dissolution of gallium arsenide and separation of gallium from arsenic" J. P. Coleman and B. F. Monzyk {{US patent|4759917}} (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
:GaAs + {{chem|H|2|O|2}} + "HA" → "GaA" complex + {{chem|H|3|AsO|4}} + 4 {{chem|H|2|O}}
This reaction produces [[arsenic acid]].

===Comparison with silicon for electronics===

===GaAs advantages===
Some electronic properties of gallium arsenide are superior to those of [[silicon]]. It has a higher [[saturation velocity|saturated electron velocity]] and higher [[electron mobility]], allowing gallium arsenide transistors to function at frequencies in excess of 250&amp;nbsp;GHz. GaAs devices are relatively insensitive to overheating, owing to their wider energy bandgap, and they also tend to create less [[noise (physics)|noise]] (disturbance in an electrical signal) in electronic circuits than silicon devices, especially at high frequencies. This is a result of higher carrier mobilities and lower resistive device parasitics. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in [[mobile phone]]s, [[communications satellite|satellite]] communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency [[radar]] systems. It is also used in the manufacture of [[Gunn diode]]s for the generation of [[microwaves]].

Another advantage of GaAs is that it has a [[direct band gap]], which means that it can be used to absorb and emit light efficiently. Silicon has an [[indirect bandgap]] and so is relatively poor at emitting light.

As a wide direct band gap material with resulting resistance to radiation damage, GaAs is an excellent material for outer space electronics and optical windows in high power applications.

Because of its wide bandgap, pure GaAs is highly resistive. Combined with a high [[dielectric constant]], this property makes  GaAs a very good substrate for [[Integrated circuits]] and unlike Si provides natural isolation between devices and circuits.  This has made it an ideal material for monolithic microwave integrated circuits, [[MMIC]]s, where active and essential passive components can readily be produced on a single slice of GaAs.

One of the first GaAs [[microprocessor]]s was developed in the early 1980s by the [[RCA]] corporation and was considered for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars program]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. These processors were several times faster and several orders of magnitude more [[Radiation hardening|radiation proof]] than silicon counterparts, but were more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEYKyfZ3yF0C&amp;pg=PA34|title=Processor architecture: from dataflow to superscalar and beyond|author1=Šilc, Von Jurij |author2=Robič, Borut |author3=Ungerer, Theo |publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=978-3-540-64798-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other GaAs processors were implemented by the [[supercomputer]] vendors [[Cray Computer|Cray Computer Corporation]], [[Convex Computer|Convex]], and [[Alliant Computer Systems|Alliant]] in an attempt to stay ahead of the ever-improving [[CMOS]] microprocessor. Cray eventually built one GaAs-based machine in the early 1990s, the [[Cray-3]], but the effort was not adequately capitalized, and the company filed for bankruptcy in 1995.

Complex layered structures of gallium arsenide in combination with [[aluminium arsenide]] (AlAs) or the alloy [[Aluminium gallium arsenide|Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As]] can be grown using [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) or using [[metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy]] (MOVPE). Because GaAs and AlAs have almost the same [[lattice constant]], the layers have very little induced [[Strain (chemistry)|strain]], which allows them to be grown almost arbitrarily thick.  This allows extremely high performance and high electron mobility [[HEMT]] transistors and other [[quantum well]] devices.

Concerns over GaAs's susceptibility to heat damage have been raised, but it has been speculated that certain manufacturers would benefit from such limitations, considering the [[planned obsolescence]] cycle that many consumer electronics are designed to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/cheaper-better-faster-stronger-ars-meets-the-latest-military-bred-chip/|title=A reprieve for Moore's Law: milspec chip writes computing's next chapter|website=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-06-14|date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon advantages===
Silicon has three major advantages over GaAs for integrated circuit manufacture. First, silicon is abundant and cheap to process in the form of [[silicate]] minerals. The [[economy of scale|economies of scale]] available to the silicon industry has also hindered the adoption of GaAs.

In addition, a Si crystal has a very stable structure and can be grown to very large diameter [[boule (crystal)|boule]]s and processed with very good yields. It is also a fairly good thermal conductor, thus enabling very dense packing of transistors that need to get rid of their heat of operation, all very desirable for design and manufacturing of very large [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s. Such good mechanical characteristics also make it a suitable material for the rapidly developing field of [[nanoelectronics]]. Naturally, a GaAs surface cannot withstand the high temperatures needed for diffusion; however a viable and actively pursued alternative as of the 1980's was ion implanation.&lt;ref name="Morgan&amp;Board"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=D. V.|last2=Board|first2=K.|title=An Introduction To Semiconductor Microtechnology|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|isbn=978-0471924784|page=137|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major advantage of Si is the existence of a native oxide ([[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is used as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]. Silicon dioxide can be incorporated onto silicon circuits easily, and such layers are adherent to the underlying silicon. SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not only a good insulator (with a [[band gap]] of 8.9 [[electron volt|eV]]), but the Si-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface can be easily engineered to have excellent electrical properties, most importantly low density of interface states. GaAs does not have a native oxide, does not easily support a stable adherent insulating layer, and does not possess the dielectric strength or surface passivating qualities of the Si-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Morgan&amp;Board" /&gt;

[[Aluminum oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has been extensively studied as a possible gate oxide for GaAs (as well as [[indium gallium arsenide|InGaAs]]).

The third advantage of silicon is that it possesses a higher [[Electron hole|hole]] mobility compared to GaAs (500 versus 400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Sze, S. M. (1985). ''Semiconductor Devices Physics and Technology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. Appendix G. {{ISBN|0-471-87424-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high mobility allows the fabrication of higher-speed P-channel [[field effect transistor]]s, which are required for [[CMOS]] logic. Because they lack a fast CMOS structure, GaAs circuits must use logic styles which have much higher power consumption; this has made GaAs logic circuits unable to compete with silicon logic circuits.

For manufacturing solar cells, silicon has relatively low [[Molar absorptivity|absorptivity]] for sunlight, meaning about 100 micrometers of Si is needed to absorb most sunlight. Such a layer is relatively robust and easy to handle. In contrast, the absorptivity of GaAs is so high that only a few micrometers of thickness are needed to absorb all of the light. Consequently, GaAs thin films must be supported on a substrate material.&lt;ref name=adv&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100211014421/http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar/tf_single_crystalline.html Single-Crystalline Thin Film]. US Department of Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon is a pure element, avoiding the problems of stoichiometric imbalance and thermal unmixing of GaAs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Silicon has a nearly perfect lattice; impurity density is very low and allows very small structures to be built (currently down to 16&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;ref&gt;Handy, Jim (17 July 2013) [http://thememoryguy.com/micron-nand-reaches-16nm/ Micron NAND Reaches 16nm]. thememoryguy.com&lt;/ref&gt;). In contrast, GaAs has a very high impurity density,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} which makes it difficult to build integrated circuits with small structures, so the 500&amp;nbsp;nm process is a common process for GaAs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Other applications==
[[File:MidSTAR-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.67|[[Multijunction photovoltaic cell|Triple-junction]] GaAs cells covering [[MidSTAR-1]]]]

===Solar cells and detectors===
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is an important semiconductor material for high-cost, high-efficiency [[solar cell]]s and is used for single-crystalline [[thin film solar cell]]s and for [[multi-junction solar cells]].

The first known operational use of GaAs solar cells in space was for the [[Venera 3]] mission, launched in 1965. The GaAs solar cells, manufactured by Kvant, were chosen because of their higher performance in high temperature environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-540-79359-5|doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-79359-5 |author=Strobl, G.F.X.; LaRoche, G.; Rasch, K.-D. and Hey, G. |chapter=2: From Extraterrestrial to Terrestrial Applications|title=High-Efficient Low-Cost Photovoltaics: Recent Developments|publisher= Springer |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GaAs cells were then used for the [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod rovers]] for the same reason.

In 1970, the GaAs heterostructure solar cells were developed by the team led by [[Zhores Alferov]] in the [[USSR]],&lt;ref&gt;Alferov, Zh. I., V. M. Andreev, M. B. Kagan, I. I. Protasov and V. G. Trofim, 1970, ‘‘Solar-energy converters based on p-n Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As-GaAs heterojunctions,’’ ''Fiz. Tekh. Poluprovodn. 4'', 2378 (''Sov. Phys. Semicond. 4'', 2047 (1971))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090225094509/http://www.im.isu.edu.tw/seminar/2005.11.16.pdf Nanotechnology in energy applications]. im.isu.edu.tw. 16 November 2005 (in Chinese) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/alferov-lecture.pdf Nobel Lecture] by [[Zhores Alferov]] at nobelprize.org, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; achieving much higher efficiencies. In the early 1980s, the efficiency of the best GaAs solar cells surpassed that of conventional, [[crystalline silicon]]-based solar cells. In the 1990s, GaAs solar cells took over from silicon as the cell type most commonly used for [[photovoltaic array]]s for satellite applications. Later, dual- and triple-junction solar cells based on GaAs with [[germanium]] and [[indium gallium phosphide]] layers were developed as the basis of a triple-junction solar cell, which held a record efficiency of over 32% and can operate also with light as concentrated as 2,000 suns. This kind of solar cell powers the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s [[Spirit rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]], which are exploring [[Mars]]' surface. Also many [[Solar car racing|solar car]]s utilize GaAs in solar arrays.

GaAs-based devices hold the world record for the highest-efficiency single-junction solar cell at 28.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/PVSC.2012.6317891|chapter=The opto-electronic physics that broke the efficiency limit in solar cells|title=2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference|year=2012|last1=Yablonovitch|first1=Eli|last2=Miller|first2=Owen D.|last3=Kurtz|first3=S. R.|isbn=978-1-4673-0066-7|pages=001556}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high efficiency is attributed to the extreme high quality GaAs epitaxial growth, surface passivation by the AlGaAs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Schnitzer, I. |title=Ultrahigh spontaneous emission quantum efficiency, 99.7% internally and 72% externally, from AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=62 |issue=2 |year=1993 |page = 131 |doi=10.1063/1.109348| display-authors=1|last2=Yablonovitch|first2=E|last3=Caneau|first3=C|last4=Gmitter|first4=T.J|bibcode = 1993ApPhL..62..131S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of photon recycling by the thin film design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wang, X.|title=Design of GaAs Solar Cells Operating Close to the Shockley–Queisser Limit |journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2013 |page = 737 |doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2013.2241594| display-authors=1|last2=Khan|first2=M.R|last3=Gray|first3=J|last4=Alam|first4=M.A.|last5=Lundstrom|first5=M.S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex designs of Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As-GaAs devices using [[quantum well]]s can be sensitive to infrared radiation ([[QWIP]]).

GaAs diodes can be used for the detection of X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppewww.physics.gla.ac.uk/preprints/97/05/psd1/psd1.html Glasgow University report on CERN detector]. Ppewww.physics.gla.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2013-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light-emission devices===

[[File:Bandstruktur GaAs en.svg|thumb|Band structure of GaAs. The direct gap of GaAs results in efficient emission of infrared light at 1.424 eV (~870 nm).]]

GaAs has been used to produce near-infrared laser diodes since 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Robert N. |authorlink=Robert N. Hall |author2=Fenner, G. E. |author3=Kingsley, J.

===Fiber optic temperature measurement===
For this purpose an optical fiber tip of an optical fiber temperature sensor is equipped with a gallium arsenide crystal. Starting at a light wavelength of 850&amp;nbsp;nm GaAs becomes optically translucent. Since the position of the band gap is temperature dependent, it shifts about 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm/K. The measurement device contains a light source and a device for the spectral detection of the band gap. With the changing of the band gap, (0.4&amp;nbsp;nm/K) an algorithm calculates the temperature (all 250 ms).&lt;ref name="cc_galliumsensor"&gt;[http://www.optocon.de/en/support/documentation-publications/?no_cache=1&amp;cid=293&amp;did=105&amp;sechash=1439a6e7 A New Fiber Optical Thermometer and Its Application for Process Control in Strong Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields]. optocon.de (PDF; 2,5&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spin-charge converters===
GaAs may have applications in [[spintronics]] as it can be used instead of [[platinum]] in [[spin-charge converter]]s and may be more tunable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140905101631/http://www.compoundsemiconductor.net/article/94939-gaas-forms-basis-of-tunable-spintronics.html GaAs forms basis of tunable spintronics]. compoundsemiconductor.net.

{{Agriculture}}
The '''Green Revolution''', or '''Third Agricultural Revolution''', refers to a set of research and the development of [[technology transfer]] initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s, that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter B.R. |last=Hazell |title=The Asian Green Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frNfVx-KZOcC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2009 |work=IFPRI Discussion Paper |publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst |id=GGKEY:HS2UT4LADZD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including [[high-yielding varieties]] (HYVs) of cereals, especially [[dwarf wheat]]s and rices, in association with [[chemical fertilizer]]s and [[agro-chemicals]], and with controlled water-supply (usually involving [[irrigation]]) and new methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=B. H.|year=1986|title= Perspectives on the 'Green Revolution'in South Asia|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=20|number=01|pages=175–199|doi=10.1017/s0026749x00013627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] were heavily involved.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Toenniessen et al. "Building an alliance for a green revolution in Africa." ''Annals of the New York academy of sciences'' 1136.1 (2008): 233-242. [http://www.un.org/chinese/millenniumgoals/pdf/NYAS%20Building%20AGRA%20Off-print.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;  
One key leader was [[Norman Borlaug]], the "Father of the Green Revolution", who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1970. He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized seeds]], synthetic fertilizers, and [[pesticide]]s to farmers.

The term "Green Revolution" was first used in a March 8, 1968, speech by the administrator of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID), [[William S. Gaud]], who noted the spread of the new technologies: "These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent [[October Revolution|Red Revolution]] like that of the Soviets, nor is it a [[White Revolution]] like that of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. I call it the Green Revolution."&lt;ref name="agbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/borlaug-green.html |title=The Green Revolution: Accomplishments and Apprehensions |last1= Gaud |first1=William S. |date=8 March 1968 |publisher=AgBioWorld |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Monique Robin, ''The World According to Monsanto: Pollution, Corruption, and the Control of the World's Food Supply'' (The New Press, 2010) p308&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In Mexico===
{{See also|Agriculture in Mexico}}
It has been argued that "during the twentieth century two 'revolutions' transformed rural Mexico: the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the Green Revolution (1950–1970)".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cotter, ''Troubled Harvest: Agronomy and Revolution in Mexico, 1880–2002'', Westport, CT: Praeger. Contributions in Latin American Studies, no. 22, 2003, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the Mexican government, the U.S. government, the United Nations, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Mexico made a concerted effort to transform agricultural productivity, particularly with irrigated rather than dry-land cultivation in its northwest, to solve its problem of lack of food self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;David Barkin, "Food Production, Consumption, and Policy", ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'' vol. 1, p. 494. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the center and south of Mexico, where large-scale production faced challenges, agricultural production languished.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Wessman, "Agribusiness and Agroindustry", ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'' vol. 1, p. 29. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased production meant food self-sufficiency in Mexico to feed its growing and urbanizing population,  with the number of calories consumed per Mexican increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Barkin, "Food Production", p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Technology was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor, and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food|last=Jennifer|first=Clapp|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico was the recipient of Green Revolution knowledge and technology, and it was an active participant with financial support from the government for agriculture as well as Mexican agronomists.  Although the Mexican Revolution had broken the back of the [[hacienda]] system and [[land reform in Mexico]] had by 1940 distributed a large expanse of land in central and southern Mexico, agricultural productivity had fallen.  During the administration of [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] (1940–46), the government put resources into developing new breeds of plants and partnered  with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Cotter, p. 11"&gt;Cotter, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Mexican government founded the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT), which became a base for international agricultural research.

Agriculture in Mexico had been a sociopolitical issue, a key factor in some regions' participation in the Mexican Revolution. It was also a technical issue, enabled by a cohort of trained agronomists, who were to advise peasants how to increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  In the post-World War II era, the government sought development in agriculture that bettered technological aspects of agriculture in regions that were not dominated by small-scale peasant cultivators.  This drive for agricultural transformation would have the benefit of keeping Mexico self-sufficient in food and in the political sphere with the Cold War, potentially stem unrest and the appeal of Communism.&lt;ref name="Cotter, p. 11"/&gt; Technical aid can be seen as also serving political ends in the international sphere. In Mexico, it also served political ends,  separating peasant agriculture based on the [[ejido]] and considered one of the victories of the Mexican Revolution,  from agribusiness that requires large-scale land ownership, irrigation, specialized seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, machinery, and a low-wage paid labor force.

The government created the Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP) to be the lead organization in raising productivity.   One of their successes was wheat production, with varieties the agency's scientists helped create dominating wheat production as early as 1951 (70%), 1965 (80%), and 1968 (90%).&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico became the showcase for extending the Green Revolution to other areas of Latin America and beyond, into Africa and Asia. New breeds of maize, beans, and wheat produced bumper crops with proper inputs (such as fertilizer and pesticides) and careful cultivation. Many Mexican farmers who had been dubious about the scientists or hostile to them (often a mutual relationship of discord) came to see the scientific approach to agriculture as worth adopting.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

===In rice: IR8 and the Philippines===
In 1960, the Government of the Republic of the [[Philippines]] with the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] established the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI). A [[rice]] crossing between Dee-Geo-woo-gen and Peta was done at IRRI in 1962. In 1966, one of the breeding lines became a new [[cultivar]], [[IR8|IR8]].&lt;ref name=ir8&gt;IRRI [http://www.irri.org/publications/chandler/pdfs/chap4a.pdf Early research and training results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217012954/http://www.irri.org/publications/chandler/pdfs/chap4a.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} (pdf)pp.106–109.&lt;/ref&gt;  IR8 required the use of fertilizers and pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields than the traditional cultivars. Annual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7&amp;nbsp;million tons in two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/13472/en |title=Rice paddies |publisher=FAO Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Friday, 14 Jun. 1968 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900147,00.html |title=Rice of the Gods |work=TIME |date=14 June 1968 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Start in India===
{{See also|Green Revolution in India}}
In 1961, India was on the brink of mass famine.{{additional citation needed|date=February 2017|reason=existing reference does not fully support the statement that India was on the brink of mass famine in 1961}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0621_bamboo.html |title=India Girds for Famine Linked With Flowering of Bamboo |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Borlaug]] was invited to India by the adviser to the Indian minister of agriculture [[Dr.M.S Swaminathan]]. Despite bureaucratic hurdles imposed by India's grain monopolies, the Ford Foundation and Indian government collaborated to import wheat seed from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] was selected by the Indian government to be the first site to try the new crops because of its reliable water supply and a history of agricultural success. India began its own Green Revolution program of plant breeding, irrigation development, and financing of agrochemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/newsroom/releases/news.asp?idnews=532 |title=Newsroom: News Releases |publisher=CGIAR |accessdate=13 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626212555/http://www.cgiar.org/newsroom/releases/news.asp?idnews=532 |archive-date=26 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India soon adopted IR8 – a semi-dwarf rice variety developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) that could produce more grains of rice per plant when grown with certain fertilizers and irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-38156350|title=IR8: The miracle rice which saved millions of lives|last=Rowlatt|first=Justin|date=2016-12-01|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Indian agronomist [[Surajit Kumar De Datta|S.K. De Datta]] published his findings that IR8 rice yielded about 5 tons per hectare with no fertilizer, and almost 10 tons per hectare under optimal conditions. This was 10 times the yield of traditional rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000060017x |vauthors=De Datta SK, Tauro AC, Balaoing SN |title=Effect of plant type and nitrogen level on growth characteristics and grain yield of indica rice in the tropics |journal=Agron.

IR8 was also developed into [[Semi-dwarf IR36]].
[[File:Wheat yields in Least Developed Countries.svg|thumb|Wheat yields in [[least developed countries]] since 1961, in kilograms per hectare.]]
In the 1960s, rice yields in India were about two tons per hectare; by the mid-1990s, they had risen to six tons per hectare. In the 1970s, rice cost about $550 a ton; in 2001, it cost under $200 a ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Barta| first = Patrick |title = Feeding Billions, A Grain at a Time| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| pages = A1| date = 28 July 2007| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118556810848880619}}&lt;/ref&gt; India became one of the world's most successful rice producers, and is now a major rice exporter, shipping nearly 4.5&amp;nbsp;million tons in 2006.

===Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research – CGIAR===
In 1970, foundation officials proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the [[World Bank]]; on 19 May 1971, the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR) was established. co-sponsored by the FAO, IFAD and UNDP. CGIAR has added many research centers throughout the world.

CGIAR has responded, at least in part, to criticisms of Green Revolution methodologies. This began in the 1980s, and mainly was a result of pressure from donor organizations.&lt;ref name=oasa&gt;{{harvnb|Oasa|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods like Agroecosystem Analysis and Farming System Research have been adopted to gain a more holistic view of agriculture.

===Brazil's agricultural revolution===
Brazil's vast inland [[cerrado]] region was regarded as unfit for farming before the 1960s because the soil was too acidic and poor in nutrients, according to [[Norman Borlaug]]. However, from the 1960s, vast quantities of lime (pulverised chalk or limestone) were poured on the soil to reduce acidity. The effort went on for decades; by the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tonnes of lime were being spread on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tonnes in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tonnes of lime per hectare. As a result, Brazil has become the world's second biggest [[soybean]] exporter. Soybeans are also widely used in animal feed, and the large volume of soy produced in Brazil has contributed to Brazil's rise to become the biggest exporter of beef and poultry in the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist. ''Brazilian agriculture: The miracle of the cerrado''. August 26, 2010. http://www.economist.com/node/16886442&lt;/ref&gt; Several parallels can also be found in Argentina's boom in soybean production as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Al Jazeera English|title=People &amp; Power - Argentina: The Bad Seeds|date=2013-03-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxATngnqgv8|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems in Africa===
There have been numerous attempts to introduce the successful concepts from the Mexican and Indian projects into Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Master |title=Debating Development – A historical analysis of the Sasakawa Global 2000 project in Ghana and indigenous knowledge as an alternative approach to agricultural development |url=http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2009-0910-200159/UUindex.html |last=Groniger |first=Wout |year=2009 |publisher=Universiteit Utrecht |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303065240/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2009-0910-200159/UUindex.html |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have generally been less successful. Reasons cited include widespread corruption, insecurity, a lack of infrastructure, and a general lack of will on the part of the governments. Yet environmental factors, such as the availability of water for irrigation, the high diversity in slope and soil types in one given area are also reasons why the Green Revolution is not so successful in Africa.&lt;ref name="inwent.org"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emile Frison |title=Biodiversity: Indispensable resources |journal=D+C |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=190–3 |date=May 2008 |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/070224/index.en.shtml |quote=If there is to be a Green Revolution for Africa, it will be necessary to breed improved varieties and, indeed, livestock.

A recent program in western Africa is attempting to introduce a new high-yielding 'family' of rice varieties known as "[[New Rice for Africa]]" (NERICA). NERICA varieties yield about 30% more rice under normal conditions, and can double yields with small amounts of fertilizer and very basic irrigation. However, the program has been beset by problems getting the rice into the hands of farmers, and to date the only success has been in [[Guinea]], where it currently accounts for 16% of rice cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html |title=In Africa, Prosperity From Seeds Falls Short |work=[[The New York Times]]  |date= 10 October 2007|accessdate=20 March 2011 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a famine in 2001 and years of chronic hunger and poverty, in 2005 the small African country of [[Malawi]] launched the "Agricultural Input Subsidy Program" by which vouchers are given to smallholder farmers to buy subsidized nitrogen fertilizer and maize seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chibwana|first1=Christopher|last2=Fisher|first2=Monica|title=The Impacts of Agricultural Input Subsidies in Malawi|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/impacts-agricultural-input-subsidies-malawi |publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within its first year, the program was reported to have had extreme success, producing the largest maize harvest of the country's history, enough to feed the country with tons of maize left over. The program has advanced yearly ever since. Various sources claim that the program has been an unusual success, hailing it as a "miracle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8363914.stm Malawi Miracle] article on the [[BBC]] website. According to the [http://www.wfp.org/countries/Malawi/News/Malawi--P4P-raising-income-for-women-farmers UN website on Malawi] the program was highly effective.

===Technologies===
[[File:Wheat-haHula-ISRAEL2.JPG|thumb|New varieties of wheat and other grains were instrumental to the green revolution.]]
The Green Revolution spread technologies that already existed, but had not been widely implemented outside industrialized nations. Two kinds of technologies were used in the Green Revolution and aim at cultivation and breeding area respectively. The technologies in cultivation are targeted at providing excellent growing conditions, which included modern [[irrigation]] projects, [[pesticide]]s, and [[synthetic nitrogen fertilizer]]. The breeding technologies aimed at improving crop varieties developed through the conventional, science-based methods available at the time. These technologies included [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, combining modern genetics with selections.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plants and Society|last=Levetin|first=Estelle|publisher=WCB/McGraw-Hill|year=1999|isbn=0697345521|location=Boston|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== High-Yielding Varieties ====
The novel technological development of the Green Revolution was the production of novel wheat [[cultivars]]. [[Agronomist]]s [[Plant breeding|bred]] cultivars of maize, wheat, and rice that are generally referred to as HYVs or "[[high-yielding varieties]]". HYVs have higher nitrogen-absorbing potential than other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge, or fall over before harvest, semi-dwarfing [[gene]]s were bred into their [[genome]]s. A Japanese dwarf wheat cultivar [[Norin 10 wheat|Norin 10]] developed by a Japanese agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka, which was sent to [[Orville Vogel]] at [[Washington State University]] by [[Cecil Salmon]], was instrumental in developing Green Revolution wheat cultivars. IR8, the first widely implemented HYV rice to be developed by IRRI, was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named "Peta" and a Chinese variety named "Dee-geo-woo-gen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Challenge of Economic Development: A Survey of Issues and Constraints Facing Developing Countries|last=Hicks|first=Norman|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4567-6633-7|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=59|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, when a food crisis happened in Asia, the spread of HYV rice was aggravated intensely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development and spread of high-yielding rice varieties in developing countries|last=Dana G.|first=Dalrymple|publisher=Int.

Dr. [[Norman Borlaug]], who is usually recognized as the "Father of the Green Revolution", bred rust-resistant cultivars which have strong and firm stems, preventing them from falling over under extreme weather at high levels of fertilization. [[CIMMYT]](Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo—International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvements) conducted these breeding programs and helped spread [[high-yielding varieties]] in Mexico and countries in Asia like India and Pakistan. These programs successfully led the harvest double in these countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

HYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs. Therefore, several authors have challenged the apparent superiority of HYVs not only compared to the traditional varieties alone, but by contrasting the monocultural system associated with HYVs with the polycultural system associated with traditional ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Igbozurike, U.M. |title=Polyculture and Monoculture: Contrast and Analysis |journal=GeoJournal |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=443–49 |year=1978 |doi=10.1007/BF00156222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production increases===
Cereal production more than doubled in developing nations between the years 1961–1985.&lt;ref name=conway1&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1998|loc=Ch. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yields of rice, maize, and wheat increased steadily during that period.&lt;ref name=conway1/&gt; The production increases can be attributed roughly equally to irrigation, fertilizer, and seed development, at least in the case of Asian rice.&lt;ref name=conway1/&gt;

While agricultural output increased as a result of the Green Revolution, the energy input to produce a crop has increased faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/5045 |archivedate=1 April 2005 |url=http://www.powerswitch.org.uk/portal/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=563|title=Why Our Food is So Dependent on Oil |last1= Church |first1=Norman |date=1 April 2005 |publisher=PowerSwitch |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time. Green Revolution techniques also heavily rely on chemical [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[Defoliant|defoliants]] and rely on machines, which as of 2014 rely on or are derived from [[crude oil]], making agriculture increasingly reliant on crude oil extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20070914/NEWS/709140329/1011/RSS&amp;source=RSS |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016154827/http://timesdaily.com/article/20070914/NEWS/709140329/1011/RSS&amp;source=RSS |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 October 2007 |title=Fuel costs, drought influence price increase |publisher=Timesdaily.com |accessdate=20 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of the [[Peak Oil]] theory fear that a future decline in oil and gas production would lead to a decline in food production or even a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0724/p01s01-wogi.html |title=Rising food prices curb aid to global poor |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on food security===
{{Main|Food security}}
The effects of the Green Revolution on global [[food security]] are difficult to assess because of the complexities involved in food systems.

The [[world population]] has grown by about five billion&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/&lt;/ref&gt; since the beginning of the Green Revolution and many believe that, without the Revolution, there would have been greater [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]]. [[India]] saw annual wheat production rise from 10 million tons in the 1960s to 73&amp;nbsp;million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4994590.stm |title=The end of India's green revolution? |publisher=BBC News  |date=29 May 2006 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average person in the developing world consumes roughly 25% more &lt;!-- calorie source? from sugar, or rice, or ? --&gt;calories per day now than before the Green Revolution.&lt;ref name=conway1/&gt;  Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by about 160%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kindall, Henery W  |author2=Pimentel, David|title=Constraints on the Expansion of the Global Food Supply |journal=Ambio. |volume=23 |issue=3 |date=May 1994 |url= http://dieoff.org/page36.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production increases fostered by the Green Revolution are often credited with having helped to avoid widespread [[famine]], and for feeding billions of people.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/80096/icode/ Save and Grow farming model launched by FAO]". [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also claims that the Green Revolution has decreased food security for a large number of people. One claim involves the shift of subsistence-oriented cropland to cropland oriented towards production of grain for export or animal feed. For example, the Green Revolution replaced much of the land used for [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] that fed Indian peasants for wheat, which did not make up a large portion of the peasant diet.&lt;ref name=spitz&gt;{{harvnb|Spitz|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

====Malthusian criticism====
Some criticisms generally involve some variation of the [[Malthusian]] principle of population. Such concerns often revolve around the idea that the Green Revolution is unsustainable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieoff.com/page55.htm |title=Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy |publisher=Dieoff.com |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that humanity is now in a state of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[overshoot (population)|overshoot]] with regards to the sustainable [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] and [[ecological footprint|ecological demands]] on the Earth.

Although 36 million people die each year as a direct or indirect result of hunger and poor nutrition,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hunger#Malnutrition mortality statistics|Mortality statistics w/references in Wikipedia article on hunger.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus's more extreme predictions have frequently failed to materialize. In 1798 Thomas Malthus made his prediction of impending famine.&lt;ref name = "Green Revolutionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/19871/ |title=Green Revolutionary |publisher=Technology Review |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The world's population had doubled by 1923 and doubled again by 1973 without fulfilling Malthus's prediction. Malthusian [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], in his 1968 book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', said that "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980" and "Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs."&lt;ref name = "Green Revolutionary"/&gt;  Ehrlich's warnings failed to materialize when India became self-sustaining in cereal production in 1974 (six years later) as a result of the introduction of [[Norman Borlaug]]'s dwarf wheat varieties.&lt;ref name = "Green Revolutionary"/&gt;

However, Borlaug was well aware of the implications of population growth. In his Nobel lecture he repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. "The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only. Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the "Population Monster"...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth..."

Modern agriculture is largely reliant on petroleum energy.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-6262621.html World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists]". ''The Independent''. June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Famine====
To some modern Western sociologists and writers, increasing food production is not synonymous with increasing food security, and is only part of a larger equation. For example, Harvard professor [[Amartya Sen]] wrote that large [[List of famines|historic famines]] were not caused by decreases in food supply, but by socioeconomic dynamics and a failure of public action.&lt;ref name=sen&gt;Drezé and Sen 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Peter Bowbrick]] disputes Sen's theory, arguing that Sen relies on inconsistent arguments and contradicts available information, including sources that Sen himself cited.&lt;ref name=Bowbrick1986&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bowbrick| first = Peter| title = A Refutation of Professor Sen's Theory of Famine| journal=Food Policy| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 105–124|date=May 1986| doi = 10.1016/0306-9192(86)90059-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowbrick further argues that Sen's views coincide with that of the [[Bengal]] government at the time of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], and the policies Sen advocates failed to relieve the famine.&lt;ref name=Bowbrick1986/&gt;

====Quality of diet====
Some have challenged the value of the increased food production of Green Revolution agriculture. [[Miguel Altieri|Miguel A. Altieri]], (a pioneer of agroecology and peasant-advocate), writes that the comparison between traditional systems of agriculture and Green Revolution agriculture has been unfair, because Green Revolution agriculture produces [[monocultures]] of cereal grains, while traditional agriculture usually incorporates [[polyculture]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

These monoculture crops are often used for export, feed for animals, or conversion into biofuel. According to Emile Frison of [[Bioversity International]], the Green Revolution has also led to a change in dietary habits, as fewer people are affected by hunger and die from starvation, but many are affected by [[malnutrition]] such as [[iron deficiency|iron]] or [[vitamin A deficiency|vitamin-A deficiencies]].&lt;ref name="inwent.org"/&gt; Frison further asserts that almost 60% of yearly deaths of children under age five in developing countries are related to malnutrition.&lt;ref name="inwent.org"/&gt;

The strategies developed by the Green Revolution focused on fend off starvation and was very successful in raising overall yields of cereal grains, but did not give sufficient relevance to nutritional quality.&lt;ref name=SandsMorris2009&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–89 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; High yield-cereal crops have low [[Protein quality|quality proteins]], with [[essential amino acid]] deficiencies, are high in [[carbohydrate]]s, and lack balanced [[essential fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s and other quality factors.&lt;ref name=SandsMorris2009 /&gt;

High-yield rice (HYR), introduced since 1964 to poverty-ridden Asian countries, such as the [[Philippines]], was found to have inferior flavor and be more glutinous and less savory than their native varieties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This caused its price to be lower than the average market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham P. |chapter=The Green Revolution |title=The Companion to Development Studies |publisher=Arnold |location=London |year=2002 |pages=155–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines the introduction of heavy pesticides to rice production, in the early part of the Green Revolution, poisoned and killed off fish and weedy green vegetables that traditionally coexisted in [[rice paddy|rice paddies]]. These were nutritious food sources for many poor Filipino farmers prior to the introduction of pesticides, further impacting the diets of locals.&lt;ref name=rice-robbery&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.collectivetech.org/apc/sites/default/files/IRRI_Resource%20Kit_Final_SIBAT_0.pdf#page=21 |title=The Great Riice Robbery: A Handbook on the Impact of IRRI in Asia |author=Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas |editor=Victoria M.

====Political impact====
A major critic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/161/ ''Conservation Refugees – When Protecting Nature Means Kicking People Out'']; Dowie, Mark; quote: "...Later that spring, at a Vancouver, British Columbia, meeting of the International Forum on Indigenous Mapping, all two hundred delegates signed a declaration stating that the 'activities of conservation organizations now represent the single biggest threat to the integrity of indigenous lands'..."; November/December 2005; [[Orion (magazine)|Orion Magazine]] on line; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Green Revolution, U.S. [[investigative journalist]] [[Mark Dowie]], writes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1635253.American_Foundations ''American Foundations: An Investigative History'']; Dowie, Mark; 13 April 2001; [[MIT Press]]; Massachusetts; (retrieved from [[Goodreads]] online); {{ISBN|0262041898}}; accessed March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary objective of the program was geopolitical: to provide food for the populace in undeveloped countries and so bring social stability and weaken the fomenting of communist insurgency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing internal Foundation documents, Dowie states that the Ford Foundation had a greater concern than Rockefeller in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Primary objective was geopolitical – see {{cite book |first=Mark |last=Dowie |title=American Foundations: An Investigative History |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA |year=2001 |pages=109–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant evidence that the Green Revolution weakened socialist movements in many nations. In countries such as India, Mexico, and the Philippines, ''technological solutions'' were sought as an alternative to expanding ''[[agrarian reform]]'' initiatives, the latter of which were often linked to socialist politics.&lt;ref name="ross1"&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1998|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivetech.org/apc/sites/default/files/IRRI_Resource%20Kit_Final_SIBAT_0.pdf#page=21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725184419/http://www.collectivetech.org/apc/sites/default/files/IRRI_Resource%20Kit_Final_SIBAT_0.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socioeconomic impacts===

The transition from traditional agriculture, in which inputs were generated on-farm, to Green Revolution agriculture, which required the purchase of inputs, led to the widespread establishment of rural credit institutions. Smaller farmers often went into [[debt]], which in many cases results in a loss of their farmland.&lt;ref name=oasa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponting"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ponting |first=Clive |year=2007 |title=A New Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations |location=New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978-0-14-303898-6 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increased level of mechanization on larger farms made possible by the Green Revolution removed a large source of employment from the rural economy.&lt;ref name=oasa/&gt;  Because wealthier farmers had better access to credit and land, the Green Revolution increased class disparities, with the rich–poor gap widening as a result. Because some regions were able to adopt Green Revolution agriculture more readily than others (for political or geographical reasons), interregional economic disparities increased as well. Many small farmers are hurt by the dropping prices resulting from increased production overall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} However, large-scale farming companies only account for less than 10% of the total farming capacity. This is a criticism held by many small producers in the [[food sovereignty]] movement.

The new economic difficulties of small holder farmers and landless farm workers led to increased [[Urbanization|rural-urban migration]]. The increase in food production led to a cheaper food for urban dwellers, and the increase in urban population increased the potential for industrialization.{{Citation needed|reason=I've heard this before, so I know reliable sources should be available; UN stats?|date=December 2008}}

According to a 2018 paper, a 10 percentage points increase in the use of high-yielding crop varieties in developing countries in the period 1960-2000 led to increases in GDP per capita of approximately 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gollin|first=Douglas|last2=Hansen|first2=Casper Worm|last3=Wingender|first3=Asger|date=2018|title=Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24744|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the green revolution.]]

====Biodiversity====
The spread of Green Revolution agriculture affected both agricultural [[biodiversity]] (or agrodiversity) and wild biodiversity.&lt;ref name=rice-robbery/&gt; There is little disagreement that the Green Revolution acted to reduce agricultural biodiversity, as it relied on just a few high-yield varieties of each crop.

This has led to concerns about the susceptibility of a food supply to pathogens that cannot be controlled by agrochemicals, as well as the permanent loss of many valuable genetic traits bred into traditional varieties over thousands of years. To address these concerns, massive seed banks such as [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]]’s (CGIAR) International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (now [[Bioversity International]]) have been established (see [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]]).

There are varying opinions about the effect of the Green Revolution on wild biodiversity. One hypothesis speculates that by increasing production per unit of land area, agriculture will not need to expand into new, uncultivated areas to feed a growing human population.&lt;ref name=Davies2003&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davies| first = Paul| title = An Historical Perspective from the Green Revolution to the Gene Revolution| journal=Nutrition Reviews| volume = 61| issue = 6| pages = S124–34|date=June 2003| doi = 10.1301/nr.2003.jun.S124-S134| pmid = 12908744}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, land degradation and soil nutrients depletion have forced farmers to clear up formerly forested areas in order to keep up with production.&lt;ref name=Shiva1991&gt;{{cite journal| last = Shiva| first = Vandana| title = The Green Revolution in the Punjab| journal=The Ecologist| volume = 21| issue = 2| pages = 57–60|date=March–April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity, and because the Green Revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid. For example, the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content, permitted the introduction of agriculture in sensitive [[Wildlife of Brazil|Brazilian ecosystems]] such as [[Cerrado]] [[tropical savanna climate|semi-humid]] [[tropical savanna]] and [[Amazon rainforest]] in the geoeconomic macroregions of [[Brazil socio-geographic division|Centro-Sul and Amazônia]].&lt;ref name="Davies2003"/&gt; Before the Green Revolution, other Brazilian ecosystems were also significantly damaged by human activity, such as the once 1st or 2nd main contributor to Brazilian megadiversity [[Mata Atlântica|Atlantic Rainforest]] (above 85% of deforestation in the 1980s, about 95% after the 2010s) and the important [[xeric shrubland]]s called [[Caatinga]] mainly in [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] (about 40% in the 1980s, about 50% after the 2010s — deforestation of the Caatinga biome is generally associated with greater risks of [[desertification]]). This also caused many animal species to suffer due to their damaged habitats.

Nevertheless, the world community has clearly acknowledged the negative aspects of [[agricultural expansion]] as the 1992 [[Rio Treaty]], signed by 189 nations, has generated numerous national [[Biodiversity Action Plans]] which assign significant biodiversity loss to agriculture's expansion into new domains.

The Green Revolution has been criticized for an agricultural model which relied on a few staple and market profitable crops, and pursuing a model which limited the biodiversity of Mexico. One of the critics against these techniques  and the Green Revolution as a whole was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a geography professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. According to Sauer these techniques of plant breeding would result in negative effects on the country's resources, and the culture:

"A good aggressive bunch of American agronomists and plant breeders could ruin the native resources for good and all by pushing their American commercial stocks… And Mexican agriculture cannot be pointed toward standardization on a few commercial types without upsetting native economy and culture hopelessly... Unless the Americans understand that, they'd better keep out of this country entirely.

According to a study published in 2013 in [[PNAS]], in the absence of the crop germplasm improvement associated with the Green Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions would have been 5.2-7.4 Gt higher than observed in 1965–2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/08/1208065110.abstract |title=Green Revolution research saved an estimated 18 to 27 million hectares from being brought into agricultural production |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-08-28 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1208065110 |volume=110 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=8363–8368|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8363S |pmc=3666715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High yield agriculture has dramatic effects on the amount of carbon cycling in the atmosphere. The way in which farms are grown, in tandem with the seasonal carbon cycling of various crops, could alter the impact carbon in the atmosphere has on global warming. Wheat, rice, and soybean crops account for a significant amount of the increase in carbon in the atmosphere over the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/green-revolution-brings-greater-co2-swings-18354|title=‘Green Revolution’ Brings Greater CO2 Swings|website=www.climatecentral.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dependence on non-renewable resources====
Most high intensity agricultural production is highly reliant on non-renewable resources. Agricultural machinery and transport, as well as the production of pesticides and nitrates all depend on fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2005-04-01/why-our-food-so-dependent-oil|title=Why Our Food is So Dependent on Oil|publisher=Powerswitch (UK)|website=Resilience|date=2005-04-01|author=Norman J. Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the essential mineral nutrient phosphorus is often a limiting factor in crop cultivation, while phosphorus mines are rapidly being depleted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phosphorusfutures.net/files/2_Peak%20P_SWhite_DCordell.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824103834/http://phosphorusfutures.net/files/2_Peak%20P_SWhite_DCordell.pdf |archivedate=24 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to depart from these non-sustainable agricultural production methods could potentially lead to a large scale collapse of the current system of intensive food production within this century.

===Health impact===
{{main|Health effects of pesticides}}
The consumption of the [[pesticide]]s used to kill [[Pest (organism)|pests]] by humans in some cases may be increasing the likelihood of cancer in some of the rural villages using them.&lt;ref name="Loyn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Loyn |first=David |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7366899.stm |title=Punjab suffers from adverse effect of Green revolution |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 April 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor farming practices including non-compliance to usage of masks and over-usage of the chemicals compound this situation.&lt;ref name="Loyn"/&gt; In 1989, WHO and UNEP estimated that there were around 1 million human pesticide poisonings annually. Some 20,000 (mostly in developing countries) ended in death, as a result of poor labeling, loose safety standards etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pimentel, D. |title=Green revolution agriculture and chemical hazards |journal=The Science of the Total Environment |volume=188 |issue=Suppl |pages=S86–S98 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/0048-9697(96)05280-1 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969796052801|bibcode=1996ScTEn.188S..86P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pesticides and cancer====
Contradictory epidemiologic studies in humans have linked phenoxy acid herbicides or contaminants in them with [[soft tissue sarcoma]] (STS) and malignant [[lymphoma]], organochlorine insecticides with STS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), [[leukemia]], and, less consistently, with cancers of the [[Lung cancer|lung]] and [[Breast cancer|breast]], [[organophosphorous]] compounds with NHL and leukemia, and triazine herbicides with [[ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dich J, Zahm SH, Hanberg A, Adami HO |title=Pesticides and cancer |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=420–43 |date=May 1997 |pmid=9498903 |doi=10.1023/A:1018413522959 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p43860605x4h5v63/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9646054 |title=Pesticides and childhood cancer |date=21 January 2011 |last2=Ward |first2=MH |volume=106 |pages=893–908 |pmc=1533072 |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |issue=Suppl 3 |last1=Zahm |first1=SH|doi=10.2307/3434207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Punjab case====
{{See also|Green Revolution in India}}
The Indian state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] pioneered green revolution among the other states transforming India into a food-surplus country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2004, Punjab |date=2004 |author=[[Government of Punjab, India|The Government of Punjab]] |accessdate=9 August 2011}}  Section: "The Green Revolution", pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The state is witnessing serious consequences of intensive farming using chemicals and pesticides. A comprehensive study conducted by [[Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research]] ([[PGIMER]]) has underlined the direct relationship between indiscriminate use of these chemicals and increased incidence of cancer in this region.&lt;ref name=cancer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardnewsmedia.com/2006/11/648 |title=Green revolution’s cancer train |author=Sandeep Yadav Faridkot |date=November 2006 |publisher=Hardnews |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the number of cancer cases has been reported in several villages including Jhariwala, Koharwala, Puckka, Bhimawali, and Khara.&lt;ref name=cancer/&gt;

Environmental activist [[Vandana Shiva]] has written extensively about the social, political and economic impacts of the Green Revolution in Punjab. She claims that the Green Revolution's reliance on heavy use of chemical inputs and monocultures has resulted in water scarcity, vulnerability to pests, and incidents of violent conflict and social marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingheritage.org/green-revolution.htm |title=Green revolution in Punjab, by Vandana Shiva |publisher=Livingheritage.org |date=15 October 1988 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Greenpeace]] Research Laboratories investigation of 50 villages in [[Muktsar]], [[Bathinda]] and [[Ludhiana district]]s revealed that twenty percent of the sampled wells had nitrate levels above WHO limits for drinking water. The 2009 study linked the nitrate pollution with high use of synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/Chemical_fertilizers_in_our_water-An_analysis_of_nitrates_in_the_groundwater_in_Punjab_Greenpeace_2009.pdf |title=Chemical fertilizers in our water-An analysis_of nitrates in the groundwater in Punjab |date= November 2009 |publisher= Greenpeace India Society |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norman Borlaug's response to criticism==
Borlaug dismissed certain claims of critics, but also cautioned, "There are no miracles in agricultural production. Nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of wheat, rice, or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all ills of a stagnant, traditional agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/iowans.html |title=Iowans Who Fed The World - Norman Borlaug: Geneticist |date= 26 October 2002 |publisher=AgBioWorld |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of environmental lobbyists, he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the [[Salt and Light#Cultural references|salt of the earth]], but many of them are [[elitist]]s. They've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or [[Brussels]]...If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tierney |first=John |url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/greens-and-hunger/ |title=Greens and Hunger |work=TierneyLab – Putting Ideas in Science to the Test |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=13 February 2009 | date=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order --&gt;

==The New Green Revolution==
{{main|Second Green Revolution}}
Although the Green Revolution has been able to improve agricultural output in some regions in the world, there was and is still room for improvement. As a result, many organizations continue to invent new ways to improve the techniques already used in the Green Revolution. Frequently quoted inventions are the [[System of Rice Intensification]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Uphoff for SciDevNet 16 October 2013 [http://www.scidev.net/global/food-security/opinion/new-approaches-are-needed-for-another-green-revolution.html New approaches are needed for another Green Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[marker-assisted selection]],&lt;ref&gt;Tom Chivers for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Last updated: 31 January 2012 [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100133700/the-new-green-revolution-that-will-feed-the-world/ The new green revolution that will feed the world],&lt;/ref&gt; [[agroecology]],&lt;ref&gt;Olivier De Schutter, Gaëtan Vanloqueren.

Rome 13–17 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Current challenges for nations trying to modernize their agriculture include closing the urban-rural income gap, integration of smallholders into value chains, and maintaining competitiveness in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pingali|first1=Prabhu|title=Making " Agriculture for Development" work in the 21st century|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007209040742|website=ScienceDirect|publisher=Handbook of Agricultural Economics|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in low-income countries, chronic problems such as poverty and hunger cause agricultural modernization efforts constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evenson|first1=Robert|title=Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture: The Role of Technological Capital|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007209040729|website=ScienceDirect|publisher=Handbook of Agricultural Economics|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected that global populations by 2050 will increase by one-third and as such will require a 70% increase in the production of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title= How to Feed the World in 2050|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/expert_paper/How_to_Feed_the_World_in_2050.pdf|website=FOA|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Second Green Revolution will likely focus on improving tolerances to pests and disease in addition to technological input use efficiency.

'''Grok Learning''' is an online interactive platform that offers coding classes in [[programming languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[HTML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groklearning.com/ |title=Grok Learning |publisher=Grok Learning |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grok Learning has a focus on educating [[high school]] students, but also has content targeted specifically for professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groklearning.com/professionals/ |title=Professional development |publisher=Grok Learning |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grok Learning provides courses suitable for use in a classroom setting where a computing trained teacher may or may not be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groklearning.com/classroom/ |title=In the classroom |publisher=Grok Learning |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site teaches students through a combination of notes and accompanying coding problems to solve. These problems can coded and run using the in-browser programming environment and are marked instantaneously by an auto-marker. The site offers feedback for solved problems, and badges for completing certain tasks, as well as leaderboards for certain courses. Grok has created a motto to encourage coders to keep going. This motto is "Grok On".

==History==
Grok Learning was founded in 2013 by Tara Murphy, [[James Curran (linguist)|James Curran]], Tim Dawborn, and Nicky Ringland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groklearning.com/about/ |title=Who are we? |publisher=Grok Learning |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of foundation, James was an [[associate professor]] in the School of IT at [[The University of Sydney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/it/~james/ |title=James Curran |publisher=James Curran |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tara was a [[senior lecturer]] in [[astroinformatics]] at [[The University of Sydney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~tara/ |title=Tara Murphy |publisher=Tara Murphy |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim and Nicky were [[computer science]] [[PhD candidate]]s at [[The University of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/it/~tdaw3088/ |title=Tim Dawborn |publisher=Tim Dawborn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/it/~nicky/ |title=Nicky Ringland |publisher=Nicky Ringland |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Tim and Nicky have completed their PhDs in 2015.

'''Gude Cause''' was the name of a [[Feminism|feminist]] project, based at the Peace and Justice Centre in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], which inspired over 60 events and projects throughout Scotland between 2007 and 2009.    
 
Gude Cause aimed to commemorate the work of Scotswomen involved in the [[suffrage movement]], to celebrate women's achievements in the 100 years since the [[Women's Suffrage]] [[Procession]] which had taken place in Edinburgh in 1909, and to re-energise women's commitment to political representation and action in Scotland.

The work culminated in the [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]] on 10 October 2009 of the 1909 Edinburgh procession, and was organised by volunteers, women's historians and community workers, in association with The Edinburgh Peace and Justice Resource Centre,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scotsman.com/news/a-gude-cause-1-777598|title = A gude cause|date = 8 October 2009|accessdate = |website = The Scotsman|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving the main goal of recreating the original procession in all its glory, while drawing attention to the problems that still need to be faced up to around the world, such as tackling domestic violence, forced marriage, sex trafficking and equal pay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Thousands of people from groups across Scotland had prepared for the day by creating [[banner]]s, learning old and specially written songs, researching women's struggles in the past and discussing current issues and future aims.

The crowd on the day included women, men and children; students, activists, '[[roller derby]] girls', the [[University of the Third Age]], political parties, [[faith]] groups and trade unions; artists and academics; professionals and campaigners for [[women's rights]], [[social justice]] and [[environmental justice]], representing a wide spectrum of ages, ethnicities, attitudes and activism and a mixture of [[belief]]s, traditions and movements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk/content/magazine/2009winter-Humanitie.pdf|title = A Gude Cause: Celebrating the Women’s Movement in Scotland|last = |first = |date = Winter 2009|journal = Humanitie, The Humanist Society of Scotland Magazine Winter 2009|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with the Suffrage Procession a century before, the Gude Cause Procession 2009 was led by a lone woman [[bagpipes|piper]], Pipe Major Louise Marshall Millington,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pipeforscotland.com/index.html|title = Piping in Scotland blog|date = |accessdate = |website = Pipe for Scotland|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured a band, the Forth Bridges Accordion Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/43675100@N08/4017766198/|title = Gude Cause Procession, Forth Bridges {{sic|nolink=y|Accordian}} Band|date = 10 October 2009|accessdate = |website = Flickr|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[mounted police]]women represented the women on horseback of the 1909 parade. Groups of drummers, including SheBoom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sheboom.co.uk/images/Adobe%20Web%20Gallery/index.html|title = SheBoom Gallery|date = |accessdate = |website = SheBoom|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and singers led each section of the Procession, representing the past, the present and the future for women in Scotland.

==Origins and aims==
In the weeks before the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election, statistics indicated that a large percentage of women intended to abstain from using the vote that women a century ago had fought so hard to secure. Women – especially young women – appeared to be disillusioned and increasingly apathetic about party politics and representative democracy. However, the same study showed they did still care about the issues and political decisions that affect people's lives in Scotland and around the world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/27104103/6|title = A Gender Audit of Statistics – Participation in Political and Public Life|date = 2007|accessdate = |website = The Scottish Government|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research also showed that, when looked at as a group, women often had differing views to men on a wide range subjects,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; including issues such as the war in Iraq or the replacement of the Trident nuclear missile system. It followed, therefore, that the under representation of women and their views in the political process was not just an academic problem, but that this was likely to result in real deficiencies in government policy and decision-making in not taking into account of the needs of this group of the population.
[[File:Participants in the Gude Cause Procession, Edinburgh 2009 .jpg|thumb|Participants in the Gude Cause Procession, Edinburgh 2009]]

In April 2007, the Edinburgh Peace &amp; Justice Centre organised a procession along Princes Street in Edinburgh, to raise the profile of women's concerns, to encourage women to re-engage with the political process, and at the most basic level, to make women think about using their vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite the short notice, several hundred women turned up, walking along Princes Street and climbing Calton Hill to sing "[[Bread and Roses]]" and other feminist songs. Participants agreed that this spirit of feminist co-operation could inspire the planning of a more substantial and high-profile public campaign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Gude Cause Banner.jpg|thumb|Gude Cause Banner]]

The plan was to recall and celebrate the courage, passion and persistence of the women's suffrage activists who, for around sixty years from 1867 until 1928, had campaigned for the vote. A key event for the movement in Scotland was the great suffrage procession through the streets of Edinburgh on 9 October 1909. It was decided it would be good to re-enact that event one hundred years on, in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Among the many of banners seen at the 1909 procession was one which read "A Gude Cause Maks a Strong Arm"; a rallying call the organisers felt was as true in 2009 as it was in 1909. And so "Gude Cause" was adopted as the name for the organisation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The organisation's aims were to commemorate the 1909 Suffrage Parade in Edinburgh, and the importance of Scotswomen in the suffrage movement; to encourage Scotswomen to re-connect with political processes at a local, regional and national level; to celebrate all the achievements and progress made by Scotswomen during the last hundred years; and to highlight the violence, lower pay, discrimination and other inequalities which the Scottish Government's own Gender Audit of 2007 revealed still blight many women's lives in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The project was launched in October 2008 at the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://vads.ac.uk/news/?m=200907|title = Your Pick: The Suffrage March|date = 24 July 2009|accessdate = |website = vads the online resource for visual arts|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1909 Event==
The 1909 Edinburgh Pageant, which so inspired the creation of Gude Cause, took place in the midst of great political tension on Scotland. Four key by-elections provided ideal campaigning opportunities for the [[suffragettes]], and in the weeks leading up to the event, several women were arrested and imprisoned. Some refused to eat. Meanwhile, the constitutional campaigners were organising exhausting caravan tours the length and breadth of the country – chalking details of meetings on pavements and enduring jeers on the streets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:"The Great Procession and Women's Demonstration", 1909 on Princes Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The Great Procession and Women's Demonstration 1909]]

The 1909 procession was organised by the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), who billed it as "The Great Procession and Women's Demonstration" with the theme of "What women have done and can and will do".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In charge of planning, and at the helm of the procession itself, was [[Flora Drummond]], aka 'the General', astride a horse. Playing the bagpipes was nine-year-old Bessie Watson.  A "Historical Pageant" of women dressed as well-known female historical figures, including the Countess of Buchan,[http://www.ourtownstories.co.uk/story/1091#page1] and groups from far &amp; near processed along Princes Street, while a large proportion of the local population turned out to watch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The leader of the British suffragette movement, Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel, were keynote speakers; participants included some of the first female graduates from Edinburgh University and a group of fishwives from Musselburgh.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'The Edinburgh ''Evening Dispatch'' wrote of "a solid phalanx of resolute and unflinching womanhood bent upon obtaining the vote"'.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://womenshistoryscotland.org/author/admin/|title = A Gude Cause Maks a Strong Arm|date = 13 October 2009|accessdate = |website = Women's History Scotland|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many taking part wore the WSPU colours of white, violet, and green, others were dressed in their graduate robes or the attire of their profession or trade. It was a demonstration of women's recent and hard-won achievements, as well as their aspirations for future equality and rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Edinburgh ''Evening Dispatch'' wrote in its 11 October 1909 issue, "The imposing display achieved its object. It advertised to tens of 1000s the aim and objects of the [[suffragettes]], and it made it abundantly apparent to all who had eyes to see, ears to hear, and minds to understand, that behind this movement there is a solid phalanx of resolute and unflinching womanhood bent upon obtaining the vote, and fully determined that they will triumph over every obstacle!”

==2009 Event==
On Saturday 10 October 2009 5000 people paraded through Edinburgh in autumn sunshine to commemorate the work of the suffrage movement, to celebrate women's achievements in the intervening 100 years, and to re-energise women's commitment to political representation and action in Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "The suffragettes wanted votes for women; these re-enactors want women to value and use the votes for which their great grannies fought".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scotsman.com/news/peter-ross-at-large-back-in-suffragette-city-1-1361662|title = Peter Ross at Large: Back in suffragette city|date = 10 October 2009|accessdate = |website = The Scotsman|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant colours were violet, green and white and many were dressed in period costume from 1909, wearing sashes and carrying banners demanding Votes for Women, reflecting the look and aims of the earlier procession, as well as banners from groups currently involved in political and social activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/world/2009/10/439620.html|title = Gude Cause Anniversary March in Edinburgh|date = 10 October 2009|accessdate = |website = Indy Media|publisher = |last = o'Hanlon|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 procession assembled on [[Bruntsfield Links]] and travelled along the following route: [[Bruntsfield Links]] – Whitehouse Loan – Bruntsfield Place – Glengyle Terrace – Leven Terrace – Melville Drive – Middle Meadow Walk crossing [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]] (park) – Forest Road – [[George IV Bridge]] – The High Street AKA [[The Royal Mile]] – [[North Bridge, Edinburgh|North Bridge]] – Waterloo Place – Regent Road – Calton Hill access road – to the summit of [[Calton Hill]].   The original route had to be changed and the part along Princes Street had to be omitted because of the tram works.

The procession paused on the High Street, where Jenny Dawe, the [[City of Edinburgh Council]] leader, spoke from the [[Mercat cross]], tracing the history of women's struggles for recognition in Edinburgh. On behalf of the City of Edinburgh Council, Jenny presented the Gude Cause Committee with a banner which was made by the City of Edinburgh Council Museum Volunteers to commemorate the occasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; MSPs, from across the political spectrum, who joined the procession included [[Fiona Hyslop]], [[Sarah Boyack]], Marilyn Glen, [[Shirley Anne Somerville]] and [[Patrick Harvie]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Former MSP and MP [[Donald Gorrie]], whose aunts Belle and Mary Gorrie played Mary Queen of Scots and Catherine Barlass in the original parade, also took part.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Councillors joined the procession at this point and walked to [[Calton Hill]] where the Minister for Education, [[Fiona Hyslop]] MSP spoke on behalf of the Scottish Government.  [[Cathy Peattie]] MSP sang '[[Bread and Roses]]', and Janet Fenton spoke about the aims, aspirations and activities of the Gude Cause movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Allied organisations and initiatives==
Gude Cause had developed a network of women's organisations to spread the word and work in partnership to promote interest in women's history and political action. Over 100 organisations provided practical and financial support. In particular, the Gude Cause committee collaborated with 
* The Workers' Educational Association which organised classes throughout Scotland on historical research, banner and jewellery making, playwriting.   The Citadel Arts Group based in Leith, Edinburgh collaborated with the WEA to produce a play which was performed 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, ''What Women Want'', at Riddle's Court.'' ''With support from an anonymous donor, the Citadel Arts Group produced a film based on the play.   Jon Pullman has edited his footage of the play and added documentary footage to produce ''The Right to Vote an a' That, ''which was shown at the Central Library, George IV Bridge, Edinburgh in June 2013, now available for purchase from the Citadel Arts Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.citadelartsgroup.co.uk/|title = Citadel and the Suffragettes|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = Citadel Arts Group|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.citadelartsgroup.co.uk/|title = Citadel Arts Group home page|date = |accessdate = |website = Citadel Arts Group|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gude Cause Media Project==
One particular initiative is still ongoing. The Gude Cause Media Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/GudeCauseMediaProject?ref=hl|title = Gude Cause Media Project|date = |accessdate = |website = Gude Cause Media Project Facebook Page|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally called the New Media Group) aims to bring together crowd-sourced photographs and videos of the event, alongside video presentations talking about Scottish women's history and the suffrage movement in Scotland.

The crowd-sourced photographs and videos are being hosted by [[Scran]], an online resource for educational use by schools, further education, higher education, libraries, museums, and the public. Scran is part of [[RCAHMS]], the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]].

There is also a Gude Cause Group on [[Flickr]] which contains many of these images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">Established in 1987, the '''International Ground Source Heat Pump Association''' (IGSHPA) is a nonprofit, membership-based organization that promotes [[geothermal heat pump]] technology. It is an outreach unit of the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology (CEAT) at [[Oklahoma State University]]. 

==Primary Efforts==

IGSHPA is the main organization for establishing standards of practice and standards of design for [[Geothermal heat pump|Geothermal Heat Pump]] (GHP) systems in the US.&lt;ref name=nat-cert-std&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=National Certification Standard for Ground Source Heat Pump Personnel|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1116539|website=SciTech Connect|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related organizations have been formed in other countries  on four continents, including Australia, Canada, China, India, South Korea, and Sweden.

==Conferences==

Each year the association hosts an annual conference for people such as manufacturers, contractors, distributors, and drillers.

==Standards==
IGSHPA sets and revises standards for [[Geothermal heat pump|Geothermal Heat Pump]] (GHP) system installs based on ongoing research and field application results.

'''Knee replacement''', also known as '''knee [[arthroplasty]]''', is a surgical procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for [[osteoarthritis]],&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for other knee diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]]. In patients with severe deformity from advanced rheumatoid [[arthritis]], trauma, or long-standing osteoarthritis, the surgery may be more complicated and carry higher risk. [[Osteoporosis]] does not typically cause knee pain, deformity, or inflammation and is not a reason to perform knee replacement

Other major causes of debilitating pain include meniscus tears, cartilage defects, and ligament tears. Debilitating pain from osteoarthritis is much more common in the elderly.

Knee replacement surgery can be performed as a partial or a total knee replacement.&lt;ref name="AAOS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee.

The operation typically involves substantial postoperative pain, and includes vigorous physical rehabilitation. The recovery period may be 6 weeks or longer and may involve the use of mobility aids (e.g. walking frames, canes, crutches) to enable the patient's return to preoperative mobility.&lt;ref name=Leopold09&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/17/1749 | pmid = 19387017 | doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806027 | volume=360 | issue=17 | title=Minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis |date=April 2009 | author=Leopold SS | journal=N.

Knee replacement surgery is most commonly performed in people with advanced [[osteoarthritis]] and should be considered when conservative treatments have been exhausted.&lt;ref name="Management"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Manen|first1=MD|last2=Nace|first2=J|last3=Mont|first3=MA|title=Management of primary knee osteoarthritis and indications for total knee arthroplasty for general practitioners.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume=112 |issue=11 |pages=709–715 |date=November 2012 |pmid=23139341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total knee replacement is also an option to correct significant knee joint or bone trauma in young patients.  Similarly, total knee replacement can be performed to correct mild [[valgus deformity|valgus]] or [[varus deformity]]. Serious valgus or varus deformity should be corrected by [[osteotomy]]. [[Physical therapy]] has been shown to improve function and may delay or prevent the need for knee replacement. Pain is often noted when performing physical activities requiring a wide range of motion in the knee joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deyle GD, Henderson NE, Matekel RL, Ryder MG, Garber MB, Allison SC |title=Effectiveness of manual physical therapy and exercise in osteoarthritis of the knee.

==Risks==

Risks and complications in knee replacement&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vims.ac.in/healthcare/joint-replace-recovery-process.html&lt;/ref&gt; are similar to those associated with all [[Joint replacement#Risks and complications|joint replacements]]. The most serious complication is infection of the joint, which occurs in &lt;1% of patients. Risk factors for infection are related to both patient and surgical factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tayton|first=E. R.|last2=Frampton|first2=C.|last3=Hooper|first3=G. J.|last4=Young|first4=S. W.|date=1 March 2016|title=The impact of patient and surgical factors on the rate of infection after primary total knee arthroplasty|url=http://www.bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/content/98-B/3/334|journal=Bone Joint J|language=en|volume=98-B|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1302/0301-620X.98B3.36775|issn=2049-4394|pmid=26920958}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep vein thrombosis]] occurs in up to 15% of patients, and is symptomatic in 2–3%. Nerve injuries occur in 1–2% of patients. Persistent pain or stiffness occurs in 8–23% of patients. Prosthesis failure occurs in approximately 2% of patients at 5 years.&lt;ref name=Leopold09/&gt;

There is increased risk of complications for [[obese]] people going through total knee replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerkhoffs|first=GM|author2=Servien, E |author3=Dunn, W |author4=Dahm, D |author5=Bramer, JA |author6= Haverkamp, D |title=The influence of obesity on the complication rate and outcome of total knee arthroplasty: a meta-analysis and systematic literature review.|journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume|date=17 October 2012|volume=94|issue=20|pages=1839–44|pmid=23079875|doi=10.2106/JBJS.K.00820|pmc=3489068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The morbidly obese should be advised to lose weight before surgery and, if medically eligible, would probably benefit from [[bariatric surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Samson AJ, Mercer GE, Campbell DG |title=Total knee replacement in the morbidly obese: a literature review |journal=ANZ J Surg |volume=80 |issue=9 |pages=595–9 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20840400 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2010.05396.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1445-1433&amp;date=2010&amp;volume=80&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fracturing or chipping of the polyethylene platform between the femoral and tibial components may be of concern. These fragments may become lodged in the knee and create pain or may move to other parts of the body. Advancements in implant design have greatly reduced these issues but the potential for concern is still present over the lifespan of the knee replacement.

===Deep vein thrombosis===
According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), [[deep vein thrombosis]] in the leg is "the most common complication of knee replacement surgery... prevention... may include periodic elevation of patient's legs, lower leg exercises to increase circulation, support stockings and medication to thin your blood."&lt;ref name="AAOS"/&gt;

===Fractures===
[[Periprosthetic]] fractures are becoming more frequent with the aging patient population and can occur intraoperatively or postoperatively. Depending on the location of the fracture and the stability of the prosthesis, these can be treated surgically with open reduction and internal fixation or revision of the prosthesis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Loss of motion===
The knee at times may not recover its normal range of motion (0–135 degrees usually) after total knee replacement. Much of this is dependent on pre-operative function. Most patients can achieve 0–110 degrees, but stiffness of the joint can occur. In some situations, manipulation of the knee under anesthetic is used to reduce post operative stiffness. There are also many implants from manufacturers that are designed to be "high-flex" knees, offering a greater range of motion.

===Instability===
In some patients, the kneecap is unrevertable post-surgery and dislocates to the outer side of the knee. This is painful and usually needs to be treated by surgery to realign the kneecap. However this is quite rare.

In the past, there was a considerable risk of the implant components loosening over time as a result of wear. As medical technology has improved however, this risk has fallen considerably.

===Infection===
The current classification of AAOS divides prosthetic infections into four types.&lt;ref name="pmid16958480"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leone JM, Hanssen AD |title=Management of infection at the site of a total knee arthroplasty |journal=Instr Course Lect |volume=55 |pages=449–61 |year=2006 |pmid=16958480 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Type 1 (positive intraoperative culture): Two positive intraoperative cultures
* Type 2 (early postoperative infection): Infection occurring within first month after surgery
* Type 3 (acute hematogenous infection): Hematogenous seeding of site of previously well-functioning prosthesis
* Type 4 (late chronic infection): Chronic indolent clinical course; infection present for more than a month

While it is relatively rare, periprosthetic infection remains one of the most challenging complications of joint arthroplasty.
A detailed clinical history and physical remain the most reliable tool to recognize a potential periprosthetic infection. In some cases the classic signs of fever, chills, painful joint, and a draining sinus may be present, and diagnostic studies are simply done to confirm the diagnosis. In reality though, most patients do not present with those clinical signs, and in fact the clinical presentation may overlap with other complications such as aseptic loosening and pain. In those cases diagnostic tests can be useful in confirming or excluding infection.

[[File:ProthesenlockerungPET-CT.jpg|thumb|FDG-PET CT showing septic loosening of knee prothesis; the FDG-enrichment shows entensive inflammatory foci: demonstrative: the PET-image ist unlike the CT reconstruction not disturbed by the high radiation attenuation of the prothesis.]]

Modern diagnosis of infection around a total knee replacement is based on the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parvizi|first1=Javad|last2=Zmistowski|first2=Benjamin|last3=Berbari|first3=Elie F.|last4=Bauer|first4=Thomas W.|last5=Springer|first5=Bryan D.|last6=Della Valle|first6=Craig J.|last7=Garvin|first7=Kevin L.|last8=Mont|first8=Michael A.|last9=Wongworawat|first9=Montri D.|last10=Zalavras|first10=Charalampos G.|title=New Definition for Periprosthetic Joint Infection: From the Workgroup of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|date=22 September 2011|volume=469|issue=11|pages=2992–2994|doi=10.1007/s11999-011-2102-9|pmc=3183178}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

1.There is a sinus tract communicating with the prosthesis; or
2. A pathogen is isolated by culture from at least two separate tissue or fluid samples obtained from the affected prosthetic joint; 
or

Four of the following six criteria exist:

1.Elevated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR&gt;30mm/hr) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP&gt;10&amp;nbsp;mg/L) concentration,

2.Elevated synovial leukocyte count,

3.Elevated synovial neutrophil percentage (PMN%),

4.Presence of purulence in the affected joint,

5.Isolation of a microorganism in one culture of periprosthetic tissue or fluid, or

6.Greater than five neutrophils per high-power field in five high-power fields observed from histologic analysis of periprosthetic tissue at ×400 magnification.

None of the above laboratory tests has 100% sensitivity or specificity for diagnosing infection. Specificity improves when the tests are performed in patients in whom clinical suspicion exists. ESR and CRP remain good 1st line tests for screening (high sensitivity, low specificity).  Aspiration of the joint remains the test with the highest specificity for confirming infection.

The choice of treatment depends on the type of prosthetic infection.&lt;ref name="pmid10535593"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Segawa H, Tsukayama DT, Kyle RF, Becker DA, Gustilo RB |title=Infection after total knee arthroplasty.

#Positive intraoperative cultures: Antibiotic therapy alone
#Early post-operative infections: debridement, antibiotics, and retention of prosthesis.
#Acute hematogenous infections: debridement, antibiotic therapy, retention of prosthesis.
#Late chronic: delayed exchange arthroplasty. Surgical débridement and parenteral antibiotics alone in this group has limited success, and standard of care involves exchange arthroplasty.&lt;ref name="pmid17438469"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiu FY, Chen CM |title=Surgical débridement and parenteral antibiotics in infected revision total knee arthroplasty |journal=Clin.

To indicate knee replacement in case of [[osteoarthritis]], its [[radiographic classification of osteoarthritis|radiographic classification]] and severity of symptoms should both be substantial. Such radiography should consist of weightbearing [[projectional radiography|X-rays]] of both knees- AP, Lateral, and 30 degrees of flexion. AP and lateral views may not show joint space narrowing, but the 30 degree flexion view is most sensitive for narrowing. Full length projections are also used in order to adjust the prosthesis to provide a neutral angle for the distal lower extremity. Two angles used for this purpose are:
*Hip-knee-shaft angle (HKS),&lt;ref name=cooke2007/&gt; an angle formed between a line through the longitudinal axis of the [[femur|femoral]] shaft and its mechanical axis, which is a line from the center of the [[femoral head]] to the intercondylar notch of the distal femur.&lt;ref name="CherianKapadia2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cherian|first1=Jeffrey J.|last2=Kapadia|first2=Bhaveen H.|last3=Banerjee|first3=Samik|last4=Jauregui|first4=Julio J.|last5=Issa|first5=Kimona|last6=Mont|first6=Michael A.|title=Mechanical, Anatomical, and Kinematic Axis in TKA: Concepts and Practical Applications|journal=Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine|volume=7|issue=2|year=2014|pages=89–95|issn=1935-973X|doi=10.1007/s12178-014-9218-y|pmid=24671469|pmc=4092202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA),&lt;ref name="dahl2009"/&gt; which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the [[ankle joint]].&lt;ref name="CherianKapadia2014"/&gt;

The patient is to perform range of motion exercises and hip, knee and ankle strengthening as directed daily.  Before the surgery is performed, pre-operative tests are done: usually a [[complete blood count]], [[electrolytes]], [[APTT]] and [[Prothrombin time|PT]] to measure [[coagulation|blood clotting]], [[chest X-ray]]s, [[ECG]], and blood [[cross-matching]] for possible [[blood transfusion|transfusion]]. About a month before the surgery, the patient may be prescribed supplemental iron to boost the hemoglobin in their blood system. Accurate X-rays of the affected knee are needed to measure the size of components which will be needed. Medications such as [[warfarin]] and [[aspirin]] will be stopped some days before surgery to reduce the amount of bleeding. Patients may be admitted on the day of surgery if the pre-op work-up is done in the pre-[[anesthetic]] clinic or may come into [[hospital]] one or more days before surgery.  Currently there is insufficient quality evidence to support the use of pre-operative physiotherapy in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesham|first1=Ross Alexander|last2=Shanmugam|first2=Sivaramkumar|title=Does preoperative physiotherapy improve postoperative, patient-based outcomes in older adults who have undergone total knee arthroplasty?

Preoperative education is currently an important part of patient care. There is some evidence that it may slightly reduce anxiety before  knee replacement surgery, with low risk of detrimental effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=S|last2=Page|first2=MJ|last3=Beringer|first3=K|last4=Wasiak|first4=J|last5=Sprowson|first5=A|date=13 May 2014|title=Preoperative education for hip or knee replacement|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=5|pages=CD003526|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003526.pub3|pmid=24820247|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bariatric surgery|Weight loss surgery]] before a knee replacement does not appear to change outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=TO|last2=Aboelmagd|first2=T|last3=Hing|first3=CB|last4=MacGregor|first4=A|title=Does bariatric surgery prior to total hip or knee arthroplasty reduce post-operative complications and improve clinical outcomes for obese patients?

==Technique==
[[Image:Prothese-genou-IMG 0033.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Model of total knee replacement]]
The [[surgery]] involves exposure of the front of the knee, with detachment of part of the [[quadriceps muscle]] ([[vastus medialis]]) from the [[patella]].  The [[patella]] is displaced to one side of the joint, allowing exposure of the [[Anatomical terms of location|distal]] end of the [[femur]] and the [[Anatomical terms of location|proximal]] end of the [[tibia]]. The ends of these bones are then accurately cut to shape using cutting guides oriented to the long axis of the bones. The [[cartilage]]s and the [[anterior cruciate ligament]] are removed; the [[posterior cruciate ligament]] may also be removed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=WC|author2=Clement, DJ |author3=Wymenga, AB |title=Retention versus sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee replacement for treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 October 2005|issue=4|pages=CD004803|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004803.pub2|pmid=16235383}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the [[medial collateral ligament|tibial]] and [[fibular collateral ligament|fibular]] collateral ligaments are preserved. Whether the posterior cruciate ligament is removed or preserved depends on the type of implant used, although there appears to be no clear difference in knee function or range of motion favouring either approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verra |first1=WC |last2=van den Boom |first2=LG |last3=Jacobs |first3=W |last4=Clement |first4=DJ |last5=Wymenga |first5=AA |last6=Nelissen |first6=RG |title=Retention versus sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee arthroplasty for treating osteoarthritis. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=11 October 2013 |issue=10 |pages=CD004803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004803.pub3 |pmid=24114343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal components are then impacted onto the bone or fixed using [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) cement. Alternative techniques exist that affix the implant without cement.  These cement-less techniques may involve [[osseointegration]], including [[metal foam|porous metal]] prostheses.

===Femoral replacement===
[[Image:Knieprothese.png|150px|thumb|right|Total knee replacement hardware, including femoral head, tibial plate, patellar plate, and meniscus replacement plate.]]
A round ended implant is used for the femur, mimicking the natural shape of the joint. On the tibia the component is flat, although it sometimes has a stem which goes down inside the bone for further stability. A flattened or slightly dished high density [[polyethylene]] surface is then inserted onto the tibial component so that the weight is transferred metal to plastic not metal to metal. During the operation any deformities must be corrected, and the ligaments balanced so that the knee has a good range of movement and is stable and aligned. In some cases the articular surface of the patella is also removed and replaced by a polyethylene button cemented to the posterior surface of the patella.  In other cases, the patella is replaced unaltered.

===Post-operative pain control===
The regional analgesia techniques (neuraxial anesthesia or continuous femoral nerve block&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toftdahl|first1=K|last2=Nikolajsen|first2=L|last3=Haraldsted|first3=V|last4=Madsen|first4=F|last5=Tønnesen|first5=EK|last6=Søballe|first6=K|title=Comparison of peri- and intraarticular analgesia with femoral nerve block after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial.|journal=Acta orthopaedica|date=April 2007|volume=78|issue=2|pages=172–9|doi=10.1080/17453670710013645|pmid=17464603}}&lt;/ref&gt; or adductor canal block) are used most commonly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Acute Pain Management|website=Anesthesiology|pages=248–273|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e31823c1030|pmid=22227789|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local anesthesia infiltration in the pericapsular area using liposomal bupivacaine provides good analgesia in the post-operative period without increasing the risk for instability or nerve injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Essving|first1=P|last2=Axelsson|first2=K|last3=Åberg|first3=E|last4=Spännar|first4=H|last5=Gupta|first5=A|last6=Lundin|first6=A|title=Local infiltration analgesia versus intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial.|journal=Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia|date=October 2011|volume=113|issue=4|pages=926–33|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182288deb|pmid=21821506}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined approach of local infiltration analagesia and femoral nerve block to achieve multimodal analagesia is common.

==Variations==

Different implant manufacturers require slightly different instrumentation and technique. No consensus has emerged over which one is the best. Clinical studies are very difficult to perform, requiring large numbers of cases followed over many years. The most significant variations are between cemented and uncemented components and between resurfacing the patella or not. Among those who do not resurface the patella, there is also variation between denervating the patella using electrocautery or not. In theory, this technique could disrupt the superficial pain receptors near the patella in hopes of relieving anterior knee pain, a common post-operative complaint. No consensus exists, but a recent randomized controlled trial indicates that while both methods provide relief, patellar denervation results in a modest benefit compared to no denervation in the short-term. The patient satisfaction was higher with more number of patients rating the procedure as excellent in the denervation group (74.6% vs 50.8%). The benefit does not, however, persist mid- to long-term post-operatively. Anterior knee pain component within the patellar score and Visual Analogue Scale for anterior knee pain were significantly better in the denervation group at 3 months (4.5 vs 5.1) but not at 12 months (4.4 vs 4.9) and 24 months (2.1 vs. 2.2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pulavarti RS1, Raut VV, McLauchlan GJ.| title= Patella Denervation in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty - A Randomized Controlled Trial with 2Years of Follow-Up. |doi= 10.1016/j.arth.2013.10.017| pmid= 24291230| volume=29| issue=5| date=May 2014| journal=J Arthroplasty| pages=977–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also study patient satisfaction data associated with pain. Retaining the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) has been shown to be beneficial for patients. Removal of the PCL has been shown to reduce the maximal force that the individual can place on that knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mahoney OM, Noble PC, Rhoads DD, Alexander JW, Tullos HS |title=Posterior cruciate function following total knee arthroplasty.

[[Minimally invasive procedure]]s have been developed in total knee replacement (TKR) that do not cut the [[quadriceps tendon]]. There are different definitions of minimally invasive knee surgery, which may include a shorter incision length, retraction of the patella (kneecap) without eversion (rotating out), and specialized instruments. There are few randomized trials, but studies have found less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and shorter recovery. However, no studies have shown long-term benefits.&lt;ref name=Leopold09/&gt;

In 2015 The OGAAP team from Sydney Australia led by [[Dr Al Muderis]]  presented a revolutionary technology for the first time enabling the use of knee replacement in combination with percutaneous bone anchoring device enabling amputees with short residual tibia and or knee joint arthritis to mobilise with ease.  This technology provided a solution for individuals with amputation who are unable to wear a traditional socket prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=26145721 | doi=10.3109/17453674.2015.1068635 | volume=86 | issue=6 | title=Osseointegrated total knee replacement connected to a lower limb prosthesis: 4 cases | pmc=4750776 | year=2015 | journal=Acta Orthop | pages=740–4 |vauthors=Khemka A, Frossard L, Lord SJ, Bosley B, Al Muderis M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation in the total knee replacement procedure is to permit movement in the prostheses using a polyethylene insert, an approach called a mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty. There is no strong evidence that this approach improves a persons function compared to the fixed bearing  approach for total knee replacement that retains the cruciate ligament.

=== Partial knee replacement ===
{{Main|Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty}}
Unicompartmental arthroplasty (UKA), also called [[partial knee replacement]], is an option for some patients. The knee is generally divided into three "compartments": medial (the inside part of the knee), lateral (the outside), and patellofemoral (the joint between the kneecap and the thighbone). Most patients with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in two or more of the above compartments and are best treated with total knee replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oansportsmed.com/news/total-knee-replacement-vs-unicompartmental-knee-replacement Unicompartmental vs. Total Knee Replacement] By Dr. Gregory Markarian. Retrieved 29 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of patients (the exact percentage is hotly debated but is probably between 10 and 30 percent) have wear confined primarily to one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better post-operative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and blood clots, but a harder revision if necessary. While most recent data suggests that UKA in properly selected patients has survival rates comparable to TKA, most surgeons believe that TKA is the more reliable long term procedure. Persons with infectious or inflammatory arthritis ([[Rheumatoid]], [[lupus erythematosus|Lupus]], [[Psoriatic]]), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.

==Post-operative evaluation==
[[File:Radiograph with knee angles.jpg|thumb|[[Projectional radiograph|X-ray]] with angles used to evaluate knee replacement:&lt;ref name=Inui2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inui|first1=Hiroshi|last2=Taketomi|first2=Shuji|last3=Nakamura|first3=Kensuke|last4=Takei|first4=Seira|last5=Takeda|first5=Hideki|last6=Tanaka|first6=Sakae|last7=Nakagawa|first7=Takumi|title=Influence of navigation system updates on total knee arthroplasty|journal=Sports Medicine, Arthroscopy, Rehabilitation, Therapy &amp; Technology|volume=5|issue=1|year=2013|issn=1758-2555|doi=10.1186/2052-1847-5-10}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0 (CC-BY-2.0)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;HKA: Hip-knee-ankle angle&lt;br&gt;FFC: frontal femoral component angle&lt;br&gt;FTC: frontal tibial component angle&lt;br&gt;LFC: lateral femoral component angle&lt;br&gt;LTC: lateral tibial component angle]]
Knee replacement is routinely evaluated by [[Projectional radiograph|X-ray]], including the following measures:
*HKA: Hip-knee-ankle angle, which is ideally between 3° [[genu varum|varum]] to 3° [[Genu valgum|valgum]] from a [[right angle]].&lt;ref name=Inui2013/&gt;
*FFC: frontal femoral component angle. It is typically regarded as optimal when being 2–7° in valgus.&lt;ref name="GromovKorchi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gromov|first1=Kirill|last2=Korchi|first2=Mounim|last3=Thomsen|first3=Morten G|last4=Husted|first4=Henrik|last5=Troelsen|first5=Anders|title=What is the optimal alignment of the tibial and femoral components in knee arthroplasty?|journal=Acta Orthopaedica|volume=85|issue=5|year=2014|pages=480–487|issn=1745-3674|doi=10.3109/17453674.2014.940573}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*FTC: frontal tibial component angle, which is regarded as optimal when being at a [[right angle]]. A varus position of more than 3° has generally been found to increase the failure rate of the prosthesis.&lt;ref name="GromovKorchi2014"/&gt;
*LFC: lateral (or sagittal) femoral component angle&lt;ref name=Inui2013/&gt;
*LTC: lateral (or sagittal) tibial component angle, which is ideally positioned so that the tibia is 0–7° flexed compared to at a right angle with the tibial plate.&lt;ref name="GromovKorchi2014"/&gt;

==Post-operative rehabilitation==
The length of post-operative hospitalization is 5 days on average depending on the health status of the patient and the amount of support available outside the hospital setting.&lt;ref name="CarterPotts2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Evelene M|last2=Potts|first2=Henry WW|title=Predicting length of stay from an electronic patient record system: a primary total knee replacement example|journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making|volume=14|issue=1|year=2014|pages=26|issn=1472-6947|doi=10.1186/1472-6947-14-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected [[weight bearing]] on crutches or a [[Walker (tool)|walker]] is required until specified by the surgeon &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/ortho-hip-knee/patient-education/pt-ed-kneerehab.pdf|title=Rehabilitation|last=|first=|date=|website=massgeneral.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of weakness in the quadriceps muscle&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valtonen|first=Anu|last2=Pöyhönen|first2=Tapani|last3=Heinonen|first3=Ari|last4=Sipilä|first4=Sarianna|date=1 October 2009|title=Muscle Deficits Persist After Unilateral Knee Replacement and Have Implications for Rehabilitation|url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/89/10/1072|journal=Physical Therapy|language=en|volume=89|issue=10|pages=1072–1079|doi=10.2522/ptj.20070295|issn=0031-9023|pmid=19713269|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811164539/http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/89/10/1072|archivedate=11 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the likelihood of a good outcome after surgery, multiple weeks of [[physical therapy]] is necessary. In these weeks, the therapist will help the patient return to normal activities, as well as prevent blood clots, improve circulation, increase range of motion, and eventually strengthen the surrounding muscles through specific exercises. Whether techniques such as [[neuromuscular electrical stimulation]] are effective at promoting gains in knee muscle strength after surgery are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monaghan |first1=B |last2=Caulfield |first2=B |last3=O'Mathúna |first3=DP |title=Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation for quadriceps strengthening pre and post total knee replacement. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=20 January 2010 |issue=1 |pages=CD007177 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007177.pub2 |pmid=20091621|url=http://doras.dcu.ie/19651/1/dpom4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often range of motion (to the limits of the prosthesis) is recovered over the first two weeks (the earlier the better). Over time, patients are able to increase the amount of weight bearing on the operated leg, and eventually are able to tolerate full weight bearing with the guidance of the physical therapist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After about ten months, the patient should be able to return to normal daily activities, although the operated leg may be significantly weaker than the non-operated leg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For post-operative knee replacement patients, immobility is a factor precipitated by pain and other complications. Mobility is known as an important aspect of human biology that has many beneficial effects on the body system.&lt;ref&gt;Leah, 2013 {{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented in literature that physical immobility affects every body system and contributes to functional complications of prolonged illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/cnq.0b013e3182750631| pmid = 23221435| title = Foreword| journal = Critical Care Nursing Quarterly| volume = 36| issue = 1| pages = 1–2| year = 2013| last1 = &amp;Na| last2 = Dickinson| first2 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most medical-surgical hospital units that perform knee replacements, ambulation is a key aspect of nursing care that is promoted to patients. Early ambulation can decrease the risk of complications associated with immobilization such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), impaired pulmonary function, and loss of functional mobility.&lt;ref name="Teodoro, 2016"&gt;Teodoro, 2016 {{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses’ promotion and execution of early ambulation on patients has found that it greatly reduces the complications listed above, as well as decreases length of stay and costs associated with further hospitalization.&lt;ref name="Teodoro, 2016"/&gt; Nurses may also work with teams such as physical therapy and occupational therapy to accomplish ambulation goals and reduce complications.&lt;ref&gt;Ong &amp; Pua, 2011{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Continuous passive motion]] (CPM) is a postoperative therapy approach that uses a machine to move the knee continuously through a specific range of motion, with the goal of preventing joint stiffness and improving recovery.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"&gt;{{Citation|title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question|date=15 September 2014|url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-physical-therapy-association/|author1=American Physical Therapy Association|author1-link=American Physical Therapy Association|work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]|page=|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|accessdate=15 September 2014}}

However, CPM should be used in conjunction with traditional physical therapy.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"/&gt; In unusual cases where the person has a problem which prevents standard mobilization treatment, then CPM may be useful.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"/&gt;

[[Cryotherapy]], also known as 'cold therapy' is sometimes recommended after surgery for pain relief and to limit swelling of the knee. Cryotherapy involves the application of ice bags or cooled water to the skin of the knee joint. However, the evidence that cryotherapy reduces pain and swelling is very weak and the benefits after total knee replacement surgery have been shown to be very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adie |first1=S |last2=Kwan |first2=A |last3=Naylor |first3=JM |last4=Harris |first4=IA |last5=Mittal |first5=R |title=Cryotherapy following total knee replacement. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=12 September 2012 |issue=9 |pages=CD007911 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007911.pub2 |pmid=22972114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Small antenna loading coil.jpg|thumb|A loading coil in a small [[cell phone]] antenna on a car roof.]]
A '''loading coil''' or '''load coil''' is an [[inductor]] that is inserted into an [[electronic circuit]] to increase its [[inductance]]. The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]]s, or between the antenna and its [[feedline]], to make an [[electrically short]] antenna [[resonance|resonant]] at its operating frequency.

The concept of loading coils was discovered by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal.  The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission is known as the [[Heaviside condition]].  Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra inductance was not as great.  [[Submarine communications cable]]s are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century installations using [[balanced pair]]s were often continuously loaded with iron wire or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.

Loading coils are historically also known as '''Pupin coils''' after [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Mihajlo Pupin]], especially when used for the Heaviside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes called ''pupinization''.

==Applications==

The capacitors are not discrete components but represent the distributed capacitance between the closely spaced wire conductors of the line, this is indicated by the dotted lines.

The windings of the loading coil are wound such that the magnetic flux induced in the core is in the same direction for both windings.]]

A common application of loading coils is to improve the [[voice frequency|voice-frequency]] amplitude response characteristics of the [[twisted pair|twisted balanced pairs]] in a telephone cable.  Because twisted pair is a [[balanced line|balanced]] format, half the loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance.  It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core.  This increases the [[magnetic flux|flux]] linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased. Despite the use of common cores, such loading coils do not comprise [[transformer]]s, as they do not provide [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] to other circuits.

Loading coils inserted periodically in series with a pair of wires reduce the [[attenuation]] at the higher voice frequencies up to the [[cutoff frequency]] of the [[low-pass filter]] formed by the inductance of the coils (plus the distributed inductance of the wires) and the distributed capacitance between the wires. Above the cutoff frequency, attenuation increases rapidly.  The shorter the distance between the coils, the higher the cut-off frequency.

It should be emphasised that the cutoff effect is an artifact of using [[lumped element model|lumped]] inductors.  With loading methods using continuous [[distributed element model|distributed]] inductance there is no cutoff.

Without loading coils, the line response is dominated by the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency.  With loading coils of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, [[waveform]]s are undistorted and the [[characteristic impedance]] is resistive up to the cutoff frequency.  The coincidental formation of an [[audio frequency]] filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.

====DSL====
When loading coils are in place, signal attenuation remains low for signals within the [[passband]] of the transmission line but increases rapidly for frequencies above the audio cutoff frequency. Thus, if the pair is subsequently reused to support applications that require higher frequencies (such as analog or digital [[carrier system]]s or [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]]), any loading coils that were present on the line must be removed or replaced with ones which are transparent to DSL.  Using coils with parallel capacitors will form a filter with the topology of an [[m-derived filter]] and a band of frequencies above the cut-off will also be passed.

If the coils are not removed, and the subscriber is an extended distance (e.g. over 4 miles or 6.4&amp;nbsp;km) from the Central Office, DSL can not be supported.  This sometimes happens in dense, growing areas such as Southern California in the late 1990s and early 21st century.



====Carrier systems====
American early and middle 20th century telephone cables had load coils at intervals of a mile (1.61&amp;nbsp;km), usually in coil cases holding many.  The coils had to be removed to pass higher frequencies, but the coil cases provided convenient places for repeaters of digital [[T-carrier]] systems, which could then transmit a 1.5 Mbit/s signal that distance.  Due to narrower streets and higher cost of copper, European cables had thinner wires and used closer spacing.  Intervals of a kilometer allowed European systems to carry 2 Mbit/s.

===Radio antenna===
[[File:CB antenna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A typical mobile antenna with a center-placed loading coil]]
[[File:Large antenna loading coil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|An enormous antenna loading coil used in a powerful [[longwave]] [[radiotelegraphy|radiotelegraph]] station in New Jersey in 1912.]]
Another type of loading coil is used in radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.  [[Monopole antenna|Monopole]] and [[dipole antenna|dipole]] radio antennas are designed to act as [[resonator]]s for radio waves; the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the antenna's [[transmission line]], excites [[standing wave]]s of voltage and current in the antenna element. To be resonant, the antenna must have a physical length of one quarter of the [[wavelength]] of the radio waves used (or a multiple of that length). At resonance the antenna acts electrically as a pure [[electrical resistance|resistance]], absorbing all the power applied to it from the transmitter.

In many cases for practical reasons it is necessary to make the antenna shorter than the resonant length, this is called an [[electrically short]] antenna. An antenna shorter than a quarter wavelength presents [[capacitive reactance]] to the transmission line. Some of the applied power is reflected back into the transmission line and travels back toward the transmitter (called “''backlash current''”). The two currents at the same frequency running in opposite directions causes [[standing wave]]s on the transmission line (measured as a [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) greater than one) which waste energy, and can even overheat the transmitter.

So to make an [[electrical length|electrically short]] antenna resonant, a loading coil is inserted in series with the antenna. The [[inductive reactance]] of the coil is equal and opposite to, and cancels, the capacitive reactance of the antenna, so the loaded antenna presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing energy from being reflected. The loading coil is often placed at the base of the antenna, between it and the transmission line (''base loading''), but for better efficiency, it is sometimes inserted in the center of the antenna element itself (''center loading'').

Loading coils for powerful transmitters can have challenging design requirements, especially at low frequencies. Since the [[radiation resistance]] of short antennas can be very low, as low a few ohms in the [[low frequency|LF]] or [[very low frequency|VLF]] bands, the coil must have extremely low AC [[electrical resistance|resistance]] at the operating frequency. To reduce [[skin effect]] losses the coil is often made of tubing or [[Litz wire]], with single layer windings with turns spaced apart to reduce [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and arcing.  They must often handle high voltages. To reduce power lost in [[dielectric loss]]es, the coil is often suspended in air supported on thin ceramic strips.  The capacitively loaded antennas used at low frequencies have extremely narrow bandwidths, and therefore if the frequency is changed the loading coil must be adjustable to tune the antenna to resonance with the new transmitter frequency. [[Inductor|Variometers]] are often used.

==Campbell equation==
The Campbell equation is a relationship due to [[George Ashley Campbell]] for predicting the [[propagation constant]] of a loaded line.  It is stated as;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cosh (\gamma'd) = \cosh (\gamma d) + \frac{Z}{2Z_0} \sinh (\gamma d)&lt;/math&gt;

:where,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant of the unloaded line
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma ' \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant of the loaded line
:&lt;math&gt;d \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the interval between coils on the loaded line
:&lt;math&gt;Z \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of a loading coil and
:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the unloaded line.

A more engineer friendly rule of thumb is that the approximate requirement for spacing loading coils is ten coils per wavelength of the maximum frequency being transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p42&lt;/ref&gt;  This approximation can be arrived at by treating the loaded line as a [[constant k filter]] and applying [[image impedance|image filter theory]] to it.  From basic image filter theory the angular cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of a [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] constant k filter are given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L_{\frac{1}{2}} C_{\frac{1}{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L_{\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{\frac{1}{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;L_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the half section element values.

From these basic equations the necessary loading coil inductance and coil spacing can be found;

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{Z_0}{\omega_c}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2}{\omega_c Z_0 C}&lt;/math&gt;

:where C is the capacitance per unit length of the line.

Expressing this in terms of number of coils per cutoff wavelength yields;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_c}{d} = \pi v Z_0 C&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''v'' is the velocity of propagation of the cable in question.

Since &lt;math&gt;v = {1 \over Z_0 C}&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_c}{d} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Campbell arrived at this expression by analogy with a mechanical line periodically loaded with weights described by Charles Godfrey in 1898 who obtained a similar result.  Mechanical loaded lines of this sort were first studied by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] (1736–1813).&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of cutoff whereby frequencies above the cutoff frequency are not transmitted is an undesirable side effect of loading coils (although it proved highly useful in [[Passive analogue filter development|the development of filters]]).  Cutoff is avoided by the use of continuous loading since it arises from the lumped nature of the loading coils.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Oliver Heaviside===
[[File:Heaviside cropped.png|thumb|Oliver Heaviside]]
The origin of the loading coil can be found in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] on the theory of [[transmission line]]s.  Heaviside (1881) represented the line as a network of infinitesimally small circuit elements.  By applying his [[operational calculus]] to the analysis of this network he discovered (1887) what has become known as the [[Heaviside condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, O, "Electromagnetic Induction and its propagation", ''The Electrician'', 3 June 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, O, ''Electrical Papers'', '''vol 1''', pp139-140, Boston, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the condition that must be fulfilled in order for a transmission line to be free from [[distortion]].  The Heaviside condition is that the series [[electrical impedance|impedance]], Z, must be proportional to the shunt [[admittance]], Y, at all frequencies.  In terms of the [[primary line coefficients]] the condition is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{G}=\frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

:where;

:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the series resistance of the line per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the series self-inductance of the line per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the shunt leakage [[Electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]] of the line insulator per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the shunt capacitance between the line conductors per unit length

Heaviside was aware that this condition was not met in the practical telegraph cables in use in his day.  In general, a real cable would have,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{G} \gg \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

This is mainly due to the low value of leakage through the cable insulator, which is even more pronounced in modern cables which have better insulators than in Heaviside's day.  In order to meet the condition, the choices are therefore to try to increase G or L or to decrease R or C.  Decreasing R requires larger conductors.  Copper was already in use in telegraph cables and this is the very best conductor available short of using silver.  Decreasing R means using more copper and a more expensive cable.  Decreasing C would also mean a larger cable (although not necessarily more copper).  Increasing G is highly undesirable; while it would reduce distortion, it would at the same time increase the signal loss.  Heaviside considered, but rejected, this possibility which left him with the strategy of increasing L as the way to reduce distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside immediately (1887) proposed several methods of increasing the inductance, including spacing the conductors further apart and loading the insulator with iron dust.  Finally, Heaviside made the proposal (1893) to use discrete inductors at intervals along the line.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electrician'', 1887 and reproduced (according to Brittain) in Heaviside, O, ''Electromagnetic Theory'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he never succeeded in persuading the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] to take up the idea.  Brittain attributes this to Heaviside's failure to provide engineering details on the size and spacing of the coils for particular cable parameters.  Heaviside's eccentric character and setting himself apart from the establishment may also have played a part in their ignoring of him.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stone===
[[John Stone Stone|John S. Stone]] worked for the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) and was the first to attempt to apply Heaviside's ideas to real telecommunications.  Stone's idea (1896) was to use a bimetallic iron-copper cable which he had patented.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M S, ''Electric Circuit'', US patent 0 578 275, filed 10 September 1896, issued 2 March 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;  This cable of Stone's would increase the line inductance due to the iron content and had the potential to meet the Heaviside condition.  However, Stone left the company in 1899 and the idea was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain pp40-41&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone's cable was an example of continuous loading, a principle that was eventually put into practice is other forms, see for instance [[#Krarup cable|Krarup cable]] later in this article.

===George Campbell===
[[George Ashley Campbell|George Campbell]] was another AT&amp;T engineer working in their Boston facility.  Campbell was tasked with continuing the investigation into Stone's bimetallic cable, but soon abandoned it in favour of the loading coil. His was an independent discovery, Campbell was aware of Heaviside's work in discovering the Heaviside condition, but unaware of Heaviside's suggestion of using loading coils to enable a line to meet it.  The motivation for the change of direction was Campbell's limited budget.

Campbell was struggling to set up a practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated.  After considering that his artificial line simulators used [[lumped element model|lumped]] components rather than the [[distributed element model|distributed]] quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line.  When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp42-45&lt;/ref&gt;  The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p45&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell's work on loading coils provided the theoretical basis for his subsequent work on filters which proved to be so important for [[frequency-division multiplexing]].  The cut-off phenomena of loading coils, an undesirable side-effect, can be exploited to produce a desirable filter frequency response.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G A, "Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Pupin===
[[File:Pupin coil.png|thumb|left|Pupin's design of loading coil]]
[[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Michael Pupin]], inventor and [[Serbia]]n immigrant to the USA, also played a part in the story of loading coils.  Pupin filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell's.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M, ''Art of Reducing Attenuation of Electrical Waves and Apparatus Therefor'', US patent 0 652 230, filed 14 December 1899, issued 19 June 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;  This patent of Pupin's dates from 1899.  There is an earlier patent&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M, ''Apparatus for Telegraphic of Telephonic Transmission'', US patent 0 519 346, filed 14 December 1893, issued 8 May 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin's loading coil patent but is, in fact, something different.  The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M I, ''From Immigrant to Inventor'', pp330-331, Charles Schribner &amp; Sons, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; although there is nothing from him published at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Pupin's 1894 patent "loads" the line with capacitors rather than inductors, a scheme that has been criticised as being theoretically flawed&lt;ref&gt;Britain, p46, quoting a contemporary criticism in ''Electrical Review'' and experiments by the [[General Post Office|GPO]] showing that the scheme does not work&lt;/ref&gt; and never put into practice.  To add to the confusion, one variant of the capacitor scheme proposed by Pupin does indeed have coils.  However, these are not intended to compensate the line in any way.  They are there merely to restore DC continuity to the line so that it may be tested with regular equipment.  Pupin states that the inductance is to be so large that it will block all AC signals above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, 1894, p5 lines 75-83&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, only the capacitor is adding any significant impedance to the line and "the coils will not exercise any material influence on the results before noted".&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, 1894, p5 lines 123-125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal battle===
Heaviside never patented his idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, p53&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the legal disputes surrounding this invention, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using loading coils.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p56&lt;/ref&gt;  There also can be little doubt that Heaviside was the first to publish and many would dispute Pupin's priority.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p36, 48-50&lt;br/&gt;Behrend to Searle, in letter quoted by Brittain, p37&lt;br/&gt;Searle to Behrend, 1931, in letter quoted by Brittain, p37&lt;br/&gt;Nahin, p276&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T fought a legal battle with Pupin over his claim.  Pupin was first to patent but Campbell had already conducted practical demonstrations before Pupin had even filed his patent (December 1899).&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M I, ''Art of Reducing Attenuation of Electrical Waves and Apparatus Therefore'', US patent 0 652 230,  filed 14 December 1899, issued 19 June 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell's delay in filing was due to the slow internal machinations of AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

However, AT&amp;T foolishly deleted from Campbell's proposed patent application all the tables and graphs detailing the exact value of inductance that would be required before the patent was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p44-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Pupin's patent contained a (less accurate) formula, AT&amp;T was open to claims of incomplete disclosure.  Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end with the invention being declared unpatentable due to Heaviside's prior publication, they decided to desist from the challenge and buy an option on Pupin's patent for a yearly fee so that AT&amp;T would control both patents.  By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 ($13 million in 2011&lt;ref name=Worth&gt;Samuel H. Williamson, "Seven Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to present" (Contemporary Standard of Living measure) ''MeasuringWorth'', April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) and by 1917, when the AT&amp;T monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a total of $455,000 ($25 million in 2011&lt;ref name=Worth/&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p54, p55 (footnote), p57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefit to AT&amp;T===
The invention was of enormous value to AT&amp;T.  Telephone cables could now be used to twice the distance previously possible, or alternatively, a cable of half the previous quality (and cost) could be used over the same distance.  When considering whether to allow Campbell to go ahead with the demonstration, their engineers had estimated that they stood to save $700,000 in new installation costs in New York and New Jersey alone.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p45&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that AT&amp;T saved $100 million in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, T &amp; Fondiller, W, "Developments and Applications of Loading for Telephone Circuits", ''Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', '''vol 45''', pp291-292, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heaviside, who began it all, came away with nothing.  He was offered a token payment but would not accept, wanting the credit for his work.  He remarked ironically that if his prior publication had been admitted it would "interfere ... with the flow of dollars in the proper direction ...".&lt;ref&gt;Brittain quoting Heaviside letter to Behrend, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Loaded submarine cable}}

===Krarup cable===
Loading coils were not without their problems.  In heavy submarine cables, loading coils were difficult to lay. Discontinuities where the coils were installed caused stresses in the cable during laying.  Without great care, the cable might part and would be difficult to repair. A second problem was that the material science of the time had difficulties sealing the joint between coil and cable against ingress of seawater.  When this occurred the cable was ruined.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

A Danish engineer, [[Carl Emil Krarup]], invented a form of continuously loaded cable which solved these problems and the cable is named for him.  Krarup cable has iron wires continuously wound around the central copper conductor with adjacent turns in contact with each other.  This cable was the first use of continuous loading on any telecommunication cable.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, p129&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902, Krarup both wrote his paper on this subject and saw the installation of the first cable between [[Helsingør]] (Denmark) and [[Helsingborg]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;Huurderman, pp321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permalloy cable===
[[File:Permalloy cable.svg|thumb|right|300px|Permalloy cable construction]]
Even though the Krarup cable added inductance to the line, this was insufficient to meet the Heaviside condition. AT&amp;T searched for a better material with higher [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]].  In 1914, Gustav Elmen discovered [[permalloy]], a magnetic nickel-iron annealed alloy. In c. 1915, [[Oliver E. Buckley]], H. D. Arnold, and Elmen, all at [[Bell Labs]], greatly improved transmission speeds by suggesting a method of constructing [[submarine communications cable]] using permalloy tape wrapped around the copper conductors.&lt;ref name=Huurd314&gt;Huurdeman, p.314&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was tested in a trial in Bermuda in 1923. The first permalloy cable placed in service connected [[New York City]] and [[Horta (Azores)]] in September 1924.&lt;ref name=Huurd314/&gt;  Permalloy cable enabled signalling speed on submarine telegraph cables to be increased to 400 words/min at a time when 40 words/min was considered good.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Huurdeman has apparently read 2000 characters per minute as 2000 words per minute --&gt;  The first transatlantic cable achieved only two words/min.&lt;ref&gt;May, pages 947, 950&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mu-metal cable===
[[File:Mu-metal cable.svg|thumb|left|300px|Mu-metal cable construction]]
[[Mu-metal]] has similar magnetic properties to permalloy but the addition of copper to the alloy increases the ductility and allows the metal to be drawn into wire.  Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core copper conductor in much the same way as the iron wire in Krarup cable.  A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.

Mu-metal was invented in 1923 by The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company Ltd., London,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, WS, Garnett, HJ, ''New and improved magnetic alloys, and their application in the manufacture of telegraphic and telephonic cables'', Patent GB224972, filed 25 Aug 1923, issued 25 Nov 1925.  patented in the US as US1582353 and US1552769&lt;/ref&gt; who made the cable, initially, for the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Co]].  Western Union were in competition with AT&amp;T and the [[Western Electric Company]] who were using permalloy.  The patent for permalloy was held by Western Electric which prevented Western Union from using it.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Green, "150 Years Of Industry &amp; Enterprise At [[Enderby's Wharf]]" paper presented at University College, July 2004, for ''History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications'' [http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/EnderbyAG/index.htm retrieved] 16 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch loading===
Continuous loading of cables is expensive and hence is only done when absolutely necessary.  Lumped loading with coils is cheaper but has the disadvantages of difficult seals and a definite cutoff frequency.  A compromise scheme is '''patch loading''' whereby the cable is continuously loaded in repeated sections.  The intervening sections are left unloaded.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current practice===
Loaded cable is no longer a useful technology for submarine communication cables, having first been superseded by [[coaxial cable|co-axial cable]] using electrically powered in-line [[repeater]]s and then by [[optical fiber|fibre-optic cable]].  Manufacture of loaded cable declined in the 1930s and was then superseded by other technologies post-war.  Loading coils can still be found in some telephone landlines today but new installations use more modern technology.

'''mHealth''' (also written as '''m-health''') is an abbreviation for '''mobile health''', a term used for the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices.&lt;ref name=mmhealthroadmapbook&gt;{{cite book

The term is most commonly used in reference to using mobile communication devices, such as [[mobile phones]], tablet computers and [[PDA]]s, and wearable devices such as smart watches, for [[health services]], information, and data collection.&lt;ref name="Cipresso 23–30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cipresso |first=P. |author2=Serino S. |author3=Villani D. |author4=Repetto C. |author5=Selitti L. |author6=Albani G. |author7=Mauro A. |author8=Gaggioli A. |author9=Riva G.   |title=Is your phone so smart to affect your states?

While mHealth certainly has application for [[industrialized nations]], the field has emerged in recent years as largely an application for [[developing countries]], stemming from the rapid rise of mobile phone penetration in low-income nations. The field, then, largely emerges as a means of providing greater access to larger segments of a population in developing countries, as well as improving the capacity of health systems in such countries to provide quality healthcare.&lt;ref name=mhealthverticalsbook&gt;{{cite book

Within the mHealth space, projects operate with a variety of objectives, including increased access to healthcare and health-related information (particularly for hard-to-reach populations); improved ability to [[diagnose]] and track diseases; timelier, more actionable [[public health]] information; and expanded access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

According to an analyst firm, around 2.8 million patients worldwide were using a home monitoring service based on equipment with integrated connectivity at the end of 2012. The figure does not include patients that use monitoring devices connected to a PC or mobile phone. It only includes systems that rely on monitors with integrated connectivity or systems that use monitoring hubs with integrated cellular or fixed-line modems. It forecast that the number of home monitoring systems with integrated communication capabilities will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.9 percent between 2011 and 2017 reaching 9.4 million connections globally by the end of the forecast period. The number of these devices that have integrated cellular connectivity increased from 0.73 million in 2011 to about 1.03 million in 2012, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 46.3 percent to 7.10 million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;mHealth and Home Monitoring by Berg Insight&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A growing percentage of health-related [[smartphone apps]] are available, and some estimates predicted that 500 million patients would be using such apps by the year 2015.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=Joel A. |last2=Moreau |first2=Jacqueline F. |last3=Akilov |first3=Oleg |last4=Patton |first4=Timothy |last5=English |first5=Joseph C., 3rd |last6=Ho |first6=Jonhan |last7=Ferris |first7=Laura K. |display-authors=3 |date=April 2013 |title=Diagnostic Inaccuracy of Smartphone Applications for Melanoma Detection |journal=JAMA Dermatology |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=422–426 |doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.2382 |pmid=23325302 |pmc=4019431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

mHealth broadly encompasses the use of [[mobile telecommunication]] and multimedia technologies as they are integrated within increasingly mobile and wireless health care delivery systems. The field broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies in health care delivery. The term mHealth was coined by Robert Istepanian as use of "emerging mobile communications and network technologies for healthcare".&lt;ref name=mhealthbook&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Istepanian |editor1-first=Robert S.H. |editor1-link=Robert Istepanian |editor2-last=Laxminarayan |editor2-first=Swamy |editor3-last=Pattichis |editor3-first=Constantinos S. |year=2006 |title=M-Health: Emerging Mobile Health Systems |series=Topics in Biomedical Engineering |publisher=Springer |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-387-26558-2 |oclc=836533004 |doi=10.1007/b137697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}
A definition used at the 2010 mHealth Summit of the Foundation for the [[National Institutes of Health]] (FNIH) was "the delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices".&lt;ref name="caroltorgan1"&gt;

While there are some projects that are considered solely within the field of mHealth, the linkage between mHealth and eHealth is unquestionable. For example, an mHealth project that uses mobile phones to access data on [[HIV/AIDS]] rates would require an eHealth system in order to manage, store, and assess the data. Thus, eHealth projects many times operate as the backbone of mHealth projects.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

In a similar vein, while not clearly bifurcated by such a definition, eHealth can largely be viewed as technology that supports the functions and delivery of healthcare, while mHealth rests largely on providing healthcare access.&lt;ref name="caroltorgan1"/&gt; Because mHealth is by definition based on mobile technology such as smartphones, healthcare, through information and delivery, can better reach areas, people, and/or healthcare practitioners with previously limited exposure to certain aspects of healthcare.

== Motivation ==
mHealth is one aspect of eHealth that is pushing the limits of how to acquire, transport, store, process, and secure the raw and processed data to deliver meaningful results. mHealth offers the ability of remote individuals to participate in the health care value matrix, which may not have been possible in the past. Participation does not imply just consumption of health care services. In many cases remote users are valuable contributors to gather data regarding disease and public health concerns such as outdoor pollution, drugs and violence.

The motivation behind the development of the mHealth field arises from two factors. The first factor concerns the myriad constraints felt by healthcare systems of developing nations. These constraints include high [[population growth]], a high [[burden of disease]] prevalence,&lt;ref name=WHO2004GBD/&gt; low health care workforce, large numbers of rural inhabitants, and limited financial resources to support healthcare infrastructure and [[health information systems]]. The second factor is the recent rapid rise in mobile phone penetration in developing countries to large segments of the healthcare workforce, as well as the population of a country as a whole.&lt;ref name="Cellular-news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/29824.php|title=Global Mobile Phone Subscribers to Reach 4.5 Billion by 2012|website=Cellular News |date=March 9, 2008|accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With greater access to mobile phones to all segments of a country, including rural areas, the potential of lowering information and transaction costs in order to deliver healthcare improves.

The combination of these two factors has motivated much discussion of how greater access to mobile phone technology can be leveraged to mitigate the numerous pressures faced by developing countries' healthcare systems. Both factors are discussed here.

Middle income and especially low-income countries face a plethora of constraints in their healthcare systems. These countries face a severe lack of human and physical resources, as well as some of the largest burdens of disease, [[extreme poverty]], and large [[population growth]] rates. Additionally, healthcare access to all reaches of society is generally low in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panjwani|first=Megha|year=2016|title=mHealth: Meaning, Purpose and Outcomes|url=http://ijcsit.com/docs/Volume%207/vol7issue5/ijcsit20160705015.pdf|journal=IJCSIT|volume=7 | issue = 5 |pages=2216–2221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report from June 2011, higher-income countries show more mHealth activity than do lower-income countries (as consistent with eHealth trends in general). Countries in the European Region are currently the most active and those in the African Region the least active. The WHO report findings also included that mHealth is most easily incorporated into processes and services that historically use voice communication through conventional telephone networks. The report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=mHealth: New horizons for health through mobile technologies |series=Global Observatory for eHealth series |volume=3 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=7 June 2011 |isbn=978-92-4-156425-0 |url=http://www.who.int/goe/publications/ehealth_series_vol3/en/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the result of a mHealth survey module designed by researchers at the Earth Institute's Center for Global Health and Economic Development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Center for Global Health and Economic Development |url=http://cghed.ei.columbia.edu/ |archive-date=27 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050138/http://cghed.ei.columbia.edu/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University.

The WHO notes an extreme deficit within the [[Health Human Resources|global healthcare workforce]]. The WHO notes critical healthcare workforce shortages in 57 countries—most of which are characterized as developing countries—and a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses, and midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=World Health Organization |title=The World Health Report 2006: Working Together for Health |date=2006 |publisher=WHO |location=Geneva |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2006/en/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO, in a study of the healthcare workforce in 12 countries of Africa, finds an average density of physicians, nurses and midwives per 1000 population of 0.64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kinfu, Y.|author2=Dal Poz, M.|author3= Mercer, H.|author4=Evans, D.B.|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/3/08-051599-table-T3.html|title=Table 3.

The burden of disease is additionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries than [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]]. The burden of disease, measured in [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY), which can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age, free of disease and disability, is about five times higher in Africa than in high-income countries.&lt;ref name=WHO2004GBD&gt;{{cite report |date=2008 |title=The Global Burden of Disease: 2004 Update |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} In addition, low- and middle-income countries are forced to face the burdens of both extreme poverty and the growing incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, an effect of new-found (relative) affluence.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

Considering poor infrastructure and low human resources, the WHO notes that the healthcare workforce in sub-Saharan Africa would need to be scaled up by as much as 140% to attain international health development targets such as those in the [[Millennium Declaration]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kinfu, Y.|author2=Dal Poz, M.|author3= Mercer, H.|author4=Evans, D.B.|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/3/08-051599/en/index.html|title= The health worker shortage in Africa: are enough physicians and nurses being trained?|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=87|issue=3|date= March 2009|pp=225–230|doi=10.2471/blt.08.051599|pmc=2654639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO, in reference to the healthcare condition in sub-saharan Africa, states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The problem is so serious that in many instances there is simply not enough human capacity even to absorb, deploy and efficiently use the substantial additional funds that are considered necessary to improve health in these countries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mobile technology has made a recent and rapid appearance into low- and middle-income nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The power of mobile money|work=The Economist|date= September 24, 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14505519}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, in the mHealth field, mobile technology usually refers to mobile phone technology, the entrance of other technologies into these nations to facilitate healthcare are also discussed here.

==== Health and development ====
The link between health and development can be found in three of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as set forth by the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000. The MDGs that specifically address health include reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV and AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; and increasing access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/res/55/2 |body=General Assembly |session=55 |type=Resolution |resolution_number=55/2 |title=United Nations Millennium Declaration |date=18 September 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A progress report published in 2006 indicates that childhood immunization and deliveries by skilled birth attendants are on the rise, while many regions continue to struggle to achieve reductions in the prevalence of the [[diseases of poverty]] including malaria, HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=United Nations |title=The Millennium Development Goals Report |date=2006 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |url=http://www.undp.org/publications/MDGReport2006.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare in developed countries ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In [[developed countries]], healthcare systems  have different policies and goals in relation to the personal and population health care goals.

In US and EU many patients and consumers use their cell phones and tablets to access health information and look for healthcare services. In parallel the number of mHealth applications grew significantly the last years.

Doctors, nurses and clinicians use mobile devices to access patient information and other databases and resources.

== Technology and market ==

Basic [[SMS]] functions and real-time voice communication serve as the backbone and the current most common use of mobile phone technology. The broad range of potential benefits to the health sector that the simple functions of mobile phones can provide should not be understated.&lt;ref name=Mechael_2006&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Mechael |first=Patricia N. |date=December 2006 |title=Exploring Health-related Uses of Mobile Phones: An Egyptian Case Study |type=PhD |location=London |publisher=London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine |page=264 |url=https://wiki.ihris.org/mediawiki/upload/PatriciaMechaelThesisFinalDecember2006.pdf |format=PDF |via=iHRIS Wiki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of mobile communication technologies is that they enable communication in motion, allowing individuals to contact each other irrespective of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Agar, J. (2003). ''Constant Touch: A Global History of the Mobile Phone'' Cambridge: Icon Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ling, R. (2004). ''The mobile connection: The cell phone's impact on society'' London: Morgan Kaufmann&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly beneficial for work in remote areas where the mobile phone, and now increasingly [[wireless infrastructure]], is able to reach more people, faster. As a result of such technological advances, the capacity for improved access to information and two-way communication becomes more available at the point of need.

=== Mobile phones ===

[[File:Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007 ITU.png|thumb|250px|Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997–2007]]
With the global [[mobile phone penetration rate]] drastically increasing over the last decade, mobile phones have made a recent and rapid entrance into many parts of the low- and middle-income world. Improvements in [[telecommunications]] technology infrastructure, reduced costs of mobile handsets, and a general increase in non-food [[expenditure]] have influenced this trend. Low- and middle-income countries are utilizing mobile phones as "leapfrog technology" (see [[leapfrogging]]). That is, mobile phones have allowed many developing countries, even those with relatively poor infrastructure, to bypass 20th century [[fixed-line]] technology and jump to modern mobile technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Leaders: The limits of leapfrogging; Technology and development|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10650775|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of global mobile phone [[subscribers]] in 2007 was estimated at 3.1 billion of an estimated [[global population]] of 6.6 billion (47%).&lt;ref name="Cellular-news"/&gt; These figures are expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2012, or a 64.7% mobile penetration rate. The greatest growth is expected in [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]]. In many countries, the number of mobile phone subscribers has bypassed the number of fixed-line telephones; this is particularly true in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ITU|year=2003|title=Mobile overtakes fixed: Implications for policy and regulation|location=Geneva|publisher=International Telecommunications Union|url=https://www.itu.int/osg/spu/ni/mobileovertakes/Resources/Mobileovertakes_Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there were 4.1 billion mobile phones in use in December 2008. See [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use]].

While mobile phone penetration rates are on the rise, globally, the growth within countries is not generally evenly distributed. In [[India]], for example, while mobile penetration rates have increased markedly, by far the greatest growth rates are found in [[urban areas]]. Mobile penetration, in September 2008, was 66% in urban areas, while only 9.4% in [[rural areas]]. The all India average was 28.2% at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Kathuria, R, Uppal M., Mamta (2009). An [[econometric analysis]] of the impact of mobile. Case paper in India: The impact of mobile phones. Vodafone Group Plc. The Policy Paper Series. November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; So, while mobile phones may have the potential to provide greater healthcare access to a larger portion of a population, there are certainly within-country equity issues to consider.

Mobile phones are spreading because the cost of mobile technology deployment is dropping and people are, on average, getting wealthier in low- and middle-income nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/GEPEXT/EXTGEP2007/0,,menuPK:3016160~pagePK:64167702~piPK:64167676~theSitePK:3016125,00.html |title=Global Economic Prospects 2007: Managing the Next Wave of Globalization |publisher=World Bank report |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221223828/http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/GEPEXT/EXTGEP2007/0%2C%2CmenuPK%3A3016160~pagePK%3A64167702~piPK%3A64167676~theSitePK%3A3016125%2C00.html |archivedate=2006-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vendors, such as [[Nokia]], are developing cheaper infrastructure technologies (CDMA) and cheaper phones (sub $50–100, such as Sun's Java phone). Non-food consumption expenditure is increasing in many parts of the developing world, as [[disposable income]] rises, causing a rapid increase spending on new technology, such as mobile phones. In India, for example, consumers have become and continue to become wealthier. Consumers are shifting their expenditure from necessity to discretionary. For example, on average, 56% of Indian consumers' consumption went towards food in 1995, compared to 42% in 2005. The number is expected to drop to 34% by 2015. That being said, although total share of consumption has declined, total consumption of food and beverages increased 82% from 1985 to 2005, while per-capita consumption of food and beverages increased 24%. Indian consumers are getting wealthier and they are spending more and more, with a greater ability to spend on new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=May 2007|title=The 'bird of gold': the rise of India's consumer market|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/asia-pacific/the-bird-of-gold|author1=Jonathan Ablett|author2= Aadarsh Baijal|author3= Eric Beinhocker|author4=Anupam Bose|author5=Diana Farrell|author6= Ulrich Gersch|author7=Ezra Greenberg |author8= Shishir Gupta|author9= Sumit Gupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smartphones ===
More advanced mobile phone technologies are enabling the potential for further healthcare delivery.
[[Smartphone]] technologies are in now in the hands of a large number of physicians and other healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries. Although far from ubiquitous, the spread of smartphone technologies opens up doors for mHealth projects such as technology-based diagnosis support, [[remote diagnostics]] and [[telemedicine]], [[web browsing]], [[GPS]] navigation, access to web-based patient information, post-visit patient surveillance, and decentralized [[health management information system]]s (HMIS).

While uptake of smartphone technology by the medical field has grown in low- and middle-income countries, it is worth noting that the capabilities of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries has not reached the sophistication of those in high-income countries. The infrastructure that enables web browsing, GPS navigation, and email through smartphones is not as well developed in much of the low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=Mechael_2006/&gt; Increased availability and efficiency in both voice and data-transfer systems in addition to rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure will likely accelerate the deployment of mobile-enabled health systems and services throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Istepanian |first1=R.S.H. |last2=Jovanov |first2=E. |last3=Zhang |first3=Y.T. |date=December 2004 |title=Introduction to the Special Section on M-Health: Beyond Seamless Mobility and Global Wireless Health-care Connectivity|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=405–414 |pmid=15615031 |doi=10.1109/titb.2004.840019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond mobile phones, wireless-enabled [[laptops]] and specialized health-related software applications are currently being developed, tested, and marketed for use in the mHealth field. Many of these technologies, while having some application to low- and middle-income nations, are developing primarily in high-income countries. However, with broad advocacy campaigns for [[free and open source software]] (FOSS), applications are beginning to be tailored for and make inroads in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name="mhealthverticalsbook"/&gt;

Some other mHealth technologies include:&lt;ref name="mmhealthroadmapbook"/&gt;

*Patient monitoring devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/misl/2009publications/pervasive09.pdf|title=A Context Aware Wireless Body Area Network (BAN)|citeseerx=10.1.1.158.6013|author1=Tony O'Donovan|author2=John O'Donoghue|author3=Cormac Sreenan|author4=David Sammon|author5=Philip O'Reilly|author6=Kieran A. O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mobile [[telemedicine]]/telecare devices
*[[Microcomputers]]
*Data collection software
*Mobile Operating System Technology
*Mobile applications (e.g., gamified/social wellness solutions)
*[[Chatterbots]]

====Mobile device operating system technology====

Technologies relate to the [[operating system]]s that orchestrate mobile device hardware while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and availability are required to build trust. This may foster greater adoption of mHealth technologies and services, by exploiting lower cost multi purpose mobile devices such as tablets, PCs, and smartphones. Operating systems that control these emerging classes of devices include Google's Android, Apple's iPhone OS, Microsoft's Windows Mobile, and RIM's BlackBerry OS.

Operating systems must be agile and evolve to effectively balance and deliver the desired level of service to an application and end user, while managing display real estate, power consumption and security posture. As advances in capabilities such as integrating voice, video and Web 2.0 collaboration tools into mobile devices, significant benefits can be achieved in the delivery of health care services. New sensor technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New sensor technologies | citeseerx = 10.1.1.141.6348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  such as HD video and audio capabilities, accelerometers, GPS, ambient light detectors, barometers and gyroscopes&lt;ref name="Lane 140–150"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=Nicholas |author2=Miluzzo, Emiliano |author3=Lu, Hong |author4=Peebles, Daniel |author5=Choudhury, Tanzeem |author6=Campbell, Andrew|title=A survey of mobile phone sensing|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=48|issue=9|pages=140–150|doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5560598}}&lt;/ref&gt; can enhance the methods of describing and studying cases, close to the patient or consumer of the health care service. This could include diagnosis, education, treatment and monitoring.

====Air quality sensing technologies====

Environmental conditions have a significant impact to public health. Per the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution accounts for about 1.4% of total mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostro|first=Bart|title=Outdoor air pollution : assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|year=2004|publisher=World Health Organization, Protection of the Human Environment|location=Geneva|isbn=92-4-159146-3|edition=null}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing Participatory sensing technologies in mobile telephone, public health research can exploit the wide penetration of mobile devices to collect air measurements,&lt;ref name="Lane 140–150"/&gt; which can be utilized to assess the impact of pollution. Projects such as the Urban Atmospheres are utilizing embedded technologies in mobile phones to acquire real time conditions from millions of user mobile phones. By aggregating this data, public health policy shall be able to craft initiatives to mitigate risk associated with outdoor air pollution.

===Data===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
[[Data]] has become an especially important aspect of mHealth. Data collection requires both the collection device (mobile phones, computer, or portable device) and the software that houses the information. Data is primarily focused on visualizing static text but can also extend to interactive decision support algorithms, other visual image information, and also communication capabilities through the integration of e-mail and SMS features. Integrating use of [[GIS]] and [[GPS]] with mobile technologies adds a geographical mapping component that is able to "tag" voice and data communication to a particular location or series of locations. These combined capabilities have been used for emergency health services as well as for disease surveillance, health facilities and services mapping, and other health-related data collection.

== Health outcomes ==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}

== Applications ==

While others exist, the 2009 UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation&lt;ref name=v/&gt; report presents seven application categories within the mHealth field.&lt;ref name="mhealthverticalsbook"/&gt;

*Education and awareness
*Helpline
*Diagnostic and treatment support
* Point-of-care diagnostics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/tmi.12461 | volume=20 | title=Heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa: review of the aetiology of heart failure and the role of point-of-care biomarker diagnostics | journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | pages=581–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Communication and training for healthcare workers
*Disease and epidemic outbreak tracking
*Remote monitoring
*Remote data collection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/14651858.MR000042 | title=Comparison of self administered survey questionnaire responses collected using mobile apps versus other methods | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each application category as well as a specific project within the category will be described.

===Education and awareness===
Education and awareness programs within the mHealth field are largely about the spreading of mass information from source to recipient through short message services (SMS). In education and awareness applications, SMS messages are sent directly to users' phones to offer information about various subjects, including testing and treatment methods, availability of health services, and disease management. SMSs provide an advantage of being relatively unobtrusive, offering patients confidentiality in environments where disease (especially HIV/AIDS) is often taboo. Additionally, SMSs provide an avenue to reach far-reaching areas—such as rural areas—which may have limited access to public health information and education, health clinics, and a deficit of healthcare workers.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

===Helpline===
Helpline typically consists of a specific phone number that any individual is able to call to gain access to a range of medical services. These include phone consultations, counseling, service complaints, and information on facilities, drugs, equipment, and/or available mobile health clinics.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

===Diagnostic support, treatment support, communication and training for healthcare workers===
Diagnostic and treatment support systems are typically designed to provide healthcare workers in remote areas advice about diagnosis and treatment of patients. While some projects may provide mobile phone applications—such as a step-by-step medical decision tree systems—to help healthcare workers diagnosis, other projects provide direct diagnosis to patients themselves. In such cases, known as [[telemedicine]], patients might take a photograph of a wound or illness and allow a remote physician diagnose to help treat the medical problem. Both diagnosis and treatment support projects attempt to mitigate the cost and time of travel for patients located in remote areas.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

mHealth projects within the communication and training for healthcare workers subset involve connecting healthcare workers to sources of information through their mobile phone. This involves connecting healthcare workers to other healthcare workers, medical institutions, ministries of health, or other houses of medical information. Such projects additionally involve using mobile phones to better organize and target in-person training. Improved communication projects attempt to increase knowledge transfer amongst healthcare workers and improve patient outcomes through such programs as patient referral processes.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

===Disease surveillance, remote data collection, and epidemic outbreak tracking===
Projects within this area operate to utilize mobile phones' ability to collect and transmit data quickly, cheaply, and relatively efficiently. Data concerning the location and levels of specific diseases (such as [[malaria]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis|TB]], [[Avian Flu]]) can help medical systems or ministries of health or other organizations identify outbreaks and better target medical resources to areas of greatest need. Such projects can be particularly useful during emergencies, in order to identify where the greatest medical needs are within a country&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

Policymakers and health providers at the national, district, and community level need accurate data in order to gauge the effectiveness of existing policies and programs and shape new ones. In the developing world, collecting field information is particularly difficult since many segments of the population are rarely able to visit a hospital, even in the case of severe illness. A lack of patient data creates an arduous environment in which policy makers can decide where and how to spend their (sometimes limited) resources. While some software within this area is specific to a particular content or area, other software can be adapted to any data collection purpose.

===Treatment support and medication compliance for patients, including chronic disease management===
Remote monitoring and treatment support allows for greater involvement in the continued care of patients. Recent studies seem to show also the efficacy of inducing positive and negative affective states, using smart phones.&lt;ref name="Cipresso 23–30"/&gt; Within environments of limited resources and beds—and subsequently a 'outpatient' culture—remote monitoring allows healthcare workers to better track patient conditions, medication regimen adherence, and follow-up scheduling. Such projects can operate through either one- or two-way communications systems. Remote monitoring has been used particularly in the area of medication adherence for AIDS,&lt;ref name="Devi 257–265"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devi|first=Balla Rama|last2=Syed-Abdul|first2=Shabbir|last3=Kumar|first3=Arun|last4=Iqbal|first4=Usman|last5=Nguyen|first5=Phung-Anh|last6=Li|first6=Yu-Chuan Jack|last7=Jian|first7=Wen-Shan|date=2015-11-01|title=mHealth: An updated systematic review with a focus on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis long term management using mobile phones|journal=Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine|volume=122|issue=2|pages=257–265|doi=10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.08.003|issn=1872-7565|pmid=26304621}}&lt;/ref&gt; cardiovascular disease,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamine|first=Saee|last2=Gerth-Guyette|first2=Emily|last3=Faulx|first3=Dunia|last4=Green|first4=Beverly B.|last5=Ginsburg|first5=Amy Sarah|date=2015-02-24|title=Impact of mHealth chronic disease management on treatment adherence and patient outcomes: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=e52|doi=10.2196/jmir.3951|issn=1438-8871|pmc=4376208|pmid=25803266}}&lt;/ref&gt; chronic lung disease,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[diabetes]],&lt;ref name=v/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chomutare|first=Taridzo|last2=Fernandez-Luque|first2=Luis|last3=Årsand|first3=Eirik|last4=Hartvigsen|first4=Gunnar|date=2011-01-01|title=Features of Mobile Diabetes Applications: Review of the Literature and Analysis of Current Applications Compared Against Evidence-Based Guidelines|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/3/e65/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.2196/jmir.1874|pmc=3222161|pmid=21979293|pages=e65}}&lt;/ref&gt; antenatal mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marcano-Belisario José S.|displayauthors=etal | year = 2016 | title = Tablet computers for implementing NICE antenatal mental health guidelines: protocol of a feasibility study | journal = BMJ Open | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = e009930 | doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009930 | pmid=26801468 | pmc=4735209}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Devi 257–265"/&gt; Technical process evaluations have confirmed the feasibility of deploying dynamically tailored, SMS-based interventions designed to provide ongoing behavioral reinforcement for persons living with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Furberg RD, Uhrig JD, Bann CM, Lewis MA, Harris JL, Williams P, Coomes C, Martin N, Kuhns L|title=Technical Implementation of a Multi-Component, Text Message–Based Intervention for Persons Living with HIV|journal=JMIR Res Protoc|year=2012|volume=1|issue=2|p=e17|url=http://www.researchprotocols.org/2012/2/e17/|doi=10.2196/resprot.2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

In conclusion, the use of the mobile phone  technology (in combination with a web-based interface) in health care results in an increase in convenience and efficiency of data collection, transfer, storage and analysis management of data as compared with paper-based systems. Formal studies and preliminary project assessments demonstrate this improvement of efficiency of healthcare delivery by mobile technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf|title = mHealth.

==International legal issues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
M-health has raised serious legal issues especially in developing countries that lack privacy and data protection laws. This makes medical records like the [[electronic health record]] vulnerable to third party abuses.

[[File:Acqua alta in Piazza San Marco-original.jpg|right|thumb|[[Acqua alta]] [[flood]]s in [[Piazza San Marco]]. This ever more frequent event causes considerable inconvenience and has driven the Authorities to seek solutions such as MOSE]]

'''MOSE''' (MOdulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, ''Experimental Electromechanical Module'') is a project intended to protect the city of [[Venice]], Italy and the [[Venetian Lagoon]] from [[flood]]ing.

The project is an integrated system consisting of rows of mobile gates installed at the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]], [[Malamocco]], and [[Chioggia]] inlets that are able to isolate the Venetian Lagoon temporarily from the [[Adriatic Sea]] during [[acqua alta]] high tides. Together with other measures, such as coastal reinforcement, the raising of quaysides, and the paving and improvement of the lagoon, MOSE is designed to protect Venice and the lagoon from tides of up to {{Convert|3|m}}.

The ''Consorzio Venezia Nuova''&lt;ref name= nota1 group="note"&gt;The Consorzio Venezia Nuova is responsible for work to safeguard Venice and the lagoon delegated to the State on behalf of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport – Venice Water Authority, according to the provisions of the Special Law for Venice (Law no. 798 of 1984). Made up of a group of national and local construction companies, to carry out its task it has created a structure able to plan, organise and manage all phases of all activities.&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for the work on behalf of the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (Italy)|Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport]] – Venice Water Authority.&lt;ref name= nota2 group="note"&gt;The Water Authority is heir to the historic office of the Serenissima set up in 1501. It is now the local organ of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport with direct primary responsibility for the safeguarding, safety and hydraulic protection of a large area including, in particular, the Venice Lagoon.&lt;/ref&gt;
Construction began simultaneously in 2003 at all three lagoon inlets, and {{as of|2013|06|lc=y}}, more than 85% of the project has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-technology.net/projects/mose-project/ |website=water-technology.net|title=MOSE Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to be fully completed in 2022.&lt;ref name="2022completion"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/10/12/esteri/lastampa-in-english/venice-and-mose-story-of-a-failure-2XRaxsCgFhcmKEXidalyxJ/pagina.html |title=Venice and MOSE: Story of a failure |author=Roberto Giovannini |publisher=La Stampa |date=10 December 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name ==
Before the acronym was used to describe the entire flood protection system, MOSE referred to the 1:1 scale prototype of a gate that had been tested between 1988 and 1992 at the Lido inlet.&lt;br /&gt;
The name also holds a secondary meaning: "MOSE" alludes to the biblical character [[Moses]] ("Mosè" in Italian), who is remembered for [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting]] the [[Red Sea]].

== Context ==
[[File:Venedig-lagune.png|thumb|400px|Map of the Venetian Lagoon]]
MOSE is part of a General Plan of Interventions to safeguard [[Venice]] and the lagoon commenced in 1987 by the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (Italy)|Ministry of Infrastructure]] through the [[Venice Water Authority]] (the Ministry's operational arm in the lagoon) and the concessionary ''Consorzio Venezia Nuova''. The measures already completed or underway along the coastline and in the lagoon are the most important environmental defense, restoration, and improvement program ever implemented by the Italian State.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In parallel with the construction of MOSE, the Venice Water Authority and Venice Local Authority are raising quaysides and paving in the city in order to protect built-up areas in the lagoon from medium high tides (below {{Convert|110|cm}}, the height at which the mobile barriers will come into operation). These measures are extremely complex, particularly in urban settings such as Venice and Chioggia where the raising must take account of the delicate architectural and monumental context.
Measures to improve the shallow lagoon environment are aimed at slowing degradation of the morphological structures caused by subsidence, [[eustatic|eustatism]], and [[erosion]] due to waves and wash. Work is underway throughout the lagoon basin to protect, reconstruct, and renaturalise salt marshes, mud flats and shallows; restore the environment of the smaller islands; and dredge lagoon canals and channels.

Important activities are also underway to redress pollution in the industrial area of Porto [[Marghera]], at the edge of the central lagoon. Islands formerly used as rubbish dumps are being secured while industrial canals are being consolidated and sealed after removal of their polluted sediments.

== Objectives ==
The aim of MOSE is to protect the lagoon, its towns, villages and inhabitants along with its iconic historic, artistic and environmental heritage from floods, including extreme events.
Although the tide in the lagoon basin is lower than in other areas of the world (where it may reach as high as {{convert|20|m}}), the phenomenon may become significant when associated with atmospheric and meteorological factors such as low pressure and the [[bora (wind)|bora]], a north-easterly wind coming from [[Trieste]], or the [[Sirocco]], a hot south-easterly wind. Those conditions push waves into the gulf of Venice. High water is also worsened by rain and water flowing into the lagoon from the drainage basin at 36 inflow points associated with small rivers and canals.

Floods have caused damage since ancient times and have become ever more frequent and intense as a result of the combined effect of eustatism (a rise in sea level) and subsidence (a drop in land level) caused by natural and man-induced phenomena. Today, towns and villages in the lagoon are an average of {{convert|23|cm}} lower with respect to the water level than at the beginning of the 1900s and each year, thousands of floods cause serious problems for the inhabitants as well as deterioration of architecture, urban structures and the ecosystem. Over the entire lagoon area, there is also a constant risk of an extreme catastrophic event such as that of 4{{nbsp}}November 1966 when a tide of {{convert|194|cm}} submerged Venice, Chioggia and the other built-up areas.
Floods effects are exacerbated due to greater erosion by the sea caused by human interventions to facilitate port activities (e.g. through the construction of jetties and artificial canals); establishment of the industrial [[Porto Marghera]] area; and increased wash from motorized boats, which all aggravate erosion of morphological structures and the foundations of quaysides and buildings.
In the future, the high water phenomenon may be further aggravated by the predicted rise in sea level as a result of [[global warming]].

In this context, MOSE, together with reinforcement of the barrier island, has been designed to provide protection from tides of up to {{convert|3|m}} in height. MOSE will therefore effectively protect the lagoon, even if the most pessimistic hypotheses are proven true, such as a rise in sea level of at least {{convert|60|cm}} (recent estimates from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) predict a rise in sea level of between {{convert|18|and|59|cm}} over the next 100 years).
MOSE is flexible and can be operated in different ways according to the characteristics and height of the tide. Given that the gates are independent and can be operated separately, all three inlets can be closed in the case of an exceptional event, the inlets can be closed one at a time according to the winds, atmospheric pressure and height of tide forecast, or again, each inlet can be partially closed.

Exceptionally high waters have struck the city during the 20th century: the flood of November 1966 ({{convert|194|cm}}), 1979 ({{convert|166|cm}}), 2007 ({{convert|160|cm}}), 1986 ({{convert|158|cm}}), 1951 and 2012 ({{convert|151|cm}}), 1936 and 2002 ({{convert|147|cm}}), 1960 ({{convert|145|cm}}), 1968 and 2000 ({{convert|144|cm}}), 1992 ({{convert|142|cm}}), 1979 ({{convert|140|cm}}). All values were recorded at the [[Punta della Salute]] (Venice) station and refer to the 1897 tidal datum point.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Chronology ==
Following the flood of 4{{nbsp}}November 1966 when Venice, Chioggia and the other built-up areas in the lagoon were submerged by a tide of {{convert|194|cm}}, the first Special Law for Venice declared the problem of safeguarding the city to be of "priority national interest".&lt;ref name=nota4&gt;Law no. 171/1973, indicating the objectives and criteria for the measures to be implemented in the lagoon and defining the institutional parties involved and their relative responsibilities: the State for physical safeguarding and environmental restoration of the lagoon basin; the Veneto Region for water pollution abatement and the local Authorities of Venice and Chioggia for economic and social development, restoration and conservative improvement of urban structures&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of a long legislative and technical process to guarantee Venice and the lagoon an effective sea defence system.

To this end, in 1975 the State [[Ministry of Public Works]] issued a competitive tender, but the process ended without a project being chosen from those presented as no hypothesis for action satisfied all the mandated requirements. The Ministry subsequently acquired documents presented during the call for tender and passed them to a group of experts commissioned to draw up a project to preserve the hydraulic balance of the lagoon and protect Venice from floods (the "Progettone" of 1981).

A few years later, a further Special Law (Law no. 798/1984) emphasised the need for a unified approach to safeguarding measures, set up a committee for policy, coordination and control of these activities (the "Comitatone", chaired by the President of the Council of Ministers and consisting of representatives of the competent national and local authorities and institutions) and entrusted design and implementation to a single body, the ''Consorzio Venezia Nuova'', recognising its ability to manage the safeguarding activities as a whole.
''The Venice Water Authority – Consorzio Venezia Nuova'' presented a complex system of interventions to safeguard Venice (the REA "Riequilibrio E Ambiente", "Rebalancing and the Environment" Project), which included mobile barriers at the inlets to regulate tides in the lagoon. In this context, between 1988 and 1992, experiments were carried out on a prototype gate (''MOdulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico'', hence the name MOSE) and in 1989, a conceptual design for the mobile barriers was drawn up. This was completed in 1992 and subsequently approved by the Higher Council of Public Works then subjected to an Environmental Impact Assessment procedure and further developed as requested by the ''Comitatone''. In 2002 the final design was presented and on 3{{nbsp}}April 2003, the Comitatone gave the go-ahead for its implementation. The same year, construction sites opened at the three lagoon inlets of Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia.

== Operating principles ==
MOSE consists of rows of mobile gates at the three inlets, which temporarily separate the lagoon from the sea in the event of a high tide. There will be a total of 78 gates divided into four barriers. At the Lido inlet, the widest, there will be two rows of gates of 21 and 20 elements respectively linked by an artificial island (the island connecting the two rows of gates at the centre of the Lido inlet will also accommodate the technical buildings housing the system operating plant); one row of 19 gates at the Malamocco inlet and one row of 18 gates at the Chioggia inlet.
The gates consist of metal box-type structures {{convert|20|m}} wide for all rows, with a length varying between {{convert|18.5|and|29|m}} and from {{convert|3.6|to|5|m}} thick, connected to the concrete housing structures with hinges, the technological heart of the system, which constrain the gates to the housing structures and allow them to move.

Under normal tidal conditions, the gates are full of water and rest in their housing structures. When a high tide is forecast, compressed air is introduced into the gates to empty them of water, causing them to rotate around the axis of the hinges and rise up until they emerge above the water to stop the tide from entering the lagoon. When the tide drops, the gates are filled with water again and return to their housing.

The inlets are closed for an average of between four and five hours, including the time taken for the gates to be raised (about 30 minutes) and lowered (about 15 minutes).

To guarantee navigation and avoid interruption of activities in the Port of Venice, when the mobile barriers are in operation, a main [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] is under construction at the Malamocco inlet to allow the transit of large ships, while at the Lido and Chioggia inlets there will be smaller locks to allow emergency vessels, fishing boats and pleasure craft to shelter and transit.

Operating procedure dictates that the gates will be raised for tides of more than {{convert|110|cm}} high. The competent authorities have established this as the optimum height with respect to current sea levels, but the gates can be operated for any level of tide. The MOSE system is also flexible and depending on the winds, atmospheric pressure and level of tide, it can oppose the high water in different ways – with simultaneous closure of all three inlets in the case of exceptional tides, by closing just one inlet at a time, or by partially closing each inlet{{mdash}}given that the gates are independent{{mdash}}for medium-high tides.

Construction of MOSE was authorised by the "Comitatone" on 3{{nbsp}}April 2003 and the associated construction sites opened the same year. Work began simultaneously and continues in parallel at the three inlets of Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia. Work on the structural parts (foundations, mobile barrier abutments, gate housing structures), associated structures (breakwaters, small craft harbours, locks) and parts for operating the system (technical buildings, plant) is now at an advanced stage.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Currently about 4000 people are employed in the construction of MOSE.
As well as the construction sites at the inlets, fabrication of the main components of MOSE (the hinges, the technological heart of the system which constrain the gates to their housing and allow them to move, and the gates) is also proceeding. Restructuring of the buildings and spaces in the area of the Venice Arsenal where maintenance of MOSE and management of the system will be located is also underway.

=== Lagoon inlet construction sites ===
Construction of MOSE at the inlets necessitates complex logistical organisation. These are located in a highly delicate environmental context so as to avoid interfering with the surrounding area as far as possible. The sites have been set up on temporary areas of water in order to limit occupation of the land adjacent to the inlets and reduce as far as possible the effect on activities taking place there. Materials (for example, site supplies) and machines are also moved via sea to avoid overloading the road system along the coast. Since the sites opened, all work has been carried out without interrupting transit through the inlet channels.

Below is a description of the work underway and already completed at each inlet.

=== Lido inlet ===
[[File:01 bocca di lido.jpg|thumb|Lido inlet. In the foreground, the sea-side basin of the small craft harbour, flooded with water again after launch and positioning of the gate housing structures for the Lido Treporti row; at the centre, the new island which will serve as an intermediate structure between the two rows of gates to be installed in this inlet]]
There will be two rows of gates at the Lido inlet (21 mobile gates for the North barrier Lido-Treporti and 20 mobile gates for the South barrier Lido-San Nicolò).

To the north of the inlet (Treporti), a small craft harbour consisting of two basins communicating through a lock, will allow small craft and emergency vessels to shelter and transit when the gates are raised. The sea-side basin was temporarily drained and sealed for use as the site to construct the gate housing structures for this barrier. Once the housing structures had been completed, the area was flooded with water to allow the housing structures to be floated out.

The housing structures for the gates in the north barrier (seven housing structures and two for the abutment connections) were positioned on the seabed. Four of this barrier's gates were installed and manoeuvred for the first time in October 2013; at the end of 2014, the installation of 21 gates will be complete and operational for functional testing purposes (the so-called "blank tests").

At the south of the inlet (San Nicolò), the launch and the positioning of seven housing structures and two for the abutment connections has been completed (the structures have been fabricated on a temporary raised area in the Malamocco inlet and will be taken out to sea by a giant mobile platform which functions as a giant elevator).

At the centre of the inlet, a new island has been constructed to act as an intermediate structure between the two rows of mobile gates. This island will accommodate the buildings and plant for operating the gates (construction underway).

Outside the inlet, a {{convert|1000|m|adj=on}} long curved breakwater is almost complete.{{when|date=July 2014}}

=== Malamocco inlet ===
[[File:06a bocca di malamocco.jpg|thumb|Malamocco inlet with work underway]]
A temporary construction site has been set up alongside the basin to fabricate the gate housing structures to be positioned on the sea bed (Malamocco and Lido San Nicolò barriers, seven housing structures and two for the abutment connections for each barrier have been built).

In April 2014, the lock for the transit of large ships becomes operative to avoid interference with port activities when the gates are in operation.

Positioning of the gate housing structures for the Malamocco barrier started in June 2014 and is now underway (expected to end in October 2014).

The seabed in the area where the 19 gates will be installed has been reinforced.

Outside the inlet, a {{convert|1300|m|adj=on}} long curved breakwater designed to attenuate tidal currents and define a basin of calm water to protect the lock has been completed.

=== Chioggia inlet ===
[[File:07a bocca di chioggia.jpg|thumb|The Chioggia inlet, with the new breakwater in the foreground]]
Work has been completed to construct a small craft harbour with double lock to guarantee transit of a large number of fishing vessels when the gates are in operation.

The sea-side basin has been temporarily drained and sealed for use as a construction site to fabricate the gate housing structures, as for the Lido north inlet barrier.

Positioning for the gate housing structures started in June 2014 (expected to end in October 2014).

In the inlet channel, the seabed in the area where the 18 gates will be installed has been reinforced.

Outside the inlet, a {{convert|500|m}} long curved breakwater has been completed.

=== Hinges ===
[[File:Sezione paratoia.jpg|thumb|left|Gate cross-section 1. gate 2. hinge 3. gate base 4. plant and access tunnels 5. land compaction piles]]

The hinges form the technological heart of the sea defence system. They constrain the gates to the housing structures, allow them to move and connect the gates to the operating plant.
The steel gates consist of a male element ({{convert|3|m}} high and weighing {{convert|10|t}}) connected to the gate, a female element ({{convert|1.5|m}} high and weighing {{convert|25|t}}) fastened to the housing structure and an attachment assembly to connect the male and female elements.
A total of 156 hinges (two for each gate) will be fabricated, together with a number of reserve elements. Fabrication is currently underway.

=== Work progress and next stages ===
During 2014, both barriers at the Lido inlet will be completed. At the same time, work will continue to launch and position the gate housing structures for the Malamocco and Chioggia barriers.
MOSE is expected to be complete and in operation by 2022.&lt;ref name="2022completion"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/10/12/esteri/lastampa-in-english/venice-and-mose-story-of-a-failure-2XRaxsCgFhcmKEXidalyxJ/pagina.html |title=Venice and MOSE: Story of a failure |author=Roberto Giovannini |publisher=La Stampa |date=10 December 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mose in the Venice Arsenal ==
[[File:Arsenale nord1.jpg|thumb|The area of the Arsenal where maintenance of Mose and management of the lagoon system will be located.]]
Since 2011, the Mose control centre and management functions for the lagoon system have been located in the [[Venice Arsenal]], symbol of the former trading and military might of the historic ''Serenissima'' or "Serene Republic". Numerous historical buildings, in a state of decay and abandonment for decades, have already been restored and reorganisation of the area is underway to accommodate these new activities.
Restoration has enabled a heritage of extraordinary historical and architectural value to be safeguarded and allowed buildings to be recovered and re-utilised. As home to MOSE management and control the arsenal will receive a new lease of life after years of abandonment, allowing its renaissance as a place of innovation and production, with important economic repercussions for the city and local area.

The historic arsenal buildings before and after restoration and construction of infrastructure to accommodate the new functions are shown below.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the control centre, key decisions will be taken on raising and lowering the mobile barriers according to measurements made by tide gauges positioned in front of the lagoon inlets to record the rising tide in real time. The command to raise the gate will be given when water reaches the level established by the procedure to begin the manoeuvre and guarantee that the water level in the lagoon does not exceed the requisite safe level.

== Projections ==
The MOSE project is estimated to cost €5.496 billion, up €1.3 billion from initial cost projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/06/06/mose-in-dieci-anni-13miliardi-di-costi-in-piu-e-allarmi-inascoltati/1015136/ |title=Mose, in dieci anni 1,3 miliardi di costi in più.

== Controversies ==
The project has met resistance from [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[conservation movement|conservation]] groups such as [[Italia Nostra]], and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], who have made negative comments about the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-66123018/venice-duels-over-troubled-waters| title=Venice: Duels over Troubled Waters| last=Piazzano| first=Piero| journal=[[UNESCO Courier]]| date=September 2000| via=[[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=1 February 2018| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the MOSE project, which environmentalists and certain political forces have opposed since its inception, relate to the costs to the Italian State of construction, management, and maintenance, which are said to be much higher than those for alternative systems employed by the Netherlands and England to resolve similar problems. In addition, according to the project's opponents, the monolithic integrated system is not "gradual, experimental and reversible" as required by the Special Law for the Safeguarding of Venice. There have also been criticisms of the environmental impact of the barriers, not just at the inlets where complex leveling will be carried out (the seabed must be flat at the barrier installation sites) and the lagoon bed reinforced to accommodate the gates (which will rest on thousands of concrete piles driven deep underground), but also on the hydrogeological balance and delicate ecosystem of the lagoon.
The ''NO MOSE front'' also emphasises what could be a number of critical points in the structure of the system and its inability to cope with predicted rises in sea level.

Over the years, nine appeals have been presented, eight of which have been rejected by the TAR (''Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale'', regional administrative court) and the Council of State. The ninth, currently under evaluation by the Administrative Tribunal, was presented by the Venice Local Authority and contests the favourable opinion of the [[Safeguard Venice Commission]] on the commencement of work at the Pellestrina site in the Malamocco inlet. Here, part of the MOSE gate housing caissons will be made using processes which, according to the local authority, could damage a site of special natural interest.

Environmental associations have also requested the intervention of the [[European Union]], as project activities affect sites protected by the ''Nature 2000 Network'' and the ''European Directive on birds''. Following a report of 5{{nbsp}}March 2004 by the Venetian MP [[Luana Zanella]], on 19{{nbsp}}December 2005 the [[European Commission]] opened an infraction procedure against Italy for "pollution of the habitat" of the lagoon. The [[European Environmental Commission]] Directorate General considers that as it has "neither identified nor adopted{{mdash}}in relation to the impacts on the area 'IBA 064-Venice Lagoon' resulting from construction of the MOSE project{{mdash}}appropriate measures to prevent pollution and deterioration of the habitat, together with harmful disturbance of birds with significant consequences in the light of the objectives of article 4 of [[EEC Directive]] 79/409, the Italian Republic has not fulfilled its obligations under Article 4, Paragraph 4, of EEC Directive 79/409 of the Council of 2{{nbsp}}April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds.
Although the European Environmental Commission has said that the initiative is not intended to stop MOSE going ahead, the body has called on the [[Italian Government]] to produce new information on the impact of the sites and the [[environmental mitigation]] structures. The Water Authority and ''Consorzio Venezia Nuova'' both confirm that the construction sites are temporary and will be completely restored at the end of the work.

In 2014, 35 people, including [[Giorgio Orsoni]], the Mayor of Venice, were arrested in Italy on corruption charges in connection with the MOSE Project. Orsoni was accused of receiving illicit funds from the Consorzio Venezia Nuova, the consortium behind the construction of the project, which he then used in his campaign to be elected mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10875534/Mayor-of-Venice-arrested-on-lagoon-barrier-project-corruption-charges.html| title=Mayor of Venice arrested on lagoon barrier project corruption charges| first=Nick| last=Squires| date=4 June 2014| newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location=[[London]]| accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were allegations that 20 million euros in public funds had been sent to foreign bank accounts and used to finance political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27692334 Venice Mayor Orsoni held in Italy corruption inquiry], [[BBC News]]. 4 June 2014. Last updated at 10:02 GMT.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the legal proceedings occurred between 2013 and 2014, that involved part of the management bodies of the Consorzio Venezia Nuova and its Companies, the State intervened in order to ensure the conclusion of the flood defense system: in December 2014, the ANAC (National Anti-Corruption Authority) proposes the extraordinary management of the Consorzio, which follows the appointment of three Special Chief Executive Officers.
The Special Administration of the Consorzio pursues its task to guarantee the proper completion of Mose and to ensure the conclusion of the defense system on 2018.

== Alternative proposals ==
Over the years, various proposals have been presented as an alternative to MOSE. Some offer widely different technological solutions while others suggest technologies to improve the efficiency of the system of mobile gates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} At the request of the Mayor of Venice, [[Massimo Cacciari]], approximately ten of these projects were examined in 2006 by round tables of experts appointed by individual responsible bodies, including the [[Higher Council of Public Works (Italy)|Higher Council of Public Works]]. In November 2006, negative assessments of the alternative proposals by these round tables led the government to give definitive approval for the MOSE project with the alternative proposals deemed ineffective or inappropriate to guarantee the defence of Venice.

As of 2016, only California, Maryland, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas had tested managed access systems.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Managed access systems are unable to stop the use of contraband devices using Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Deployment of managed access systems requires FCC approval&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; as well as consent from cellular network carriers. The devices can also cause interference outside of the prison if they are not properly implemented.&lt;ref name=NIJ/&gt;

* Ministers of State, [[Niranjan Jyoti]]

== Functions of the ministry ==
* Policy support and developmental
* Promotional and technical
* Advisory and regulatory

== Goals of MOFPI ==
* Better utilization and value addition of agricultural produce for enhancement of income of farmers.
* Minimizing wastage at all stages in the food processing chain by the development of infrastructure for storage, transportation and processing of agrno-food produce.
* Induction of modern technology into the food processing industries from both domestic and external sources.
* Maximum utilization of agricultural residues and by-products of the primary agricultural produce as also of the processed industry.
* To encourage R&amp;D in food processing for product and process development and improved packaging.
* To provide policy support, promotional initiatives and physical facilities to promote value added exports

== Roles of MOFPI ==

The strategic role and functions of the Ministry fall under three categories -

* Policy support developmental &amp; promotional
* Technical &amp; advisory
* Regulatory.

It is concerned with the formulation &amp; implementation of policies and plans for all the industries under its domain within the overall national priorities and objectives. Its main focus areas include—development of infrastructure, technological up gradation, development of backward linkages, enforcement of quality standards and expanding domestic as well as export markets for processed food products.

The Ministry acts as a catalyst and facilitator for attracting domestic &amp; foreign investments towards developing large integrated processing capacities, by creating conducive policy environment, including rationalization of taxes &amp; duties. It processes applications for foreign collaborations, Export Oriented Units (EOUs) etc. and assists/guides prospective entrepreneur in his endeavour.

Post liberalization, it has approved a large no. of joint ventures, foreign collaborations, industrial licenses and 100% EOU proposals in different food processing areas and has taken major policy initiatives to facilitate an accelerated growth of the industry.The functions of the Ministry can be broadly classified as follows:

=== Policy support ===

* Formulation and implementation of policies for food processing industries within overall national priorities and objectives.
* Facilitating the creation of a conducive policy environment for healthy growth of the food-processing sector.
* Promoting rationalization of tariffs and duties relating to food processing sector.

=== Developmental ===

== Photogeneration cell ==

[[File:Fotocel.jpg|thumb|right|Photogeneration cell band diagram]]

This type of cell [[electrolysis|electrolizes]] water to [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] gas by irradiating the [[anode]] with [[electromagnetic radiation]]. This has been referred to as [[artificial photosynthesis]] and has been suggested as a way of storing [[solar energy]] in [[hydrogen]] for use as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/41568.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611185053/http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/41568.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-11 |title=Photoelectrochemical Water Systems for H2 Production |author=John A. Turner|date=2007-05-17 |publisher=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] |accessdate=2011-05-02|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incoming sunlight excites free electrons near the surface of the silicon electrode. These electrons flow through wires to the stainless steel electrode, where four of them react with four water molecules to form two molecules of hydrogen and 4 OH groups. The OH groups flow through the liquid electrolyte to the surface of the silicon electrode. There they react with the four holes associated with the four photoelectrons, the result being two water molecules and an oxygen molecule. Illuminated silicon immediately begins to corrode under contact with the electrolytes. The corrosion consumes material and disrupts the properties of the surfaces and interfaces within the cell.&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;

Two types of [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] systems operate via [[photocatalysis]]. One uses semiconductor surfaces as catalysts. In these devices the [[semiconductor]] surface absorbs solar energy and acts as an electrode for [[water splitting]]. The other methodology uses in-solution metal complexes as catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berinstein |first=Paula |title=Alternative energy: facts, statistics, and issues |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |date=2001-06-30 |isbn=1-57356-248-3 |quote=Another photoelectrochemical method involves using dissolved metal complexes as a catalyst, which absorbs energy and creates an electric charge separation that drives the water-splitting reaction. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1149/1.2946478| title = Photoelectrochemical Characterization and Durability Analysis of GaInPN Epilayers| year = 2008| last1 = Deutsch | first1 = T.

Dye-sensitized solar cells or Grätzel cells use dye-[[adsorbed]] highly porous nanocrystalline [[titanium dioxide]] (nc-{{chem|TiO|2}}) to produce electrical energy.

== Materials ==

PECs convert light energy into electricity within a two-electrode cell. In theory, three arrangements of photo-electrodes in the assembly of PECs exist:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00337-6| title = Recent topics in photoelectrochemistry: achievements and future prospects| year = 2000| last1 = Tryk | first1 = D.| last2 = Fujishima| first2 = A| last3 = Honda| first3 = K| journal = Electrochimica Acta| volume = 45| issue = 15–16| pages = 2363–2376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* photo-anode made of a n-type semiconductor and a metal cathode
* photo-anode made of a n-type semiconductor and a photo-cathode made of a p-type semiconductor
* photo-cathode made of a p-type semiconductor and a metal anode

The two basic requirements for materials used as photo-electrodes are optical function, required to obtain maximal absorption of solar energy, and catalytic function, required for other reactions such as water decomposition.

GaN is another option, because metal nitrides usually have a narrow band gap that could encompass almost the entire solar spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = D. | last2 = Pierre | first2 = A. | last3 = Kibria | first3 = M.

=== Silicon ===

In 2013 a cell with 2 nanometers of nickel on a silicon electrode, paired with a stainless steel electrode, immersed in an aqueous electrolyte of [[potassium borate]] and [[lithium borate]] operated for 80 hours without noticeable corrosion, versus 8 hours for titanium dioxide.  In the process, about 150 ml of hydrogen gas was generated, representing the storage of about 2 kilojoules of energy.&lt;ref name=giz1312&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/nickel-coated-silicon-pec-hydrogen-stanford/29810/ |title=Silicon/nickel water splitter could lead to cheaper hydrogen |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kenney | first1 = M.

The '''polyurethane urea elastomer''' ('''PUU'''), or poly(urethane urea) elastomer, is a flexible [[polymeric material]] that is composed of linkages made out of [[polyurethane]] and [[polyurea]] compounds. Due to its hyperelastic properties, it is capable of bouncing back high-speed ballistic projectiles as if the material had “hardened” upon impact. PUUs were developed by researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] and the Army’s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] to potentially replace [[polyethylene]] materials in [[body armor]] and other protective gear, such as [[Combat helmet|combat helmets]], [[Face shield|face shields]], and [[Ballistic vest|ballistic vests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://defensesystems.com/articles/2017/10/cw/army.aspx|title=A new polyurethane-based material could mean self-hardening, almost impenetrable helmets|last=Owens|first=Katherine|date=October 23, 2017|work=Defense Systems|access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
In general, PUUs are composed of both hard and soft segments that each play a role in the material’s physical properties. The soft segments consist of two types of chemical compounds, long-chain [[Polyol|polyols]] and [[Diisocyanate|diisocyanates]], that react and connect together with urethane linkages. On the other hand, the short-chain [[Diamine|diamines]] react with the [[Diisocyanate|diisocyanates]] to form the hard segments that are held together with urea linkages. The mechanical properties of the PUU largely depend on the specific diisocyanates, long-chain polyols, and short-chain diamines in play, because how these components interact determines how well the soft and hard segments of the elastomers  both [[Crystallization|crystallize]] and undergo [[microphase separation]]. As a result, variations in this molecular arrangement of chemical compounds have been shown to greatly affect the elastomer’s morphology and the macroscopic, mechanical properties that it exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Alex|last2=Orlicki|first2=Joshua|last3=Beyer|first3=Rick|date=March 2009|title=Molecular Design of Novel Poly(urethane-urea) Hybrids as Helmet Pads for Ballistic and Blast Trauma Mitigation|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA496122|journal=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Alex|last2=Sarva|first2=Sai|last3=Rice|first3=Norman|date=September 2009|title=Improved Dynamic Strain Hardening in Poly(Urethane Urea) Elastomers for Transparent Armor Applications|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2009/technical-report.cfm?id=1931|journal=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyperelastic Behavior ==
In 2017, researchers from the Army Research Laboratory and MIT reported that PUUs are capable of demonstrating hyperelastic properties, meaning that the material becomes extremely hardened upon being deformed within a very short time. As a result, the material may withstand ballistic impacts at exceptionally high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=48275|title=PUUs Seem to be Propitious for Soldier and Vehicle Protection|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2017|work=AZO Materials|access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the study, the researchers investigated the performance of different PUU variants where 4,4’-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate ([[Hexamethylene diisocyanate|HMDI]]) was chosen as the diisocyanate compound, diethyltoluenediamine (DETA) was chosen as the short-chain diamine compound, and poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PTMO) was chosen as the long-chain polyol compound. Despite consisting of the same chemical compounds with the same [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric ratio]] of 2:1:1 of [HDMI]:[DETA]:[PTMO], the samples differed regarding the [[Molecular Weight|molecular weight]] of their respective PTMO component, namely 650 g/mol, 1000 g/mol, and 2000 g/mol, for the soft segments of the elastomers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veysset|first=David|last2=Hsieh|first2=Alex|last3=Kooi|first3=Steven|last4=Nelson|first4=Keith|date=June 27, 2017|title=Molecular influence in high-strain-rate microparticle impact response of poly(urethane urea) elastomers|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032386117306493?via%3Dihub|journal=Polymer|volume=123|pages=30–38|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three samples were subjected to a laser-induced projectile impact test (LIPIT), which tested the dynamic response of the material by using a pulsed laser to shoot it with [[Microparticle|microparticles]] made of [[Silicate|silica]] at speeds ranging from 200 m/s to 800 m/s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.machinedesign.com/materials/army-investigates-new-tougher-materials-helmets|title=Army Investigates New, Tougher Materials for Helmets|last=Mraz|first=Stephen|date=November 20, 2017|work=Machine Design|access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that the sample with the 650 g/mol PTMO was the most rigid variant with the particle exhibiting a shallow penetration of about 4 micrometers upon impact despite travelling at 790 m/s before rebounding at 195 m/s. In contrast, the sample with the 2000 g/mol PTMO displayed a deeper penetration of about 9 micrometers but had a slower particle rebound of 80 m/s, making it the most rubber-like among the PUU samples. The [[Strain rate imaging|strain-rates]] associated with these impacts were on the order of 2.0 x 10^8/s for the former and 8.1 x 10^7/s for the latter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, all three PUU variants demonstrated rebound capabilities with no signs of post-mortem damage after impact from the microparticles. In contrast, when the LIPIT was performed on a ductile, glassy [[polycarbonate]] at similar speeds to that of the 650 g/mol PTMO PUU variant, the polycarbonate displayed predominant deformation upon impact, despite its high [[fracture toughness]] and ballistic strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/195105/army_finds_promise_in_durable_material_for_future_soldier_combat_helmets|title=Army finds promise in durable material for future Soldier combat helmets|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2017|work=U.S. Army|access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers, the effectiveness of the PUUs may come from how the molecules “resonate” similar to [[Mail (armour)|chain-mail]] upon impact with each oscillations at specific frequencies dissipate the absorbed energy. In comparison, the polycarbonate lacked the broad range of [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation times]], a characteristic that reflects how efficiently the molecules in the polymer chains respond to an external impulse, that PUUs are known to have.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, the researchers concluded that even the most rubber-like variant of the PUU, specifically the 2000 g/mol PTMO sample, demonstrated greater robustness and dynamic stiffening than the glassy polycarbonate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ARL researchers have stated that the PUU’s primary benefit comes not from its extra strength but its fabric-like flexibility, which demonstrates its potential as a replacement material for the rigid ceramic and metal plates generally found in military battle armor. However, as of 2018, the PUU is still under development in the testing phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taskandpurpose.com/army-body-armor-polymer/|title=The Army’s Next Body Armor May Get Stronger The Harder It’s Hit|last=Keller|first=Jared|date=October 11, 2017|work=Task &amp; Purpose|access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[oil well]]s, '''pumping''' is a routine operation involving injecting fluids into the well.  Pumping may either be done by rigging up to the kill wing valve on the [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Xmas tree]] or, if an intervention rig up is present pumping into the riser through a T-piece (a small section of riser with a connection on the side).  Pumping is most routinely done to protect the well against scale and hydrates through the pumping of scale inhibitors and methanol.  Pumping of kill weight brine may be done for the purposes of [[well kill]]s and more exotic chemicals may be pumped from surface for cleaning the lower completion or stimulating the reservoir (though these types are jobs are more frequently done with [[coiled tubing]] for extra precision).

==Importance of knowing quantity==
Work involving wells is fraught with difficulties as there is often very little information about the real time condition of the [[completion (oil well)|completion]].  This lack of knowledge also covers potential damage and even loss of [[well integrity]].  Therefore, it is essential for the operator to pay attention to the pressures as recorded and to the quantity pumped.  A premature increase in pressure is sign of a potential blockage and continuing to pump risks burst pressure retaining components.  Pumping more than an anticipated amount of fluid is a sign of a loss of integrity and a potential leak path somewhere.  In either of these two situations, pumping must be stopped and the potential causes analysed.

===Compressed volumes===
It is vital to know the effective capacity of the completion being filled in order to understand what are sensible volumes.  If pumping is to continue until reaching a desired pressurisation, then the compressibility of the fluid will become significant.  It is therefore important to know how much the fluid will compress under pressure to know how much extra fluid is expected to be required.

As a rule of thumb in the oilfield, compression is governed by the equation:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta V=P \times V \times k&lt;/math&gt;
where ΔV is the change in volume, P is the pressure at surface and V is the volume of fluid unpressurised.  k is a compression factor approximately 3.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; psi&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, a volume of 300 bbl is to be filled with brine and pressurised to 3000 psi at the surface.  The compression is&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta V=PVk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta V=3000 psi \times 300 bbl \times 3.5 \times 10^{-6} psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = 3.15 bbl&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it is expected that 303.15 bbl are required to accomplish this task.  If 3000 psi is achieved prior to this quantity being pumped, a blockage is to be suspected.  If after pumping 303 bbl, pressurisation is not achieved, a leak is to be suspected.

[[File:Kuehlregal USA.jpg|thumb|Commercial refrigeration]]

'''Refrigeration''' is a process of removing heat from a low-temperature reservoir and transferring it to a high-temperature reservoir. The work of heat transfer is traditionally driven by [[mechanical work|mechanical]] means, but can also be driven by heat, [[magnetism]], [[electricity]], [[laser]], or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including, but not limited to: household [[refrigerator]]s, industrial [[freezer]]s, [[cryogenics]], and [[air conditioning]]. [[Heat pump]]s may use the heat output of the refrigeration process, and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to air conditioning units.                                                                                   Refrigeration has had a large impact on industry, lifestyle, agriculture, and settlement patterns. The idea of preserving food dates back to at least the ancient Roman and Chinese empires. However, mechanical refrigeration technology has rapidly evolved in the last century, from ice harvesting to temperature-controlled rail cars. The introduction of refrigerated rail cars contributed to the westward expansion of the United States, allowing settlement in areas that were not on main transport channels such as rivers, harbors, or valley trails. Settlements were also developing in infertile parts of the country, filled with newly discovered  natural resources. These new settlement patterns sparked the building of large cities which are able to thrive in areas that were otherwise thought to be inhospitable, such as [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Las Vegas]], Nevada.  In most developed countries, cities are heavily dependent upon refrigeration in supermarkets, in order to obtain their food for daily consumption. The increase in food sources has led to a larger concentration of agricultural sales coming from a smaller percentage of existing farms. Farms today have a much larger output per person in comparison to the late 1800s. This has resulted in new food sources available to entire populations, which has had a large impact on the nutrition of  society.

As quite similar criteria shall be fulfilled by [[working fluids]] ([[refrigerants]]) applied to heat pumps, refrigeration and ORC cycles, several working fluids are applied by all these technologies. Ammonia was one of the first refrigerants. Refrigeration can be defined as "The science of providing and maintaining temperature below that of surrounding atmosphere". It means continuous extraction of heat from a body whose temperature is already below the temperature of its surroundings.

==History==
{{Main|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}

===Earliest forms of cooling===
The seasonal harvesting of snow and ice is an ancient practice estimated to have begun earlier than 1000 B.C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neuburger|first=Albert|title=The technical arts and sciences of the ancients|year=2003|publisher=Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0710307551|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese collection of lyrics from this time period known as the ''[[Shijing]]'', describes religious ceremonies for filling and emptying ice cellars. However, little is known about the construction of these ice cellars or what the ice was used for. The next ancient society to harvest ice may have been the Jews according to the book of Proverbs, which reads, “As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them who sent him.”  Historians have interpreted this to mean that the Jews used ice to cool beverages rather than to preserve food. Other ancient cultures such as the Greeks and the Romans dug large snow pits insulated with grass, chaff, or branches of trees as cold storage.  Like the Jews, the Greeks and Romans did not use ice and snow to preserve food, but primarily as a means to cool beverages. The Egyptians also developed methods to cool beverages, but in lieu of using ice to cool water, the Egyptians cooled water by putting boiling water in shallow earthen jars and placing them on the roofs of their houses at night. Slaves would moisten the outside of the jars and the resulting evaporation would cool the water.  The ancient people of India used this same concept to produce ice.  The Persians stored ice in a pit called a [[Yakhchal]] and may have been the first group of people to use cold storage to preserve food. In the Australian outback before a reliable electricity supply was available where the weather could be hot and dry, many farmers used a "[[Coolgardie safe]]". This consisted of a room with hessian "curtains" hanging from the ceiling soaked in water. The water would evaporate and thereby cool the hessian curtains and thereby the air circulating in the room. This would allow many perishables such as fruit, butter, and cured meats to be kept that would normally spoil in the heat.

===Ice harvesting===
{{see also|Ice cutting|Ice trade}}
[[File:Ice Harvesting, Massachusetts, early 1850s.jpg|thumb|Ice harvesting in [[Massachusetts]], 1852, showing the [[railroad]] line in the background, used to transport the ice.]]
Before 1830, few Americans used ice to refrigerate foods due to a lack of ice-storehouses and iceboxes. As these two things became more widely available, individuals used axes and saws to [[ice cutting|harvest ice]] for their storehouses.  This method proved to be difficult, dangerous, and certainly did not resemble anything that could be duplicated on a commercial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the difficulties of harvesting ice, Frederic Tudor thought that he could capitalize on this new commodity by harvesting ice in New England and shipping it to the Caribbean islands as well as the southern states.  In the beginning, Tudor lost thousands of dollars, but eventually turned a profit as he constructed icehouses in Charleston, Virginia and in the Cuban port town of Havana.  These icehouses as well as better insulated ships helped reduce ice wastage from 66% to 8%.  This efficiency gain influenced Tudor to expand his ice market to other towns with icehouses such as New Orleans and Savannah.  This ice market further expanded as harvesting ice became faster and cheaper after one of Tudor’s suppliers, Nathaniel Wyeth, invented a horse-drawn ice cutter in 1825.  This invention as well as Tudor’s success inspired others to get involved in the [[ice trade]] and the ice industry grew.

Ice became a mass-market commodity by the early 1830s with the price of ice dropping from six cents per pound to a half of a cent per pound.  In New York City, ice consumption increased from 12,000 tons in 1843 to 100,000 tons in 1856.  Boston’s consumption leapt from 6,000 tons to 85,000 tons during that same period.  Ice harvesting created a “cooling culture” as majority of people used ice and iceboxes to store their dairy products, fish, meat, and even fruits and vegetables.  These early cold storage practices paved the way for many Americans to accept the refrigeration technology that would soon take over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=20–23|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refrigeration research===
[[File:William Cullen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Cullen]], the first to conduct experiments into artificial refrigeration.]]
The history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial [[vacuum]] over a container of [[diethyl ether]], which then [[boiling point|boiled]], absorbing [[heat of vaporization|heat]] from the surrounding air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arora|first=Ramesh Chandra|title=Refrigeration and Air Conditioning|publisher=PHI Learning|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81-203-3915-0|page=3|chapter=Mechanical vapour compression refrigeration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.

In 1758, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]], professor of chemistry, collaborated on a project investigating the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object at [[Cambridge University]], [[England]]. They confirmed that the evaporation of highly volatile liquids, such as alcohol and ether, could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to quicken the evaporation; they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|7|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, while the ambient temperature was {{convert|65|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. They noted that soon after they passed the freezing point of water (32&amp;nbsp;°F), a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about a quarter inch thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|7|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.  Franklin wrote, "From this experiment, one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm Cooling by Evaporation (Letter to John Lining)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128075748/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |date=2011-01-28 }}. Benjamin Franklin, London, June 17, 1758&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] described a closed [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum.

In 1820 the English scientist [[Michael Faraday]] liquefied [[ammonia]] and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate to Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system in the world. It was a closed-cycle that could operate continuously, as he described in his patent:
:I am enabled to use volatile fluids for the purpose of producing the cooling or freezing of fluids, and yet at the same time constantly condensing such volatile fluids, and bringing them again into operation without waste.

His prototype system worked although it did not succeed commercially.&lt;ref name=burstall&gt;{{cite book |last = Burstall |first = Aubrey F. |year = 1965 |title = A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher = The MIT Press |isbn = 0-262-52001-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842, a similar attempt was made by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00008080&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPALL%2526s1%3D0008080.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0008080%2526RS%3DPN%2F0008080&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Improved process for the artificial production of ice", U.S. Patent Office, Patent 8080, 1851]&lt;/ref&gt; who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure.  Like many of the medical experts during this time, Gorrie thought too much exposure to tropical heat led to mental and physical degeneration, as well as the spread of diseases such as malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=23|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He conceived the idea of using his refrigeration system to cool the air for comfort in homes and hospitals to prevent disease.  American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapour compression system that used ether.

The first practical vapour-compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a British journalist who had emigrated to [[Australia]]. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated [[beef]] sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold room system instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.

[[Image:AppareilCarré.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ferdinand Carré]]'s ice-making device]]
The first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as "aqua ammonia") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carré]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineer specializing in [[steam locomotive]]s and professor of engineering at the [[Technische Universität München|Technological University of Munich]] in Germany, began researching refrigeration in the 1860s and 1870s in response to demand from brewers for a technology that would allow year-round, large-scale production of [[lager]]; he patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Eat, Drink, and Be Merry | url = | accessdate= | series = Connections | serieslink=Connections (TV series)|credits= [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] |network=BBC |date=1979| number= 8|minutes=41-49 | transcript = | transcripturl =  | language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new process made possible using gases such as [[ammonia]], [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[methyl chloride]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.

[[Thaddeus Lowe]], an American balloonist, held several patents on ice-making machines. His "Compression Ice Machine" would revolutionize the cold-storage industry. In 1869 other investors and he purchased an old steamship onto which they loaded one of Lowe's refrigeration units and began shipping fresh fruit from New York to the Gulf Coast area, and fresh meat from Galveston, Texas back to New York, but because of Lowe's lack of knowledge about shipping, the business was a costly failure.

===Commercial use===

[[File:AndrewMuhlPatent02.png|thumb|Icemaker Patent by Andrew Muhl, dated December 12, 1871.]]
In 1842 [[John Gorrie]] created a system capable of refrigerating water to produce ice.  Although it was a commercial failure, it inspired scientists and inventors around the world.  France’s Ferdinand Carre was one of the inspired and he created an ice producing system that was simpler and smaller than that of Gorrie.  During the Civil War, cities such as New Orleans could no longer get ice from New England via the coastal ice trade.  Carre’s refrigeration system became the solution to New Orleans ice problems and by 1865 the city had three of Carre’s machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867, in San Antonio, Texas, a French immigrant named Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871. In 1873, the patent for this machine was contracted by the Columbus Iron Works, a company acquired by the W. C. Bradley Co., which went on to produce the first commercial ice-makers in the US.

By the 1870s breweries had become the largest users of harvested ice. Though the ice-harvesting industry had grown immensely by the turn of the 20th century, pollution and sewage had begun to creep into natural ice, making it a problem in the metropolitan suburbs. Eventually, breweries began to complain of tainted ice. Public concern for the purity of water, from which ice was formed, began to increase in the early 1900s with the rise of germ theory.  Numerous media outlets published articles connecting diseases such as typhoid fever with natural ice consumption. This caused ice harvesting to become illegal in certain areas of the country.  All of these scenarios increased the demands for modern refrigeration and manufactured ice.  Ice producing machines like that of Carre’s and Muhl’s were looked to as means of producing ice to meet the needs of grocers, farmers, and food shippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=25|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refrigerated railroad cars were introduced in the US in the 1840s for short-run transport of dairy products, but these used harvested ice to maintain a cool temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dqr01 Refrigeration], Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SS Dunedin by Frederick Tudgay.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dunedin (ship)|''Dunedin'']], the first commercially successful refrigerated ship.]]
The new refrigerating technology first met with widespread industrial use as a means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in [[reefer ship]]s from the British [[Dominion]]s and other countries to the [[British Isles]]. The first to achieve this breakthrough was an entrepreneur who had emigrated to [[New Zealand]]. [[William Soltau Davidson]] thought that Britain's rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world [[wool]] markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the [[Dunedin (ship)|''Dunedin'']] to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the ''Dunedin'' sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated meat industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A lasting Legacy - A 125 year history of New Zealand Farming since the first Frozen Meat Shipment|author=Colin Williscroft|publisher=NZ Rural Press Limited|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Lasting_Legacy.html?id=VTrmMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' commented "Today we have to record such a triumph over physical difficulties, as would have been incredible, even unimaginable, a very few days ago...". The ''[[Marlborough (1876 ship)|Marlborough]]''—sister ship to the ''Dunedin'' – was immediately converted and joined the trade the following year, along with the rival New Zealand Shipping Company vessel ''Mataurua'', while the German Steamer ''Marsala'' began carrying frozen New Zealand lamb in December 1882. Within five years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, of which only 9 had significant amounts of meat condemned. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in [[Australasia]] and South America. [[J &amp; E Hall]] of [[Dartford]], England outfitted the 'SS Selembria' with a vapor compression system to bring 30,000 carcasses of [[mutton]] from the [[Falkland Islands]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jehall.co.uk/about/history.jsp J &amp; E Hall International - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323100802/http://www.jehall.co.uk/about/history.jsp |date=2009-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years ahead, the industry rapidly expanded to [[Australia]], [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]].

By the 1890s refrigeration played a vital role in the distribution of food.  The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=142|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914 almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The big meat packers, Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas. 
	
By the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or lorries. Refrigerated vehicles are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between –40 and –20&amp;nbsp;°C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000&amp;nbsp;kg gross weight (in Europe).	
	
Although commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household.  First, most refrigerators were far too large.  Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons.  Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain.  Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe.  It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases.  Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=38|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home and consumer use===
[[File:Early household refrigerator in Popular Science 1919.png|thumb|An early example of the [[consumerization]] of mechanical refrigeration that began in the early 20th century. The [[refrigerant]] was [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
[[File:Food into a refrigerator - 20111002.jpg|thumb|A modern home refrigerator]]

During the early 1800s consumers preserved their food by storing food and ice purchased from ice harvesters in iceboxes. In 1803, Thomas Moore patented a metal-lined butter-storage tub which became the prototype for most iceboxes.  These iceboxes were used until nearly 1910 and the technology did not progress.  In fact, consumers that used the icebox in 1910 faced the same challenge of a moldy and stinky icebox that consumers had in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=23, 38|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
	
General Electric (GE) was one of the first companies to overcome these challenges. In 1911 GE released a household refrigeration unit that was powered by gas. The use of gas eliminated the need for an electric compressor motor and decreased the size of the refrigerator. However, electric companies that were customers of GE did not benefit from a gas-powered unit.  Thus, GE invested in developing an electric model. In 1927, GE released the Monitor Top, the first refrigerator to run on electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=43–45|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Frigidaire, one of GE’s main competitors, synthesized [[Freon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=44|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   With the invention of synthetic refrigerants based mostly on a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home and consumer use.  Freon led to the development of smaller, lighter, and cheaper refrigerators. The average price of a refrigerator dropped from $275 to $154 with the synthesis of Freon. This lower price allowed ownership of refrigerators in American households to exceed 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh : a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674057228|pages=45|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Freon is a trademark of the DuPont Corporation and refers to these CFCs, and later hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFC), refrigerants developed in the late 1920s. These refrigerants were considered at the time to be less harmful than the commonly-used refrigerants of the time, including methyl formate, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide. The intent was to provide refrigeration equipment for home use without danger. These CFC refrigerants answered that need. In the 1970s, though, the compounds were found to be reacting with atmospheric ozone, an important protection against solar ultraviolet radiation, and their use as a refrigerant worldwide was curtailed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.

==Impact on settlement patterns==
In the last century refrigeration allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. This new technology has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern cities and states. In the 20th century, refrigeration has made “Galactic Cities” such as Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles possible.

===Refrigerated rail cars===
The refrigerated rail car ([[refrigerated van]] or [[refrigerator car]]), along with the dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before the invention of the refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car.  After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade.  The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit.  The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods.  During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests.  This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for a good portion of the year while making no revenue for the car’s owner.  The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;     The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s.  By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stover|first=J.|title=American Railroads|journal=The Chicago History of the Railroad Refrigerator Car|year=1970|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion west and into rural areas===
The widespread use of refrigeration allowed for a vast amount of new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States.  New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural such as states in the south and in the west.  Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail carts lead to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the tomato industry. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes.  Without refrigeration this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as 400 miles.  Dairy products were not as easily transported great distances like fruits and vegetables due to greater perishability.   Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay transportation cost and still undersell their eastern competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact.|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=[Princeton]|isbn=0804616213|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.&lt;ref name="Schimd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schimd|first=A.|title=The Economics of Population Settlement: Cost of Alternative Growth Patterns|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/Extension/ncrcrd/NCRCRD-rrd172-print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the galactic city===
"Edge city" was a term coined by [[Joel Garreau]], whereas the term "galactic city" was coined by [[Lewis Mumford]]. These terms refer to a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district in what had previously been a residential or rural area.  There were several factors contributing to the growth of these cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix.  The factors that contributed to these large cities include reliable automobiles, highway systems, refrigeration, and agricultural production increases. Large cities such as the ones mentioned above have not been uncommon in history but what separates these cities from the rest are that these cities are not along some natural channel of transport, or at some crossroad of two or more channels such as a trail, harbor, mountain, river, or valley.  These large cities have been developed in areas that only a few hundred years ago would have been uninhabitable. Without a cost efficient way of cooling air and transporting water and food great distances these large cities would have never developed.  The rapid growth of these cities was influenced by refrigeration and an agricultural productivity increase, allowing more distant farms to effectively feed the population.&lt;ref name="Schimd"/&gt;

==Impact on agriculture and food production==
Agriculture’s role in developed countries has drastically changed in the last century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from a small portion of the existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigeration’s use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.

===Demographics===
The introduction of refrigeration and evolution of additional technologies drastically changed agriculture in the United States. During the beginning of the 20th century, farming was a common occupation and lifestyle for United States citizens, as most farmers actually lived on their farm. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States and a population of 127 million. Yet, while the United States population has continued to climb, citizens pursuing agriculture continue to decline. Based on the 2007 US Census, less than one percent of a population of 310 million people claim farming as an occupation today. However, the increasing population has led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which is met through a greater variety of crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved technology. Improved technology has decreased the risk and time involved if agricultural management and allows larger farms to increase their output per person to meet society’s demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demographics|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/demographics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meat packing and trade===
Prior to 1882, the [[South Island]] of New Zealand had been experimenting with sowing grass and crossbreeding sheep, which immediately gave their farmers economic potential in the exportation of meat. In 1882, the first successful shipment of sheep carcasses was sent from [[Port Chalmers]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand to [[London]]. By the 1890s, the frozen meat trade became increasingly more profitable in New Zealand, especially in [[Canterbury]], where 50% of exported sheep carcasses came from in 1900. It wasn’t long before Canterbury meat was known for the highest quality, creating a demand for New Zealand meat around the world. In order to meet this new demand, the farmers improved their feed so sheep could be ready for the slaughter in only seven months. This new method of shipping led to an economic boom in New Zealand by the mid 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peden|first=R.|title=Farming in the Economy-Refrigeration and Sheep Farming|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/farming-in-the-economy/page-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Meat Inspection Act of 1891 was put in place in the United States because local butchers felt the refrigerated railcar system was unwholesome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libecap|title=The Rise of the Chicago Meat Packers and the Origins of Meat Inspection and Antitrust|journal=Economic Inquiry 30|pages=242–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When meat packing began to take off, consumers became nervous about the quality of the meat for consumption. [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' brought negative attention to the meat packing industry, by drawing to light unsanitary working conditions and processing of diseased animals. The book caught the attention of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Federal Meat Inspection Act|the 1906 Meat Inspection Act]] was put into place as an amendment to the Meat Inspection Act of 1891. This new act focused on the quality of the meat and environment it is processed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Gary M. Walton, Hugh|title=History of the American Economy|year=2010|publisher=South-Western/Cengage Learning|location=Mason, Ohio|isbn=0324786611|pages=336–368|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electricity in rural areas===
In the early 1930s, 90 percent of the urban population of the United States [[electrification|had electric power]], in comparison to only 10 percent of rural homes. At the time, power companies did not feel that extending power to rural areas ([[rural electrification]]) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.

While electricity dramatically improved working conditions on farms, it also had a large impact on the safety of food production. Refrigeration systems were introduced to the farming and [[food distribution]] processes, which helped in food preservation and [[food safety|kept food supplies safe]]. Refrigeration also allowed for production of perishable commodities, which could then be shipped throughout the United States. As a result, the United States farmers quickly became the most productive in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|periodical=Rural Cooperatives|last=Campbell|first=D.|title=When the Lights Came On|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-aug00.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424031515/http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-aug00.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-24|date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entire new [[food systems]] arose.

===Farm use===
In order to reduce humidity levels and spoiling due to bacterial growth, refrigeration is used for meat, produce, and dairy processing in farming today. Refrigeration systems are used the heaviest in the warmer months for farming produce, which must be cooled as soon as possible in order to meet quality standards and increase the shelf life. Meanwhile, dairy farms refrigerate milk year round to avoid spoiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beard|first=R.|title=Energy-Efficient Refrigeration for Farms|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/28568/energy-efficient-refrigeration-for-farms#UqOhOPRDtld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on lifestyle and diet==
In the late 19th Century and into the very early 20th Century, except for staple foods (sugar, rice, and beans) that needed no refrigeration, the available foods were affected heavily by the seasons and what could be grown locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelpflug|first=E|title=The Food Industry and the Part That Refrigeration Plays in It|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=6|issue=4|pages=37–39|doi=10.2469/faj.v6.n4.37}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Refrigeration has removed these limitations. Refrigeration played a large part in the feasibility and then popularity of the modern supermarket.  Fruits and vegetables out of season, or grown in distant locations, are now available at relatively low prices.  Refrigerators have led to a huge increase in meat and dairy products as a portion of overall supermarket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelpflug|first=E.|title=Effect of Modern Refrigeration on the Modern Supermarket|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=10|issue=5|pages=63–64|doi=10.2469/faj.v10.n5.63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as changing the goods purchased at the market, the ability to store these foods for extended periods of time has led to an increase in leisure time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Prior to the advent of the household refrigerator, people would have to shop on a daily basis for the supplies needed for their meals.

===Impact on nutrition===
The introduction of refrigeration allowed for the hygienic handling and storage of perishables, and as such, promoted output growth, consumption, and the availability of nutrition. The change in our method of food preservation moved us away from salts to a more manageable sodium level.  The ability to move and store perishables such as meat and dairy led to a 1.7% increase in dairy consumption and overall protein intake by 1.25% annually in the US after the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=L. |author2=Goodwin B. |author3=Grennes T.|title=The Effect of Mechanical Refrigeration on Nutrition in the United States|journal=Social Science History|volume=28|issue=2|pages=325–336|doi=10.1215/01455532-28-2-325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People were not only consuming these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% of the increase in adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger. Recent studies have also shown a negative relationship between the number of refrigerators in a household and the rate of gastric cancer mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=B. |author2=Shin A. |author3=Yoo, K.|title=Ecological Study for Refrigerator Use, Salt, Vegetable, and Fruit Intakes, and Gastric Cancer|journal=Cancer Causes &amp; Control|volume=22|issue=11|pages=1497–1502|doi=10.1007/s10552-011-9823-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current applications of refrigeration==
Probably the most widely used current applications of refrigeration are for [[air conditioning]] of private homes and public buildings, and refrigerating foodstuffs in homes, restaurants and large storage warehouses. The use of [[refrigerator]]s in kitchens for storing fruits and vegetables has allowed adding fresh salads to the modern diet year round, and storing fish and meats safely for long periods.
Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is {{convert|3|to|5|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090213114520/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bloom/actions/fridgefreezertips.shtml Keep your fridge-freezer clean and ice-free]. ''BBC''. 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In commerce and manufacturing, there are many uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquify gases - [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[propane]] and [[methane]], for example. In compressed air purification, it is used to [[condensation|condense]] water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, and [[petrochemical]] plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in [[alkylation]] of [[butene]]s and [[butane]] to produce a high [[octane rating|octane]] gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.

Dairy products are constantly in need of refrigeration, and it was only discovered in the past few decades that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival at the grocery store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.

One of the most influential uses of refrigeration was in the development of the [[sushi]]/[[sashimi]] industry in Japan. Before the discovery of refrigeration, many sushi connoisseurs were at risk of contracting diseases.  The dangers of unrefrigerated sashimi were not brought to light for decades due to the lack of research and healthcare distribution across rural Japan. Around mid-century, the [[Zojirushi]] corporation, based in Kyoto, made breakthroughs in refrigerator designs, making refrigerators cheaper and more accessible for restaurant proprietors and the general public.

== Methods of refrigeration ==
Methods of refrigeration can be classified as ''non-cyclic'', ''cyclic'', ''thermoelectric'' and ''magnetic''.

=== Non-cyclic refrigeration ===
{{Expand section|date = December 2015}}
This refrigeration method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating [[dry ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.brighthubengineering.com/hvac/20353-methods-of-refrigeration-ice-refrigeration-and-dry-ice-refrigeration/
| title = Methods of Refrigeration: Ice Refrigeration, Dry Ice Refrigeration

| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the simplest example of this is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a [[Ice cream maker#Hand Cranked machines|traditional ice-cream maker]]). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below freezing.

=== Cyclic refrigeration ===
{{Main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
This consists of a refrigeration cycle, where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink with the help of external work, and its inverse, the [[thermodynamic power cycle]]. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

A ''refrigeration cycle'' describes the changes that take place in the refrigerant as it alternately absorbs and rejects heat as it circulates through a [[refrigerator]].  It is also applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [[HVACR]] work, when describing the "process" of refrigerant flow through an HVACR unit, whether it is a packaged or split system.

Heat naturally flows from hot to cold. [[mechanical work|Work]] is applied to cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. [[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and [[energy]] needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 as a [[Carnot heat engine|heat engine]].

The most common types of refrigeration systems use the reverse-Rankine [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, although [[absorption heat pump]]s are used in a minority of applications.

Cyclic refrigeration can be classified as:
# Vapor cycle, and
# Gas cycle

Vapor cycle refrigeration can further be classified as:
#[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]
#[[Absorption refrigerator|Vapor-absorption refrigeration]]

==== Vapor-compression cycle ====
{{see also|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|Vapor-compression refrigeration}}
The vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and [[Industrial refrigerator|industrial refrigeration]] systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [[File:Refrigeration.png|frame|right|Figure 1: Vapor compression refrigeration]] The [[thermodynamics]] of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf The Ideal Vapor-Compression Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226113352/http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[Freon]] enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant [[entropy]] and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the [[vapor pressure]] at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the [[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing [[flash evaporation]] and auto-refrigeration of, typically, less than half of the liquid. [[File:RefrigerationTS.png|frame|right|Figure 2: Temperature–Entropy diagram]] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.

The above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight [[thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamic irreversibility]] during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or [[ideal gas|non-ideal gas]] behavior, if any.

More information about the design and performance of vapor-compression refrigeration systems is available in the classic ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H.  |author2=Green, D.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}} (see pages 12-27 through 12-38)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vapor absorption cycle ====
{{Main|Absorption refrigerator}}
In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used.  After the development of the vapor compression cycle, the vapor absorption cycle lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Today, the vapor absorption cycle is used mainly where fuel for heating is available but electricity is not, such as in [[recreational vehicles]] that carry [[liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]].  It is also used in industrial environments where plentiful waste heat overcomes its inefficiency.

The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).

==== Gas cycle ====
When the [[Working fluids|working fluid]] is a gas that is compressed and expanded but doesn't change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a ''gas cycle''.  [[Air]] is most often this working fluid.  As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas [[heat exchanger]]s in gas cycles.

The gas cycle is less efficient than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse [[Brayton cycle]] instead of the reverse [[Rankine cycle]].  As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas refrigeration cycle needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.

Because of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, ''air cycle'' coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices.  However, the [[air cycle machine]] is very common on [[gas turbine]]-powered jet [[aircraft]] as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections.  Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.

=== Thermoelectric refrigeration ===
[[Thermoelectric cooling]] uses the [[Peltier effect]] to create a heat [[flux]] between the junction of two types of material. This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers and for cooling electronic components and small instruments.

===Magnetic refrigeration===
{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}
Magnetic refrigeration, or [[adiabatic demagnetization]], is a cooling technology based on the magnetocaloric effect, an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] property of magnetic solids. The refrigerant is often a [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[salt]], such as [[cerium]] [[magnesium]] [[nitrate]]. The active [[magnetic field|magnetic]] [[dipole]]s in this case are those of the [[electron shell]]s of the paramagnetic atoms.

A strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered [[entropy]]. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.

Because few materials exhibit the needed properties at room temperature, applications have so far been limited to [[cryogenics]] and research.

===Other methods===
Other methods of refrigeration include the [[air cycle machine]] used in aircraft; the [[vortex tube]] used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and [[thermoacoustic refrigeration]] using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; [[steam jet cooling]] popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many [[Stirling cycle]] heat engines can be run backwards to act as a refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in [[cryogenics]]. In addition there are other types of [[cryocoolers]] such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, [[Pulse tube refrigerator|pulse-tube refrigerators]] and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, [[dilution refrigerator]]s.

===Elastocaloric Refrigeration===
Another potential solid-state refrigeration technique and a relatively new area of study comes from a special property of [[Pseudoelasticity|super elastic]] materials. These materials undergo a temperature change when experiencing an applied mechanical [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] (called the elastocaloric effect). Since super elastic materials deform reversibly at high [[Strain (mechanics)|strains]], the material experiences a flattened [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] region in its [[stress-strain curve]] caused by a resulting phase transformation from an [[austenite|austenitic]] to a [[martensite|martensitic]] crystal phase.

When a super elastic material experiences a stress in the austenitic phase, it undergoes an [[exothermic]] [[phase transition|phase transformation]] to the martensitic phase, which causes the material to heat up. Removing the stress reverses the process, restores the material to its austenitic phase, and [[Endothermic process|absorbs heat]] from the surroundings cooling down the material.

The most appealing part of this research is how potentially energy efficient and environmentally friendly this cooling technology is. The different materials used, commonly [[shape-memory alloy]]s, provide a non-toxic source of emission free refrigeration. The most commonly studied materials studied are shape-memory alloys, like [[nitinol]] and Cu-Zn-Al. Nitinol is of the more promising alloys with output heat at about 66 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a temperature change of about 16-20 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tušek|first1=J.|last2=Engelbrecht|first2=K.|last3=Mikkelsen|first3=L. P.|last4=Pryds|first4=N.|title=Elastocaloric effect of Ni-Ti wire for application in a cooling device|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=February 2015|volume=117|issue=12|doi=10.1063/1.4913878|accessdate=|bibcode=2015JAP...117l4901T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulty in manufacturing some of the shape memory alloys, alternative materials like [[natural rubber]] have been studied. Even though rubber may not give off as much heat per volume (12 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ) as the shape memory alloys, it still generates a comparable temperature change of about 12 K and operates at a suitable temperature range, low stresses, and low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Zhongjian|last2=Sebald|first2=Gael|last3=Guyomar|first3=Daniel|title=Temperature dependence of the elastocaloric effect in natural rubber|journal=Physics Letters A|date=21 February 2017|volume=381|issue=25-26|pages=2112–2116|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2017.02.014|accessdate=|arxiv=1604.02686|bibcode=2017PhLA..381.2112X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenge however comes from potential energy losses in the form of [[hysteresis]], often associated with this process. Since most of these losses comes from incompatibilities between the two phases, proper alloy tuning is necessary to reduce losses and increase reversibility and [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]]. Balancing the transformation strain of the material with the energy losses enables a large elastocaloric effect to occur and potentially a new alternative for refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Benfeng|last2=Liu|first2=Jian|title=Elastocaloric effect and superelastic stability in Ni–Mn–In–Co polycrystalline Heusler alloys: hysteresis and strain-rate effects|journal=Scientific Reports|date=18 May 2017|volume=7|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-02300-3|accessdate=|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.2084L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fridge Gate===
The Fridge Gate method is a theoretical application of using a single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates on the fact that there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Passive Systems===

MIT researchers have devised a new way of providing cooling on a hot sunny day, using inexpensive materials and requiring no fossil fuel-generated power. The passive system, which could be used to supplement other cooling systems to preserve food and medications in hot, off-grid locations, is essentially a high-tech version of a parasol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A new way to provide cooling without power |url=http://news.mit.edu/2018/device-provides-cooling-without-power-1128 |website=MIT News |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacity ratings ==
The measured capacity of refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of [[power (physics)|power]]. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For commercial and industrial refrigeration systems, the '''kilowatt''' (kW) is the basic unit of refrigeration{{and}}except in North America, where the '''[[ton of refrigeration]]''' (TR) is used. (Nominally the capacity to freeze one [[short ton]] of water per day, the TR is defined as 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517&amp;nbsp;kW).)

A refrigeration system's '''coefficient of performance''' (CoP) is very important in determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use '''performance factor''' (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It is important to note that both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">[[Image:Serial cable (blue).jpg|thumb|Serial cables are typically used for [[RS-232]] communication.]]
A '''serial cable''' is a [[electrical cable|cable]] used to transfer information between two devices using a [[serial communication]] protocol. The form of connectors depends on the particular [[serial port]] used. A cable wired for connecting two [[data terminal equipment|DTE]]s directly is known as a [[null modem]] cable.

==Maximum cable lengths==
The maximum working length of a cable varies depending on the characteristics of the transmitters and receivers, the [[baud rate]] on the cable, and the [[capacitance]] and [[electrical impedance]] of the cable. The [[RS-232]] standard states that a compliant port must provide defined signal characteristics for a capacitive load of {{val|2500}} pF. This does not correspond to a fixed length of cable since varying cables have different characteristics. Empirically tested combinations of bit rate, serial ports, cable type, and lengths may provide reliable communications, but generally RS-232-compatible ports are intended to be connected by, at the most, a few tens of metres of cable. Other serial communications standards are better adapted to drive hundreds or thousands of metres of cable.

This cable has short transmission distance because of noise limiting the transmission of high numbers of bits per second when the cable is more than 15{{nbsp}}[[Metre|m]] long. This means that the transmitting and receiving lines are referenced to ground. It is cheap to purchase and is simple to join and connect. It is suitable for unbalanced circuits. Each end of the cable can be connected to only one device.

[[File:Rüttelpult.jpg|thumb|upright|Champagne bottles in racks in underground cellars]]

'''Sparkling wine''' is a [[wine]] (usually white) that becomes [[carbonation|carbonated]], either through [[fermentation]] or by addition of [[carbon dioxide]]. The oldest known production of sparkling wine took place in 1531 with the ''ancestral method''. [[Champagne]] is the most well-known variant, but there are other variations such as Italian [[Prosecco]] and [[Spumante]], Spanish [[Cava (Spanish wine)|Cava]], French  [[Crémant]] and German [[Sekt]].

Overall, more or less dry white wines are most common among the sparkling wines, but sparkling rosé and red wines are also produced, as well as wines of varying sweetness.

==Pressure and terminology==
In popular parlance and also in the title of this article the term ''sparkling'' is used for all wines that produce bubbles at the surface after opening. Under EU law the term ''sparkling'' has a special meaning that does not include all wines that produce bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stylegourmet.com/wine/wlang001.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621080241/http://www.stylegourmet.com/wine/wlang001.htm |title=Wine Language - The Many Degrees of Fizz |author=Elliot Essman |publisher=Style Gourmet |archive-date=2016-06-21 |access-date=2016-06-21 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason the terms ''fizzy'' and ''effervescent'' are sometimes used to include all bubbly wines.

The following terms are increasingly used to designate different bottle pressures:&lt;ref name="efferv_index"/&gt;
* ''Beady'' is a wine with less than 1 additional [[Bar (unit)|bar]] of pressure.
* ''Semi-sparkling'' is a wine with 1 to 2.5 additional [[Bar (unit)|bars]] of pressure. ''Semi-sparkling'' wines include wines labelled as [[Frizzante]], [[Spritzig]], [[Pétillant]] and [[Pearl (wine)|Pearl]].
* ''Sparkling'' is a wine with above 3 additional [[Bar (unit)|bars]] of pressure. This is the only wine that can be labelled as ''sparkling'' under EU law. ''Sparkling'' wines include wines labelled as [[Champagne]], [[Cava (Spanish wine)|Cava]], [[Mousseux]], [[Crémant]], [[Espumoso]], [[Sekt]] and [[Spumante]].

==Production methods==
[[Fermentation]] of sugar into [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during winemaking always means that carbon dioxide is released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the main constituent of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In Champagne production, the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called ''[[cuvée]]''. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead [[yeast]] cells form a precipitate called ''lees'', that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.

The main methods used to make sparkling wines are often given as seven, with some variations.&lt;ref name="efferv_index"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/index.en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215232702/http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/index.en.html|title=A Sparkling Success World-Wide: An Example to Reflect On|publisher=Effervescents du Monde|archive-date=2016-02-15 |access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; What or which production methods that give the best wines is not a moot point, but there is some consensus that the first four methods, where the second fermentation occurs in the bottle, are usually preferable to the latter three. The following table shows the main features of each method. The methods are then described in the text. It should be noted that within each method there may be variations from one producer to another.

===Traditional method===
{{main article|Traditional method}}
[[File:Moët&amp;Chandon press house.jpg|thumb| 150px | The larger Champagne producers have a number of press houses situated throughout the region, such as this [[Moët &amp; Chandon]] facility.]][[File: Gyropalette Machine.jpg | thumbnail | 150px | Today [[Gyropalette]]s usually replace hand power for ''riddling'' in the traditional method.]]
The so-called classic way (though not the oldest) to produce sparkling wine is popularly known as the ''Champagne method'' or ''méthode classique'' which is the official [[EU]] designation. Formerly, the designation was ''méthode champenoise'' but this designation is no longer permitted, as it involves a certain amount of renomée [[passing off]]. {{efn |The term ''"méthode champenoise"'' or "Champagne method" was outlawed for all wines other than Champagne (which for obvious reasons does not bother to utilize it) in Europe in 1994, replaced with "traditional method". On labels it may be referred to as ''"méthode traditionnelle"'', ''"méthode classique"'', "traditional method", "classic method", or the ambiguous term "bottle fermented".}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jancis Robinson|title=Oxford Companion to Wine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|edition=Second|isbn=019866236X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the former designation suggests, the method is used for the production of most Champagne, and it is slightly more expensive than the Charmat method. Champagne in bottles of 375 ml, 750 ml and 1.5 liters must be produced with the traditional method, but smaller and larger bottles are usually produced with the ''transfer method''.&lt;ref name="champagne411"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.champagne411.com/champagne/sparkling-wine-production.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154828/http://www.champagne411.com/champagne/sparkling-wine-production.html |publisher=Champagne411 |title=Sparkling Wine Production Methods |archive-date=2016-05-29 |access-date=2016-05-29 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wine is fermented once in the barrel and then undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle after the addition of yeast, nutrients for the yeast, and sugar (known as ''[[tirage]]''). The second fermentation results in a natural sparkling wine. Yeast precipitate (lees) must then be removed. This begins with ''riddling'' (''remuage'' in French) which means that the bottles are turned with the neck downwards and lightly shaken to move the lees to the neck of the bottle. This is done in small steps where the bottle orientation gradually changes. Finally the inverted bottle necks are cooled so that the precipitation freezes to a small block of ice, the bottles are turned upright and the temporary closure (normally a [[crown cap]]) is opened so that the precipitate is pushed out by the pressure in the bottle. Then the bottle is filled to replace the missing volume, and fitted with a plain Champagne cork and halter. The process to remove lees is called ''disgorging''.

Historically the various stages were performed manually but the whole process is now automated for most wines. In connection with the filling of the missing volume, it is common to add a certain amount of sugar dissolved in wine to give the sparkling wine a smoother taste. Sugar addition is called ''dosage'' and the added liquid ''liqueur d'expedition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_champ.en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310104003/http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_champ.en.html|title=Méthode Champenoise or Traditional Method|publisher=Effervescents du Monde|archive-date=2014-03-10|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the wine is stored on the lees&amp;nbsp;– ''sur lie''&amp;nbsp;– under carbon dioxide pressure for a long time before disgorging takes place, to get a more mature character. The requirement for non-vintage Champagne is at least 15 months of storage on the lees, and for vintage Champagne at least three years.

The traditional method is used for Champagne, all European wines with the designation ''Crémant'', ''Cava'', better varieties of ''Sekt'' and other sparkling wines that have names such as ''méthode classique'' or ''fermented in this bottle'' on the label (note, however, that the unusual ''ancestral'' and ''dioise'' methods also ferment the wine exclusively in the bottle).

===Ancestral method===
[[File: Bugey_Cerdon_sparkling_rose.JPG | thumbnail|150px | Bugey Cerdon produced with the ancestral method]]
The ancestral method ({{lang-fr|méthode ancestrale}}) goes under many local names in the various French regions, such as "rurale", "artisanale" and "gaillacoise". This is by far the oldest method of making sparkling wine and preceded the ''traditional method'' by almost 200 years, or possibly even more. The wine that is now called [[Limoux wine|Blanquette de Limoux]] is considered by wine historians to be the world's first sparkling wine, and was produced in [[Limoux]] in 1531 by monks in the monastery of [[Saint-Hilaire, Aude|Saint-Hilaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Ed|last2=Ewing-Mulligan|first2=M.|title=French Wine for Dummies|page=222|publisher=Wiley Publishing|year=2001|ISBN=0-7645 -5354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_ancestrale.en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125140431/http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_ancestrale.en.html|title=Method Ancestral - Sparkling Wines Produced by Spontaneous Fermentation|publisher=Effervescents du Monde|archive-date=2013-11-25 |access-date=2016-05-29 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wines produced using the ancestral method include among others French wines from [[Gaillac]], [[Bugey wine|Bugey Cerdon]] and [[Blanquette de Limoux]], German wines from a few vineyards where the method is usually called ''méthode rural'', and North American wines.

Wines made with the ancestral method are sometimes called ''pétillant-naturel'', popularly ''pét-nat''. Since French wine labels ban the word ''natural'' the [[appellation]] from [[Montlouis-sur-Loire]] is instead called ''pétillant originel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://punchdrink.com/articles/what-is-pet-nat-really/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529084620/http://punchdrink.com/articles/what-is-pet-nat-really/ |title=What Is "Pét-Nat," Really? |publisher=Punch |author=Zachary Sussman |date=26 May 2015 |archive-date=2016-05-29 |access-date=2016-05-29 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcoholic fermentation is not completely finished when the wine is bottled. It follows that the carbon dioxide is produced by the fermenting yeasts, and where malolactic fermentation has not yet taken place. Unlike the ''traditional method'' there is no ''disgorging'' and ''dosage'', but the wine is normally filtered. To accomplish this the bottles are emptied, then cleaned and refilled.

The method generally produces wines that are highly aromatic with low alcohol content, sometimes as low as 6%. The wines are sometimes somewhat obscure from remaining lees. They taste best 1–3 years after bottling and do not develop with further storage. In general, the wines are slightly sweet but ''brut'' (dry) varieties are also produced. The method's main weakness is that the production process is difficult to control and therefore requires great skill by the winemaker. The produced volumes are very modest. High-quality wines produced with the ancestral method, often by small growers using [[Organic farming|organic farming principles]], can be complex and very distinctive. They are mainly used as [[aperitif]]s or [[dessert wine]] with fruit dishes.

===Transfer method===
The transfer method follows the first steps of the traditional method in that after primary fermentation the cuvée is transferred to bottles to complete secondary fermentation, which allows for additional complexity. When the secondary fermentation is complete and the wine has spent the desired amount of time in bottle on yeast lees (six months is the requirement to label a wine 'bottle fermented') then the individual bottles are transferred (hence the name) into a larger tank. The wine is then filtered, ''liqueur de dosage'' added, and then filled back into new bottles for sale. This method allows for complexity to be built into the wine, but also gives scope for blending options after the wine has gone into bottle and reduces the bottle-to-bottle variations that can be hard to control in the traditional method.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 657-660"&gt;{{cite book|editor=J. Robinson|title=The Oxford Companion to Wine|edition=Third|pages=657–660|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''transversage method'' is often used as a synonym to transfer method, but is actually a slight twist to the latter. In the transfer method proper, the wine is transferred to a tank directly after ageing on lees, while in the transversage method, the wine is riddled and disgorged before transfer to a tank. Consequently the transversage method doesn't need additional clarification before bottling.

The transfer method gives better results than the ''charmat'' method, particularly in terms of bubble size and durability. Sparkling wines from [[New Zealand wine|New Zealand]] and [[Australia wine|Australia]] often use the transfer method. The method is used for sparkling wine sold in unusually small or unusually large bottles.&lt;ref name="champagne411"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_trans.en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125140441/http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_trans.en.html|title=Method Transfer|publisher=Effervescents du Monde|archive-date=2013-11-25|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wineguide.virginwines.co.uk/sparkling-wine/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524092114/http://wineguide.virginwines.co.uk/sparkling-wine/ |publisher=Wine Guide by Virgin Wines |title=Sparkling Wine |archive-date=2016-05-24 |access-date=2016-05-24 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dioise method===
This method is used for [[Clairette de Die AOC]] where the method is officially designated as the ''original dioise process''. In contrast to the ''ancestral method'' the yeast production is controlled by cooling. The dioise method is used in among others [[Die, Drôme|the Drôme valley]] in France, as well as for [[Asti Spumante]] produced in [[Canelli]] in [[Piedmont|the Piedmont region]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ujvr.fr/eng/aoc_wine_clairette_de_die.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145538/http://www.ujvr.fr/eng/aoc_wine_clairette_de_die.html|title=Our Clairette de Die Tradition AOC "Cuvée Chambéran"|publisher=Union des Jeunes viticulteurs Récoltants|archive-date=2007-10-12|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_dioise.en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125143430/http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_dioise.en.html|title=Method Dioise / Asti Spumante|publisher=Effervescents du Monde|archive-date=2013-11-25|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charmat method===
[[File:Méthode Charmat.JPG|thumb|150 px|Label detail of a French sparkling wine made using the Charmat process]]
Charmat ({{lang-it|Metodo Martinotti}}) was developed and patented in 1895 by the Italian Federico Martinotti (1860–1924).&lt;ref&gt;Patent CH-10711 granted 12 July 1895: ''Installation pour la fabrication continue des vins mousseux''&lt;/ref&gt; The method was further developed with a new patent by the inventor Eugène Charmat in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Patent GB-7734 granted 7 April 1908, with French priority 17 April 1907: ''Process for Decanting Sparkling Wines''&lt;/ref&gt; The method is now named after the latter, but is also called ''cuve close'', ''metodo Italiano'' or ''the tank method''. The wine is mixed in a stainless steel pressure tank, together with sugar and yeast. When the sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, the yeast is filtered and removed, and the wine is bottled. The duration of fermentation affects the quality; longer fermentation preserves the wine's aromas better and gives finer and more durable bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_CuveClose.en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125140426/http://www.effervescents-du-monde.com/pages/80_efferv/meth_CuveClose.en.html|title=Method Closed Tank|publisher=Effervescents du Monde|archive-date=2013-11-25|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This production method is widely used in the U.S., in Italy, especially in [[Province of Asti|the Asti province]], and in [[Prosecco]] wines, and in Germany to produce cheap variants of [[Sekt]].  Charmat method sparkling wines can be produced at a considerably lower cost than traditional method wines.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 657-660"/&gt;

===Continuous method===
The continuous method is also called the ''Russian method''. The secondary fermentation takes place in steel tanks with special rings, or with added oak chips.

==Wine faults==
Several [[wine fault]]s can occur in sparkling wine production. Some that were present in early production methods include ''yeux de [[crapaud]]s'' (toad's eyes) which was a condition of big, viscous bubbles that resulted from the wine spending too much time in wooden casks. Another fault could occur when the wine is exposed to bacteria or direct sunlight, leaving the wine with murky colouring and an oily texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. &amp; P.

The '''Spy gondola''', '''Spy basket''', '''Observation car''' or '''sub-cloud car''' ({{lang-de|Spähgondel}} or {{lang|de|Spähkorb}}) was a byproduct of ''Peilgondel'' development (a gondola to weight an airship's radio-locating antenna). They were used almost entirely by the Germans in the [[World War I|First World War]] on their military [[airship]]s. The spy basket could be lowered from above through the cloud deck several hundred metres,&lt;ref&gt;Captain [[Ernst A. Lehmann]]'s book&lt;/ref&gt; in order to inconspicuously observe the ground and to help navigate the airship.

==Development==
The ''Peilgondel'' was developed by [[Paul Jaray]] to act as a heavy [[plumbbob]] for an airship's radio antenna. A free-hanging antenna wire would move and flex in the wind hindering communications; the added weight reduced this movement. Jaray then developed the ''Peilgondel'' further into a manned spy gondola.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=a) Nothing found about antenna. b) Nothing found about spy basket, Lehmann not mentioned him.}}

== Use ==
[[File:USS Macon spy basket 1934.jpg|thumb|right|An aeroplane photographed this spy basket in operation hanging from the American [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|USS Macon]] in 1934-09-27.]]Spy baskets were used on, among others, [[Schütte-Lanz]] and [[Zeppelin]] airships. {{As of|1937}}, it was not always certain which airships used them: the blueprints for [[List of Zeppelins#LZ62|LZ 62]] (L 30) and [[List of Zeppelins#LZ72|LZ 72]] (L 31) included the spy basket operating plant but the German Navy was no longer installing them at that time; however a fish-shaped spy basket can be seen on photographs of the German Army [[List of Zeppelins#LZ83|LZ 83]] (tactical number LZ 113).&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[[#Horn|Horn, Andreas]]&lt;/ref&gt;After the war the Americans briefly experimented with a spy basket on the {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/ac-usn22/z-types/zrs5-o.htm USS Macon (ZRS-5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zeppelin spy basket development and use ==
Captain [[Ernst A. Lehmann]], the German airship captain, described in his book ''The Zeppelins'' how he and [[Baron Gemmingen]], [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin|Count Zeppelin]]'s nephew, had developed the device. To test the prototype he blindfolded the helmsman of the airship and allowed himself to be lowered by a winch from the bombroom in a modified cask, equipped with a telephone. Hanging some {{convert|500|ft|order=flip}} below the airship using a compass he could tell the helmsman which bearing to take and effectively drive the airship.&lt;ref name=Lehmann&gt;[[#Lehmann|Lehmann, The Zeppelins]]&lt;/ref&gt; He later recounted how, while returning from the aborted raid on London in March 1916&lt;ref name="Syon104"&gt;[[#Syon|Syon 2001 page 104]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[List of Zeppelins#LZ26|Z 12]], Baron Gemmingen insisted on being the first to use it on their secondary target, Calais. The basket was equipped with a wicker chair, chart table, electric lamp, compass, telephone,&lt;ref name="Syon104"/&gt; and lightning conductor. With the Zeppelin sometimes within, sometimes above the clouds and unable to see the ground, Gemmingen in the hanging basket would relay orders on navigation and when and which bombs to drop. The Calais defenders could hear the engines but their searchlights and artillery fire did not reach the airship.&lt;ref name=Lehmann/&gt;

LZ26's basket was lowered from the airship on a specially constructed tether {{convert|1000|m|ft}} long;&lt;ref name="Lehmann"/&gt; other airships may have used one approximately {{convert|750|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="Syon104"/&gt; The tether was high grade steel with a brass core insulated with rubber to act as the telephone cable.&lt;ref name="Lehmann"/&gt;

Despite Gemmingen reporting a feeling of loneliness while being lowered and losing sight of the airship, crewmen would nevertheless volunteer for this duty because it was the one place they could smoke.&lt;ref name="Syon104"/&gt;

==Surviving examples==
[[File:IWMzeppelinspybasket.JPG|thumb|right|A spy basket preserved at the [[Imperial War Museum]], which fell from the [[List of Zeppelins#LZ60|LZ 90]] on 2 to 3 September 1916.&lt;ref name=iwm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30000193 |title=Zeppelin Observation Car ('Cloud Car') |work=Collection Search |author=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Imperial War Museum]] in London exhibits a Zeppelin observation car that was found near [[Colchester]] after the Zeppelin air raid on the night of the September 2-3, 1916. It is believed to have been carried by the [[List of Zeppelins#LZ90|LZ 90]] and was being deployed unmanned when the winch accidentally ran out of control. It was found along with 1500 metres of cable. The winch was jettisoned near [[Bury St. Edmunds]].&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt; 

==In fiction==
The spy basket's use is dramatized in the 1930 film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]''. In the long running British comic [[Charley's War]], a ruthless German airship commander orders the jettisoning of his ship's
cloud car (with the observer still in it) in order to save weight when his airship comes under attack.

[[Image:Stump-jump plough.jpg|thumb|Plan of the original single-furrow plough]]The '''stump-jump plough''' is a kind of [[plough]] invented in [[South Australia]] in the late 19th century by [[Richard Bowyer Smith]] to solve the particular problem of preparing [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] lands for cultivation.

==The problem==

[[Mallee (biogeographic region)|Mallee]] scrub originally covered large parts of southern Australia, and when farmers moved into these areas they found it peculiarly difficult to clear the land. After the trees were cut down, the roots energetically produced regrowth. These young shoots and the old roots could be killed by repeated burning (see below), but the large roots remained in the ground, making it impossible to plough the soil. Grubbing the roots out was a slow and labour-intensive activity, and the problem was seriously hindering agricultural expansion.

In South Australia, land was being offered under the ''Scrub Act'' of 1866 to farmers on lease, with the option of purchasing after 21 years at the price of £1 per acre. However, grubbing the scrublands was proving costly, at approximately £2 per acre, and solutions to the problem were desperately sought.

==Solutions==

The situation had grown to be so frustrating by 1878 that the South Australian government offered a reward of £200 to anyone who could develop an effective mechanical stump puller; although myriad devices were developed, none proved to be a breakthrough success. Many of these machines were trialled in contests near [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] in the same year, but none were as effective as three skilled axemen.

Pending the development of an effective machine, a technique known as '''mullenizing''' (after a farmer from [[Wasleys, South Australia|Wasleys]] named Charles Mullens) became popular as a means of clearing the scrub. Mullenizing involved dragging a heavy roller over roughly cleared ground to crush young shoots; the field was then burnt, and a spiked log was run over the ground, and a crop of wheat sown. The next season, the stubble and any mallee regrowth was again burnt, and eventually the mallee died, though stumps remained underground.

==Breakthrough==

In 1876 a special plough was invented by agricultural machinery apprentice [[Richard Bowyer Smith]], and later developed and perfected by his brother, [[Clarence Herbert Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/agriculture/jump_plough.html 100 Years of Australian Innovation - stump-jump plough]&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Yorke Peninsula]] (where the problem was particularly acute). The plough consisted of any number of hinged [[Ploughshare|shares]]: when the blade encountered an underground obstacle like a mallee stump, it would rise out of the ground. Attached weights forced the blade back into the ground after the root was passed, allowing as much of the ground to be furrowed as possible. Although a little unorthodox, the plough in action appearing "like a ship in a storm",&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Meinig, ''On the Margins of the Good Earth'', Rigby, 1962, 106&lt;/ref&gt; it proved remarkably effective, and was dubbed the "stump-jump" plough.

The invention was hailed as a "complete revolution"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'',105&lt;/ref&gt; and, in combination with the process of mullenizing, was adopted almost universally across the mallee lands, even proving as useful in stony ground as it was in mallee country. There is a plough on display in [[Ardrossan, South Australia|Ardrossan]], with a [[Historic Engineering Marker]] plaque attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/heritage/smiths-stump-jump-plough-1876 |title=Smith's Stump-Jump Plough, 1876- |accessdate=14 June 2016 |publisher=[[Engineers Australia]] |work=Engineering Heritage Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another successful stump jump plough was invented in 1877 by James Winchester Stott (1830-1907) who was a very prolific inventor in [[Alma, South Australia|Alma]] in the mid North of South Australia. Not only did he invent a stump jump plough he also invented a cultivator, slasher, scarifier and double furrow plough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Winchester Stott |url=http://stottfamily.id.au/rootspersona-tree-2/james-winchester-stott-2/ |website=The Stott Family|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stott and [[Mellor Brothers]], who had refined Stott's design, were jointly the first to patent a stump-jumping plough in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47537293 |title=Stump Jumping Plough |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=17 February 1934 |accessdate=2 October 2017 |page=22 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A working model of the R.B. Smith Double Furrow Plow is held by the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.  It is very finely crafted and was made in 1883 by Albert Arnold, then a young Journeyman blacksmith. His family moved to Dowlingville (near Ardrossan) on the Yorke Peninsula in 1876 &lt;7&gt; to take up land. He and his father John, also a blacksmith, made numerous modifications over several years and participated in local ploughing competitions.  Albert moved to Sydney in 1882 and endeavoured to have his new employer manufacture the plow, hence the model. Albert left considerable family papers including diagrams and photos of his work.  Eventually the model and another 25 models and NSWGR inventions were given to the then Technological Museum and are available to viewers on request.

[[File:Thompson-and-his-gun.jpg|thumb|General [[John T. Thompson]] holding a [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921]]]]
A '''submachine gun''' ('''SMG''') is a [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]-fed, [[automatic firearm|automatic]] [[carbine]] designed to fire [[pistol]] [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]]. The term "submachine gun" was coined by [[John T. Thompson]], the inventor of the [[Thompson submachine gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The%20Thompson%20submachine%20gun:%20shooting%20a%2020th%20century%20icon.-a0172907495|title=The Thompson submachine gun: shooting a 20th century icon. - Free Online Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The submachine gun was developed during [[World War I]] (1914–1918). At its zenith during [[World War II]] (1939–1945), millions of SMGs were made. After the war, new SMG designs appeared frequently.&lt;ref name="Century. Ian Hogg 2000. p93"&gt;Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century. Ian Hogg &amp; John Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. p93&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1980s, SMG usage decreased.&lt;ref name="Century. Ian Hogg 2000. p93"/&gt; Today, submachine guns have been largely replaced by [[assault rifles]],&lt;ref name="Century. Ian Hogg 2000. p93"/&gt; which have a greater effective range and are capable of penetrating the [[Combat helmet|helmet]]s and [[Personal armor|body armor]] used by modern [[infantry]].&lt;ref name="defensereview.com"&gt;David Crane (December 11, 2011). [http://www.defensereview.com/submachine-guns-smgs-outpaced-by-today%E2%80%99s-modern-short-barreled-rifles-sbrssub-carbines-or-still-a-viable-tool-for-close-quarters-battleclose-quarters-combat-cqbcqc/ Submachine Guns (SMG’s): Outpaced by Today’s Modern Short-Barreled Rifles (SBR’s)/Sub-Carbines, or Still a Viable Tool for Close Quarters Battle/Close Quarters Combat (CQB/CQC)?] Defense Review.&lt;/ref&gt; However, submachine guns are still used by [[special forces|military special forces]] and [[SWAT|police SWAT teams]] for close quarters battle (CQB) because they are "a pistol-caliber weapon that's easy to control, and less likely to over-penetrate the target."&lt;ref name="defensereview.com"/&gt;

==History==

[[File:Arty08.jpg|thumb|Artillery [[Luger pistol|Luger P08 pistol]] with snail-drum magazine and removable stock.]]

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], the Austrians introduced the world's first [[machine pistol]] the '''[[Steyr M1912|Steyr Repetierpistole M1912/P16]].''' The Germans also experimented with machine pistols by converting [[pistol]]s such as the '''[[Mauser C96]]''' and '''[[Luger Pistol|Luger P-08]]''' from [[Semi-automatic firearm|semiautomatic]] to fully automatic operation and adding detachable stocks. Carbine-type automatic weapons firing pistol rounds were developed during the latter stages of World War I by Italy, [[German Empire|Germany]] and the United States. Their improved firepower and portability offered an advantage in [[trench warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Britannica Guide to Inventions That Changed the Modern World |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Curley |year=2009 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |edition=First |isbn=1-61530-064-3 |pages=291–292 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtN-Ek2qjIMC&amp;pg=PA291}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beretta M1918.jpg|thumb|left|Beretta Model 1918]]

In 1915, the Italians introduced the '''[[Villar-Perosa aircraft machine gun]]'''. It fired pistol-caliber [[9mm Glisenti]] ammunition, but was not a true submachine gun, as it was originally designed as a mounted weapon. This odd design was then modified into the '''[[OVP 1918]]''' carbine-type submachine gun, which then evolved into the [[9×19mm Parabellum]] '''[[Beretta 1918|Beretta Model 1918]]''' after the end of World War I. Both the OVP 1918 and the Beretta 1918 had a traditional wooden stock, a 25-round top-fed [[box magazine]], and had a cyclic [[rate of fire]] of 900 rounds per minute.

[[File:Bergmann MP18.1.JPG|thumb|The [[MP 18|Bergmann MP 18]] was the world's first practical submachine gun]]
The Germans initially used heavier versions of the [[Luger pistol|P08]] [[pistol]] equipped with a detachable stock, larger-capacity snail-[[drum magazine]] and a longer [[Gun barrel|barrel]]. By 1918, Bergmann Waffenfabrik had developed the 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum '''[[MP 18]]''', the first practical submachine gun. This weapon used the same 32-round snail-drum magazine as the Luger P-08. The MP 18 was used in significant numbers by German [[stormtrooper]]s employing [[infiltration tactics]], achieving some notable successes in the final year of the war. However, these were not enough to prevent Germany's collapse in [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November 1918]]. After World War I, the MP 18 would evolve into the MP28/II SMG, 
which incorporated a simple 32-round box magazine, a semi &amp; full auto selector, and other minor improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. pages 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campbell Thompson.jpg|thumb|left|Thompson M1921 SMG with 100-round drum magazine]]
The [[.45 ACP]] '''[[Thompson submachine gun]]''' had been in development at approximately the same time as the Bergmann and the Beretta. However, the war ended before prototypes could be shipped to Europe.&lt;ref name="Frank Iannamico 1928"&gt;Frank Iannamico, ''American Thunder: The Military Thompson Submachine Gun 1928, 1928A1, M1, M1A1'', Moose Lake Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had missed its chance to be the first purpose-designed submachine gun to enter service, it became the basis for later weapons and had the longest active service life of the three.

In the [[interwar period]] the "Tommy Gun" or "Chicago Typewriter" became notorious in the U.S. as a gangster's weapon; the image of pinstripe-suited [[James Cagney]] types wielding drum-magazine Thompsons caused some military planners to shun the weapon. However, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and other U.S. police forces themselves showed no reluctance to use and prominently display these weapons. Eventually, the submachine gun was gradually accepted by many military organizations, especially as World War II loomed, with many countries developing their own designs.

[[File:Beretta 38.jpg|thumb|[[Beretta Model 38]]]]

===World War II===
The Italians were among the first to develop submachine guns during World War I. However, they were slow to produce them during World War II. The 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum '''[[Beretta Model 38|Beretta Model 1938]]''' was not available in large numbers until 1943. The 38 was made in a successive series of improved and simplified models all sharing the same basic layout. The Beretta has two triggers, the front for semi-auto and rear for full-auto. Most models use standard wooden stocks, although some models were fitted with an MP&amp;nbsp;40-style under-folding stock and are commonly mistaken for the German SMG. The 38 series was extremely robust and proved very popular with both [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied troops]] (who used captured Berettas).&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press, (1948), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the most successful and effective Italian small arm of World War II. The 38 series is the longest serving of the world's SMGs, as later models can still be seen in the hands of Italian military and police forces.

In 1939, the Germans introduced the 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum '''[[MP38]]''' during the [[invasion of Poland]]. However, the MP38 production was still just starting and only a few thousand were in service at the time. It proved to be far more practical and effective in close quarters combat than the standard-issue German [[Kar 98K]] bolt-action rifle. From it, the nearly identical '''[[MP40]]''' (commonly and erroneously referred to as '''Schmeisser''') was developed and made in large numbers; about a million were made during [[World War II]]. The MP40 was lighter than the MP38. It also used more stamped parts, making it faster and cheaper to produce.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 118-120"&gt;Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. pages 118–120&lt;/ref&gt; The MP38 and MP40 were the first SMGs to use plastic furniture and a practical folding stock.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 118-120"/&gt; They would set the fashion for all future SMG designs.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 118-120"/&gt;

[[File:Suomi M31 Torpin Tykit 2.JPG|thumb|[[Suomi KP/-31|Suomi M31]] submachine with 70-round drum magazine attached, 20- and 50-round box magazines.]]
During the [[Winter War]], the badly outnumbered Finnish used the '''[[Suomi KP/-31]]''' in large numbers against the Russians with devastating effect.&lt;ref name="world.guns.ru"&gt;armies.http://world.guns.ru/smg/fi/suomi-m31-e.html&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish ski troops became known for appearing out of the woods on one side of a road, raking Soviet columns with SMG fire and disappearing back into the woods on the other side. During the [[Continuation War]], the Finnish [[Sissi (Finnish light infantry)|Sissi patrols]] would often equip every soldier with KP/-31s. The Suomi fired 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum ammo from a 71-round drum magazine (although often loaded with 74 rounds). "This SMG showed to the world the importance of the submachine gun to the modern warfare",&lt;ref name="world.guns.ru"/&gt; prompting the development, adoption and [[mass production]] of submachine guns by most of the World's armies. The Suomi was used in combat until the end of the [[Lapland war]], was widely exported&lt;ref name="world.guns.ru"/&gt; and remained in service to the late 1970s.

[[File:PPSh-41 from soviet.jpg|thumb|left|[[PPSh-41]] with 71-round drum magazine]]
In 1940, the Russians introduced the [[7.62×25mm Tokarev|7.62×25mm]] '''[[PPD-40]]''' and later the more easily manufactured '''[[PPSh-41]]''' in response to their experience during the Winter War against Finland. The PPSh's 71-round drum magazine is a copy of the Suomi's. Later in the war they developed the even more readily mass-produced '''[[PPS submachine gun]]'''. The USSR would go on to make over 6 million PPSh-41s and 2 million PPSs by the end of World War II. Thus, the Soviet Union could field huge numbers of submachine guns against the Wehrmacht, with whole infantry battalions being armed with little else. Even in the hands of conscripted soldiers with minimal training, the volume of fire produced by massed submachine guns could be overwhelming.

[[File:Sten Mk II IMG 4764 (Nemo5576).jpg|thumb|[[Sten|STEN MK II]]]]
In 1941, Britain adopted the 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum '''[[Lanchester submachine gun]]'''. Following the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], and with no time for the usual research and development for a new weapon, it was decided to make a direct copy of the German [[MP 18#Evolution|MP 28]]. However this gun, the Lanchester, proved to be difficult and expensive to manufacture. Shortly thereafter, the simpler '''[[Sten|STEN]]''' submachine gun was developed, which was much cheaper and faster to make. Over 4 million STEN Guns were made during World War II. The STEN was so cheap and easy to make that Germany started manufacturing their own copy (the '''[[MP 3008]]''') towards the end of World War II. After the war, the British replaced the STEN with the '''[[Sterling submachine gun]]'''. Britain also used many M1928 Thompson submachine guns during World War II.

[[File:M3 and M1A1 Wings Over Wine Country 2007.JPG|thumb|left|[[M3 submachine gun|M3]] "Grease Gun" top and [[Thompson submachine gun|M1A1]] "Tommy Gun" bottom]]
The United States and its allies used the Thompson submachine gun, especially the simplified '''[[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1]]'''. However, the Thompson was still expensive and slow to produce. Therefore, the U.S. developed the '''[[M3 submachine gun]]''' or "Grease Gun" in 1942, followed by the improved M3A1 in 1944. While the M3 was no more effective than the Tommy Gun, it was made primarily of stamped parts and welded together, and so, it could be produced much faster and at fraction of the cost of a Thompson. It could be configured to fire either [[.45 ACP]] or [[9mm Luger]] ammunition. The M3A1 was among the longest serving submachine guns designs, being produced into the 1960s and serving in US forces into the 1990s.

[[File:CompletedOwenGun1942.png|thumb|The Owen Gun, which was known officially as the Owen Machine Carbine]]
The '''[[Owen Gun]]''' is a 9mm Parabellum Australian submachine gun designed by Evelyn Owen in 1939. The Owen is a simple, highly reliable, open bolt, blowback SMG. It was designed to be fired either from the shoulder or the hip. It's easily recognisable, owing to its unconventional appearance, including a quick-release barrel and butt-stock, double pistol grips, top-mounted magazine, and unusual offset right-side mounted sights. The Owen was the only entirely Australian-designed and constructed service submachine gun of World War II and was used by the Australian Army from 1943 until the mid-1960s, when it was replaced by the '''[[F1 submachine gun]]'''. Only about 45,000 Owens were produced during the war for a unit cost of about A$30.

===After World War II===
After World War II, "new submachine gun designs appeared almost every week to replace the admittedly rough and ready designs which had appeared during the war. Some (the better ones) survived, most rarely got past the glossy brochure stage."&lt;ref&gt;Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. pages 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these survivors were cheaper, easier and faster to make than their predecessors. As such, they were widely distributed.

[[File:US soldier with Carl Gustav SMG.jpg|US soldier with Carl Gustav SMG|thumb|U.S. Army Swedish K SMG: Soldier firing an m/45B SMG during special weapons training.]]
In 1945, Sweden introduced the 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum '''[[Carl Gustav M/45]]''' with a design borrowing from and improving on many design elements of earlier submachine-gun designs. It has a tubular stamped steel receiver with a side folding stock. The M/45 was widely exported, and especially popular with CIA operatives and U.S. Special Forces during the Vietnam War. In U.S. service it was known as the "Swedish-K". In 1966, the Swedish government blocked the sale of firearms to the United States because it opposed the [[Vietnam War]]. As a result, in the following year [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] began to manufacture an M/45 clone called the '''[[Smith &amp; Wesson M76|M76]]'''.

In 1946, Denmark introduced the Madsen M-46, and in 1950, an improved model the '''[[Madsen M-50]]'''. These 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum stamped steel SMGs featured a unique clamshell type design, a side folding stock and a grip-safety on the magazine housing. The Madsen was widely exported and especially popular in Latin America, with variants made by several countries.

[[File:Samopal Vz 25.JPG|thumb|left|Czechoslovak [[Sa vz. 23|Sa vz. 25]]]]
In 1948, [[Czechoslovakia]] introduced the '''[[Sa vz. 23]]''' series. This 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum SMG introduced several innovations: a [[progressive trigger]] for selecting between semi-automatic and full auto fire, a [[telescoping bolt]] that extends forward wrapping around the barrel and a vertical handgrip housing the magazine and trigger mechanism. The vz. 23 series was widely exported and especially popular in Africa and the Middle East with variants made by several countries. The vz. 23 inspired the development of the '''[[Uzi submachine gun]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Ian V. (1979). Guns and How They Work. New York: Everest House. p. 157. {{ISBN|0-89696-023-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MP IMG 1690.JPG|thumb|[[MAT-49]] on display]]
In 1949, France introduced the '''[[MAT-49]]''' to replace the hodgepodge of French, American, British, German and Italian SMGs in French service after World War II. The 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum MAT-49 is an inexpensive stamped steel SMG with a telescoping wire stock, a pronounced folding magazine housing and a grip safety. This "wildebeast like design" proved to be an extremely reliable and effective SMG, and was used by the French well into the 1980s. It was also widely exported to Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

[[File:Uzi of the israeli armed forces.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Uzi|UZI]]]]

===1950s===
In 1954, Israel introduced a 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine gun called the '''[[Uzi]]''' (after its designer [[Uziel Gal]]). The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a [[telescoping bolt]] design with the magazine housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon. The Uzi has become the most popular submachine gun in the world, with over 10 million units sold,&lt;ref name="mcmanners2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ultimate Special Forces |last= McManners |first= Hugh |year= 2003 |publisher=DK Publishing |location=New York |isbn= 0-7894-9973-8 |page=157 |oclc=53221575 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more

[[File:M12S Beretta.jpg|thumb|[[Beretta M12|Beretta M12S]]]]
In 1959, Beretta introduced the '''[[Beretta M12|Model 12]]'''. This 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum submachine gun was a complete break with previous Beretta designs.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 138-139"&gt;Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. pages 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small, compact, very well made SMG and among the first to use telescoping bolt design.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 138-139"/&gt; The M12 was designed for mass production and was made largely of stamped steel and welded together.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 138-139"/&gt; It is identified by its tubular shape receiver, double pistol grips, a side folding stock and the magazine housed in front of the trigger guard. The M12 uses the same magazines as the Model 38 series.

[[File:Hkmp5count-terr-wiki.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]]]

===1960s===
In the 1960s, [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] developed the 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum '''[[MP5]]''' submachine gun. The MP5 is based on the [[G3 rifle]] and uses the same [[closed-bolt]] [[roller-delayed blowback]] operation system. This makes the MP5 more accurate than [[open-bolt]] SMGs, such as the UZI. The MP5 is also one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world,&lt;ref name="hogg2002"&gt;Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''.

[[File:Steyr-MP-69.jpg|thumb|Steyr MPi69]]
In 1969, [[Steyr]] introduced the '''[[MPi 69]]'''. This 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum open-bolt, blowback-operated SMG has telescoping bolt and is similar in appearance to the Uzi SMG.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 97-98"&gt;Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. pages 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has a vertical pistol-grip into which the magazine is inserted, a longer horizontal front grip area and a telescoping wire butt-stock. The receiver is a squared stamped steel tube which partly nestles inside a large plastic molding (resembling a lower receiver) which contains the forward hand-grip, vertical pistol-grip and the [[fire control group]]. Making the MPi 69 one of the first firearms to use a plastic construction in this way. It has a progressive trigger and is also unusual among modern SMGs, as the MPi 69 is cocked by a dual-purpose lever also used as the front sling attachment point.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. pages 97-98"/&gt;

[[File:MAC10.jpg|thumb|left|Ingram MAC 10 with suppressor. Note: the magazine is missing]]

===1970s===
In the 1970s, extremely compact submachine guns, such as the [[.45ACP]] '''[[Mac-10]]''' and [[.380 ACP]] '''[[Mac-11]]''', were developed to be used with [[suppressor|silencers or suppressors]].&lt;ref name="Century 2000. page 166"&gt;Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. page 166&lt;/ref&gt; While these SMGs received enormous publicity, and were prominently displayed in films and television, they were not widely adopted by military or police forces.&lt;ref name="Century 2000. page 166"/&gt; These smaller weapons led other manufacturers to develop their own compact SMGs, such as the '''[[Micro-UZI]]''' and the H&amp;K '''[[MP5K]]'''.

===1980s===
[[File:Ejercito Argentino.jpg|thumb|Argentine soldier armed with [[Colt 9mm SMG]] which is virtually identical to the M16 rifle.]]
By the 1980s, the demand for new submachine guns was very low and could be easily met by existing makers with existing designs.&lt;ref name="Century. Ian Hogg 2000. p93"/&gt; However, following H&amp;Ks lead, other manufacturers began designing submachine guns based on their existing [[assault rifle]] patterns. These new SMGs offered a high degree of parts commonality with parent weapons, thereby easing logistical concerns.

In 1987, [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] introduced the '''[[Colt 9mm SMG]]''' based on the [[M16 rifle]].&lt;ref name="coltsmg0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colt.com/mil/SMG.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030518122948/http://www.colt.com/mil/SMG.asp |archivedate=2003-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colt SMG is a closed bolt, [[blowback (arms)|blowback]] operated SMG and the overall aesthetics are identical to most M16 type rifles. The magazine well is modified using a special adapter to allow the use of smaller 9mm magazines. The magazines themselves are a copy of the Israeli [[UZI]] SMG magazine, modified to fit the Colt and lock the bolt back after the last shot. The Colt is widely used by U.S. police forces and the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]].&lt;ref&gt;Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century. Ian Hogg &amp; John Weeks.

===2010s===
By 2010, [[Assault rifle#Compact assault rifles|compact assault rifles]] and [[personal defense weapon]]s had replaced submachine guns in most roles.&lt;ref name="Century. Ian Hogg 2000. p93"/&gt; Factors such as the increasing use of [[Ballistic vest|body armor]] and logistical concerns have combined to limit the appeal of submachine guns. However, SMGs are still used by police (especially [[SWAT]] teams) for dealing with heavily armed suspects and by military [[special forces]] units for close quarters combat, due to their reduced size, recoil and muzzle blast. Submachine guns also lend themselves to the use of [[suppressor]]s, particularly when loaded with [[subsonic ammunition]]. Variants of the '''[[Sterling submachine gun|Sterling]]''' and Heckler &amp; Koch '''[[MP5]]''' have been manufactured with integral suppressors.

[[File:H&amp;K MP7.jpg|thumb|An [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP7|MP7A1]] with a 20-round magazine, and a reflex sight]]
Developed during the late 1980s, the [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) is touted as a further evolution of the submachine gun. The PDW was created in response to a [[NATO]] request for a replacement for [[9×19mm Parabellum]] submachine guns. The PDW is a compact automatic weapon that can defeat enemy body armor and which can be used conveniently by non-combatant and support troops, and as a [[close quarters battle]] weapon for [[special forces]] and [[counter-terrorist]] groups.&lt;ref name="miller2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oliver2007"/&gt;

Introduced in 2001, the '''[[Heckler &amp; Koch MP7]]''' is a direct rival to the FN P90. It is a more conventional-looking design.

'''Tactile signing''' is a common means of communication used by people with both a [[Visual impairment|sight]] and [[hearing impairment]] (see [[Deafblindness]]), which is based on a [[sign language]] or other system of [[manual communication]].

"Tactile signing" refers to the mode or medium i.e. signing (using some form of signed language or code) using ''touch''. It does not indicate whether the signer is using a tactile form of a natural language e.g. [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) a modified form of such a visual sign language, a modified form of a manual code for English [[Manually Coded English]] or something else. It has also been referred to as "hand over hand" referring to the position of the listener vis. the signer.

== Kinds ==
Several methods of [[Deafblind]] communication may be referred to as tactile signing, including:
* '''Hand-over-hand''' (also known as 'hands-on signing'): The receiver’s hand(s) are placed lightly upon the back of the hands of the signer to read the signs through touch and movement. The sign language used in hand-over-hand signing is often a slightly modified version of the local [[Sign Language]]; this is especially the case when used by people who have learned to read sign visually before losing their vision as with [[Usher syndrome]]. The sign language used may also be a manually coded version of the local oral language (such as [[Signed English]]), or a mid-way point between the two known as [[contact signing]].
* '''Tracking''': The listener lightly places their hand(s) on the wrists or forearms of the signer to help them track the signs visually (as the listener knows the location of their own hands and is thus able to focus on the signer's hand(s) as they move in space. The listener using 'tracking' typically has a [[tunnel vision|limited field of vision]]. 
* '''Tactile [[fingerspelling]]''' (a manual form of the alphabet) in which words are spelled out. See [[manual alphabet]]. Different manual alphabets may be used, such as the one-handed [[ASL alphabet]] or the [[two-handed manual alphabets]] used, for example, in Britain. Again, the listener places a hand over that of the signer. This alphabet is also rarely used in the United States.

== Adaptations ==

We all adapt to our imperfect body, using glasses, crutches and so on. Human beings also adapt to an environment, for example by modifying our diet to fit the local ecology. (See [[adaptation]].)
Until the 1970s it was rare for a person to be both deaf and blind and most people who were deaf and blind lived lives of isolation. As professionals became aware of this population attempts were made to serve both adults and children who are deaf and blind by modifying the manual alphabet mentioned above, or the Sign Language used by deaf-sighted people. See, for example [[Helen Keller National Center]], [[LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired]] and [[Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind]].

Professionals developed ways to communicate with their clients/students/patients who were deafblind. These are listed below.
* '''Lorm''': A hand-touch alphabet developed in the 19th century by Deafblind inventor and novelist [[Hieronymus Lorm]] and used in some countries in Europe.
* '''Tracing''' or 'print-on-palm': Tracing letters (or shapes) onto the palm or body of receiver. Capital letters produced in consistent ways are referred to as the 'block alphabet' or the 'spartan alphabet'.
* '''Braille signing''': Using six spots on the palm to represent the six dots of a [[braille]] cell. Alternatively, the signer may 'type' onto a table as if using a braille typewriter (see [[Perkins Brailler]]) and the receiver will place their hands on top. This method can have multiple receivers on top of each other, however a receiver sitting opposite will be reading the [[braille cell]] backwards.

Additionally, simple ways of responding such as a tap for 'yes' or a rubbing motion for 'no' may be included. In Japan, a system developed by a deafblind woman is in use to represent the five [[vowel]]s and five major [[consonant]]s of the [[Japanese language]] on the fingers, where the signer 'types' onto a table and the receiver places their hands on top to 'listen' (see [http://www.deaflibrary.org/deaf_blind.html this page] for more info).

What was especially challenging was communicating with children or babies born deaf and blind who had not had an opportunity to learn a natural (spoken or signed) language. Below are listed some of these attempts.
* '''Co-active signing''': The sender moves and manipulates the hands and arms of the Deafblind person to form sign shapes, or fingerspelt words. This is often used with deafblind children to teach them signs, and with people with an intellectual disability.
* '''On-body signing''': The body of the person who is deafblind is used to complete the sign formation with another person. E.g.: chin, palm, chest. Often used with people who also have an intellectual disability.

== Communities develop ==
As the decades progressed, deafblind people began to form communities where a tactile language is being born. Just as deaf people brought together in community first used an invented form of the spoken language and then created/evolved their own natural language that suits the life of a deaf-sighted person (i.e. a visual language) so too, deafblind people in community have first used a modified form of a visual language and are now creating/evolving their own natural tactile/tactual language. For the development of visual sign languages see for example: [[Deaf Education]]; [[List of sign languages]]; [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]].
One of the most active communities is in the Seattle area of Washington State. See Washington State DeafBlind Citizens [http://www.wsdbc.org].

==Vs. visual sign language==
Little data exists on the specifics of variation between visual and tactile sign language use. However, what studies there are suggest a significant degree of difference. In hand-over-hand signing, elements of deaf sign languages known as 'non-manual features' (such as facial expression) will not be received, and will need to be substituted with supplementary information produced manually. Common non-manual features used in Deaf Sign languages that are absent in tactile signing include raised eyebrows as a question marker and a shaking head as a negation.

Tactile signing is also contained within a smaller space than is typical in visual sign language. Signs that touch the body may be moved forward into a more neutral space.  Other signs which are usually produced in an 'out of range' location (such as the leg) may be modified (either spelled or a variant sign used).

Different rules govern turn taking, greetings and goodbyes.

==Interacting with deaf-blind people==
When interacting with deaf-blind people, a number of considerations can smooth the interaction.

Many deafblind people make the most of their remaining sight, so the right lighting is vital. Mostly bright, even light is best (avoid glare), but some prefer dim light, so it is best to ask.

Susie Morgan [http://www.deafblind.com/slmorgan.html suggests] the following guidelines for appearance and attire of interpreters working with deafblind clients:

Wear clothes that provide contrast for your hands. Consider the following when selecting clothing:
*Dark colors (black, navy blue, brown, dark green, etc.) for persons with light skin
*Light colors (off-white, tan, peach, etc.) for persons with dark skin
*Solid colored clothing (avoid stripes, polka dots, etc.)
*High necklines (no scoopnecks or low v-necks) Contrasting colors between skin tone and background walls can also help.

It is better to avoid jewelry which can be distracting, either tactually (e.g. rings and bracelets) or visually (e.g. sparkling drop earrings). Fingernails should also be short and smooth. A neutral color of nail polish may be worn, but bright reds and dark colors can be too strong. Working in close proximity to clients when using tactile sign, interpreters need to be aware of strong smells such as perfumes, cigarette smoke or onion breath.

Tactile signing can also be exhausting for both the interpreter and the deafblind client. Breaks are even more important than with regular interpreting, and should be taken more often. Correct seating can also reduce the risk of strain of injury; both communication partners should be comfortable and at an equal height. Specially designed cushioned tables for tactile signing can be employed.

==History==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
In 1648 in England, [[John Bulwer]] wrote of a couple who were proficient in tactile sign communication: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A pregnant example of the officious nature of the Touch in supplying the defect or temporall incapacity of the other senses we have in one Master Babington of Burntwood in the County of Essex, an ingenious gentleman, who through some sicknesse becoming deaf, doth notwithstanding feele words, and as if he had an eye in his finger, sees signes in the darke; whose Wife discourseth very perfectly with him by a strange way of Arthrologie or Alphabet contrived on the joynts of his Fingers; who taking him by the hand in the night, can so discourse with him very exactly; for he feeling the joynts which she toucheth for letters, by them collected into words, very readily conceives what shee would suggest unto him. By which examples [referring to this case and to that of an abbot who became deaf, dumb, and blind, who understood writing traced upon his naked arm] you may see how ready upon any invitation of Art, the Tact is, to supply the defect, and to officiate for any or all of the other senses, as being the most faithful sense to man, being both the Founder, and Vicar generall to all the rest."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Berlin-Moabit, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 C4925.jpg|thumb|300px|Target indicators falling over Berlin during a raid on the city]]
'''Target Indicators''', also known as '''target markers''' or '''TI's''' for short, were [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] used by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF's]] [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] during [[World War II]]. TI's were normally dropped by the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinders]] on the target, providing an easily seen visual aiming point for the following bombers to aim at. After their introduction, the use of TI's expanded to include en-route markers to gather up lost aircraft, additional drops of TI's to keep the target lit over long periods, and various changes in technique to address German defences.

The use of TI's allowed the RAF to concentrate its advanced navigational systems in the Pathfinder units. Most widely used were the [[H2S radar]] and [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] system, the former requiring considerable training to be useful, the latter able to guide only a single aircraft at a time. The limited number of navigational units meant that spreading them through the force would have limited effects. By concentrating these in a single Group and having them drop TI's, the accurate fixes could be used to guide the entire attack. The same basic system had been used by the [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[Kampfgruppe 100]] during [[The Blitz]], for similar reasons.

Target Indicators were available in various colours, and during a raid bomb aimers would be instructed by the Master Bomber to drop their bombs on the target indicators of a specified colour, marker aircraft carrying different colours should the initial target indicators be dropped off target. The first target indicators could be cancelled over the radio by the Master Bomber and the Marker crews instructed to drop new target indicators of a different colour, until the correct aiming point was correctly marked. The Main Force bombers would then be instructed by the Master Bomber to bomb the colour of the most accurate target indicators.

Target Indicators could be fuzed for both air and ground burst, the air burst markers - referred to as 'sky marking' by the RAF - resembling bunches of grapes or upside down fir trees when detonated in the air. These the Germans called 'Christmas trees' due to their shape.

Marking of targets was carried out by the following methods:

*Newhaven – target marking blind using [[H2S radar|H2S]] then with visual backup marking
*Parramatta – target marking by blind dropped ground markers - prefixed with 'Musical' when [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]]-guided 
*Wanganui – target marking by blind-dropped sky markers when ground concealed by cloud - prefixed with 'Musical' when Oboe-guided

The [[code word]]s were initially chosen by asking three Bomber Command personnel in the operations room where they came from. One was from [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], England, one from [[Parramatta]], New South Wales, and one from [[Whanganui|Wanganui]], New Zealand.

[[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] was usually carried by Pathfinder [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">'''The Kitchen Library''' was the first non-profit lending library of kitchen appliances in [[Canada]]. Since opening its doors inside the [[Toronto Tool Library]] in October 2013, The Kitchen Library has received local, national, and international media attention and community support. The Kitchen Library moved to Yonge and Eglinton (inside Living City Health) in October 2014 where they lend appliances and teach workshops.

As population increases and the average size of condos decrease, they believe that space and income shouldn't be barriers to cooking and healthy eating. By providing access to otherwise costly and space-consuming appliances they are building a more shareable city for the future.

==Plot==
[[File:They're Made Out of Meat.jpg|thumb|right|''They’re Made Out of Meat'' (2009) by [[Alexander S. Peak]], inspired by the story.]]
The two characters are [[intelligent]] beings capable of traveling [[faster than light]], on a mission to "contact, welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe." Bisson's stage directions represent them as "two lights moving like fireflies among the stars" on a [[projection screen]]. One of them tells the incredulous other about the recent discovery of [[carbon-based life|carbon-based]] lifeforms "made up entirely of meat". After conversing briefly about it, they both deem such beings and communication with them too bizarre and agree to "erase the records and forget the whole thing", marking the [[Solar System]] "unoccupied".&lt;ref name="tb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html |title=They're Made out of Meat |accessdate=2009-12-10 |first=Terry|last=Bisson |work=Terry Bisson SF Story Showcase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptations ==

===''They're Made out of Meat'' (2005)===
In 2005, Stephen O'Regan wrote and directed a live film adaptation starring [[Tom Noonan]] and [[Ben Bailey]]. The film was made as a final project for the [[New York Film Academy]]. The main action takes place inside of a diner full of teenagers. The music for the film was scored by [[Bob Reynolds (saxophonist)|Bob Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/bobreynolds/sets/theyre-made-out-of-meat&lt;/ref&gt;

===''They're Made out of Meat'' (2010)===
In 2010, Jeff Frumess and Trevor Scott wrote and directed their own iteration, adding the character of a homeless conspiracy theorist with an original score by musician Sam Belkin. The film was shot at the Hartsdale train platform on the Merto North in Westchester, NY.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== Music ==
In 2015, musical producer [[Jose Hoffman]] created a song based on the story.

[[File:Thomas Thorp in Algiers, May 1900.png|thumb|Thomas Thorp in Algiers, May 1900]]
'''Thomas Thorp''' (1850–1914) was an English manufacturer of scientific instruments credited with inventing the first practical coin-in-the-slot [[gas meter]], with innovations in the field of photography, including that involving colour, and for producing an early example of what has since been developed into the modern [[spectrohelioscope]]. He began his working life as an apprentice to a firm of architects and ended it as a [[Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society]], having had a keen interest in astronomy since childhood.

==Early life==
Thomas Thorp was born on 26 October 1850, the son of a farmer who worked land around Narrow Lane (now known as Victoria Avenue), [[Besses o' th' Barn]], [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]], Lancashire. He was educated first at the local Park Lane School and subsequently at [[Manchester Grammar School]], following which he was apprenticed to Maycock and Bell, a firm of architects and surveyors in Manchester. During his apprenticeship, he had a role in the [[town-planning]] of [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], which was then rising as a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Seaside resort|resort]] town. He had an interest in the practical application of scientific knowledge, as did his inventive father, and a consequence of this trait was an inclination towards [[Civil engineering|civil]] and mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251&gt;Royal Astronomical Society (1915), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt; Later in life Thorp was to be the appointed engineer for both the Local Board of Whitefield and also its [[Local government in the United Kingdom|District Council]].&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanitary Record (1891), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering==
As early as 1872, while still working for Maycock and Bell, he was sole patentee of a mechanism for [[Tap (valve)|tap valves]].&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette (1872).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he was jointly named with A. P. Bell, architect, on a patent application regarding improvements to the automation of [[gas lighting]],&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette (1875).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laxton (1877), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to design items for the gas industry thereafter. In 1880 he established a business for the manufacture of his designs, originally known as Thomas Thorp &amp; Co., with premises at Narrow Lane, Whitefield.&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1994), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant innovation was the design, patented in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Nasmith (1895), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; for the first practical mechanism that allowed gas to be dispensed by insertion of a [[penny]] into a meter, an early point-of-use prepayment system.&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt;{{#tag:ref|There had been previous successful patent applications for coin-in-the-slot metering by John Stewart Wallace and by Rowland William Brownhill (both in 1887) but neither mechanism proved to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;Nasmith (1895), pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Although frequently attributed as being his invention alone, the patent was jointly held with Thomas Gardiner Marsh.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The device was a major advance and, for example, the Manchester Institution of the Association of Gas Engineers and Manufacturers reported in 1898 that {{quote|The consumption of gas has been greatly increased by the introduction of coin meters among the working class, who previously had rarely burned gas, and who but for the introduction of this class of meter, never would have done so. To people of this class, a supply of gas by coin meters is a great boon, and much appreciated. It is very much safer than lighting by oil, which it is rapidly superseding; and the cost in most cases is less.&lt;ref name=AGEM1898pp59-60&gt;Assoc. Gas Engineers (1898), pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|A paper presented to the [[Manchester Association of Engineers]] noted disincentives regarding the use of gas included that consumption was billed quarterly, and thus gave the appearance of being a large sum, and that gas suppliers required customers to lodge a deposit that was refunded only when consumption ceased. Prepayment meters resolved these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Nasmith (1895), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}}}

Despite its practicality, the meter design of Thorp and Marsh was rapidly superseded and by 1894 J. Nasmith was reporting that it was "practically out of the running".&lt;ref&gt;Nasmith (1895), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edinburgh]]-based William Cowan and the Manchester business of Sawyer and Purves were among those who had been granted patents for improvements to the mechanism by that time.&lt;ref&gt;Nasmith (1895), pp. 190, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, Thorp and Marsh were among the many people experimenting with the possibilities of using [[acetylene]] gas as an alternate to [[coal gas]]. Acetylene&amp;nbsp;– produced by mixing [[calcium carbide]] and water&amp;nbsp;– was thought to produce a better quality of light but there were practical difficulties to overcome. They discovered that adding the carbide to the water was less dangerous than adding the water to the carbide, and they surmounted problems related to gradual "choking" of the burners when in use by mixing air with the product. They also invented a safety valve that they claimed cut off the burner outlet in the not unusual event that the supply to it was interrupted, thus preventing unlit gas from being emitted when the supply was restored. This valve was capable of use in both acetylene and coal gas installations.&lt;ref name=AGEM1898pp59-60 /&gt;

Thorp also invented the [[Gas meter#Rotary meters|rotary gas meter]] in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard (1908), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and, what his obituary describes as "a tiny device&amp;nbsp;... for economical regulation of gas delivery [that] has been very widely employed by manufacturers and public authorities."&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt; Other inventions included a push-tap for water and improvements to gas lamps and pneumatic tools.&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt;

Thorp retired from business at the age of 50 to devote more time to his scientific studies.&lt;ref name=GasAge1914p59 /&gt; An advertisement of 1906 shows Marsh as chairman of the Manchester-based Rotary Meter Company Ltd and director of a similarly named business in New York. The latter had bought the sole US and Canadian manufacturing rights for all products regarding which Thorp held or might in future hold US patents.&lt;ref&gt;American Gas Light Journal (1906), p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific instruments==
Thorp was a "scientific and mechanical genius".&lt;ref name=Duckworth1975 /&gt; In pursuit of his childhood interest in astronomy, he developed considerable skills in the manufacture of optical glass and both [[reflector telescope|reflector]] and [[refractor telescope]]s. He also created [[celluloid]] [[diffraction grating]] replicas, [[Polarization (waves)|polarising]] solar eyepieces and [[Solar prominence|prominence]] [[spectroscope]]s that were widely used, as well as [[Objective (optics)|objective]] [[prisms]].&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt; His high resolution&lt;ref&gt;Powerhouse.&lt;/ref&gt; diffracting grating replicas were significant advances of the ideas developed by [[Henry Augustus Rowland|Henry Rowland]], whilst his [[multi-slit spectroscope]] was the first to enable the showing of both celestial and terrestrial objects and has formed the basis for the present day spectrohelioscope.&lt;ref name=Duckworth1975&gt;Duckworth (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Father [[Aloysius Cortie]], of [[Stonyhurst College]], Lancashire, was one whom achieved good results from an example of the objective prisms. Eventually owning houses in Whitefield{{#tag:ref|Thorp's Whitefield house was called ''Moss Bank'', on Knowsley Street; and that in Prestatyn was ''The Uplands''.&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Observatory1902p114 /&gt; {{As of|2012}} both still exist.|group=note}} and also in [[Prestatyn]], [[North Wales]], he constructed observatories at each of these and favoured the {{convert|8|inch|mm}} [[T. Cooke &amp; Sons|Cooke]] [[equatorial telescope]] for his own observations. This device was fitted with a [[photo-visual objective]], a spectroscope and other attachments that enabled it to be used for photography.&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt;

Thorp's innovative design for celluloid diffraction grating replicas won him the [[Wilde Premium for Original Research]] in 1901, principally in recognition of his paper of 1899 entitled ''Grating Films and their application to Colour Photography''.&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (1902–1903), Awards of Medals &amp; Premiums, p. lxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also recognised by awards from other bodies, including international exhibitions.&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt; His diffraction gratings were particularly noted in an obituary, which said that they made {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the study of spectroscopic astrophysics possible to so many lovers of the science. In addition to putting these on the market at a moderate price, he was most lavish in his generous distribution of them to professional and amateur workers throughout the world.}} Prior to his developments, details of which he published but did not patent,&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt; interested people had to rely upon the photographic methods that had been proposed by [[Lord Rayleigh]] and Izarn&lt;!--Published two papers in Comptes rendus in 1893; which identify him only as M(onsieur). Izarn. I can find out nothing more about him.--&gt;. Thorp's "brilliant idea", announced in 1898 and improved thereafter through experimentation and the development of new materials, was to take "a cast of the ruled surface in a transparent medium [comprising] a thin solution of celluloid in amyl acetate."&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt; He described his method on numerous occasions, including in a letter published in the edition of 29 December 1905 of the ''[[British Journal of Photography]]'' (reproduced in ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'', 1906), He emphasised the need for a dust-free environment and a uniform drying of the solution as well as asserting that his was the "first method of producing optically useful replicas of gratings and one which after all has not in my opinion been superseded." By 1900 he was able to apply his developments to colour photography&lt;ref&gt;Thorp (1906), pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and he went on to demonstrate to the [[British Astronomical Association]] a method for projecting natural colours that used "three replicas adjusted to diffract the proper colour sensations to the eye".&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt;

[[File:Flash spectrum of total solar eclipse, Burgos, August 1905.png|thumb|Flash spectrum of total solar eclipse, Burgos, August 1905]]
His work with celluloid was not limited to investigation of its uses in astronomy. He reported in 1902 that he had demonstrated the explosive nature of the substance by substituting it for the [[cordite]] in a bullet and then firing that bullet through a {{convert|1|inch|mm}} thick piece of wood.&lt;ref&gt;Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (October 1902), p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although he used partial vacuums in his development of his diffraction gratings, he also investigated their use elsewhere as, for example, in his paper of 1903 entitled ''On the Production of Polished Metallic Surfaces having the Properties of Japanese "Magic" Mirrors''.&lt;ref&gt;Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (January 1902), Article 7 &amp; pp. xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MLP1903pxxii /&gt; These and numerous other contributions&amp;nbsp;– including experiments in soldering aluminium&lt;ref&gt;Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (November 1902), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of optics for [[gunsight]]s&lt;ref name=MLP1903pxxii&gt;Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (February 1903), p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– were reported to the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]], of which he had been elected a member on 21 January 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (1902), List of Ordinary Members, p. lxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as member of the Society's Council for all but one year between 1902 and 1912, was a vice-president for three years and was offered, but refused, a nomination to be president.&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt;

Thorp was a member of expeditions to view the [[Solar eclipse|total solar eclipses]] of [[Solar eclipse of May 28, 1900|1900]] and [[Solar eclipse of August 30, 1905|1905]], which visited [[Algiers]] and [[Burgos]], respectively.&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt; Examples of his inventions were used by various members of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Maunder (1901), pp. 62, 156–158, 160–161, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levander (1906), pp. 7, 13, 15, 40–41, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed by [[David G. Simpson]], Thorp was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 11 April 1902.&lt;ref name=Observatory1902p114&gt;The Observatory (1902), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a vice-president of the [[Manchester Astronomical Society]],&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii /&gt; of which he had been a member since 1892.&lt;ref name=Duckworth1975 /&gt;

==Death==
Thorp died at Prestatyn on 13 June 1914, leaving a widow and three sons, one of whom&amp;nbsp;– Franklin&amp;nbsp;– also had involvements in the gas industry.&lt;ref name=GasAge1914p59&gt;Gas Age (1914), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[All Saints' Church, Stand]], a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Guardian (1914), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He also left a partially developed scheme for the manufacture of a ruling machine that obviated the need for a [[screw drive]], being controlled instead by a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and [[micrometre valve]],&lt;ref name=RAS1915pp250-251 /&gt; and had been working on the design of a cinema screen. Thorp's Cooke telescope was given by the family to [[Stand Grammar School]]. One obituarist remarked on his "unassuming and genial manner to all with whom he came into contact, and his readiness to explain and to make suggestions on any subject in which his wide knowledge could be of any assistance."&lt;ref name=MLP1914pxlvii&gt;WHT in Manc. Lit. &amp; Phil. (1913–1914), Annual Report to the Council, pp. xlvii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The business that he founded, Thomas Thorp &amp; Co. Ltd, was finally liquidated in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette (1976), p. 9126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flammenfressermotor.JPG|thumb|Photo of a flame-licker engine]]
A '''vacuum engine''' (also called '''flame-licker engine, flame-engine, flame-dancer''') derives its force from [[air pressure]] against one side of the piston, which has a [[Vacuum|partial vacuum]] on the other side of it. At the beginning of an outstroke, a valve in the head of the cylinder opens and admits a charge of burning gas and air, which is trapped by the closing of the valve and expands. Towards the end of the stroke the charge comes into contact with a water- or air-cooled part of the cylinder and is chilled, causing a sudden drop in pressure sufficient to suck the piston – which is open towards the crank – back on the return stroke. The valve opens again in time for the piston to expel the burnt gases before the next outstroke begins.

==History==
{{main|History of the internal combustion engine}}
Some early [[gas engine]]s worked on the "vacuum" or "atmospheric" principle in a similar way to the [[Newcomen steam engine]].  A mixture of gas and air was drawn into the cylinder and ignited; the mixture expanded and part of it escaped through the exhaust valve; the valve then closed, the mixture cooled and contracted, and atmospheric pressure pushed the piston in. Such engines were very inefficient and were superseded by engines working on the [[Otto cycle]].

==Vacuum motor==
In a vacuum motor, the partial vacuum is created by an external pump. These motors were commonly used to power [[Turntable (rail)|railway turntables]] in the [[UK]], using vacuum created by a [[steam locomotive]]'s [[vacuum brake]] [[ejector]]. The operating principle is similar to a steam engine – in both cases power is extracted from a difference in pressure.{{efn-lr|The motor is similar to a steam engine, not identical, as steam engines operate from hot steam which also contains [[enthalpy]] in the form of heat.}} 

Small vacuum motors were also used to operate [[windscreen wiper]]s in [[automobile]]s. In this case, the motors were powered by [[manifold vacuum]]. This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the [[throttle]] were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers.  Modern automobiles still use a vacuum motor of a kind, however, the [[vacuum servo]].  Brakes are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver. Small vacuum motors were also used from the late 1960s to control [[servomechanism]]s such as door locks,{{efn-lr|Mercedes-Benz}} heater controls{{efn-lr|[[Lancia Beta Montecarlo]]}} or movable bonnet ventilation flaps.{{efn-lr|[[Dodge Charger]]}}

You could say that the global Industrial Revolution arose because of a 'vacuum motor', because all the early steam engines, especially the pioneering Boulton and Watt engines, operated with almost atmospheric pressure steam.  You can easily make a demonstration vacuum engine using a flywheel, simple plumbing parts and a few other simple components, as Neil A Downie shows in the reference.

A vacuum system can be used for power transmission, although the maximum power that can be transmitted to a vacuum motor is less than conventional pneumatics. There is an optimum pressure for the operation of a vacuum power transmission system, of around 0.4 bar (8 psig), as Downie also shows. Although less efficient than pneumatics, it can be perfectly workable. For example a 22 mm (7/8") pipe on vacuum can transmit as much power on 0.4 bar (8 psig) as a 6 mm (1/4") pipe on 8 bar (100 psig). The system is efficient enough that Boulton and Watt used vacuum power transmission in their factory.  They called the vacuum main in the factory the ‘spirit pipe’.

&lt;ref&gt;Smiles, Samuel, Lives of the Engineers, the Steam Engine, Boulton and Watt, London, John Murray (1878).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal Thermodynamic Process==
Unlike the ideal [[Otto cycle]] engine, the vacuum engine relies on a constant heat source provided by burning fuel. As mentioned above, a valve allows an intake of heat into the piston chamber. Estimating the heat in or Qin is constant in the controlled volume space, the [[ideal gas equation]] PV = nRT implies an increase in the pressure of the piston chamber. After the valve closes, the piston undergoes an adiabatic process during the downward stroke. Once the piston reaches the bottom of its stroke, the chamber is cooled either by the surrounding air or water, and the resulting Qout forces the pressure in the piston to decrease. The system then undergoes another adiabatic compression of the gas in the chamber, which is subsequently released by the valve at the top of the cylinder's stroke, while simultaneously allowing new heated gas to enter the chamber.

One of the major issues that this engine encountered while being developed was that the efficiency of this model was extremely poor in real applications. Because the heat source is not contained to a specific area, only a small portion of the potential fuel is being consumed to power the engine. Because [[Engine efficiency]] is defined by the relationship between the amount of work done and the potential energy in the fuel consumed, it can be seen that in the vacuum engine only a small amount of the burning fuel is being used to power the engine. The rest of the fuel energy is lost to the surrounding atmosphere.

'''Volume combustion synthesis''' (VCS) is method of [[chemical synthesis]] in which the [[reactant]]s are heated uniformly in a controlled manner until a reaction ignites throughout the volume of the reaction chamber.  The VCS mode is typically used for weakly exothermic reactions that require preheating prior to ignition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">A '''wallpaper steamer''' is an electrical device which [[boil]]s water continuously in order to produce [[steam]]. This steam is then allowed to pass through a narrow bore tube to a face plate. This face plate is then held against a wallpapered wall. The steam passes through the paper, saturates the backing paper and partially dissolves the desiccated [[wallpaper paste]]. This then allows the [[wallpaper]] to be pulled from, or scraped off the wall.&lt;ref name="FreePatents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0268479.html|title=Abstract of Patent|publisher=Free Patents Online|accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wallpaper steamer was invented by [[Peter Ravenscroft Wilkins]] from [[Blackwell, Worcestershire]], England. Its European patent was filed 19 November 1987.&lt;ref name="FreePatents" /&gt;

==Technology==
The basic form of a wallpaper steamer is a semi-sealed container, usually made of plastic, that contains a [[heating element]]. A quantity of water is added to the container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of pressure pipe. At the end of the pressure pipe is a flat plate about {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the pressure pipe and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, [[saturation (chemistry)|saturating]] it and [[Wetting|rehydrating]] the [[wallpaper paste]]. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.

Penetration of steam, especially with vinyl-coated wallpapers, may be accelerated by first perforating the surface of the wallpaper. A variety of spiked roller and spiked wheel hand tools are available for this.

During use, the operator's hands are close to the steam source and so protective, heat- and vapour-proof gloves, such as silicone oven gloves, may be helpful.

Wallpaper steamers have been more popular in countries, such as the UK or Europe, using 230V [[mains power|domestic electricity]]. This provides around 3kW of steam generating capacity from all sockets around the house.

== Other uses ==
A commercial wallpaper steamer is a conveniently packaged source of steam. This can be used for other purposes too, such as [[steam bending|steam-bending wood]].

'''Walter Ernst Fricke''' (1{{nbsp}}April 1915{{snd}}21{{nbsp}}March 1988) was a German distinguished professor of [[theoretical astronomy]] at the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web |bibcode=1990QJRAS..31..515W |title=Quarterly journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 31 no. 3| pages = 515–517 |last=Wielen |first=R. |last2=Lederle |first2=T. |publisher=SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) |date= September 1990 |website=articles.adsabs.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a mathematician and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] during the time of [[World War II]] in Inspectorate 7/VI from 1941-1942 (which would later become the [[General der Nachrichtenaufklärung]], then in 1942 posted to Inspectorate 7/IV, then later transferred to [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht|OKW/Chi]] Section IIb. His speciality was the production of codes and ciphers, and the security studies of Army systems. &lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; After the war he was director of the [[Astronomical Calculation Institute (Heidelberg University)|Astronomical Calculation Institute]] (German: ''Astronomisches Rechen-Institut'') in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]].

==Life==
Walter Fricke was born in Leimbach-Mansfeld near [[Merseburg]], [[Germany]]. His father was a carpenter who worked as a miner in the copper-schist mines at [[Mansfeld]]. Walter Fricke attended a high school Stephaneum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephaneum.de/index.php?id=91&amp;L=1 |title=Famous Stephaneer  |publisher=Europe Gymnasium Stephaneum Aschersleben |date=2013 |website=Offene Ganztagsschule Stephaneum - History and Famous Stephaneer |access-date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Aschersleben]] and passed the final examination (''Abitur'') in 1934. After high school, he enrolled as a student at [[Frederick William University]] in [[East Berlin]], studying [[astronomy]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. His teachers there included [[Paul ten Bruggencate]] and [[August Kopff]] in astronomy, [[Erhard Schmidt]] in mathematics and [[Max von Laue]] in physics.

In 1935, he published his first astronomy papers. These were critiques of [[Edwin Hubble]]'s studies made at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] on the distribution of [[Spiral galaxy|spiral nebulae]].&lt;ref Name="I20"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_oIJbGCCNYeMGUxNzk0NWQtNzNhZi00YWVjLWI1NmItMzc2YWZiZGNjNjQ5 |title=TICOM I-20 Interrogation of SonderFuehrer Dr Fricke of OKW/CHI |publisher=NSA |date=28 June 1945 |website=sites.google.com |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, while resident at the [[Göttingen Observatory]], he received his doctorate with a thesis titled ''Influence of a resisting agent in the dynamics of dense stellar systems'' (''Einfluß eines widerstehenden Mittels in der Dynamik dichter Sternsysteme''). He obtained a scholarship to [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] in [[Scotland]], which was arranged with the help of British theoretical [[Cosmology|cosmologist]] Dr [[George C. McVittie]],&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; which was due to start in 1 October 1939&lt;ref Name="I20" /&gt;{{rp|2}} but which had to be cancelled because of the start of [[World War II]] in September 1939. On 1 May 1940 he started work at [[Hamburg Observatory]], but later in that year was drafted into the Signal Corps (''Nachrichtentruppe''). On 15 May 1941 he was posted to [[Inspektorate 7]], the cipher bureau of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) high command]],&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; although as an astronomer he knew nothing about [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]]. Professor [[Otto Heckmann]], director of the Hamburg Observatory, tried to lure him back to continue working on problems specifically related to war work that he had been occupied with before he was drafted: tables of air and ship navigation, [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] problems for [[Airplane|aeroplanes]] traveling at speeds over 1300&amp;nbsp;km/hour as well as rockets flying at speeds of more than 3000&amp;nbsp;km/hour. These were purely solutions to [[differential equation]]s which were allocated to various institutions for solving.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt;

A minor planet discovered on 15 February 1941 by [[Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth]] in Heidelberg was named "1561 Fricke" in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/MPNames.html |title=International Astronomical Association Minor Planet Names |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |date=21 August 2016 |website=minorplanetcenter.net |access-date=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he was appointed the assistant astronomer at the [[Hamburg Observatory]] at [[Bergedorf]], but could only take the position up in 1946 due to conscription.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In 1943 Fricke married Marianne Fricke (''[[née]]'' Traute). They had a daughter, Maxi-Marianne Fricke. His wife Marianne died in 1987.

In 1951, he received his [[habilitation]] from [[University of Hamburg]]. In 1953, after receiving a [[fellow]]ship from the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Science Foundation]], he went to the [[United States]] for a year, working at the [[Yerkes Observatory|Yerkes]], [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mount Wilson]], [[Palomar Observatory|Palomar]] and [[Princeton University]] Observatories.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; After returning, he became a [[tenure]]d member (''Wissenschaftlicher Rat'') of the Hamburg Observatory. In December 1954, Dr Fricke was made the provisional director of the [[Astronomical Calculation Institute (Heidelberg University)|Astronomical Calculation Institute]] in Heidelberg. Heidelberg University appointed him an honorary professor in 1955 and a personal full professor in 1958. In 1961 he became a regular full professor of theoretical astronomy at Heidelberg.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Fricke served as president of the [[International Astronomical Union]] Commissions 4 (1958–1964) and 8 (1970–1973), and as vice president of the IAU from 1964 to 1967.&lt;ref name="Schmadel2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lutz D. Schmadel |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eHv1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date=11 November 2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn= 978-3-662-06615-7 |pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1983 he retired as professor emeritus. Dr. Drh.c.mult Fricke stayed on as Director of the Institute until 30 September 1985, and continued his scientific work until he was hospitalized with cancer in 1987.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==Scientific work==
Fricke had a wide interest in astronomy. His first publications dealt with problems in [[Theoretical astronomy|theoretical]] and [[Observational astronomy|observational]] astronomy. Then for the next two decades, from the time of his thesis onwards, his interests focused on [[stellar dynamics]], working from the observatory in [[Bergedorf]]. His favourite subject was the photographic surface [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] survey of the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In addition, in 1951 he published with [[Otto Heckmann]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] an important work for the extension of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heckmann |first1=Otto Hermann Leopold |last2=Jordan |first2=Pascual |last3=Fricke |first3=Walter |authorlink1= Otto Heckmann |authorlink2=Pascual Jordan |title=Zur erweiterten Gravitationstheorie. I. |journal=Zeitschrift für Astrophysik |date=1951 |issue=28 |pages=113–149 |accessdate=|trans-title=Toward an extended theory of gravitation |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being appointed to the Astronomical Calculation Institute, Fricke concentrated on fundamental [[astrometry]].  He worked specifically to improve the fundamental reference system, a series of measurements of the position and motions of a series of fundamental stars that is extremely important for study of kinematics and dynamics of objects within the Galactic system.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; The production of this kind of fundamental catalogue, which provided the astronomical representation of an inertial system, was part of the Institute's important work. His finest contribution to astronomy was the derivation, together with his colleagues and his predecessor [[August Kopff]], of the [[Catalogues of Fundamental Stars|Fourth Fundamental Catalogue]] (FK4), published in 1963.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; The FK5 catalogue was strongly associated with his name, but he was unable to view it when it was published; it used a new constant of precession which he derived himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieske |first=J. H. |date=November 1985 |title=The evolution of adopted values for precession |bibcode=1985CeMec..37..209L |journal=Celestial Mechanics |publisher= Dordrecht, Holland : D. Reidel Pub. Co. [Dordrecht] : Kluwer Academic Publishers|volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=209–238 |doi=10.1007/BF02285047 |issn=0008-8714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted by the IAU in 1976.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Fricke made significant contributions toward the establishment of the [[European Southern Observatory]] in 1962 and the [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]] (''Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie'') in Heidelberg, with [[Calar Alto Observatory|its observatory]] in [[Calar Alto]], Spain.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==Cryptographic work==
''See also'' [[Two-square cipher#Two-square cryptanalysis|Crytanalysis of Double Playfair]].

While in the military, Fricke studied German cipher methods and devised new ones.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt;

Fricke's initial task was working on the solving of the double stop system, NS 42, code named the [[Two-square cipher|Double Playfair]] (''Doppelkastenschlüssel'').&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]], [[Luftwaffe|Air Force]] and [[Police forces of Nazi Germany|Police]] used the Double Playfair system as a medium-grade hand cipher in World War II. The [[Playfair cipher|Playfair TS 42]] single stop system had already been broken at that point if there were more than 3000 letters of traffic a day.  After a year's work, they solved the problem by using vertical [[bigram]] frequencies. As the text was written in double lines of 17 or 21 and the substitutions taken vertically, plain text bigram frequencies could not be used. Combined frequencies of pairs of single letters showed a sharp drop after the top three values, EE, EN and NE (the last two had the same frequency).  Of a text length of 10000, they could place the three values only initially. [[Unit record equipment|Hollerith]] counts ([[frequency analysis]]) were undertaken against messages from the [[Invasion of Poland|Polish War]], but as these were of a stereotypical nature, words could only be guessed after high-frequency digraphs (i.e. pairs of letters) had been created. Using this method led to the recovery of more pairs, and the guessing of words. However, the solution was never used, as even though they believed 3000 letters would be enough to break a message, the Army never informed them what the actual volume of traffic was, so the system continued in use.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt;

Around the same time, he worked on the French [[C-36 (cipher machine)|C36]] cipher machine with fixed lugs, designed by [[Boris Hagelin]], which was solved by [[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]]. He later heard from others that cribs were no longer needed.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt;

The head of his section at OKH/Chi (Army Cipher Office) was Dr Pietsch, who had eight mathematicians under him. He remained there until 1 November 1944, when he was transferred to [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht|OKW/Chi]]. At this time '''Inspektorate 7''' was forbidden to create new systems, which was strictly restricted to OKW/Chi.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; At OKW/Chi, Dr Fricke managed Section IIb of Chi II (Group 2), the main group managing OKW/Chi's interception services. Section IIb, which developed German code and cypher systems (camouflage, codes and cyphers, and telephone secrecy) and also advised on the production of keys and the supervision of production, had a staff of 14. OKW/Chi cipher bureau was a strictly military organization.

In 1942, he developed the codebook (''Schlüsseltafel'') for enciphering tables for 3 letter field codes. Before that were used without [[Encryption|encipherment]]. Daily changing [[Substitution cipher#Polygraphic substitution|trigraphic substitution tables]] were introduced, initially made by Hollerith machines. He stated in his [[TICOM]] interview that there were two master decks of 500 cards each, with a trigraph on each card. Late in the war, the Hollerith machine section moved to [[Weimar]], so Walter Fricke told the printer to make up a set of three-letter slugs of type corresponding to the code groups, which were called ''Logotypen''.  The printer had the plain code values in alphabetical order in a form, with blank spaces for the encrypted values.  He was told to draw two logos from the mixed batch and place the second one opposite that plain value which was the same as the first. This procedure was repeated until the reciprocal table was created. It also had the effect of enabled untrained workers to make fewer mistakes.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt;

He went on to design and develop the [[Rasterschlüssel 44|raster key]] hand cipher (''Rasterschluessel 44''), which was to replace the ''double playfair'' cipher. A study was made on the British cipher [[Grille (cryptography)|raster]], [[Cysquare]] which was created by [[John Tiltman]] in 1941. The Cysquare cipher had been pinched from Britain, when [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel's]] [[Afrika Korps]] overran British units and captured the Cysquare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tiltman |first=John. H. |last2= |first2= |date=1962 |title=A Cryptologic Fairy Tale |url= https://www.governmentattic.org/docs/21-NSA-Tech-Journal-Articles_1957-1965.pdf |journal=NSA Technical Journal |publisher=NSA |volume=VII |issue=2 |series =  NSA DOCID:3265469|pages= |doi= |access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pads with their instruction booklets.  Fricke found it to be excellent, a very secure and practical hand cipher, but he didn't know if it had been broken, with the English using 40 letters and large number of abbreviations. He knew that if German forces used the cipher as it was, it soon would be broken because of longer messages.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; In order to use longer messages, 26 rows were created, of which 24 were used at any one time. The requirement was to choose all rasters from a systematically constructed field, and to satisfy the following requirements simultaneously:

* All rasters should have a fixed number of columns with 20 white cells, a fixed number with 18 and so on.
* Vertically adjacent white cells should be kept to a minimum.
* And when they did not occur, they must not be less than eight nor more than 12 white cells apart.

These conditions were difficult to achieve, since as soon as one requirement was achieved the others would go wrong. The purpose of making all from the same field was to avoid special cases. However, they were eventually required to be made from 20 to 40 master fields. As regards changing keys, the printer was given lead strips bearing the pattern of each of the 36 rows, of which 24 were chosen for each raster. The minimum message length was initially set to 60 characters but was lowered to 45 by the army after some use.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; Fricke asked the TICOM interrogators
:''whether the cipher was ever solved, because he was convinced if properly used it would be unbreakable, but they never knew whether mistakes were made which rendered it soluble.'' They replied it would be impossible for them to give him an answer. Fricke stated that they always wanted to work on their own traffic just as they would on foreign material, but were never allowed to. He never understood how the army actually used the cipher and never saw any real traffic.&lt;ref Name="I20"/&gt; When they asked for real traffic, they were offered specially prepared messages, one of which read
:''We are standing in Berlin and see the Polish infantry coming down the Frankfurter Allee''.

They reflected on the fact that the work on Russian systems showed that these systems were secure if properly used, but if the cryptographers in [[Moscow]] could only see how they were used they would be very unhappy.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web 2.0 does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but to changes in the way Web pages are designed and used. The transition was progressive and there is no precise date on which the change occurred.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A Web 2.0 website may allow users to interact and collaborate with each other in a [[social media]] dialogue as creators of [[user-generated content]] in a [[virtual community]], in contrast to the first generation of [[#Web 1.0|Web 1.0]]-era websites where people were limited to the passive viewing of [[Content (media and publishing)|content]]. Examples of Web 2.0 features include [[social networking site]]s and [[social media]] sites (e.g., [[Facebook]]), [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]] ("tagging" keywords on websites and links), [[video sharing]] sites (e.g., [[YouTube]]), [[Web service|hosted services]], [[Web application]]s ("apps"), [[collaborative consumption]] platforms, and [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup applications]].

Whether Web 2.0 is substantively different from prior Web technologies has been challenged by World Wide Web inventor  [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who describes the term as [[jargon]].&lt;ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee"/&gt; His original vision of the Web was "a collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm |title=Berners-Lee on the read/write web |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Will|title=Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms|year=2009|publisher=Corwin Press|location=California|isbn=978-1-4129-5972-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sR1Asxd0JcAC&amp;pg=PA1|edition=2nd|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the term [[Semantic Web]] (sometimes referred to as Web 3.0)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_3_point_0.html|title=What is Web 3.0?

==History==

===Web 1.0===
[[File:Internet Key Layers.png|thumb|right|400px|A diagram showing the milestones in the development of the key layers of the Internet.]]
Web 1.0 is a [[retronym]] referring to the first stage of the [[World Wide Web]]'s evolution. According to Cormode, G. and, Krishnamurthy, B. (2008): "content creators were few in Web 1.0 with the vast majority of users simply acting as consumers of content."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Graham Cormode|last=Balachander Krishnamurthy|title=Key differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0|journal=First Monday |volume=13 |issue=6|date=2 June 2008|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2125/1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal web page]]s were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]]-run [[web server]]s, or on [[free web hosting service]]s such as [[GeoCities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Geocities|title=Geocities – Dead media archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/163765/So_Long_GeoCities_We_Forgot_You_Still_Existed.html|title=So Long, GeoCities: We Forgot You Still Existed|date=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of Web 2.0, it was more common for the average web user to have social networking profiles on sites such as Myspace and Facebook, as well as personal blogs on one of the new low-cost [[web hosting services]] or a dedicated blog host like [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] or [[LiveJournal]]. The content for both was generated dynamically from stored content, allowing for readers to comment directly on pages in a way that was not previously common.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Some Web 2.0 capabilities were present in the days of Web 1.0, but they were implemented differently. For example, a Web 1.0 site may have had a [[guestbook]] page to publish visitor comments, instead of a [[comment section]] at the end of each page. Server performance and bandwidth considerations had to be taken into account, and a long comments thread on each page could potentially slow down the site. [[Terry Flew]], in his 3rd edition of ''New Media,'' described the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0:

{{Quote|text="move from personal websites to blogs and blog site aggregation, from publishing to participation, from web content as the outcome of large up-front investment to an ongoing and interactive process, and from content management systems to links based on "tagging" website content using keywords (folksonomy)."|sign=|source=}}

Flew believed it to be the above factors that form the basic change in trends that resulted in the onset of the Web 2.0 "craze".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====Characteristics====
Some design elements of a Web 1.0 site include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viswanathan|first1=Ganesh|last2=Dutt Mathur|first2=Punit|last3=Yammiyavar|first3=Pradeep|title=From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and beyond: Reviewing usability heuristic criteria taking music sites as case studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/8381037|date=March 2010|place=Mumbai|accessdate=20 February 2015|series=IndiaHCI Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Static pages instead of [[dynamic HTML]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-101.htm Web 1.0 defined – How stuff works]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Content served from the server's [[filesystem]] instead of a relational database management system ([[RDBMS]]).
* Pages built using [[Server Side Includes]] or [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) instead of a [[web application]] written in a [[dynamic programming language]] such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].
* The use of [[HTML 3.2]]-era elements such as [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]] and tables to position and align elements on a page. These were often used in combination with [[spacer GIF]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* Proprietary [[HTML]] extensions, such as the [[blink element|&amp;lt;blink&gt;]] and [[marquee tag|&amp;lt;marquee&gt;]] tags, introduced during the [[Browser wars#First_Browser_War|first browser war]].
* Online [[guestbook]]s.
* [[GIF]] buttons, graphics (typically 88x31 [[pixel]]s in size) promoting [[web browser]]s, [[operating system]]s, [[text editor]]s and various other products.
* HTML forms sent via [[email]]. Support for [[server side scripting]] was rare on [[shared server]]s during this period. To provide a feedback mechanism for web site visitors, [[mailto|mailto forms]] were used. A user would fill in a form, and upon clicking the form's submit button, their [[email client]] would launch and attempt to send an email containing the form's details. The popularity and complications of the mailto protocol led browser developers to incorporate [[email client]]s into their browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s04.html|title=The Right Size of Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web 2.0===
The term "Web 2.0" was first used in January 1999 by Darcy DiNucci, an [[information architecture]] consultant. In her article, "Fragmented Future", DiNucci writes:&lt;ref name="DiNucci"/&gt;

{{quote|The Web we know now, which loads into a [[Web browser|browser window]] in essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.
}}
Writing when [[Palm Inc.]] was introducing its first Web-capable [[personal digital assistant]], supporting Web access with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], DiNucci saw the Web "fragmenting" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. She focused on how the basic information structure and hyperlinking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her use of the "2.0" designation refers to a next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.

The term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kingsley Uyi Idehen|Idehen, Kingsley]]. 2003. RSS: INJAN (It's not just about news). Blog. Blog Data Space.

Jeff Bezos Comments about Web Services. Blog. Blog Data Space. September 25. [http://www.openlinksw.com/blog/~kidehen/index.vspx?id=373 OpenLinkSW.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knorr, Eric 2003"&gt;Knorr, Eric. 2003. The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, "the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform".&lt;ref name="Knorr, Eric 2003"/&gt; In 2004, the term began its rise in popularity when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the "Web as Platform", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that "customers are building your business for you".&lt;ref name="O'Reilly, Tim 2004"&gt;O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be "harnessed" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called "Web 1.0". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. For example,
{{quote|Netscape framed "the web as platform" in terms of the old software paradigm: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the "horseless carriage" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a "webtop" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.&lt;ref&gt;O’Reilly, T., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not at the time focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data such as the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its "[[PageRank]]" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called "the [[perpetual beta]]". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]]: while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any "[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]" or other problems. Wikipedia's volunteer editor community produces, edits and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.

The popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lev. 2006. Person of the Year: You. December 25.

In the cover story, Lev Grossman explains:
{{quote|It's a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It's about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel people's network [[YouTube]] and the online metropolis [[MySpace]]. It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world but also change the way the world changes.}}

====Characteristics====
Instead of merely reading a Web 2.0 site, a user is invited to contribute to the site's content by commenting on published articles or creating a [[user account]] or [[user profile|profile]] on the site, which may enable increased participation. By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage the user to rely more on their browser for [[user interface]], [[application software]] ("apps") and [[file storage]] facilities. This has been called "network as platform" computing.&lt;ref name="oreilly" /&gt; Major features of Web 2.0 include [[social networking]] websites, self-publishing platforms (e.g., [[WordPress]]' easy-to-use blog and website creation tools), [[Tag (metadata)|"tagging"]] (which enables users to label websites, videos or photos in some fashion), [[Like button|"like" buttons]] (which enable a user to indicate that they are pleased by online content), and [[social bookmarking]]. Users can provide the data that is on a Web 2.0 site and exercise some control over that data.&lt;ref name="oreilly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hinchcliffe"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites may have an "architecture of participation" that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.&lt;ref name="graham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oreilly" /&gt; Users can add value in many ways, such as by commenting on a news story on a news website, by uploading a relevant photo on a travel website, or by adding a link to a video or [[TED talk]] which is pertinent to the subject being discussed on a website. Some scholars argue that [[cloud computing]] is an example of Web 2.0 because cloud computing is simply an implication of computing on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=732483 Wireless Communications and Computing at a Crossroads: New Paradigms and Their Impact on Theories Governing the Public's Right to Spectrum Access], Patrick S. Ryan, Journal on Telecommunications &amp; High Technology Law, Vol. 3, No. 2, p. 239, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:How to edit a page Edit box.png|thumb|Edit box interface through which anyone could edit a [[Wikipedia]] article.]]

Web 2.0 offers almost all users the same freedom to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/15831013 |title=Learn More About Web 2.0 |publisher=academia.edu |accessdate=2015-10-14|last1=Pal |first1=Surendra Kumar }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this opens the possibility for serious debate and collaboration, it also increases the incidence of [[Spam (electronic)|"spamming"]], [[Troll (Internet)|"trolling"]], and can even create a venue for racist [[hate speech]], [[cyberbullying]] and [[defamation]]. The impossibility of excluding group members who do not contribute to the provision of goods (i.e., to the creation of a user-generated website) from sharing the benefits (of using the website) gives rise to the possibility that serious members will prefer to withhold their contribution of effort and [[Free rider problem|"free ride"]] on the contributions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Marwell and Ruth E.

Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; by way of user participation, can also be viewed as essential attributes of Web 2.0. Some websites require users to contribute user-generated content to have access to the website, to discourage "free riding".[[File:Mass Effect Wiki Collaboration.png|thumb|A list of ways that people can volunteer to improve Mass Effect Wiki, an example of content generated by users working collaboratively.]]The key features of Web 2.0 include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
# [[Folksonomy]] – free classification of information; allows users to collectively classify and find information (e.g. [[Tag (metadata)|"tagging"]] of websites, images, videos or links)
# Rich user experience – dynamic content that is responsive to user input (e.g., a user can "click" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information)
# [[Crowdsourcing|User participation]] – information flows two ways between site owner and site users by means of evaluation, review, and online commenting. Site users also typically create [[user-generated content]] for others to see (e.g., [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)
# [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) – Web 2.0 sites developed [[API]]s to allow automated usage, such as by a [[Web app|Web "app"]] ([[software application]]) or a [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]
# [[Eternal September|Mass participation]] – near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be [[hacker]]s and computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users

==Technologies==
The [[client-side]] ([[Web browser]]) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]]. Ajax programming uses [[JavaScript]] and the [[Document Object Model]] to update selected regions of the page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue to interact with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.

As a widely available plugin independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. In addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. On the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].

==Concepts==
Web 2.0 can be described in three parts:
* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&amp;nbsp;— defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is "rich" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.
* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&amp;nbsp;— defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].
* [[Social Web]]&amp;nbsp;— defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).

As such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and the user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment now known as "Web 1.0".

Web 2.0 sites include the following features and techniques, referred to as the acronym [[SLATES]] by Andrew McAfee:&lt;ref&gt;McAfee, A. (2006). Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration. MIT Sloan Management review. Vol. 47, No. 3, p. 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

; '''S'''earch
: Finding information through [[keyword search]].
; '''L'''inks to other websites
: Connects information sources together using the model of the Web.
; '''A'''uthoring
: The ability to create and update content leads to the collaborative work of many authors. [[Wiki]] users may extend, undo, redo and edit each other's work. Comment systems allow readers to contribute their viewpoints.
; '''T'''ags
: Categorization of content by users adding "tags"&amp;nbsp;— short, usually one-word or two word descriptions&amp;nbsp;— to facilitate searching. For example, a user can tag a metal song as "[[death metal]]". Collections of tags created by many users within a single system may be referred to as "folksonomies" (i.e., [[Folk taxonomy|folk]] [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]]).
; '''E'''xtensions
: Software that makes the Web an [[application platform]] as well as a [[document server]]. Examples include [[Adobe Reader]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight]], [[ActiveX]], [[Java programming language|Oracle Java]], [[QuickTime]], and [[Windows Media]].
; Signals
: The use of syndication technology, such as [[RSS]] feeds to notify users of content changes.

While SLATES forms the basic framework of Enterprise 2.0, it does not contradict all of the higher level Web 2.0 design patterns and business models. It includes discussions of self-service IT, the long tail of enterprise IT demand, and many other consequences of the Web 2.0 era in enterprise uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 |title=Web 2.0 definition updated and Enterprise 2.0 emerges |last=Hinchcliffe |first=Dion |date=November 5, 2006 |website=ZDNet blogs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129225858/http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 |archivedate=2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

A third important part of Web 2.0 is the [[social web]]. The social Web consists of a number of online tools and platforms where people share their perspectives, opinions, thoughts and experiences. Web 2.0 applications tend to interact much more with the end user. As such, the end user is not only a user of the application but also a participant by:
* [[Podcasting]]
* [[Blogging]]
* [[Tag (metadata)|Tagging]]
* [[Content curation|Curating]] with [[RSS]]
* [[Social bookmarking]]
* [[Social networking]]
* [[Social media]]
* [[Wiki]]s
* [[Web content voting]]

The popularity of the term Web 2.0, along with the increasing use of blogs, wikis, and social networking technologies, has led many in academia and business to append a flurry of 2.0's to existing concepts and fields of study,&lt;ref&gt;Schick, S., 2005.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these 2.0s refer to Web 2.0 technologies as the source of the new version in their respective disciplines and areas. For example, in the Talis white paper "Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation", Paul Miller argues

&lt;blockquote&gt;Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a "Library 2.0". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to "end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off "Web 2.0" &amp;#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education. Issues under consideration include the understanding of students' different learning modes; the conflicts between ideas entrenched in informal on-line communities and educational establishments' views on the production and authentication of 'formal' knowledge; and questions about privacy, plagiarism, shared authorship and the ownership of knowledge and information produced and/or published on line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.108.9995 | title=What is Web 2.0?

===Marketing===

Web 2.0 is used by companies, non-profit organizations and governments for interactive [[marketing]]. A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, [[customer service]] enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis—Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content&amp;nbsp;— to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. Another marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | publisher=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing. Saturating media hubs—like ''[[The New York Times]], [[PC Magazine]]'' and ''[[Business Week]]''&amp;nbsp;— with links to popular new Web sites and services, is critical to achieving the threshold for mass adoption of those services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mainstream_media_web20.php|title=Mainstream Media Usage of Web 2.0 Services is Increasing|last=MacManus|first=Richard|year=2007|publisher=Read Write Web|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811174656/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mainstream_media_web20.php|archivedate=2011-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; User web content can be used to gauge consumer satisfaction.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Google Timeline, the term Web 2.0 was discussed and indexed most frequently in 2005, 2007 and 2008. Its average use is continuously declining by 2–4% per quarter since April 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==== Destination Marketing ====
In tourism industries, social media is an effective channel to attract travellers and promote the tourism product and services by engaging with customers. The brand of tourist destinations can be built through the marketing campaigns on social media by engaging with customers. For example, the “Snow at First Sight” campaign launched by the State of Colorado aimed at a brand awareness of Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for examples, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participates to share experiences, pictures and videos on social medias. As a result, Colorado enhanced the image of winter destination and a campaign worth was about $2.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mukherje|first=Anwesha|date=June 2016|title=Role of Social Media in Tourism Marketing|url=|journal=International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR)|volume=5|pages=2026–2033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tourism organisation can earn a brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics. For example, “Moms” advisors of the Walt Disney World are responsibilities for offer suggestions and reply answers about the family trips at the Walt Disney World. Due to its characteristic of experts in Disney, the “Moms” was chosen to represent the campaign.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Simon|last2=Thal|first2=Karen|date=2013-01-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on the Consumer Decision Process: Implications for Tourism Marketing|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=156–160|doi=10.1080/10548408.2013.751276|issn=1054-8408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social networking such as Facebook can be used as a platform for providing a detailed information about the marketing campaign, as well as real-time online communication with customers. Korean Airline Tour created and maintained a relationship with customers by using Facebook for individual communication purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Jongpil|last2=Oh|first2=Ick-Keun|date=2012-01-01|title=A Case Study of Social Media Marketing by Travel Agency: The Salience of Social Media Marketing in the Tourism Industry|journal=International Journal of Tourism Sciences|volume=12|issue=1|pages=93–106|doi=10.1080/15980634.2012.11434654|issn=1598-0634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel 2.0 refers a model of Web 2.0 on tourism industries which provided virtual travel communities. Travel 2.0 model allow user to create their own contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buhalis|first=Dimitrios|last2=Law|first2=Rob|title=Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet—The state of eTourism research|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0261517708000162|journal=Tourism Management|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=609–623|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2008.01.005|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2011|last=Milano|first=Roberta|last2=Baggio|first2=Rodolfo|last3=Piattelli|first3=Robert|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Springer, Vienna|pages=471–483|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-0503-0_38|chapter = The effects of online social media on tourism websites|isbn = 978-3-7091-0502-3|citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.3557}}&lt;/ref&gt; The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities.

Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miguens|first=J.|last2=Baggio|first2=R.|date=2008|title=Social media and Tourism Destinations: TripAdvisor Case Study|url=http://www.iby.it/turismo/papers/baggio-aveiro2.pdf|journal=Advances in Tourism Research|volume=|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools have a significant impact on travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Benxiang|last2=Gerritsen|first2=Rolf|date=2014-04-01|title=What do we know about social media in tourism? A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211973614000026|journal=Tourism Management Perspectives|volume=10|pages=27–36|doi=10.1016/j.tmp.2014.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Education==

Web 2.0 could allow for more collaborative education. For example, blogs give students a public space to interact with one another and the content of the class.&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Will|title=Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms|year=2010|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn=978-1-4129-7747-0|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest that Web 2.0 can increase the public's understanding of science, which could improve governments' policy decisions. A 2012 study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison notes that "...the internet could be a crucial tool in increasing the general public’s level of science literacy. This increase could then lead to better communication between researchers and the public, more substantive discussion, and more informed policy decision."&lt;ref name=Ladwig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladwig|first=Peter and Kajsa E. Dalrymple, Dominique Brossard, Dietram A. Scheufele and Elizabeth A. Corley|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge?

==Web-based applications and desktops==
[[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] has prompted the development of Web sites that mimic desktop applications, such as [[word processor|word processing]], the [[spreadsheet]], and [[presentation program|slide-show presentation]]. [[WYSIWYG]] [[wiki]] and [[blog]]ging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications. Several browser-based services have emerged, including [[EyeOS]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/
|title=Can eyeOS Succeed Where Desktop.com Failed?
|publisher=www.techcrunch.com
|accessdate=2007-12-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[YouOS]].(No longer active.)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html
|title=Tech Beat Hey YouOS!&amp;nbsp;– BusinessWeek
|publisher=www.businessweek.com
|accessdate=2007-12-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Although named [[operating systems]], many of these services are application platforms. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating-systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these so-called "operating systems" do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997–2001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.

==Distribution of media==

===XML and RSS===
Many regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.

===Web APIs===
{{Main|Web API}}
Web 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].

==Criticism==
Critics of the term claim that "Web 2.0" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called "Web 1.0" technologies and concepts.&lt;ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee" /&gt; First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add an additional layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term "Web 2.0" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Amazon Web Services API
|work=O'Reilly Network
|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes

|archivedate=2006-06-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who developed the initial technologies of the Web, has been an outspoken critic of the term, while supporting many of the elements associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|title=Tim Berners-Lee on Web 2.0: "nobody even knows what it means"|quote=He's big on blogs and wikis, and has nothing but good things to say about AJAX, but Berners-Lee faults the term "Web 2.0" for lacking any coherent meaning.|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CERN|the environment where the Web originated]], each workstation had a [[dedicated IP address]] and always-on connection to the Internet. Sharing a file or publishing a web page was as simple as moving the file into a shared folder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html|title=developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee|date=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most common criticism is that the term is unclear or simply a [[buzzword]].  For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term "Web 2.0" as a jargon:&lt;ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee
|date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Other critics labeled Web 2.0 "a second bubble" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997–2000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s. For example, ''[[The Economist]]'' has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as "Bubble 2.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bubble 2.0 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;!-- I commented this out as it has been proved invalid, actually wrong, due to subsequent events. If someone thinks it should be included with some sort of caveat, do so. Leaving it as is undermines the intent of the section, which is provide valid counter views [[Venture capital]]ist [[Josh Kopelman]] noted that Web 2.0 had excited only 53,651 people (the number of subscribers at that time to [[TechCrunch]], a Weblog covering Web 2.0 startups and technology news), too few users to make them an economically viable target for consumer applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=53,651 |authorlink=Josh Kopelman|first=Josh|last=Kopelman |work=Redeye VC |url=http://redeye.firstround.com/2006/05/53651.html |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Critics have cited the language used to describe the hype cycle of Web 2.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Gartner 2006 Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of [[Techno-utopianism|Techno-utopianist]] rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|first=Michael|last=Zimmer |title="Critical Perspectives on Web 2.0", Special issue of ''[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]'', 13(3), 2008. [http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/263/showToc UIC.edu]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No! This is a misunderstanding of the Gartner Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle! Gartner's concept is applicable to ANY emerging technology. It is isn't a pejorative, or criticism per se, merely an acknowledgment of introduction, gathering momentum, then steady-state which is either success or failure. It doesn't mean that Web 2.0 is "hype". This needs to be reworded or removed. Until then, I have commented it out --&gt;

In terms of Web 2.0's social impact, critics such as [[Andrew Keen]] argue that Web 2.0 has created a cult of digital [[narcissism]] and amateurism, which undermines the notion of expertise by allowing anybody, anywhere to share and place undue value upon their own opinions about any subject and post any kind of content, regardless of their actual talent, knowledge, credentials, biases or possible hidden agendas. Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... [and that Wikipedia is full of] mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thinking is so over|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article1874668.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=JohnPaul | last=Flintoff | date=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' interview, [[Steve Jobs]], forecasting the future development of the web for personal publishing, said "The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you – you have to go get it. They can make themselves available, but if nobody wants to look at their site, that's fine. To be honest, most people who have something to say get published now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html|title= Steve Jobs: The Next Insanely Great Thing | work=Wired | first=Gary|last=Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Gorman, former president of the [[American Library Association]] has been vocal about his opposition to Web 2.0 due to the lack of expertise that it outwardly claims, though he believes that there is hope for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Michael|title=Web 2.0: The Sleep of Reason, Part 1|url=http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2007/06/web-20-the-sleep-of-reason-part-i/|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task before us is to extend into the digital world the virtues of authenticity, expertise, and scholarly apparatus that have evolved over the 500 years of print, virtues often absent in the manuscript age that preceded print".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is also a growing body of critique of Web 2.0 from the perspective of [[political economy]]. Since, as Tim O'Reilly and John Batelle put it, Web 2.0 is based on the "customers... building your business for you,"&lt;ref name="O'Reilly, Tim 2004"/&gt; critics have argued that sites such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are exploiting the "free labor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terranova|first=Tiziana|title=Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy|journal=Social Text|year=2000|volume=18|issue=2|pages=33–58|doi=10.1215/01642472-18-2_63-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; of user-created content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Soren|title=Loser Generated Content: From Participation to Exploitation|journal=First Monday|year=2008|volume=13|issue=3|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2141/1948}} {{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Astra|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|publisher=Metropolitan Books|year=2014|isbn=9780805093568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web 2.0 sites use Terms of Service agreements to claim perpetual licenses to user-generated content, and they use that content to create profiles of users to sell to marketers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert|title=The Archive and the Processor: The Internal Logic of Web 2.0|journal=New Media and Society|year=2011|volume=13|issue=8|pages=1228–1244|doi=10.1177/1461444811401735}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of increased surveillance of user activity happening within Web 2.0 sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrejevic|first=Mark|title=iSpy: Surveillance and Power in the Interactive Era|year=2007|publisher=U P of Kansas|location=Lawrence, KS|isbn=978-0-7006-1528-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard's Berkman Center for the Internet and Society argues that such data can be used by governments who want to monitor dissident citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|title=Minds for Sale|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/interactive/events/2009/11/berkwest|publisher=Berkman Center for the Internet and Society|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[AJAX]]-driven web sites where much of the content must be rendered on the client has meant that users of older hardware are given worse performance versus a site purely composed of HTML, where the processing takes place on the server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-web20/|title=Accessibility in Web 2.0 technology|quote=In the Web application domain, making static Web pages accessible is relatively easy.

Others have noted that Web 2.0 technologies are tied to particular political ideologies. "Web 2.0 discourse is a conduit for the materialization of neoliberal ideology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marwick|first=Alice|title=Status Update: Celebrity, publicity and Self-Branding in Web 2.0|year=2010|url=http://www.tiara.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/marwick_dissertation_statusupdate.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technologies of Web 2.0 may also "function as a disciplining technology within the framework of a neoliberal political economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarrett|first=Kylie|title=Interactivity Is Evil!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6493">'''Xandria''' was one of the largest distributors of sex toys and [[Pornographic film|adult videos]], books and novelty items in the [[United States]]. It began as a catalog of sexual aids for people with disabilities at a time when the [[disability rights movement]] was in its infancy.
Xandria was also one of the first companies to sell sex-related items online.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The business closed in 2016 when Lawrence Research Group, Inc., which operated the business, filed for dissolution with the [[Secretary of State of Nevada|Nevada Secretary of State]].

==Xandria History==

Xandria was founded in 1974 by Gaye Raymond, a [[San Francisco]] physical therapy professor, and her husband, [[Victoria's Secret]] founder Roy Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD9123CF931A3575AC0A965958260 Roy Raymond, 47; Began Victoria's Secret] The New York Times, Obituaries, 2 Sept. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye Raymond’s philosophy was that people with disabilities should be able to enjoy as much of life as possible, including an active sex life. Xandria began as a catalog-based distributor of sexual aids for people with physical and [[developmental disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.farnorthernrc.org/mylifemychoice/Organizations.htm |title=Far Northern Regional Center for persons with developmental disabilities |access-date=2007-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927064529/http://www.farnorthernrc.org/mylifemychoice/Organizations.htm |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Xandria Collection offered mostly educational adult videos and books, as well as [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s and [[sex toys]] that were easier to grasp and maneuver by people who had physical impairments due to an [[amputation]] or illness.

The company’s guarantee of [[privacy]], product quality and personal satisfaction helped it develop a following among the general public, especially among those who didn’t want to be seen entering their local porn shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wgnradio.com/shows/kathy_judy/links.htm The Kathy and Judy Show] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616225022/http://wgnradio.com/shows/kathy_judy/links.htm |date=June 16, 2007 }} on Chicago's 720 WGN Radio&lt;/ref&gt; 

Xandria’s products were shipped in discreet packages that did not bear the company’s name. Customers could request a refund within 60 days if they were not satisfied with their sex toys for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xandria.com/index.php?page=guarantee&amp;theme=7 Xandria’s 3-Way Guarantee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaye and Roy Raymond sold the Xandria Collection in 1984 and the company's inventory was expanded to appeal to the general public. In addition to a catalog for people with disabilities, the company began selling [[condoms]], [[erotica]], dildos, lubricants, vibrating cock rings, triple crowns, penis pumps, [[lingerie]], [[masturbation]] aids and other sex-related products. In 1999 it also began carrying explicit sex videos distributed by sister company 1st Skin. 

The company's new owners also created an advisory board of health and sex experts. Members included sex educator, activist and author [[Betty Dodson]]; journalist and author [[Michael Castleman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcastleman.com/page3/page3.html Michael Clastleman’s official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072537/http://www.mcastleman.com/page3/page3.html |date=September 28, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; who penned the [[Playboy|Playboy Magazine]] Advisor from 1991 to 1995; and clinical psychologist Louanne Cole, who now serves as resident expert for [[WebMD]]'s "Sex Matters."

Xandria was initially headquartered in [[San Francisco]]. It moved to [[Brisbane]], California in 1993 and to its final location in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] in 2005.
 
In 1997, the company launched Xandria.com, one of the first online stores dedicated to selling sex toys and adult videos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multichannelmerchant.com/crosschannel/marketing/marketing_little_romance/ A Little Romance] Catalog Age, March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The site and the company itself have generated positive press from well-known publications such as Playboy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playboy.com/magazine/advisor/faq/37.html Playboy magazine Advisor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702170856/http://www.playboy.com/magazine/advisor/faq/37.html |date=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0201-FEB_AMERICA/ Take This Job and… Insert Gently] Esquire magazine, Feb. 2001, Vol. 135, No. 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hustler and [[Men's Fitness|Men’s Fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_9_17/ai_80309797 Bedroom games: with these boudoir contests, the loser can be the winner] Men’s Fitness, Sept. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its final phase customers could order items through the mail and by calling a toll free number, but most of the company’s sales were generated through its website. Xandria did not have a physical store. Xandria.com carried a long list of sex-related items as well as articles on sexual health written by well-known authors. 

Several sex toys from the Xandria Collection were featured in the film Stash, an indie comedy starring [[Tim Kazurinsky]] and [[Marilyn Chambers]]. The film is about "Discreet Removals," a company that will remove people's stashes of pornography and sex toys after their death, so that unsuspecting spouses and family members can "concentrate on grieving".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discreetremovals.com/ Discreet Removals] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715201353/http://www.discreetremovals.com/ |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stash won the 2007 Gold Remi Award for excellence in the category of Mature Audience Narrative Feature"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stashmovie.com/press.html Stash]{{fv|date=January 2016}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612233807/http://www.stashmovie.com/press.html |date=June 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[WorldFest Houston International Film Festival]].

'''Yokneam Illit''' ({{lang-he-n|יָקְנְעָם עילית}}), also ''Yoqne'am Illit'' and ''Jokneam Illit'', is a city in northern [[Israel]]. It is located in a hilly region of the [[lower Galilee]] at the base of the [[Carmel Mountains]] and overlooks the [[Jezreel Valley]], {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=off}} from [[Haifa]] and {{convert|80|km|mi}} from [[Tel Aviv]]. Yokneam is known as Israel's "[[Startup Village, Yokneam|Startup Village]]" because its high-tech hub is surrounded by forest and small communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Meir Orbach|author2=Assaf Gilad|title=Amazon moves to buy Israeli start-up Annapurna Labs|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4618056,00.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|publisher=ynetnews.com|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Yokneam Illit was founded in 1950 and became a local authority in 1967, and a city in 2007. The city is located alongside the country’s major highways – [[Highway 70 (Israel)|Highway 70]] and [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Yoqne'am Illit}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

Starting in 1989 when a new mayor, Simon Alfassi, was elected, the economic structure of Yokneam Illit changed from a centralized dependence on two large factories to a dispersed base of many small high-tech companies. As the number and size of the companies grew, Yokneam and the small communities around it began to attract young entrepreneurs and developers who were looking for a less urban alternative to the Tel Aviv area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepost.co.il/news/new.aspx?pn6Vq=J&amp;0r9VQ=EJEEK|title="Leaving the Center" City of Refuge: How Yokneam Became the Northern Alternative to the Dan Region|publisher=The Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now has over 160 high-tech companies and exports of approximately 6 billion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Margit |first1=Maya |title=Alternative Israeli Hi-tech Hub Spurs Medical Innovations |url=https://www.jpost.com/Jpost-Tech/Alternative-Israeli-Hi-tech-Hub-Spurs-Medical-Innovations-566884 |accessdate=17 October 2018 |agency=The Media Line |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=9 September 2018 |quote=Altogether, the city exports roughly $6 billion worth of technology products annually}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darel|first1=Yael|title=In the last quarter of 2021 there will be a light rail train if the Finance Ministry doesn't interfere|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/real_estate/articles/0,7340,L-3658581,00.html|accessdate=13 July 2015|work=Kalkalist|date=June 5, 2015|language=Hebrew|quote=היום יקנעם היא מעצמת היי-טק עם כחמישה מיליארד דולר ייצוא ועם מאה חברות, כולל תרבות וחינוך ואיכות חיים.

The policy of the municipality is to build low-density, spacious homes to preserve the landscape and views from every home. Although real estate prices are low relative to the Tel-Aviv area, its high rate of growth in recent years has pushed prices up faster than in similar sized cities.&lt;ref name="יסמין גואטה, רותם שטרקמן"&gt;{{cite news|last=יסמין גואטה, רותם שטרקמן|first=Yasmin Gueta and Rotem Shterman|title=On the ruins of Soltam in Yokneam, the Silicon Valley of the North Arises (Hebrew)|url=http://www.themarker.com/markerweek/1.2119046|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=The Marker|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Tel Yokneam|Qira, Haifa}}

[[File:Yoqneam-01.JPG|thumbnail|Yokneam Illit]]Ancient Yokneam appears in the list of 119 cities conquered by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] following the victory in the [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|battle of Megiddo]] (1468 BC).

Yokneam (or Jokneam) is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as a [[Levitical city|city of Levites]] within the territory of the Israelite [[tribe of Zebulun]] (Joshua 12:1, 12:22, 19:10-11, 21:34). It is located near [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] (Armageddon). The [[Crusaders]] called Yokneam "Cain Mons", or "Mountain of Cain" in keeping with the tradition that [[Cain]], son of Adam (Genesis 4: 23-24), was murdered at this site. Yokneam was populated throughout the Persian, [[Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine]], Arab, Crusaders, [[Mameluk]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods.

Yokneam was the site of a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] village named [[Qira, Palestine|Qira]], depopulated in the lead up to the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]].

[[File:Maabarat Yokneam1952.jpg|thumbnail|left|Yokneam [[Maabara]] (1952)]]
[[File:Elias-Pano2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Yokneam illit (2009)]]
The Yokneam Moshava was established in 1935. In July 1950, a tent camp ([[Maabara]]) was set up to absorb 250 new immigrant families and remained part of Yokneam Moshava until 1967. By the start of 1952, another 400 families were housed in the tent camp. Toward the end of 1951, the first 285 families moved from the tent camp to permanent housing on the hill above the Yokneam Moshava.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:יקנעם עילית#cite note-5|70 Families Accept 700 Families]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Yokneam was considered unusual in that it had a single school for all regardless of whether they were religious or secular, or from the moshava or the tent camp.&lt;ref name="jpress.org.il"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yokneam gave up on the movements, and the movements gave up on Yokneam|url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=4ytfdhHSD0PRUQl%2FVdEqePxk33Icil5TJwYZUBZ83%2BuZUkQvWXHF%2F8hjcWSccyGlYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=DAV%2f1952%2f07%2f10&amp;page=2&amp;rtl=true|newspaper=Davar|date=July 10, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Yokneam was occupied by 4,300 residents, with 160 of the families living in the moshava. In 1967, Yokneam was split into two local councils (Yokneam and Yokneam Illit).

In the 1980s there were two factories in Yokneam, employing 90% of its residents. One collapsed and unemployment soared creating a challenging situation for residents.

In the 1990s, Yokneam absorbed a large wave of immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union. During that time, Yokneam's industrial parks became a magnet for high-tech firms.

Yokneam Illit was formally declared a city in 2006. In 2009, Yokneam was linked to [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]] and also received recognition as Israel's first "Green City" in the Cleantech competition. These two events significantly boosted Yokneam's attraction as a center for companies involved in medical, cleantech and product development.

In 2011, some 16,000 workers entered the industrial parks every day. Of these, only 4,000 were local residents.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/no-such-thing-as-a-highway-to-nowhere-1.380566|title=No Such Thing as a Highway to Nowhere|work=Haaretz.com|date=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
On Dec. 31, 2014, Yokneam had a population of 21,100 residents, with a population density of 2,576.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population and density per sq. Km. In localities numbering 5,000 residents and more on 31 XII 2014(1)|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton.html?num_tab=st02_24&amp;CYear=2015|publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of unemployment is 5 percent, lower than the national average.

== Integrated Social and Economic Ecosystem ==
Since the 1950s when Yokneam Moshava and Yokneam Illit shared a single school, social integration and coexistence has been an integral part of the local culture.&lt;ref name="jpress.org.il"/&gt; The first wave of immigrants to settle in the [[Maabara]] (tent camp) had major contingents from at least 6 different Jewish communities ([[Iranian Jews in Israel|Iran]], [[Iraqi Jews in Israel|Iraq]], [[Kurdish Jews in Israel|Kurdistan]], [[Romanian Jews in Israel|Romania]], [[Yemenite Jews in Israel|Yemen]] and [[Indian Jews in Israel|India]]), all of whom were absorbed by the Moshava which had been settled in 1935 by Jews from Germany and the Netherlands.

The next wave of new immigrants came in the 1960s from North Africa, followed by immigrants from the Soviet Union in the 1970s. In the 1990s, Yokneam Illit absorbed large numbers of immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union.

Starting in the 1990s, the growth of high-tech companies in Yokneam Illit also brought an influx of Israeli-born residents along with an increasing number of immigrants from Western Europe, South Africa, North America and South America. During this period, the economic problems of the Kibbutz and Moshav movements led many of the young families in the Megiddo Regional Council to move to nearby Yokneam Illit.

Yokneam Illit's accelerated demand for day care and Kindergartens led to a shortage of space in local day care and Kindergartens at the same time that there was a shortage of children at some of the Kibbutzim. In order to avoid sending their children to other small communities in the area, Kibbutz children's houses and Kindergartens began accepting children from nearby Yokneam Illit, and in some cases the number of children from Yokneam Illit outnumbered the Kibbutz children. This phenomenon later extended to the elementary and secondary schools until the building of new schools in Yokneam Illit was able to catch up with demand.

Many of the children from Yokneam Illit and their families remained in the Megiddo school system, while families who moved from the Megiddo communities to Yokneam Illit were educating their children in the Yokneam Illit school system. The family ties and school friendships led to mixed Yokneam-Megiddo parents groups in both communities and nearly all sports activities and many other after-school activities being fully integrated. Today, it is extremely rare to find a local team representing only Yokneam Illit or only the Megiddo Regional Council.

The Partnership2Gether program, which partnered Yokneam Illit and the Megiddo Regional Council on the Israeli side, with the Jewish communities of Atlanta, GA and St. Louis, MO on the US side, helped institutionalize cooperation between the Yokneam Illit municipality and the Megiddo Regional Council. The impact on joint community leadership not only affected Yokneam-Megiddo, but also created an ongoing relationship between the Jewish communities of Atlanta and St. Louis.

This cross-pollination has led to an integrated economic ecosystem that help support the high-tech companies in Yokneam Illit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobio Missouri Delegation Visit Yokneam Megiddo|url=http://p2g.jewishagency.org/english/partnerships/yokneam/2012/12/11/mobio-missouri-delegation-visit-yokneam-megiddo/|work=Partnership2Gether|publisher=The Jewish Agency of Israel|accessdate=23 February 2014|author=yaaritk|date=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this cooperation can be seen in the activities of the Southeast chapter of the US-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta, and the success of companies like [[Given Imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givenimaging.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx|title=Covidien Products - Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies|first=|last=Covidien|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given Imaging, which began as a small startup in Yokneam Illit, leveraged its special relationship with the Southeast chapter of the US-Israel Chamber of Commerce when it opened its Marketing headquarters in Atlanta, GA.

[[File:StartupVillage-Yokneam 03.jpg|thumb|View of the "Startup Village" high-tech park]]
Yokneam's proximity to two major universities ([[Technion]] and [[University of Haifa]]), location at the crossroads between northern Israel and the major urban areas of Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem, tax benefits and investment grants associated with its status as a "National Priority Area A", and its small town surroundings and lower cost of housing all worked together to attract Israel's highest concentration of R&amp;D companies outside of Tel-Aviv and give it the nickname of [[Startup Village, Yokneam|Startup Village]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Technology incubators ===
As the number of hi-tech companies in Yokneam grow, technology incubators have begun opening in or moving to Yokneam, each specializing in different types of technology.

==Parks and recreation==
Yokneam is a very green city. Not just in terms of ecological activism, but also in terms of its physical surroundings. Roughly two-thirds of the land within Yokneam's city limits are green space (parks, archeological digs, gardens, playgrounds). It has five major public parks, and outdoor amphitheater and over 80 playgrounds distributed throughout the city. Tel Yokneam, which includes the ruins of a crusader church and its intricate water system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Kirk|title=Tell Yokneam|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfXM4rVfWSI|accessdate=19 September 2016|quote=...at the end of the 88 season they found the entrance...}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used as an educational site where Yokneam's school children perform restoration work under the direction of the Antiquities Authority and the National Parks Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joe Yudin|title=Off the Beaten Track: Exploring Tel Yokneam|url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/Off-the-Beaten-Track-Exploring-Tel-Yokneam|accessdate=27 January 2015|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nearly {{convert|13|km|abbr=off}} of bicycle paths connect all of the parks and public spaces. The city is also surrounded by the Ramot Menashe Biosphere Reserve of the [[Megiddo Regional Council]], which is currently in the process of becoming recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a [[biosphere reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosphere.org.il/cgi-webaxy/item?10110208|title=About the biosphere|website=biosphere.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year thousands of Israelis participate in Yokneam's annual walking event which began in 1991. In 2013 there were 35,000 participants. The event takes place in the Spring, with a short route of {{convert|6|km|abbr=off}} and a longer route of {{convert|11|km|abbr=off}} through the hills and valleys that surround Yokneam. The 2014 walking event is scheduled for April 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfa.co.il/activities.asp?x=3|title=Popular Sports Events|publisher=Israel Sport for All Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016192804/http://www.isfa.co.il/activities.asp?x=3|archivedate=2005-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Yokneam sits at the intersections of [[Highway 70 (Israel)|Highway 70]] and [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]], which connect all of Israel with both [[Tel-Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], and will soon be connected to [[Highway 77 (Israel)|Highway 77]] leading to the Galilee. The [[Yokneam–Kfar Yehoshua railway station]] on the [[Jezreel Valley railway]] which stretches from Haifa to [[Beit She'an]] is located only 5 minutes from Yokneam's high-tech parks. Yokneam is 20–25 minutes from [[Haifa Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Haifa+Airport,+Haifa,+Israel/Yokneam+Illit,+Israel/@32.7392038,34.9944452,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x151db0a7151e9f9f:0x561f8f9316551ec0!2m2!1d35.0440391!2d32.8113927!1m5!1m1!1s0x151daec0a66a5e27:0x837c16f02a68cf31!2m2!1d35.104606!2d32.660225?hl=en|website=Google Maps|accessdate=8 May 2016|title=Haifa Airport, Haifa, Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 12 minutes from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Ramat+David/Yokneam+Elit?hl=en&amp;dg=dbrw&amp;newdg=1|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ramat David Airbase|Ramat David airbase]], which is reported to be the most likely location for a new International airport to complement [[Ben Gurion Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Lazar|title=Air force base slated to become second major airport|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/air-force-base-slated-to-become-second-major-airport/|accessdate=28 October 2014|agency=The Times of Israel|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=September 18, 2014|quote=After years of attempts to find a location for a second major international airport in Israel, the Ramat David air force base in the Lower Galilee has emerged as the likely solution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus service in Yokneam is provided by 3 bus companies. [[Superbus (company)|Superbus]] provides the local service in Yokneam and intercity service to [[Haifa]] and [[Afula]]. Superbus also runs [[Night bus lines in Israel|night lines]] (including Friday nights) to Haifa, [[Kiryat Tiv'on|Kiryat Tivon]] and [[Ramat Yishai|Ramat Ishai]]. All bus stops are handicapped-accessible. Egged and [[Nateev Express]] provide express intercity services to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Bnei Brak]] and [[Jerusalem]], as well as service with stops along the way.

There is a taxi stand at the shopping mall at the eastern entrance to Yokneam Illit.

The Yokneam Illit Municipality encourages the use of bicycles in the city. It currently has {{convert|13|km|abbr=off}} of bicycle paths that connect all of it public parks and buildings.

== Education ==
Yokneam allocates 42% of its budget to education. With 75% of its students passing the national matriculation exams and a dropout rate of only 0.8%, Yokneam Illit was awarded the National Education Prize and the Regional Education Prize several times in recent years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|title=D&amp;B Dun's 100 2012 - Israel's Largest Enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preschool from age 3 has been free in Yokneam Illit for 20 years.&lt;ref name="Rozen"/&gt; According to a 2018 report by the Knesset, Yokneam has the 2nd highest percentage of residents with an academic of any city in Israel. That same study showed that Yokneam had the 2nd highest rate of high school matriculation among development town and the highest rate of those with matriculation at a level high enough for University acceptance, both of which were 205 higher than the national average and 30% higher than the average for development towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benita |first1=Rina |author2=Ehud Bakar |title=מבט על ערי פיתוח: 1972-2016 (A look at development towns: 1972-2016) |date=12 June 2018 |publisher=The Knesset of Israel |location=Israel |pages=14–16 |url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Info/MMM/Pages/document.aspx?docId=aabfbc0e-2342-e811-80df-00155d0a9876&amp;businessType=1 |accessdate=17 October 2018 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The municipality of Yokneam has developed a special relationship with the Jewish communities of Atlanta, GA and Saint Louis, MO, whereby all three communities work together to create programs for bridging the gaps between communities and cultures, and to provide all students with equal opportunities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Environmental Protection Ministry (Israel)]] awarded a number of Yokneam's kindergartens and elementary schools the “green label” because of the way they integrated study of the environment into the local curriculum.[[File:גן מדעי.JPG|left|thumb|Yokneam Science Museum]][[File:גן מדע ומדיה.JPG|thumb|The Yokneam Media Museum]] In grades three through six, elementary school students spend a full week of school at the city's Science Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniel|first=Ben Simon|title=Miracle in Yokne'am|url=http://www.haaretz.com/miracle-in-yokne-am-1.98008|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=22 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDF Head of Manpower Planning recently awarded the city a special excellence prize for achieving an 87% level of enlistment in the IDF and the eighth highest level of recruitment to elite units and officers courses in all of Israel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Construction of a "breakthrough" educational campus is nearly complete, with an educational infrastructure for study from kindergarten to high school that will eliminate the transitions that affect students’ lives. The campus will have sports halls, day care centers, kindergartens, elementary and high schools, and academic courses prior to IDF enlistment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In addition to Yokneam's proximity to [[Technion]](23.8&amp;nbsp;km), [[University of Haifa]](22&amp;nbsp;km), and [[Oranim Academic College]](7.5&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oranim.ac.il/sites/heb/about/about-oranim-en/Pages/default.aspx|title=About Oranim Academic College|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029142658/http://www.oranim.ac.il/sites/heb/about/about-oranim-en/pages/default.aspx|archivedate=2016-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yokneam has a branch of the [[Open University of Israel|Open University]] for bachelor's and master's degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distances from Yokneam|url=http://www.tremp.co.il/distance/all_distances.php?source=Yokneam&amp;language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distances from Yokneam|url=http://www.tremp.co.il/distance/all_distances.php?source=%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A2%D7%9D|accessdate=10 March 2014|location=Distance to Oranim Teaching College|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality is currently trying to expand on this by working with major universities to open branches in Yokneam.

== Israel's first "Green City" ==
[[File:Green Day in Yokneam (2008).jpg|thumb|left|"Green Day" Festivities in Yokneam Illit]]In 2009, the Cleantech Authority of the [[Environmental Protection Ministry (Israel)]] awarded the city of Yokneam Illit a prize for its overall strategy of protecting and nurturing green spaces and encouraging environmental awareness and education. It was again awarded the "Green City" prize in 2014, where the parameters measured included: energy efficiency, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and waste separation, water and sewage, environment-friendly "green" construction, public gardens, environmental education, beauty of the city, environment-friendly "green" commerce and industry, care of urban public grounds and nature, and urban management.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cleantech competition declares Yokneam is a Green City for a second time|newspaper=Yokneam Municipality Press Announcement (Hebrew)|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has its own environmental protection committee responsible for defining and implementing an overall strategy for improving the quality of life and protecting the environment. The strategy emphasizes: planned development, environmental management, educational programs for environmental protection, urban sanitation, cause and effect management, and conservation of energy and water. It actively promotes walking and use of bicycles for transportation, and all bus stops are handicapped-accessible.

Yokneam Illit's 500 dunams of public parks and its 50 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/person of open urban space&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;    is 5 times the minimum recommendation for urban planning. In addition to the annual "Yokneam Walk", which attracts thousands of participants, the works closely with the Israel National Fund (Keren Kayemet) to further promote nature preservation.

Yokneam Illit is one of 31 municipalities that separates garbage at the source, as well as having waste separation centers distributed throughout the city. The drainage systems work well and stockpile water for reuse in city parks and gardens. The city also uses a computerized irrigation system to save water and achieve optimal results.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Sewage is treated at the water treatment plants that are located in nearby Kiryat Tivon.

As part of Yokneam's commitment to adopting green energy it will soon be one of the first two cities in northern Israel where electric buses will operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golden Dragon Releases Its New Bus Models in Israel|url=http://www.chinabuses.org/news/2016/0627/article_9517.html|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=www.chinabuses.org|date=2016-06-27|quote=“We have been closely eyeing the latest technological advances. To pursue a more sustainable development and adopt green energy, we are determined to introduce the most sustainable technologies and solutions. Our Golden Dragon CNG and electric buses will soon be put into operation in Afula and Yokneam in northern Israel, providing cleaner and more comfortable travel experience for local citizens”, says Dani, CEO of Auto Chen, which is the partner of Golden Dragon in Israel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality invests both time and money to maintain the natural beauty of its green spaces. Its building codes have become stricter and greener as the demand for housing has increased. A "green" neighborhood is currently under construction which includes environment friendly lighting, irrigation and waste management.  At the same time, the municipality has actively worked to make the older neighborhoods more attractive.

The city runs environmental leadership workshops. Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia run a program to teach and preserve traditional farming methods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leket Israel Honors Ethiopian Yokneam Volunteers|url=http://p2g.jewishagency.org/english/partnerships/yokneam/2012/10/15/leket-israel-honors-ethiopian-yokneam-volunteers/|work=Partnership2Gether|publisher=The Jewish Agency of Israel|accessdate=23 February 2014|author=yaaritk|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The education system is defined as “green”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; with environmental studies built into the curriculum.
