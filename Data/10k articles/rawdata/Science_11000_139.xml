==Early life==
Abdulaziz Karimov Vakhitovich was born in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]] in 1944. He was brought up in the family of a serviceman. From  1951 to 1962, he studied at [[Maxim Gorky]] school no. 90 in [[Tashkent]]. He graduated from 1964 to 1970 the Tashkent Institute of Education, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, a principal research institute of  the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan]] with a degree of Doctor of physical and mathematical sciences.    From 1962 to 1964 he used to be an employee of the Tashkent Cable Factory. From 1964 to 1967 he served in the army. Having finished his army service, he enrolled as a senior engineer in Tashkent State University in 1967-1968. Beginning from 1968 and in the meantime he is an employee of the Physical-Technical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan.  In the period from 1968 to 1971 he used to be a junior researcher, from 1971 to 1986 as a senior researcher, and from 1986 to present times he is a leading scientist of the Institute.

==Career==
His work is the study of physical phenomena and processes in epitaxial multilayer structures and the development of their physical foundations. The scientific activity of Dr. A.V. Karimov  is closely related to the investigation of physical phenomena and processes in epitaxial multilayer structures and development of their physical basics as well as creation of a novel class of semiconductor devices. In 1980 Dr. A.V. Karimov was granted his PhD Certifictae for his research titled “Development of physical basics of technology of production of GaAs-structures for field transistors and investigation of their thermal and photoelectrical properties”. His research was primarily devoted to the problems of obtaining the semiconductor epitaxial layers and properties of semiconductor structures on their basis. In 1991 he was granted the title of a senior scientific researcher. His scientific activity at the Physical-Technical Institute is connected to studying the physical phenomena and processes that take place in epitaxial multilayer structures and development of their physical basics, creation of a novel class of samples.

In 1995 Doctor A.V. Karimov was granted his Doctor of Science Certificate for his research “Physical phenomena in GaAs-structures with thin quasiperiodic transition”. In 2006 he received the title of professor in the field of Physics of semiconductors and dielectrics.

He has published more than 450 scientific articles, two monograph and one academic  textbook and invented - author more than 40 devices. Under his leadership, the physical basis of technologies have been developed, as well as the original design of multi-barrier [[photodiode]] structures with internal [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] amplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Karimov A.V.. Three-barrier photodiode. USSR Patent. * 1676399. 08.05., 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karimov A.V.. Three-barrier photodiode. Uzb Patent no. 933. 15.04. 1994., Reports of Academy of Science. UzSSR №12, 1990 s.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Invention three-barrier photodiode Karimov.

He discovered that double-barrier rAlGaInAs-n GaAs-Au-injection structures and field effects are the basis of injection-field photodiodes with an operating voltage spectral range of A.&lt;ref&gt;A.V. Karimov, D.M. Yodgorova. An injection -type field-emission rhotodiode., ''Radioelectronics and communicatios systems''- № 2. 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;55-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

His research results have been published in ''Technical Physics Letters'', ''Radioelectronics and communicatios systems,'' ''Journal of Semiconductor Physics, Quantum Electronics, Optoelectronics and'' ''Journal of Engineering Physics'').

Noteworthy results include the spectral characteristics of the double-barrier structure with a corrugated surface of the photodetector &lt;ref&gt;A.V. Karimov, D.M. Yodgorova, E.N.Yakubov. Research of structures corrugated photoreceiving surface. ''Journal Semiconductor Physics Quantum Electronics Optoelectronics''. (2004)   Vol. 7. number 4, p.&amp;nbsp;378-382,&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sensitivity to the impurity region of the spectrum.

In comparison with the classical single-barrier photodiode, he obtained high values of photosensitivity from 5 to 15 A / W, which is one - one and a half orders of magnitude higher than (0.5-1 A / W) in the known analogues.

Dr. A.V. Karimov regularly participates at various  part in high-profile international scientific conferences,  including lectures and  latest publicationsin in Prague, 13–17 October 2002, Berlin, 23–25 June 2003, Paris, 7–11 June 2004, Kiev and Odessa 2004-2007 at international conferences physical processes in phototransformator, photodiodes, phototransistors, and the problems of the physical processes in the [[P–n junction|pn-junctions]]. He was a member of the organizing committee of the conference held in Baku and Odessa (2004-2007 biennium) on Information and electronic technologies.

Dr. A.V. Karimov was an active participant as a research manager of international projects UZB-31 “Development of solar energy photoconverters based on novel structures: ion-beam modified and diamond-like layers of polycrystalline silicon” (01.04.2000-31.06.2002), and UZB-56(J) “Development and investigation of micro-layer photoconverters with InGaAs/GaAs and AlGaAs/GaAs heteroepitaxial junctions” (01.10.2002-31.12.2004) jointly ith Ukrainian Science and Technology Center.

The physical basics of the technology and original designs of multiple barrier photodiode structures with internal photoelectrical amplification were developed under his guidance in Uzbekistan in the early 90th [Karimov A.V. Three-barrier photodiode of A.V. Karimov. USSR Patent. ٭1676399. 08.05., 1991. Karimov A.V. Three-barrier photodiode. Uzb Patent # 933. 15.04., 1994., Academy of Sciences reports of Uzbek SSR, # 12, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18]. Multibarrier structures replenish from year to year by new constructions with extended functional possibilities. Discovered in two-barrier p+ AlGaInAs-n0 GaAs-Au-structures injection and field effects make up the basis of injection-field photodiode with spectral range switched from the working voltage [A.V.

]]His multiple scientific results were published in various journals (Electronics, Instruments and experimental technologies, Semiconductors, Technical Physics Letters, Radioelectronics and communication systems, Journal of engineering physics and thermophysics) worldwide. The results of investigation of spectral characteristics of two-barrier structures with corrugated surface are of special interest [A.V. Karimov, D.M. Yodgorova, E.N. Yakubov. Research of structures with corrugated photoreceiving surface// Journal of Semiconductor Physics and Quantum Electronics and Optoelectronics. 2004, Vol. 7, #4, pp.&amp;nbsp;378–382]. Compared to the classical one-barrier photodiode structures, Dr. A.V. Karimov obtained high value of photosensitivity ranging from 5 to 15 A/V, which is by 1-1.5 fold higher than that (0.5-1 A/V) in the existing samples.

Dr. A.V. Karimov, as a leading expert and professional in his field, he is listed in the Biographical Collection 10th Anniversary Edition of [[Who's Who]] in Science and Engineering/ [[Marquis Who's Who]] / [https://www.marquiswhoswho.com/pages/online-database Who's Who] in Science and Engineering, and also in International list of the '''[[International Biographical Centre]] [http://www.internationalbiographicalcentre.com/ Melrose Press Ltd]''' (registered in Great Britain under #965274 with an office at Saint Thomas Place, ELY, Cambridgeshire, CB7 4GG, Great Britain). He was admitted as an International scientist for the year 2008.

At present Dr. A.V. Karimov together with his team works on creating a new generation of photodetector structures for receiving and processing information  (a novel generation of photo-receiver structures for information processing and storage).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24849">'''Advanced Metrics''' is the term for the empirical analysis of [[sports]], particularly [[statistics]] that measure in-game productivity and efficiency. Advanced metrics were first employed in baseball by [[Bill James]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwdev.sabr.org/node/604/|title=Bill James Profile|first=Don|last=Zminda|work=Summer 2010 Baseball Research Journal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in the field who is considered the father and public face of the practice.

==General principles==
The basic principles of advanced metrics were outlined in ''The Sabermetric Manifesto'' by David Grabiner (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball1.com/baseball-archive/sabermetrics/sabermetric-manifesto/|title=The Sabermetric Manifesto|first=David J.|last=Grabiner|work=The Baseball Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, Grabiner explains that Bill James defined sabermetrics, the first advanced metric, as the search for objective knowledge about sports.

To glean objective knowledge, advanced metrics practitioners gather and synthesize thousands of situational game data points from a wide variety of sources beyond high level box score information. A large volume of situational data is then distilled into sophisticated statistics that helps sports enthusiasts better understand, compare, and appreciate the on-field performances by athletes. Advanced metrics provide more objective answers to questions such as "which player on the [[Red Sox]] contributed the most to the team's offense?" or "who is the best wing player in the [[NBA]]?" or "how many touchdowns is [[Dez Bryant]] likely to score for the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]]?". By removing the subjective observations of sports media members and the emotional opinions of fans, advanced metrics offer a more clinical, rational prism from which to enjoy sporting events and consume sports media coverage.

==Early history==
Advanced metrics were first posited in the mid-1900s, and [[Earnshaw Cook]] was one its earliest practitioners. Cook's research for his 1964 work, ''Percentage Baseball'' was the first publication siting advanced metrics to garner national media attention.&lt;ref name="albert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first=James|author2=Jay M. Bennett |title=Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game|isbn=0-387-98816-5|year=2001|pages=170–171|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the competitive advantage offered by advanced metrics, the practice was unanimously dismissed by major sports organizations for most of the twentieth century.

In the late 1970s, Bill James helped bring SABR, which stands for the [[Society for American Baseball Research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/about|title=About SABR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the empirical analysis of athletic performance, to national prominence. The analytical perspective on sports championed by James and SABR developed a wider following after [[Sports Illustrated]] featured James in the article ''He Does It By The Numbers'' by Daniel Okrent (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1981/05/25/825650/he-does-it-by-the-numbers-the-esoteric-equation-on-the-royals-scoreboard-in-kansas-city-is-only-one-of-the-far-out-findings-of-deep-thinking-baseball-statistician-bill-james|title=He Does It By The Numbers...|first=Daniel|last=Okrent|work=Sports Illustrated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advanced metrics in baseball==
Former [[Major League Baseball]] second baseman [[Davey Johnson]] was the first known member of a major sports organization to advocate for the use of advanced metrics. During his time with the [[Baltimore Orioles]], he used an [[IBM System/360]] to write a [[FORTRAN]] baseball [[computer simulation]] to determine the team's optimal starting lineup. When he proposed his findings to Orioles manager [[Earl Weaver]], Johnson's proposal was summarily dismissed. A decade later, after becoming the [[New York Mets']] manager in 1984, Johnson tasked a team employee with writing a [[dBASE II]] application to run sophisticated statistical models in order to better understand the capabilities and tendencies of the team's opponents.&lt;ref name="porter19840529"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqO7wRZjZQQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22pc%20mag%22%20%22may%2029%201984%22&amp;pg=PA210 | title=The PC Goes to Bat | work=PC Magazine | date=1984-05-29 | accessdate=24 October 2013 | author=Porter, Martin | pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the twentieth century, advanced metrics had gained significant acceptance by the management of many [[Major League Baseball]] clubs, notably the [[Oakland A's]], [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]].

The adoption of advanced metrics by professional baseball franchises has been largely outpaced by sports fans and sports media. [[Bill James]]' first published his ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|Baseball Abstract]]'' in the early 1980s. In 1996, [[Baseball Prospectus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philbirnbaum.com/btn2000-05.pdf|title=Baseball Prospectus — Escaping Bill James' Shadow|first=James|last=Fraser|work=SABR Statistical Analysis Committee|pages=4–5|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to build upon Bill James' work when it launched the website ''[http://www.BaseballProspectus.com BaseballProspectus.com]'' in order to present [[sabermetric]] research and related findings as well as publish advanced metrics such as [[EqA]], the [[Clay Davenport|Davenport Translations (DT's)]], and [[VORP]]. Today, Baseball Prospectus has grown into a multi-channel sports media organization employing a team of statisticians and writers who publish ''New York Times Best Selling'' books and host weekly radio shows and podcasts.

==Advanced metrics in basketball==
[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], under coach [[Frank McGuire]], was the first known basketball organization to utilized advanced possession metrics to gain a competitive advantage. Since then, advanced metrics enthusiasts in basketball have borrowed aspects of Bill James' philosophy in order to create weighted statistics that measure each player and each team's on-court efficiency. Most basketball-specific advanced metrics feature a per-minute measurement to ensure that a player's incremental team contributions are measured irrespective of usage volume.

Beginning in the 1990s, statistician [[Dean Oliver (statistician)|Dean Oliver]] and [[ESPN]] sports writer [[John Hollinger]] first popularized the use of advanced metrics in basketball. Oliver's book ''Basketball On Paper''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Basketball On Paper|first=Dean|last=Oliver|work=Potomac Books|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hollinger's ''Pro Basketball Forecast''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Basketball-Forecast-John-Hollinger/dp/1574889621|title=Pro Basketball Forecast|first=John|last=Hollinger|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; are credited with the advancement of basketball's version of sabermetrics, [[APBRmetrics]]. Major sports media proponents, such as Hollinger, have helped basketball evolve more quickly from rudimentary statistics to advanced metrics than some other major American sports.

[[Houston Rockets]]' [[Daryl Morey]] was the first [[NBA]] general manager to implement advanced metrics as a key aspect of player evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2007-11-01/news/rocket-science/|title=Rocket Science|first=Jason|last=Friedman|work=Houston Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed Morey's hiring, the [[NBA]] moved quickly to adopt advanced metrics-based player evaluation practices. In 2012, John Holliger left ESPN to become VP of Basketball Operations for the [[Memphis Grizzlies]].

Beyond professional basketball front offices, major sports media websites such as [http://www.basketballreference.com ''basketballreference.com''] and [http://www.hoopsdata.com ''hoopsdata.com''] are now dedicated to the collection, synthesis, and dissemination of advanced metrics to pro and college basketball organizations, sports media members, and fans.

==Advanced metrics in American football==
The adoption of advanced metrics by college and professional football organizations has been a gradual evolution. While the sabermetrics revolution in baseball has already inspired a bestselling book, ''Moneyball'' by Michael Lewis, which also became a critically acclaimed film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html|title=84th Annual Academy Awards Nominees}}&lt;/ref&gt; the advanced metrics movement in football has had no such prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/112300/football-sabermetrics-how-stats-could-transform-nfl|title=4th Down? We're Going For It!|first=Nate|last=Cohn|work=New Republic|date=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the advanced metrics-focused website [http://www.FootballOutsiders.com ''FootballOutsiders.com''] pioneered football's first comprehensive advanced metric, DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/glossary|title=General Football Terms Glossary|work=Football Outsiders}}&lt;/ref&gt; which compares a player's success on each play to the league average based on a number of variables including down, distance, location on field, current score gap, quarter, and strength of opponent. [[Football Outsiders]]' work has since been widely cited by analytical members the sports media establishment. A few years later, [[Pro Football Focus]] launched a comprehensive statistical database, which soon featured a sophisticated player grading system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/history/|title=History of ProFootballFocus}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advanced Football Analytics]] (originally Advanced NFL Stats) has its EPA (expected points added) and WPA (win probability added) for NFL players.

[[Grantland]] lead football writer Bill Barnwell created the first advanced metrics focused on predicting the future performance of an individual player, the [[Speed Score]], which he referenced in a piece written for ''Pro Football Prospectus''. After analyzing data pertaining to running back success, Barnwell discovered that the most successful running backs at the [[NFL]] level were both fast and heavy, therefore, Speed Score weights 40-yard dash times by assigning a premium to bigger, often stronger, running backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/pro-football-prospectus|title=Pro Football Prospectus|first=Bill|last=Barnwell|work=Football Outsiders|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fantasy football community has been one of the driving forces in the evolution of advanced metrics in American football. Fantasy sports writer, and author of ''How To Think Like A Fantasy Football Winner'', C.D. Carter is a leading advocate for the use of advanced metrics in fantasy football analysis. He and peers at [http://www.xnsports.com XN Sports], [http://www.NumberFire.com NumberFire], and the long-form fantasy football analysis site, [http://www.Rotoviz.com Rotoviz.com], have established an informal subculture of fantasy football sports writers who refer to themselves as "degens." The degen movement is responsible for the creation of numerous American football efficiency metrics that better explain past football performances and attempt to predict future player production. Height-adjusted Speed Score,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moneyinthebananastand.com/2012/04/24/dominator-rating-height-adjusted-speed-score-and-wr-draft-rankings/|title=Dominator Rating, Height-adjusted Speed Score, and WR Draft Rankings|first=Shawn|last=Siegele|work=Money In The Banana Stand|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; College Dominator Rating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fantasydouche.com/2012/04/game-plan-now-available-in-paperback/|title=Game Plan|first=Frank|last=DuPont|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target Premium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xnsports.com/2014/02/04/fantasy-football-2013-wr-review-target-multiplier/|title=Fantasy Football 2013 WR Review|first=Rich|last=Hribar|work=XN Sports|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catch Radius,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rotoviz.com/2014/03/the-catch-radius-project-in-search-of-better-td-production/|title=The Catch Radius Project: In Search of Better TD Production|first=Scott|last=Smith|work=RotoViz|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Net Expected Points (NEP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.numberfire.com/info/glossary/|title=Glossary|work=NumberFire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Production Premium&lt;ref name="Terms Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playerprofiler.com/terms-glossary/|title=Terms Glossary|work=PlayerProfiler|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were recently created and disseminated by degen writers and mathematicians. Building on the work of these writers, sites such as [http://www.PlayerProfiler.com PlayerProfiler.com] distill a wide variety of established advanced metrics into a single player snapshot designed to be palatable to the casual sports fan.&lt;ref name="Terms Glossary"/&gt;

'''Andrew Damien Wilkie''' (born 8 November 1961 in [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]], New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian politician and independent federal member for [[Division of Denison|Denison]]. Before entering politics Wilkie was an infantry officer in the [[Australian Army]].&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;[https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=C2T Mr Andrew Wilkie MP], Australian Parliament House Biographies; 19 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkie served with the Australian Army from 1980 to 2004. An officer with the [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps]] who had earlier commanded a company of the [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]],&lt;ref name="Green Left Weekly"&gt;[https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/independent-mp-andrew-wilkie-bring-our-troops-home-afghanistan: Independent MP Andrew Wilkie - Bring our troops home from Afghanistan]; 19 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his entry to public life  Wilkie was posted to Australia's [[Office of National Assessments]] as an [[Intelligence analysis|intelligence analyst]]. In 2003, in the lead-up to the [[Iraq War]], he resigned from his position at ONA  because he feared the humanitarian consequences of invasion, such as [[Saddam Hussein]] using his weapons of mass destruction or assisting terrorists. Following his resignation he said: Iraq's "weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way." He opposed [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Australia's contribution]] to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] under the [[Howard government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/s804540.htm Senior intelligence officer, Andrew Wilkie, resigns in protest]; ABC Radio; AM Program; 12 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1037355.htm |title=PM – Andrew Wilkie discusses WMD doubts |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a "lie".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-07/wilkie-blames-bali-bombing-lindt-siege-on-iraq-war-involvement/7576480 Chilcot report: Andrew Wilkie blames Bali bombing, Lindt Cafe siege on Australia's Iraq War involvement]; ABC News; 7 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkie has been active in politics since 2003.

In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of [[Division of Denison (state)|Denison]] at the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|Tasmanian state election]], narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the [[Division of Denison|federal seat of Denison]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences.&lt;ref name="DenisonOfficial2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-15508-194.htm |work=Election 2010 Virtual Tally Room: The official election results |title=TAS DIVISION – DENISON |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |year=2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827165541/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-15508-194.htm |archivedate=27 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]] and increased his margin.

==Early life and education==
Wilkie trained at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]]&lt;ref name="Wilkie, 2004 p. 2"&gt;Wilkie, 2004 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in 1984.&lt;ref name="speech"/&gt; He joined the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] while a cadet. He also studied at the [[University of New South Wales]], and holds a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, a Graduate Diploma of Management, and a Graduate Diploma of Defence Studies. After graduation and being stationed in Brisbane, he joined the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] before allowing his membership to lapse.&lt;ref name="pastures"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/09/1070732214670.html |title=Former spy eyes greener pastures |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=10 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His military career spanned 1980–2001 and he rose to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="Wilkie, 2004, back cover"&gt;Wilkie, 2004, back cover&lt;/ref&gt; He was seconded to the ONA, an Australian [[intelligence agency]], from 1999 until late 2000.&lt;ref name="Wilkie, 2004, back cover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hansard"/&gt; After a stint with US defence company [[Raytheon]],&lt;ref name="Wilkie, 2004 p. 2"/&gt; Wilkie returned to the ONA shortly after the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].&lt;ref name="Wilkie, 2004, back cover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hansard"/&gt;

==Military career, 1980—2003==
Wilkie joined the Army in 1980, and was first stationed in [[Brisbane, Queensland]]. He served in the [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps]] and achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel]]. He was discharged in 2001.&lt;ref name="APH" /&gt;

===Opposition of Iraq War, and aftermath (2001–2003)===
In the aftermath of the September 11 Terror Attacks, the United States called upon Australia to assist in enforcing the 1991 Gulf War peace treaty which had been [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|repeatedly breached by Saddam Hussein's Iraq]]. Iraq failed to comply with demands to allow unfettered arms inspections, and the [[Howard Government]] elected to send forces to support the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. While the Government was considering the case for war, Wilkie was asked to report on humanitarian considerations. According to a leaked report published in the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', in December 2002 Wilkie had submitted an ONA report on the humanitarian implications of war in Iraq to the Government. In it he cautioned against unpredictable but potentially serious humanitarian consequences of war against Saddam, such as the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/not_just_a_leak_but_a_lie/P20/ Not just a leak but a lie]; ''Herald Sun''; 13 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[popular opposition to war on Iraq|widespread opposition to the war]], Wilkie gave extensive television interviews and accepted numerous offers of public speaking engagements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He subsequently gave evidence to official British and Australian inquiries into the government's case for involvement in the Iraq war.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/joint/commttee/j6782.pdf |title=Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction |publisher=Official Committee Hansard, Commonwealth of Australia |date=22 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Wilkie published ''Axis of Deceit'', an account of the reasons for his decision and its results.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his views on the nature of intelligence agencies and the analyst's work, the history of the Iraq war, the untruths of politicians and the attempts to suppress the truth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Following Britain's 2016 [[Chilcot Report]] which criticised the Blair Government's prosecution of the war, Wilkie attributed all terror attacks against Australians since the Iraq invasion to the nation's involvement in the Iraq War. Wilkie said that Howard, Bush and Blair should be brought before an international court, and called for Australia to hold another inquiry into the war.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; Howard rejected Wilkie's proposition and called him "irrational", telling the media: "Andrew Wilkie said the Iraq invasion was responsible for the Bali attack of 2005. What about the Bali attack of 2002? And he blamed it [the Iraq War] on the Lindt Cafe siege. I mean, this is irrational."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-07/chilcot-inquiry-john-howard-responds/7577306 Chilcot report: John Howard defends decision to send Australian troops to Iraq]; ABC News online, 7 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation from ONA (2003)===
On 11 March 2003, Wilkie resigned from the ONA, asserting that while Iraq likely did possess weapons of mass destruction, its program in this area was contained, that international sanctions were having an effect, and therefore an invasion was premature and also reckless in potentially provoking Saddam Hussein to use those weapons and possibly even begin supporting terrorism.&lt;ref name="Lateline interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s804475.htm |title=Lateline – 11/03/2003: Senior intelligence officer resigns over Iraq .

For a start, Iraq does not pose a security threat to any other country at this point in time. Its military is very weak, it's a fraction of the size of the military at the time of the invasion of Kuwait. Its weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/s804540.htm Senior intelligence officer, Andrew Wilkie, resigns in protest]; ABC Radio, AM Program; 12 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie later told the press that in the lead up to his resignation he had increasingly encountered [[ethical dilemma|ethical conflict]] between his duty as an intelligence officer and his "respect for the truth".&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressclubonline.com/Assets/33/1/AndrewWilkieSpeech.pdf |format=PDF |title=Club Lunch – Speaker Andrew Wilkie |publisher=Melbourne Press Club |date= 31 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his later political career, Wilkie said that the notion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and co-operated with terrorists had been "a lie" and denounced other politicians who had made the claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-07/wilkie-blames-bali-bombing-lindt-siege-on-iraq-war-involvement/7576480 Chilcot report: Andrew Wilkie blames Bali bombing, Lindt Cafe siege on Australia's Iraq War involvement]; ABC News online, 7 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career, 2004—present==
===Candidacy for Australian Greens (2004–2008)===

Wilkie was a member of the [[Australian Greens]] by 2004 and stood unsuccessfully on the Tasmanian Senate ticket in 2007. He resigned from the party in 2008, criticising it for a lack of professionalism.&lt;ref name="AbcProfile2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/26/2994143.htm |title=Who is Andrew Wilkie? |first=Conor |last=Duffy |work=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100829044014/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/26/2994143.htm| archivedate= 29 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkie stood as the [[Australian Greens]] [[2004 Australian Greens candidates|candidate]] for [[Division of Bennelong|Bennelong]] against [[John Howard]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]].&lt;ref name="pastures"/&gt; He was a supporter of the [['Not happy John!' campaign]] which ran during the election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phillip |last=Hudson |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/09/1097261864643.html |title=Four in a row for Coalition |work=The Age |date=10 October 2004 |location=Canberra, Australia |accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling 16 per cent of the primary vote, Wilkie achieved the fifth-highest Green vote percentage across the nation. This result was a considerable increase from the Greens' [[Australian federal election, 2001|previous (2001) election]] figure of 5%. Although Wilkie's vote was nowhere near enough to win the seat, there was a swing of 3.18% against John Howard, the sitting Liberal Party member and prime minister, who achieved a primary vote of 49.89%, which resulted in the seat being decided on preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-105.htm |title=House of Representatives Division First Preferences |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |date=9 November 2005 |work=Virtual Tally Room |accessdate=29 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100813092913/http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-105.htm| archivedate= 13 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seat reverted to a margin of 5% in [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007]], but Green votes were amongst the preferences that saw Labor's [[Maxine McKew]] defeat Howard.

He was nominated as the Greens' second Tasmanian candidate for the [[Australian Senate]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], behind the Greens federal leader, [[Bob Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Greens-announce-Tasmanian-Senate-ticket/2007/02/16/1171405424983.html |title=Greens announce Tasmanian Senate ticket |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member of Parliament (2010–present)===

; Gillard-Rudd Government
Wilkie stood as an independent candidate in the state [[Division of Denison (state)|Division of Denison]], based around central Hobart, in the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sue |last=Neales |url=http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/03/20/62275_tasmania-news.html |title=Wilkie's Denison punt |work=The Mercury |date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won 8.44 per cent of first preference votes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoral.tas.gov.au/pages/HouseOfAssembly/HoA2010/Results/Denison/DenisonFirst.html Division of Denison – first preference figures], ''Tasmanian Electoral Commission''&lt;/ref&gt; and was beaten by 315 votes by Liberal candidate [[Elise Archer]] after distribution of preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral.tas.gov.au/pages/HouseOfAssembly/HoA2010/Results/Denison/DenisonDist.html |title=Tasmanian Electoral Commission |publisher=Electoral.tas.gov.au |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkie stood as an independent for the federal Division of Denison, which has the same boundaries as the state division, in the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]&lt;ref name="AecVotingInDenison2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/election/tas/denison.htm |title=Voting in the electorate of Denison (tas), 2010 federal election |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won more than 20 per cent of the primary vote.  The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] declared Wilkie the winner on election night, predicting that Wilkie would be vaulted into second place on Green preferences and ultimately take the seat on Liberal preferences.&lt;ref name="AbcCallsDenisonForWilkie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2010/08/distributing-preferences-in-denison.html |first=Antony |last=Green |authorlink=Antony Green |title=Distributing Preferences in Denison |date=24 August 2010 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100825023708/http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2010/08/distributing-preferences-in-denison.html| archivedate= 25 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third count, he picked up enough Green preferences to put him in second place, ahead of the Liberal candidate.  On the fourth count, more than 79 percent of the Liberal candidate's preferences flowed to Wilkie, allowing him to win the seat with just over 51 per cent of the two-candidate-preferred vote.&lt;ref name="DenisonOfficial2010"/&gt; Reportedly, Wilkie benefited from a lacklustre campaign by Labor's candidate, Jonathan Jackson, the son of former longtime state Labor minister [[Judy Jackson]]; Labor lost almost a quarter of its primary vote from 2007, and Labor theoretically tallied a [[two-party-preferred vote|two-party vote]] of more than 65 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/guide/deni/ |title=Denison – Australia Votes &amp;#124; Federal Election 2013 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election, he declared that he would back the [[Australian Labor Party]] minority government, in return for the [[Julia Gillard|Gillard]] government committing $340 million to the [[Royal Hobart Hospital]] and a commitment to reduce problem gambling.&lt;ref name="RodgersAbc"/&gt; In contrast the Coalition offered A$1 billion in funding for the same hospital in their offer to Wilkie, which was perceived by Wilkie as "almost reckless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Leslie |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/03/3001227.htm |title=Abbott's 'reckless' offer pushed Wilkie to Labor |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie described this as being part of the evidence that Labor would better be able to offer a more stable, competent and ethical government than the Coalition.

In April 2011 during push for gambling reform initiated by Wilkie, [[News Limited]] media reported allegations by a former Duntroon army cadet that in 1983 Wilkie had forced junior cadets to salute to [[Adolf Hitler]] on the 50th anniversary of the latter's rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2011/s3192529.htm |title=Wilkie admits bastardising Duntroon cadets |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Wilkie said he had been "involved in bastardisation of teenage army cadets" at Duntroon during the 1980s and apologised for this "inappropriate behaviour" but could not recall the specific incident alleged.&lt;ref name="HeraldSun"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/andrew-wilkie-caught-up-in-nazi-salute-allegation/story-e6frf7jo-1226039348399 |title=Andrew Wilkie caught up in Nazi salute allegation |first=Andrew |last=Rule |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the allegation and its publication, he accused pro-[[Poker machine|Pokies]] advocates of running a smear campaign against him.&lt;ref name="HeraldSun"/&gt;

On 21 January 2012 Wilkie announced that he was withdrawing his support for the Labor government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Julia Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government.&lt;ref name="Wilkie withdraws support"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wilkie withdraws support over broken pokies deal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-21/wilkie-withdraws-support-over-broken-pokies-deal/3786040|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillard and [[Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] [[Jenny Macklin]] argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically infeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.&lt;ref name="PM unveils compromise deal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Peatling|first=Stephanie|title=PM unveils compromise deal over pokies reform|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/pm-unveils-compromise-deal-over-pokies-reform-20120121-1qb1m.html|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making his announcement, Wilkie stated that he would only support motions of no confidence against the government "in the event of serious misconduct" and would "consider budget measures on their merits".&lt;ref name="PM unveils compromise deal" /&gt;

; Abbott-Turnbull Government

Wilkie was reelected in the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], gaining a swing of 15 points to increase his majority to 65 percent.

In October 2014, Wilkie wrote to the [[International Criminal Court]], seeking to prosecute Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] and the 19 members of his cabinet for crimes against humanity, with particular concerns relating to the treatment of asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/andrew-wilkie-seeks-to-prosecute-abbott-government-over-inhumane-treatment-of-asylum-seekers/story-fncynjr2-1227098266151 |title=Andrew Wilkie seeks to prosecute Abbott Government over 'inhumane' treatment of asylum seekers |publisher=News.com.au |date=2014-10-22 |accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
&lt;!-- This entire paragraph is sourced from the cite at the end of it. --&gt;
Wilkie made the removal of [[poker machine]]s his primary campaign issue in the 2010 Tasmanian state election. He strongly opposed to the [[Bell Bay Pulp Mill|Gunns pulp mill]] in the Tamar Valley. Wilkie is a supporter of [[voluntary euthanasia]], provided that there are safeguards in place, he is also in favour of [[same-sex marriage]] and access to abortion.  He supported a [[National Broadband Network]] and opposed the Howard Government's [[WorkChoices]] industrial relations reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Wilkie – Independent Candidate for Denison |url=http://www.andrewwilkie.org/content/index.php/site/issues |accessdate=29 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824193012/http://www.andrewwilkie.org/content/index.php/site/issues |archivedate=24 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Wilkie's maiden speech to federal parliament on 30 September 2010, he called for withdrawal of Australian troops from [[Afghanistan]]. He said Australia should be more willing to say "no" more often to the United States. He said that there could be no hope for peace in Afghanistan until foreign troops are withdrawn:  "No-one should be fooled by the Australian Government's periodic efforts to tinker around the edges with Australia's commitment to Afghanistan" and that "The reality is that the best plan the Australian Government can come up with so far is simply to continue to support whatever the US Government comes up with and that alone is no plan—it's just reinforcing failure."

Wilkie's comments came amid opposition calls for more support for Australia's troops in Afghanistan. During his speech Wilkie also canvassed his push for legislation to protect [[whistleblower]]s, measures to tackle problem gambling and a more humane approach to asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilkie takes stand against Afghan war |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/30/3025977.htm |accessdate=1 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101003151043/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/30/3025977.htm| archivedate= 3 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 he called Liberal MPs [[Cory Bernardi]] and [[Scott Morrison]] "a disgrace to high office" calling on [[Tony Abbott]] to sack them both and referring to endemic racism in the Liberal party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/independent-andrew-wilkie-calls-on-abbott-to-lance-the-boil-of-racism-in-his-party/story-fn59niix-1226014258266|title=Independent Andrew Wilkie calls on Abbott to 'lance the boil' of racism in his party|last=Kelly|first=Joe|date=1 March 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=2 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051149/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/independent-andrew-wilkie-calls-on-abbott-to-lance-the-boil-of-racism-in-his-party/story-fn59niix-1226014258266| archivedate= 6 March 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pokies and pre-commitment===
Wilkie campaigned heavily against [[poker machine]]s (colloquially "pokies") at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] and immediately began forging ties with independent anti-pokies Senator [[Nick Xenophon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s2994058.htm |title=Wilkie, Xenophon team up against pokies: ABC The World Today 26 August 2010 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=2 October 1980 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie claimed that problem gamblers in Australia lose $5 billion each year on pokies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewwilkie.org/content/index.php/aw/issues_policy_extended/C18 |title=Poker Machines |publisher=AndrewWilkie.org |accessdate=19 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117020825/http://www.andrewwilkie.org/content/index.php/aw/issues_policy_extended/C18 |archivedate=17 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labor government gave two commitments regarding pokies in exchange for Wilkie's support.

The [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) aligned themselves with the campaign in opposing the pre-commitment plans, as did some prominent [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) people. Commentators from the [[Nine Network]] gave planned political arguments without disclosure during commentary of a Semi-final NRL game, prompting the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) to investigate, stating "Channel Nine broadcast political material without adequately identifying it as such during the NRL first preliminary final". One of the accused commentators stated that the remarks were a "directive from up top that it be read by at least somebody". Investigations were predicted to take months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=clubsnsw |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CVxAlyGRdI |title=Channel 9 support campaign against MPC during NRL semi-final broadcast |publisher=YouTube |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maiden |first=Samantha |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/andrew-wilkie-blows-the-whistle-on-channel-nine/story-e6freuy9-1226155203893 |title=Andrew Wilkie blows the whistle on Channel Nine: Daily Telegraph 2 October 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/media-watchdog-to-probe-nrl-commentators-20111004-1l6is.html |title=Media watchdog to probe NRL commentators |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-04/ch9-investigated-over-pokies-comments/3208422 |title=Channel Nine investigated over pokies comments: ABC 4 October 2011 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Demetriou]], chief executive officer of the AFL, rejected suggestions that the AFL was joining Clubs Australia in their media campaign despite opposition to the plan by Collingwood president Eddie McGuire.

An '''Austrophile''' is somebody who is fond of [[Austrian culture]] and [[Austria]] in general but not born there. Historically it could be applied to the wider [[Austrian Empire]], but since 1918, it has applied to the more limited boundaries of the modern [[nation-state]] of [[Austria]]. It was later sometimes taken as part of a wider [[Germanophile]] attitude and generally linked to the admiration of the Germanic culture of the German-speaking world or countries, mainly Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

== History ==
The term ”austrophile” carried different meanings throughout history. The term was used to refer to 19th Century Austrian nationalist societies that were trying to resist the strong cultural influence that the [[German Empire]] carried in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Hapsburg Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=31LMY9S8IBIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Theodor Herzl: From Assimilation to Zionism|last=Kornberg|first=Jacques|date=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=0253112591|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, the term was also used to describe citizens of the Austrian Empire who were not ethnically Austrian, but were strong supporters of the Austrian control over their native region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=-qQwBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Balkans and Islam: Encounter, Transformation, Discontinuity, Continuity|last=Furat|first=Ayşe Zişan|last2=Er|first2=Hamit|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781443842839|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=101|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50855647|title=AUSTROPHILE INFLUENCE.|last=|first=|date=1916-01-24|work=Examiner (Launceston, Tas. : 1900 - 1954)|access-date=2018-11-17|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], supporters of the [[House of Habsburg|Hapsburg House]] and its pretender to the throne, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], were known as Austrophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://educalingo.com/en/dic-fr/austrophile|title=AUSTROPHILE - Definition and synonyms of austrophile in the French dictionary|website=educalingo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, during the 18th century, there were a number of prominent Austrophiles, including Prime Minister [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. Austrophiles sought an alliance with Austria against [[Early Modern France|France]]. Opposed to the [[Francophiles]], who saw French dominance in Europe as inevitable both culturally and militarily, they obtained the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance]].The movement led to British support for the Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]] during the [[Austrian War of Succession]]. They were opposed by the Austrophobes, who tried to draw attention to Austria's perceived autocracy and suppression of Protestant minorities.

'''Benchmarking''' is comparing ones business processes and [[performance metric]]s to industry bests and [[best practice]]s from other companies. In [[project management]] benchmarking can also support the selection, planning and delivery of projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Invernizzi|first=Diletta Colette|last2=Locatelli|first2=Giorgio|last3=Brookes|first3=Naomi J.|date=2017-08-01|title=How benchmarking can support the selection, planning and delivery of nuclear decommissioning projects|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149197017301075|journal=Progress in Nuclear Energy|volume=99|pages=155–164|doi=10.1016/j.pnucene.2017.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost. In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the "targets") to one's own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful. According to National Council on Measurement in Education, benchmark assessments &lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education (USA) http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorB {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorB |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are short assessments used by teachers at various times throughout the school year to monitor student progress in some area of the school curriculum. These also are known as interim assessments.

Benchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific [[Performance indicator|indicator]] (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.&lt;ref&gt;Fifer, R. M. (1989). [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1696939&amp;show=abstract Cost benchmarking functions in the value chain.] Strategy &amp; Leadership, 17(3), 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also referred to as "best practice benchmarking" or "process benchmarking", this process is used in management which particularly shows VEMR [[strategic management]], in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best practice companies' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.

== History ==
The term '''benchmark''', originates from the history of guns and ammunition, and with the same aim as for the business term; comparison and improved performance. The introduction of gunpowder arms replaced the bow and arrow from the archer, the soldier who used the bow. The archer now had to adapt to the new situation, and learn to handle the gun. The new weapon left only a mark on the target, where the arrow used to be visible, and with the bow gone, the soldiers title changed to [[marksman]], the man who put the mark. The gun was improved already in the early beginning, with rifling of the barrel, and the rifle was born. With the industrialization of the weapon-industry in the mid-1800's, The mass production of ammunition as a cartridge replaced the manual loading of black-powder and bullet into the gun. Now, with standardized production of both the high-precision rifle, as well as the cartridge, the marksman was now the uncertain variable, and with different qualities and specifications on both rifle as well as ammunition, there was a need for a method of finding the best combination. The rifled weapon was fixed in a bench, making it possible to fire several identical shots at a target to measure the spread. This is benchmarking, as it is still done today, both at the gun-factory, the ammunition-factory, as well as for a lot of sportsmen who look for the best ammunition to bring to competition.  

Benchmarking is most used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others. In 1994, one of the first technical journal named [[Benchmarking (journal)|''Benchmarking: An International Journal'']] was published.

In 2008, a comprehensive survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbenchmarking.ipk.fraunhofer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/GBN/PDF/2010_gbn_survey_business_improvement_and_benchmarking_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803220401/http://www.globalbenchmarking.ipk.fraunhofer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/GBN/PDF/2010_gbn_survey_business_improvement_and_benchmarking_web.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on benchmarking was commissioned by The Global Benchmarking Network, a network of benchmarking centres representing 22 countries.

# Mission and Vision Statements and Customer (Client) Surveys are the most used (by 77% of organizations) of 20 improvement tools, followed by [[SWOT analysis]] (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) (72%), and Informal Benchmarking (68%). [[Performance Benchmarking]] was used by 49% and Best Practice Benchmarking by 39%.
# The tools that are likely to increase in popularity the most over the next three years are Performance Benchmarking, Informal Benchmarking, SWOT, and Best Practice Benchmarking. Over 60% of organizations that are not currently using these tools indicated they are likely to use them in the next three years. benchmarking mainly depends on SWOT analysis and will also be using in future for almost 4-5 years.

== Procedure ==
There is no single benchmarking process that has been universally adopted. The wide appeal and acceptance of benchmarking has led to the emergence of benchmarking methodologies. One seminal book is Boxwell's ''Benchmarking for Competitive Advantage'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Benchmarking for Competitive Advantage |first=Robert J|last= Boxwell Jr |year=1994 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Robert J Boxwell Jr, New York |isbn=0-07-006899-2 |pages=225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book on benchmarking, written and published by [[Kaiser Associates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beating the competition: a practical guide to Benchmarking |year=1988 |publisher=Kaiser Associates |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-56365-018-5 |pages=176 |url=http://www.kaiserassociates.com/cs/first_book_on_benchmarking |access-date=2009-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827003927/http://www.kaiserassociates.com/cs/first_book_on_benchmarking |archive-date=2009-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a practical guide and offers a seven-step approach. Robert Camp (who wrote one of the earliest books on benchmarking in 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Camp, R. (1989). The search for industry best practices that lead to superior performance. Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 12-stage approach to benchmarking.

The 12 stage methodology consists of:
# Select subject
# Define the process
# Identify potential partners
# Identify data sources
# Collect data and select all partners
# Determine the gap
# Establish process differences
# Target future performance
# Communicate
# Adjust goal
# Implement
# Review and recalibrate

The following is an example of a typical benchmarking methodology:

* Identify problem areas: Because benchmarking can be applied to any business process or function, a range of research techniques may be required. They include informal conversations with customers, employees, or suppliers; [[qualitative marketing research|exploratory research]] techniques such as [[focus group]]s; or in-depth [[marketing research]], [[Quantitative marketing research|quantitative research]], [[Statistical survey|surveys]], [[questionnaire construction|questionnaires]], re-engineering analysis, process mapping, quality control variance reports, financial ratio analysis, or simply reviewing cycle times or other performance indicators. Before embarking on comparison with other organizations it is essential to know the organization's function and processes; base lining performance provides a point against which improvement effort can be measured.
* Identify other industries that have similar processes: For instance, if one were interested in improving hand-offs in addiction treatment one would identify other fields that also have hand-off challenges. These could include air traffic control, cell phone switching between towers, transfer of patients from surgery to recovery rooms.
* Identify organizations that are leaders in these areas: Look for the very best in any industry and in any country. Consult customers, suppliers, financial analysts, trade associations, and magazines to determine which companies are worthy of study.
* Survey companies for measures and practices: Companies target specific business processes using detailed surveys of measures and practices used to identify business process alternatives and leading companies. Surveys are typically masked to protect confidential data by neutral associations and consultants.
* Visit the "best practice" companies to identify leading edge practices: Companies typically agree to mutually exchange information beneficial to all parties in a benchmarking group and share the results within the group.
* Implement new and improved business practices: Take the leading edge practices and develop implementation plans which include identification of specific opportunities, funding the project and selling the ideas to the organization for the purpose of gaining demonstrated value from the process.

== Costs ==
The three main types of costs in benchmarking are:
* Visit Costs - This includes hotel rooms, travel costs, meals, a token gift, and lost labor time.
* Time Costs - Members of the benchmarking team will be investing time in researching problems, finding exceptional companies to study, visits, and implementation. This will take them away from their regular tasks for part of each day so additional staff might be required.
* Benchmarking Database Costs - Organizations that institutionalize benchmarking into their daily procedures find it is useful to create and maintain a database of best practices and the companies associated with each best practice now.

The cost of benchmarking can substantially be reduced through utilizing the many internet resources that have sprung up over the last few years. These aim to capture benchmarks and best practices from organizations, business sectors and countries to make the benchmarking process much quicker and cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://logisticsbureau.com/what-is-benchmarking-save-supply-chain-costs/ "What is Benchmarking? Save Supply Chain Costs"] Retrieved 2014-3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical/product benchmarking ==
The technique initially used to compare existing corporate strategies with a view to achieving the best possible performance in new situations (see above), has recently been extended to the comparison of technical products. This process is usually referred to as "technical benchmarking" or "product benchmarking". Its use is well-developed within the automotive industry ("automotive benchmarking"), where it is vital to design products that match precise user expectations, at minimal cost, by applying the best technologies available worldwide. Data is obtained by fully disassembling existing cars and their systems. Such analyses were initially carried out in-house by car makers and their suppliers. However, as these analyses are expensive, they are increasingly being outsourced to companies who specialize in this area. Outsourcing has enabled a drastic decrease in costs for each company (by cost sharing) and the development of efficient tools (standards, software).

== Types ==
Benchmarking can be internal (comparing performance between different groups or teams within an organization) or external (comparing performance with companies in a specific industry or across industries). Within these broader categories, there are three specific types of benchmarking: 1) Process benchmarking, 2) Performance benchmarking and 3) Strategic benchmarking. These can be further detailed as follows:
*Process benchmarking - the initiating firm focuses its observation and investigation of business processes with a goal of identifying and observing the best practices from one or more benchmark firms. Activity analysis will be required where the objective is to benchmark cost and efficiency; increasingly applied to back-office processes where outsourcing may be a consideration. Benchmarking is appropriate in nearly every case where process redesign or improvement is to be undertaking so long as the cost of the study does not exceed the expected benefit.
*Financial benchmarking - performing a financial analysis and comparing the results in an effort to assess your overall competitiveness and productivity.
*Benchmarking from an investor perspective- extending the benchmarking universe to also compare to peer companies that can be considered alternative investment opportunities from the perspective of an investor.
*Benchmarking in the public sector - functions as a tool for improvement and innovation in public administration, where state organizations invest efforts and resources to achieve quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide.
*Performance benchmarking - allows the initiator firm to assess their competitive position by comparing products and services with those of target firms.
*Product benchmarking - the process of designing new products or upgrades to current ones. This process can sometimes involve reverse engineering which is taking apart competitors products to find strengths and weaknesses.
*Strategic benchmarking - involves observing how others compete. This type is usually not industry specific, meaning it is best to look at other industries.
*Functional benchmarking - a company will focus its benchmarking on a single function to improve the operation of that particular function. Complex functions such as Human Resources, Finance and Accounting and Information and Communication Technology are unlikely to be directly comparable in cost and efficiency terms and may need to be disaggregated into processes to make valid comparison.
*Best-in-class benchmarking - involves studying the leading competitor or the company that best carries out a specific function.
*Operational benchmarking  embraces everything from staffing and productivity to office flow and analysis of procedures performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuesoft.com/news-events/medical-practice-benchmarking.html|title=Benchmarking: How to Make the Best Decisions for Your Practice|work=NueMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Energy benchmarking - process of collecting, analysing and relating energy performance data of comparable activities with the purpose of evaluating and comparing performance between or within entities.&lt;ref&gt;prEN16231:2011 Energy Efficiency Benchmarking Methodology, Brussels: CEN, 2011, p5 (Definition 3.2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Entities can include processes, buildings or companies.  Benchmarking may be internal between entities within a single organization, or - subject to confidentiality restrictions - external between competing entities.

== Tools ==
{{further information|List of benchmarking methods and software tools}}
Benchmarking software can be used to organize large and complex amounts of information. Software packages can extend the concept of benchmarking and competitive analysis by allowing individuals to handle such large and complex amounts or strategies. Such tools support different types of benchmarking (see above) and can reduce the above costs significantly.

The emerging technology of benchmarking engines automates the stage of going from data to noteworthy comparative insights, sometimes even expressing the insights in English sentences.

== Metric benchmarking ==
Another approach to making comparisons involves using more aggregative cost or production information to identify strong and weak performing units. The two most common forms of quantitative analysis used in metric benchmarking are data envelope analysis (DEA) and regression analysis. DEA estimates the cost level an efficient firm should be able to achieve in a particular market. In infrastructure regulation, DEA can be used to reward companies/operators whose costs are near the efficient frontier with additional profits. Regression analysis estimates what the average firm should be able to achieve. With regression analysis, firms that performed better than average can be rewarded while firms that performed worse than average can be penalized. Such benchmarking studies are used to create yardstick comparisons, allowing outsiders to evaluate the performance of operators in an industry. Advanced statistical techniques, including [[stochastic frontier analysis]], have been used to identify high and weak performers in industries, including applications to schools, hospitals, water utilities, and electric utilities.&lt;ref name="bokir"&gt;[http://www.regulationbodyofknowledge.org/price-level-regulation/basic-forms-of-regulation/ Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation] "Incentive Regulation: Basic forms of Regulation"&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest challenges for metric benchmarking is the variety of metric definitions used among companies or divisions. Definitions may change over time within the same organization due to changes in leadership and priorities. The most useful comparisons can be made when metrics definitions are common between compared units and do not change so improvements can be changed

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Carl Julius Meyer von Klinggräff''' (26 March 1809 in [[Klein Watkowitz]] in Kreis Stuhm &amp;ndash; 1879) was a German [[botanist]]. He was an older brother to [[bryologist]] [[Hugo Erich Meyer von Klinggräff]] (1820&amp;ndash;1902, H.Klinggr.).

From 1828 to 1832, he studied medicine and botany at the [[University of Königsberg]], where he was influenced by [[Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer]]. In 1832 he received his doctorate in medicine and [[surgery]] with the thesis "''De carie vertebrarum''". Following graduation, he travelled to his parents' home near [[Zagreb]], and on the journey, conducted studies of [[Alpine plant|Alpine flora]] and plants native to the [[Adriatic coast]]. He visited [[Fiume]], [[Trieste]], islands in the [[Gulf of Quarnero]] and made the acquaintanceship of botanists [[Bartolomeo Biasoletto]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Noë]] and [[Mutius von Tommasini]].&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Klinggr%C3%A4ff,_Karl_Julius_Meyer_von ADB:Klinggräff, Karl Julius Meyer von] @ [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 he returned to Prussia, settling in [[Marienwerder]] as a general practitioner. In 1836 he relocated to the town of [[Paleschken]], from where he concentrated on botanical research. During his career, he made numerous trips throughout the [[Province of Prussia]], and in 1844, took an extended journey to [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and northern [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

He made major contributions to the knowledge of Prussian flora, conducting research in the fields of [[phytogeography]], [[plant systematics]] and [[climatology]] as it pertained to botany.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

A '''crater of eternal darkness ''' is a depression on a body in the [[Solar System]] within which lies a point that is always in [[darkness]]. Such a crater must be located at high [[latitude]] (close to a [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]]), and be on a body with very small [[axial tilt]].
[[File:Radar Image of the Lunar South Pole from Jean-Luc Margot's PhD thesis.jpg|thumb|right|Shackleton Crater as imaged by Earth-based [[radar]] is one such crater.]]

Craters of eternal darkness might be advantageous for [[space exploration]] and [[space colonization|colonization]], as they could potentially preserve sources of water.

'''Education Informatics''' is a sub-field of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]]. The primary focus is on computer applications, systems and networks that support research in and delivery of education. Education informatics is based upon [[information science]], [[computer science]] and [[education]] but particularly addresses the intersection of these broad areas. Note that it is distinct from Informatics Education, a term that relates more to the practice of teaching/learning about informatics, rather than the use of information science and technology in the support of teaching and learning. The term has been in use since at least 1980.&lt;ref&gt; Carr, Jo Ann; O'Brien, Nancy P. (2010). "Policy Implications of Education Informatics".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38867">'''Electromagnetic mass''' was initially a concept of [[classical mechanics]], denoting as to how much the [[electromagnetic field]], or the [[self-energy]], is contributing to the mass of [[Electric charge|charged]] particles. It was first derived by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1881 and was for some time also considered as a dynamical explanation of [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] ''per se''. Today, the relation of [[mass]], [[momentum]], [[velocity]] and all forms of energy, including electromagnetic energy, is analyzed on the basis of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] and [[mass–energy equivalence]]. As to the cause of mass of [[elementary particle]]s, the [[Higgs mechanism]] in the framework of the relativistic [[Standard Model]] is currently used. In addition, some problems concerning the electromagnetic mass and self-energy of charged particles are still studied.

==Charged particles==

=== Rest mass and energy ===
It was recognized by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1881&lt;ref name=thomson /&gt; that a charged sphere moving in a space filled with a medium of a specific inductive capacity (the electromagnetic [[luminiferous aether|aether]] of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]), is harder to set in motion than an uncharged body. (Similar considerations were already made by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] (1843) with respect to [[hydrodynamics]], who showed that the inertia of a body moving in an incompressible [[perfect fluid]] is increased.&lt;ref name=stokes /&gt;) So due to this self-induction effect, electrostatic energy behaves as having some sort of [[momentum]] and "apparent" electromagnetic mass, which can increase the ordinary mechanical mass of the bodies, or in more modern terms, the increase should arise from their electromagnetic [[self-energy]]. This idea was worked out in more detail by [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1889),&lt;ref name=heav /&gt; Thomson (1893),&lt;ref name=thomson2 /&gt; [[George Frederick Charles Searle]] (1897),&lt;ref name=searle /&gt; [[Max Abraham]] (1902),&lt;ref name=abraham /&gt; [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1892, 1904),&lt;ref name=lor92 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lor04 /&gt; and was directly applied to the [[electron]] by using the [[Abraham–Lorentz force]]. Now, the electrostatic energy &lt;math&gt;E_{em}&lt;/math&gt; and mass &lt;math&gt;m_{em}&lt;/math&gt; of an electron at rest was calculated to be &lt;ref group=B&gt;Feynman, Ch. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=pais&gt;Pais, pp. 155–159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Miller, pp. 45–47, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_{em}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{a},\qquad m_{em}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{ac^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the charge, uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]], which must be nonzero to avoid infinite energy accumulation. Thus the formula for this electromagnetic energy–mass relation is

:&lt;math&gt;m_{em}=\frac{4}{3}\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

This was discussed in connection with the proposal of the electrical origin of matter, so [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1900),&lt;ref name=wien /&gt; and Max Abraham (1902),&lt;ref name=abraham /&gt; came to the conclusion that the total mass of the bodies is identical to its electromagnetic mass. Wien stated, that if it is assumed that [[gravitation]] is an electromagnetic effect too, then there has to be a proportionality between electromagnetic energy, inertial mass, and gravitational mass. When one body attracts another one, the electromagnetic energy store of gravitation is according to Wien diminished by the amount (where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the attracted mass, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the [[gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the distance):&lt;ref name=wien /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G\frac{\frac{4}{3}\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}M}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]] in 1906 argued that when mass is in fact the product of the electromagnetic field in the aether – implying that no "real" mass exists – and because matter is inseparably connected with mass, then also [[matter]] doesn't exist at all and electrons are only concavities in the aether.&lt;ref name=poinc06b /&gt;

=== Mass and speed ===

====Thomson and Searle====
Thomson (1893) noticed that electromagnetic momentum and energy of charged bodies, and therefore their masses, depend on the speed of the bodies as well. He wrote:&lt;ref name=thomson2 /&gt;

{{Quote|text=''[p. 21] When in the limit v = c, the increase in mass is infinite, thus a charged sphere moving with the velocity of light behaves as if its mass were infinite, its velocity therefore will remain constant, in other words it is impossible to increase the velocity of a charged body moving through the dielectric beyond that of light.''}}

In 1897, Searle gave a more precise formula for the electromagnetic energy of charged sphere in motion:&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_{em}^{v}=E_{em}\left[\frac{1}{\beta}\ln\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}-1\right],\qquad\beta=\frac{v}{c},&lt;/math&gt;

and like Thomson he concluded:
{{Quote|text=''... when v = c the energy becomes infinite, so that it would seem to be impossible to make a charged body move at a greater speed than that of light.''}}

====Longitudinal and transverse mass====
[[File:Abraham-Lorentz-Bucherer.svg|thumb|300px|Abraham-Lorentz-Bucherer|Predictions of speed dependence of transverse electromagnetic mass according to the theories of Abraham, Lorentz, and Bucherer.]]

From Searle's formula, [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1901) and Abraham (1902) derived the formula for the electromagnetic mass of moving bodies:&lt;ref name=abraham /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m_{L}=\frac{3}{4}\cdot m_{em}\cdot\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\left[-\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\ln\left(\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}\right)+\frac{2}{1-\beta^{2}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

However, it was shown by Abraham (1902), that this value is only valid in the longitudinal direction ("longitudinal mass"), i.e., that the electromagnetic mass also depends on the direction of the moving bodies with respect to the aether. Thus Abraham also derived the "transverse mass":&lt;ref name=abraham /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m_{T}=\frac{3}{4}\cdot m_{em}\cdot\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\left[\left(\frac{1+\beta^{2}}{2\beta}\right)\ln\left(\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}\right)-1\right]&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, already in 1899 Lorentz assumed that the electrons undergo [[length contraction]] in the line of motion, which leads to results for the acceleration of moving electrons that differ from those given by Abraham. Lorentz obtained factors of &lt;math&gt;k^3 \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; parallel to the direction of motion and &lt;math&gt;k\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the direction of motion, where &lt;math&gt;k = \sqrt{1- v^2 / c^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an undetermined factor.&lt;ref name=lor99 /&gt; Lorentz expanded his 1899 ideas in his famous 1904 paper, where he set the factor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; to unity, thus:&lt;ref name=lor04 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m_{L}=\frac{m_{em}}{\left(\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)^{3}},\quad m_{T}=\frac{m_{em}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} &lt;/math&gt;,

So, eventually Lorentz arrived at the same conclusion as Thomson in 1893: no body can reach the speed of light because the mass becomes infinitely large at this velocity.

Additionally, a third electron model was developed by [[Alfred Bucherer]] and [[Paul Langevin]], in which the electron contracts in the line of motion, and expands perpendicular to it, so that the volume remains constant.&lt;ref name=bucherer /&gt; This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;m_{L}=\frac{m_{em}\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\right)}{\left(\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)^{8/3}},\quad m_{T}=\frac{m_{em}}{\left(\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)^{2/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Kaufmann's experiments====
The predictions of the theories of Abraham and Lorentz were supported by the experiments of [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1901), but the experiments were not precise enough to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name=kauf02 /&gt; In 1905 Kaufmann conducted another series of experiments ([[Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments]]) which confirmed Abraham's and Bucherer's predictions, but contradicted Lorentz's theory and the "fundamental assumption of Lorentz and Einstein", ''i.e.'', the relativity principle.&lt;ref name=kauf05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kauf06 /&gt; In the following years experiments by [[Alfred Bucherer]] (1908), Gunther Neumann (1914) and others seemed to confirm Lorentz's mass formula. It was later pointed out that the Bucherer–Neumann experiments were also not precise enough to distinguish between the theories – it lasted until 1940 when the precision required was achieved to eventually prove Lorentz's formula and to refute Abraham's by these kinds of experiments. (However, other experiments of different kind already refuted Abraham's and Bucherer's formulas long before.)&lt;ref group=B&gt;Miller (1981), 334–352&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poincaré stresses and 4/3 problem===
The idea of an electromagnetic nature of matter, however, had to be given up. Abraham (1904, 1905)&lt;ref name=abraham04 /&gt; argued that non-electromagnetic forces were necessary to prevent Lorentz's contractile electrons from exploding. He also showed that different results for the longitudinal electromagnetic mass can be obtained in [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentz's theory]], depending on whether the mass is calculated from its energy or its momentum, so a non-electromagnetic potential (corresponding to 1/3 of the electron's electromagnetic energy) was necessary to render these masses equal. Abraham doubted whether it was possible to develop a model satisfying all of these properties.&lt;ref name=abraham05 /&gt;

To solve those problems, [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1905&lt;ref name=poinc05 /&gt; and 1906&lt;ref name=poinc06 /&gt; introduced some sort of pressure ("Poincaré stresses") of non-electromagnetic nature. As required by Abraham, these stresses contribute non-electromagnetic energy to the electrons, amounting to 1/4 of their total energy or to 1/3 of their electromagnetic energy. So, the Poincaré stresses remove the contradiction in the derivation of the longitudinal electromagnetic mass, they prevent the electron from exploding, they remain unaltered by a [[Lorentz transformation]] (''i.e.'' they are Lorentz invariant), and were also thought as a dynamical explanation of [[length contraction]]. However, Poincaré still assumed that only the electromagnetic energy contributes to the mass of the bodies.&lt;ref group=B name=jan&gt;Janssen/Mecklenburg (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was later noted, the problem lies in the 4/3 factor of electromagnetic rest mass – given above as &lt;math&gt;m_{em}=(4/3)E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt; when derived from the Abraham–Lorentz equations. However, when it is derived from the electron's electrostatic energy alone, we have &lt;math&gt;m_{es}=E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt; where the 4/3 factor is missing. This can be solved by adding the non-electromagnetic energy &lt;math&gt;E_{p}&lt;/math&gt; of the Poincaré stresses to &lt;math&gt;E_{em}&lt;/math&gt;, the electron's total energy &lt;math&gt;E_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; now becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_{tot}}{c^{2}}=\frac{E_{em}+E_{p}}{c^{2}}=\frac{E_{em}+\frac{E_{em}}{3}}{c^{2}}=\frac{4}{3}\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}=\frac{4}{3}m_{es}=m_{em}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the missing 4/3 factor is restored when the mass is related to its electromagnetic energy, and it disappears when the total energy is considered.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Miller (1981), 382–383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Janssen/Mecklenburg (2007), pp. 32, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inertia of energy and radiation paradoxes ==

===Radiation pressure===
Another way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of [[radiation pressure]]. These pressures or tensions in the electromagnetic field were derived by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1874) and [[Adolfo Bartoli]] (1876). Lorentz recognized in 1895&lt;ref name=lor95 /&gt; that those tensions also arise in [[Lorentz ether theory|his theory]] of the stationary aether. So if the electromagnetic field of the aether is able to set bodies in motion, the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|action/reaction principle]] demands that the aether must be set in motion by matter as well. However, Lorentz pointed out that any tension in the aether requires the mobility of the aether parts, which in not possible since in his theory the aether is immobile. This represents a violation of the reaction principle that was accepted by Lorentz consciously. He continued by saying, that one can only speak about ''fictitious'' tensions, since they are only mathematical models in his theory to ease the description of the electrodynamic interactions.

===Mass of the fictitious electromagnetic fluid===
In 1900&lt;ref name=poinc00 /&gt; Poincaré studied the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz's theory. He tried to determine whether the [[center of gravity]] still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields and radiation are involved. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum (such a momentum was also derived by Thomson in 1893 in a more complicated way&lt;ref name=thomson2 /&gt;). Poincaré concluded, the electromagnetic field energy behaves like a fictitious [[fluid]] („fluide fictif“) with a mass density of &lt;math&gt;E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt; (in other words &lt;math&gt;m_{em}=E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;). Now, if the [[center of mass frame]] (COM-frame) is defined by both the mass of matter ''and'' the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible – it is neither created or destroyed – then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform.

But this electromagnetic fluid is not indestructible, because it can be absorbed by matter (which according to Poincaré was the reason why he regarded the em-fluid as "fictitious" rather than "real"). Thus the COM-principle would be violated again. As it was later done by Einstein, an easy solution of this would be to assume that the mass of em-field is transferred to matter in the absorption process. But Poincaré created another solution: He assumed that there exists an immobile non-electromagnetic energy fluid at each point in space, also carrying a mass proportional to its energy. When the fictitious em-fluid is destroyed or absorbed, its electromagnetic energy and mass is not carried away by moving matter, but is transferred into the non-electromagnetic fluid and remains at exactly the same place in that fluid. (Poincaré added that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.) In this way, the motion of the COM-frame,  incl. matter, fictitious em-fluid, and fictitious non-em-fluid, at least ''theoretically'' remains uniform.

However, since only matter and electromagnetic energy are directly observable by experiment (not the non-em-fluid), Poincaré's resolution still violates the reaction principle and the COM-theorem, when an emission/absorption process is ''practically'' considered. This leads to a paradox when changing frames: if waves are radiated in a certain direction, the device will suffer a [[recoil]] from the momentum of the fictitious fluid. Then, Poincaré performed a [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz boost]] (to first order in v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow [[perpetual motion]], a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Miller (1981), 41ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=dar&gt;Darrigol (2005), 18–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Poincaré came back to this topic in 1904.&lt;ref name=poinc04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=poinc08 /&gt; This time he rejected his own solution that motions in the ether can compensate the motion of matter, because any such motion is unobservable and therefore scientifically worthless. He also abandoned the concept that energy carries mass and wrote in connection to the above-mentioned recoil:

{{Quote|''The apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy.''}}

===Momentum and cavity radiation===
However, Poincaré's idea of momentum and mass associated with radiation proved to be fruitful, when [[Max Abraham]] introduced&lt;ref name=abraham /&gt; the term „electromagnetic momentum“, having a field density of &lt;math&gt;E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt; per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{em}/c&lt;/math&gt; per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Contrary to Lorentz and Poincaré, who considered momentum as a fictitious force, he argued that it is a real physical entity, and therefore conservation of momentum is guaranteed.

In 1904, [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] specifically associated inertia with ''radiation'' by studying the dynamics of a moving [[Black body|cavity]].&lt;ref name=hasen1 /&gt; Hasenöhrl suggested that part of the mass of a body (which he called ''apparent mass'') can be thought of as radiation bouncing around a cavity. The apparent mass of radiation depends on the temperature (because every heated body emits radiation) and is proportional to its energy, and he first concluded that &lt;math&gt;m=(8/3)E/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. However, in 1905 Hasenöhrl published a summary of a letter, which was written by Abraham to him. Abraham concluded that Hasenöhrl's formula of the apparent mass of radiation is not correct, and on the basis of his definition of electromagnetic momentum and longitudinal electromagnetic mass Abraham changed it to &lt;math&gt;m=(4/3)E/c^2&lt;/math&gt;, the same value for the electromagnetic mass for a body at rest. Hasenöhrl recalculated his own derivation and verified Abraham's result. He also noticed the similarity between the apparent mass and the electromagnetic mass. However, Hasenöhrl stated that this energy-apparent-mass relation ''only'' holds as long a body radiates, i.e. if the temperature of a body is greater than 0 [[kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=hasen2 /&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Miller (1981), 359–360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern view==

===Mass–energy equivalence===
The idea that the principal relations between mass, energy, momentum and velocity can only be considered on the basis of dynamical interactions of matter was superseded, when [[Albert Einstein]] found out in 1905 that considerations based on the special [[principle of relativity]] require that all forms of energy (not only electromagnetic) contribute to the mass of bodies ([[mass–energy equivalence]]).&lt;ref name=einstel /&gt;&lt;ref name=einst05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=einst06 /&gt; That is, the entire mass of a body is a measure of its energy content by &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;, and Einstein's considerations were independent from assumptions about the constitution of matter.&lt;ref group=B name=pais /&gt; By this equivalence, Poincaré's radiation paradox can be solved without using "compensating forces", because the mass of matter itself (not the non-electromagnetic aether fluid as suggested by Poincaré) is increased or diminished by the mass of electromagnetic energy in the course of the emission/absorption process.&lt;ref group=B name=dar /&gt; Also the idea of an electromagnetic explanation of gravitation was superseded in the course of developing [[general relativity]].&lt;ref group=B name=dar /&gt;

So every theory dealing with the mass of a body must be formulated in a relativistic way from the outset. This is for example the case in the current [[Quantum field theory|quantum field]] explanation of mass of [[elementary particle]]s in the framework of the [[Standard Model]], the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Because of this, the idea that any form of mass is ''completely'' caused by interactions with electromagnetic fields, is not relevant any more.

===Relativistic mass===
The concepts of longitudinal and transverse mass (equivalent to those of Lorentz) were also used by Einstein in his first papers on relativity.&lt;ref name=einstel /&gt; However, in special relativity they apply to the entire mass of matter, not only to the electromagnetic part. Later it was shown by physicists like [[Richard Chace Tolman]]&lt;ref name=Tolman /&gt; that expressing mass as the ratio of force and acceleration is not advantageous. Therefore, a similar concept without direction dependent terms, in which force is defined as &lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \mathrm{d}\vec{p}/\mathrm{d}t&lt;/math&gt;, was used as [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]]

:&lt;math&gt;M=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}},\qquad m_{0}=\frac{E}{c^2},&lt;/math&gt;

This concept is sometimes still used in modern physics textbooks, although the term 'mass' is now considered by many to refer to [[invariant mass]], see [[mass in special relativity]].

=== Self-energy ===

When the special case of the electromagnetic [[self-energy]] or self-force of charged particles is discussed, also in modern texts some sort of "effective" electromagnetic mass is sometimes introduced – not as an explanation of mass ''per se'', but in addition to the ordinary mass of bodies.&lt;ref name=rohr group=B&gt;Rohrlich (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Many different reformulations of the [[Abraham–Lorentz force]] have been derived – for instance, in order to deal with the 4/3-problem (see next section) and other problems that arose from this concept. Such questions are discussed in connection with [[renormalization]], and on the basis of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], which must be applied when the electron is considered physically point-like. At distances located in the classical domain, the classical concepts again come into play.&lt;ref name=rohr group=B /&gt; A rigorous derivation of the electromagnetic self-force, including the contribution to the mass of the body, was published by Gralla et al. (2009).&lt;ref name=gralla /&gt;

=== 4/3 problem ===
[[Max von Laue]] in 1911&lt;ref name=laue /&gt; also used the [[Abraham–Lorentz force|Abraham–Lorentz]] equations of motion in his development of special relativistic dynamics, so that also in special relativity the 4/3-factor is present when the electromagnetic mass of a charged sphere is calculated. This contradicts the mass–energy equivalence formula, which requires the relation &lt;math&gt;m_{em}=E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt; without the 4/3 factor, or in other words, four-momentum doesn't properly transform like a [[four-vector]] when the 4/3 factor is present. Laue found a solution equivalent to Poincaré's introduction of a non-electromagnetic potential (Poincaré stresses), but Laue showed its deeper, relativistic meaning by employing and advancing [[Hermann Minkowski]]'s [[spacetime]] formalism. Laue's formalism required that there are additional components and forces, which guarantee that spatially extended systems (where both electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic energies are combined) are forming a stable or "closed system" and transform as a four-vector. That is, the 4/3 factor arises only with respect to electromagnetic mass, while the closed system has total rest mass and energy of &lt;math&gt;m_{tot}=E_{tot}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=B name=jan /&gt;

Another solution was found by authors such as [[Enrico Fermi]] (1922),&lt;ref name=fermi /&gt; [[Paul Dirac]] (1938)&lt;ref name=dirac /&gt; Fritz Rohrlich (1960),&lt;ref name=rohrlich /&gt; or [[Julian Schwinger]] (1983),&lt;ref name=schwinger /&gt; who pointed out that the electron's stability and the 4/3-problem are two different things. They showed that the preceding definitions of four-momentum are non-relativistic ''per se'', and by  changing the definition into a relativistic form, the electromagnetic mass can simply be written as &lt;math&gt;m_{em}=E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt; and thus the 4/3 factor doesn't appear at all. So every part of the system, not only "closed" systems, properly transforms as a four-vector. However, binding forces like the Poincaré stresses are still necessary to prevent the electron from exploding due to Coulomb repulsion. But on the basis of the Fermi–Rohrlich definition, this is only a dynamical problem and has nothing to do with the transformation properties any more.&lt;ref group=B name=jan /&gt;

Also other solutions have been proposed, for instance, [[Valery Morozov]] (2011)&lt;ref name=Morozov /&gt; gave consideration to movement of an imponderable charged sphere. It turned out that a flux of nonelectromagnetic energy exists in the sphere body. This flux has an impulse exactly equal to 1/3 of the sphere electromagnetic impulse regardless of a sphere internal structure or a material, it is made of. The problem was solved without attraction of any additional hypotheses. In this model, sphere tensions are not connected with its mass.&lt;ref group=B name=jan /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6284">'''Etheric force''' is a term [[Thomas Edison]] coined to describe a [[phenomenon]] later understood as [[high frequency]] [[electromagnetic waves]]—effectively, [[radio]]. Edison believed it was the mysterious force that some believed pervaded the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]].

At the end of 1875, Edison and his assistants were experimenting with the [[Acoustic Telegraph]] when they noticed that a rapidly vibrating spark gap produced a spark in an adjacent relay.&lt;ref name=wills&gt;Wills, Ian. 2009. Edison and science: A curious result. ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A'' 40 (June):157-166&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigation showed that the phenomenon could be made to occur at a distance of several feet without interconnecting cables. Edison, with this small amount of evidence, announced that it was "a true unknown force" &lt;ref&gt;Israel, Paul B. 1998. ''Edison: A life of invention.'' New York: John Wiley. p.111&lt;/ref&gt; since he believed that the spark transmitted electricity without carrying any charge.&lt;ref name=gorman&gt;{{cite book |title= Transforming nature: ethics, invention and discovery |author= Michael E. Gorman |edition= illustrated |publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers (now merged with Springer) |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-7923-8120-3 |page= 116 |url= http://bart.tcc.virginia.edu/book/chap3/chapter3sec1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison concluded that this discovery had the potential to cheapen [[telegraphic]] communication and to allow [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cables]] to be laid without [[Electrical insulation|insulation]]. He was also interested in finding new forces as a means for providing scientific explanations for [[spiritualist]], [[occult]] and other allegedly [[supernatural]] phenomena following his disenchantment with [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].

Edison's apparatus consisted of a spark gap vibrating at a high frequency powered by batteries and connected to tin foil sheet about 12 by 8&amp;nbsp;inches, effectively  acting as an antenna. A similar tin foil sheet, connected to ground was located at about eight feet away with two more similar, un-grounded tin foil sheets between. Sparks could be seen at the "receiver" sheets. Effectively, Edison had observed wireless transmission and was later to regret that he had not pursued it.&lt;ref name=wills /&gt;

Edison's last laboratory notebook entry on etheric force in 1875, which shows his experimental apparatus, can be seen at [http://edison.rutgers.edu/images/ac/ac0211.jpg The Edison Papers].

==Controversy==
Thomas Edison announced the discovery, which he called ''etheric force'', to the press and reports began to appear in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] newspapers from November 29, 1875. While etheric force initially met with an enthusiastic reception, sceptics began to question whether it truly was a new phenomenon or merely a consequence of some already known phenomenon such as [[electromagnetic induction]]. Leaders among the doubters were James Ashley, editor of the ''[[Telegrapher]]'', the inventor [[Elihu Thomson]] and [[Edwin Houston]], a high school teacher with whom Thomson had studied. Thomson and Houston conducted a series of careful experiments where they discovered that the sparks actually carried a charge,&lt;ref name=gorman /&gt; and they announced their results, not in the popular press as Edison had done, but in a scientific journal, the ''[[Journal of the Franklin Institute]]''. This prompted a reply from Edison, more experiments and more scientific papers.&lt;ref name=wills/&gt;

Nevertheless, Edison found support from a fellow diner at [[Delmonico's]]: [[George Miller Beard]] had experimented with electrophysiology, and enthusiastically promoted Edison's new force, most significantly in the pages of [[Scientific American]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Miller Beard]] (22 January 1876) "The Nature of the Newly Discovered Force", [[Scientific American]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niel Baldwin (2001) ''Edison: Inventing the Century'', pages 64,5, [[University of Chicago Press]] {{ISBN|0226035719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scepticism is not easily explained on scientific grounds as [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had predicted such waves in 1864 (confirmed by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1889).&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, Heinrich. 1893. ''Electric waves: being researches on the propagation of electric action with finite velocity through space.'' Reprint, New York: Dover (1962) Available from http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.cdl/docviewer?did=cdl334&amp;view=50&amp;frames=0&amp;seq=5.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative reception is perhaps better understood as a result of Edison's uneasy relationship with the professional scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A. 1980. Edison and the pure science ideal in 19th-century America. ''Science'' 207 (4431):612-617.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the controversy increased to the point where Edison was pressured by his principal financial backers, [[Western Union]], to desist from etheric force research and publicity over it, and to devote himself to what Western Union saw as more commercially viable projects. Edison abandoned work despite having been able to send signals twenty to thirty feet. He also drafted, but did not file, a patent application for an "etheric telegraph" before he abandoned etheric force.

==Later development==
In 1885 Edison again took up investigation of transmission by spark while working on a [[railway telegraph system]] and was able to get transmission of five hundred feet.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, Paul B. 1998. ''Edison: A life of invention''. New York: John Wiley. p.239&lt;/ref&gt; Edison thought it might be suitable for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication, taking out a patent&lt;ref&gt;Edison, Thomas A. 1885. ''Means for transmitting signals electrically''. US patent 465,971 filed 23 May 1885, and issued 29 December 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; for the system. Edison did not develop the patent commercially but according to his former assistant Francis Jehl, sold it to [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who developed it into radio.&lt;ref&gt;Jehl, Francis. 1937. ''Menlo Park reminiscences: Written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory''. Vol. 1. Dearborn, Michigan: Edison Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5186">In [[linguistics]], '''feminization''' has two mutually independent meanings.

First, it refers to the process of re-classifying [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s which as such refer to male beings, including [[Job|occupational]] terms, as feminine. This is done most of the time by adding inflectional [[suffix]]es denoting a female (such as the standard suffix ''[[wiktionary:-ess|-ess]]'' in English, and its equivalent ''[[wiktionary:-a#Spanish|-a]]'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mINlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2635&amp;lpg=PA2635&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p4RDWcmlbX&amp;sig=Q4QgBWuZOuhR6JYYfRCgYWhJKRw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_t6AiPPPAhXCLMAKHYZrCoUQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22&amp;f=false|title=Word-Formation: An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe|last=Müller|first=Peter|date=2016|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|isbn=|location=|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages with [[grammatical gender]], for example [[Dutch language|Dutch]], there is a tendency to assign the feminine gender to certain – in particular [[Abstract noun|abstract]] – nouns which are originally masculine or neuter. This also happened to some words in [[Middle English]] (which, in contrast to [[Modern English]], had grammatical gender) which denoted virtue and vice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=pfKty8gnVPAC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22+pronouns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LCmbB2_R7l&amp;sig=q4qJrYFWpBr_skuQXYlgCpRSmFs&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAppigkfPPAhVIJMAKHXwcBREQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22%20pronouns&amp;f=false|title=English Historical Linguistics and Philology in Japan|author=Jacek Fisiak, Akio Oizumi|date=1998|publisher=|isbn=|location=|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Modern English, in spite of it being a [[gender-neutral language]], certain non-human things that are usually neuter are still sometimes feminized by way of [[figure of speech]], especially countries and ships (see also {{slink|Gender in English|Ships}}, {{slink|Gender in English|Modern English}}).

== In Feminist Theory ==
Feminists believe the use of the generic masculine to refer to someone who's gender is unknown erases women and should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mucchi-Faina|first=Angelica|date=2016-06-30|title=Visible or influential? Language reforms and gender (in)equality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0539018405050466|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=189–215|doi=10.1177/0539018405050466}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of arguments against such prescriptive rules however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parks|first=Janet B.|date=1998|title=Contemporary Arguments Against Nonsexist Language: Blaubergs (1980) Revisited|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=39|pages=445–461|via=Plenum Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization in Various Languages ==

=== French ===
Double gender marking is prevalent in radical political pamphlets and manifestos. This is difficult to track, however, as these types of publications are written by many groups and tend to be published by organizations that don't keep detailed records of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbou|first=Julie|date=2011-02-01|title=Double gender marking in French: a linguistic practice of antisexism|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14664208.2010.541387|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=12|issue=1|pages=55–75|doi=10.1080/14664208.2010.541387|issn=1466-4208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian ===
Female members of a profession can be referred to with the masculine ending -e (eg. presidente) or the feminine -essa (eg. presidentessa). A 2001 study by Mucchi-Faina and Barro showed that women professionals are more persuasive when using the masculine ending while a 2012 study by Merkel et al. show there was no difference in perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=Elisa|last2=Maass|first2=Anne|last3=Frommelt|first3=Laura|date=2012-05-16|title=Shielding Women Against Status Loss|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X12446599|journal=Journal of Language and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=311–320|doi=10.1177/0261927x12446599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian ===
Noun declension is asymmetrical in Russian. Women can be referred to with suffixes of the first or second declension but men can only be referred to with first declension suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gurevich|first=Olga|date=2006|title=Lexicon and Context in Feminization in Russian|journal=Russian Linguistics|volume=30|pages=175–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German ===
''Man'' is commonly used to mean 'one' and is frequently used in general statements. It is similar to English indefinite "you" or "one."
Feminine job titles are usually created by adding -in to the grammatically masculine word in question. Informatiker (singular or plural). The feminine form is Informatikerin (singular) and Informatikerinnen (plural).

'''Folding@home''' ('''FAH''' or '''F@h''') is a [[distributed computing]] project for disease research that simulates [[protein folding]], computational [[drug design]], and other types of [[molecular dynamics]]. The project uses the [[Idle (CPU)|idle processing resources]] of thousands of [[personal computer]]s owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which [[protein]]s reach their [[Protein tertiary structure|final three-dimensional structure]], and to examine the causes of [[protein misfolding]]. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for [[medical research]] into [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], and many forms of [[cancer]], among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to [[Protein structure prediction|predict]] a protein's [[native state|final structure]] and determine how other molecules may [[Protein–ligand docking|interact]] with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. [[Vijay Pande]], and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.&lt;ref name="About FAH"/&gt;

The project has pioneered the use of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt; As part of the [[client–server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.

Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems, with a speed of approximately 135 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]]&lt;ref name="Folding stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=osstats2 | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Stanford University | accessdate = 2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|01|2|alt=as of January 2018}}. This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October&amp;nbsp;1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 139 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt; Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.1003962107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature01160"/&gt;

{{further|Protein folding}}
[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|300px|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]

[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a ''holy grail'' of [[computational biology]].&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.309.5731.78b"/&gt; Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.&lt;ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/&gt; Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011"/&gt;

Due to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447"/&gt; before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/&gt; General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.&lt;ref name="978-1-58603-796-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1002/bip.10219"/&gt; Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1137/06065146X"/&gt;

[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|left|thumb|400px|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]
Protein folding does not occur in one step.&lt;ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/&gt; Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/&gt; ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/ct900620b"/&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="typepad: how far FAH has come"/&gt; In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature01160"/&gt; and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&amp;nbsp;million CPU hours of computing.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.1010880108"/&gt; In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.3390/ijms11125292"/&gt; In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.&lt;ref name="2010 KPS award"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSMBuilder source"/&gt; For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate Bárány Award for Young Investigators for "developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding",&lt;ref name="Biophysical society names recipients"/&gt; and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which "''have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.''"&lt;ref name="FAH Awards"/&gt;

== Biomedical research ==
Protein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&amp;nbsp;II diabetes]].&lt;ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Protein Misfolding Diseases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.&lt;ref name="978-0-340-66316-5"/&gt; Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature02265"/&gt; The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011"/&gt; such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref name="10.1093/bib/bbp023"/&gt; The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;

The simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt; but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.&lt;ref name="forum: 7808/7809 to FAH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0608256104"/&gt; Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&amp;nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja908369h"/&gt;

The Pande Lab is part of Stanford University, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit entity]], and does not sell the results generated by Folding@home.&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; The large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.&lt;ref name="typepad: Simbios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="papers for free"/&gt; The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,&lt;ref name="10.1038/sj.embor.7400108"/&gt; and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.&lt;ref name="typepad: Simbios"/&gt; In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or [[supercomputer]]s.&lt;ref name="Pronk et al, 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copernicus download"/&gt; Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (Aβ) [[peptide]], caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1001/archneurol.2007.56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1074/jbc.R800036200"/&gt; Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.&lt;ref name="10.1063/1.3010881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0021776"/&gt;

Preventing Aβ aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.&lt;ref name="10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x"/&gt; In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a [[beta hairpin]] that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure.&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt; The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.&lt;ref name="10.1063/1.3010881"/&gt;

In December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of Aβ aggregates.&lt;ref name="typepad: possible alz. drug"/&gt; In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on [[biological tissue]].&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several [[mutation]]s of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] studies of Aβ [[oligomer]]s.&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0021776"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/jm201332p"/&gt; Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.&lt;ref name="forum: 6871"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 6571"/&gt;

=== Huntington's disease ===
[[Huntington's disease]] is a neurodegenerative [[genetic disorder]] that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. [[Polyglutamine tract|Excessive repeats]] of the [[glutamine]] amino acid at the [[N-terminus]] of the [[Huntingtin protein]] cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.&lt;ref name="10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1"/&gt; As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.032"/&gt; Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with [[rational drug design]] methods to stop the aggregate formation.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; The N17 fragment of the Huntington protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown.&lt;ref name="10.1038/nchembio.279"/&gt; Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease.&lt;ref name="forum: 8021 in beta"/&gt; Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt;

=== Cancer ===
More than half of all known cancers involve [[mutations]] of [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor]] protein present in every cell which regulates the [[cell cycle]] and signals for [[cell death]] in the event of damage to [[DNA]]. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of [[tumors]]. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers.&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.1905840"/&gt; In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's [[protein dimer]] in an [[water model|all-atom simulation of water]]. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2004.10.083"/&gt; This was the first [[peer review]]ed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project.&lt;ref name="FAH publishes cancer results"/&gt; The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.083"/&gt;

Folding@home is also used to study [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]],&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; [[heat shock protein]]s which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the [[Macromolecular crowding|crowded]] and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in [[chemotherapy]] resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.025"/&gt; Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells.&lt;ref name="typepad: nanomedicine ce"/&gt; Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme [[Src kinase]], and some forms of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] [[homeodomain]]: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.&lt;ref name="typepad: protomol b4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 180"/&gt; In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small [[Trefoil knot fold|knottin]] protein EETI, which can identify [[carcinoma]]s in [[medical imaging|imaging scan]]s by binding to [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]]s of cancer cells.&lt;ref name="forum: 7600 in beta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 7600"/&gt;

[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. [[Pharmaceutical companies]] have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the [[National Institutes of Health]] are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.&lt;ref name="scientists boost IL-2 potency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature10975"/&gt;

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta ===
[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]], known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in [[Type-I collagen]],&lt;ref name="10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16051-0"/&gt; which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name="978-0-387-73905-2"/&gt; The mutation causes a deformation in [[Collagen helix|collagen's triple helix structure]], which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.bpj.2009.04.059"/&gt; In 2005, Folding@home tested a new [[quantum mechanical]] method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.20301"/&gt; Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to [[Alzheimer]]'s and Huntington's research.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt;

=== Viruses ===
Folding@home is assisting in research towards preventing some [[virus]]es, such as [[influenza]] and [[HIV]], from recognizing and entering [[Cell (biology)|biological cells]].&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme [[RNase H]], a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it.&lt;ref name="forum: 10125"/&gt; Folding@home has also been used to study [[membrane fusion]], an essential event for [[viral entry|viral infection]] and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves [[conformational change]]s of viral fusion proteins and [[protein docking]],&lt;ref name="978-0-340-66316-5"/&gt; but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown.&lt;ref name="10.1039/c0cs00115e"/&gt; Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt; The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name="Peter Kasson"/&gt; In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt;

Following detailed simulations from Folding@home of small cells known as [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], in 2007, the Pande lab introduced a new computing method to measure the [[topology]] of its structural changes during fusion.&lt;ref name="10.1093/bioinformatics/btm250"/&gt; In 2009, researchers used Folding@home to study mutations of [[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|influenza hemagglutinin]], a protein that attaches a virus to its [[Host (biology)|host]] cell and assists with viral entry. Mutations to hemagglutinin affect [[binding affinity|how well the protein binds]] to a host's [[cell surface receptor]] molecules, which determines how [[infectivity|infective]] the virus strain is to the host organism.  Knowledge of the effects of hemagglutinin mutations assists in the development of [[antiviral drug]]s.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja904557w"/&gt;&lt;ref name="19209725, 2811693"/&gt; As of 2012, Folding@home continues to simulate the folding and interactions of hemagglutinin, complementing experimental studies at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: kasson update"/&gt;

=== Drug design ===
[[Drug]]s function by [[ligand binding|binding]] to [[binding site|specific locations]] on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a [[conformational change]]. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: drug design methods"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1063/1.2221680"/&gt; Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.&lt;ref name="10.1093/bib/bbp023"/&gt; In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (Å) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]]. This accuracy has implications to future [[protein structure prediction]] methods, including for [[intrinsically unstructured proteins]].&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt; Scientists have used Folding@home to research [[drug resistance]] by studying [[vancomycin]], an antibiotic [[drug of last resort]], and [[beta-lactamase]], a protein that can break down antibiotics like [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="description: 10721"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: drug targets"/&gt;

Chemical activity occurs along a protein's [[active site]]. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].&lt;ref name="typepad: drug targets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.1209309109"/&gt;

Approximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins. [[Macrolide antibiotics]] clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study and design new antibiotics.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0801795105"/&gt; The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated [[ribosomal protein]]s, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.&lt;ref name="description: 5765"/&gt;

== Participation ==
{{update|section|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Folding@home participation per client.png|thumb|left|300px|Folding@home's participation from April 2004 to October 2012. Total active clients (green) is broken down to those from CPUs (blue), GPUs (red), and PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3s (orange).]]

In addition to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point operations per second ([[FLOPS]]) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware.&lt;ref name="FLOPS FAQ"/&gt; In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS,&lt;ref name="typepad: FLOPS"/&gt; the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard [[x86]] CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences.&lt;ref name="FLOPS FAQ"/&gt; Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise a large majority of Folding@home's measured computing performance.&lt;ref name="FAH osstats2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS3 FAQ"/&gt;

In 2007, [[Guinness World Records]] recognized Folding@home as the most powerful distributed computing network.&lt;ref name="guinness most powerful DC"/&gt; As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS).&lt;ref name="FAH osstats2"/&gt; At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] totals 7.924 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="BOINC credit overview"/&gt; In November 2012, Folding@home updated its accounting of FLOPS, especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors.&lt;ref name="typepad: new stats page"/&gt; Using the Markov state model method, Folding@home achieves [[strong scaling]] across its user base and gains a linear [[speedup]] for every added processor.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt; This network allows Folding@home to do work that was formerly impractical computationally.&lt;ref name="10.1038/sj.embor.7400108"/&gt;

In March 2002, [[Google]] cofounder [[Sergey Brin]] launched [[Google Compute]] as an add-on for the [[Google Toolbar]].&lt;ref name="news: Google supercomputing"/&gt; Although limited in function and scope, it increased participation in Folding@home from 10,000, up to about 30,000 active CPUs.&lt;ref name="Biotech 27"/&gt; The program ended in October 2005, in favor of the official Folding@home clients, and is no longer available for the Toolbar.&lt;ref name="idle time precious"/&gt; Folding@home also gained participants from [[Genome@home]], another distributed computing project from the Pande lab and a sister project to Folding@home. The goal of Genome@home was [[protein design]] and associated applications. Following its official conclusion in March 2004, users were asked to donate computing power to Folding@home instead.&lt;ref name="G@h updates"/&gt;

=== Performance ===
[[File:Folding@home and Supercomputer Computational Powers.png|thumb|right|400px|Computing power of Folding@home and the fastest supercomputer from April 2004 to October 2012. Between June 2007 and June 2011, Folding@home (red) exceeded the performance of [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer (black). However it was eclipsed by [[K computer]] in November 2011 and [[Blue Gene/Q]] in June 2012.&lt;sup id="Note 1 back"&gt;[[#Note 1|Note 1]]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

On September 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so.&lt;ref name="typepad: crossing 1 PF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008"/&gt; [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer at the time was [[BlueGene/L]], at 0.280 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="Top500 June 2007"/&gt; The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS,&lt;ref name="FAH reaches 2 PF"/&gt; followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 2008&lt;ref name="Nvidia-FAH milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="3 PF barrier"/&gt; and September 28, 2008 respectively.&lt;ref name="past 4 petaFLOPS"/&gt; On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS,&lt;ref name="typepad: FAH passes 5 PF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crossing 5 PF barrier"/&gt; and was the first computing project to meet these five levels.&lt;ref name="Community Grid Computing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review of FAH"/&gt; In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] at 1.105 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="Top500 November 2008"/&gt; On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="6 petaFLOPS"/&gt; In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="FAH stats doc"/&gt; On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Petaflops nearly reached|url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/closing-in-on-100-petaflops|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Points ==
Similarly to other distributed computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing contributions to the project through a credit system.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt; All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt; Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though through the use of a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority.&lt;ref name="Passkey FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMP2 release"/&gt; Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines.&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt;

Users can register their contributions under a team, which combine the points of all their members. A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team.&lt;ref name="FAH homepage"/&gt; In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].&lt;ref name="Extreme overclocking forum"/&gt; The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaximumPC Chimp Challenge"/&gt; Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt;

If a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a "Default" team. This "Default" team has a team number of "0". Statistics are accumulated for this "Default" team as well as for specially named teams.

== Software ==
Folding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.

=== Work units ===
A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt; All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&amp;nbsp;3 450&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.&lt;ref name="SMP FAQ"/&gt;

Before public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.&lt;ref name="typepad: more transparency"/&gt; Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.&lt;ref name="forum: Gromacs cannot continue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: 6803(4,66,255)"/&gt; The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.&lt;ref name="forum: troubleshooting bad WUs"/&gt;

=== Cores ===
{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}
Specialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as "FahCores" and often abbreviated "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt; one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.20703"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/ct700301q"/&gt; Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.&lt;ref name="Gromacs FAQ"/&gt; Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.&lt;ref name="Open Source FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: update on new FahCores"/&gt; Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petaflop FAQ"/&gt; The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;

=== Client ===
A Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.&lt;ref name="Uni Guide"/&gt; The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.&lt;ref name="FAH homepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.&lt;ref name="Uni Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: can FAH damage PC?"/&gt; The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMP FAQ"/&gt;

Professional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.&lt;ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/&gt; Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&amp;nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uninstall"/&gt; While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,&lt;ref name="FAHControl source code"/&gt; the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.&lt;ref name="FAH license"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: FAH EULA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="help ubuntu"/&gt;

However, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries The Case of the Modified Binaries, Josh Pitts, October 23, 2014; retrieved on 2016-11-23]&lt;/ref&gt; or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat]&lt;/ref&gt; or by decompiling&lt;ref&gt;probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]&lt;/ref&gt; and recompiling them after modification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/disassembling-modifying-and-then-reassembling-a-linux-executable x86 - Disassembling, modifying and then reassembling a Linux executable - Stack Overflow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable? - Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the binary files - and/or the transport channel - are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, since in the case of Folding@Home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uninstall"/&gt; the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.

Folding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/&gt; Folding@home was launched on October&amp;nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.&lt;ref name="10.1039/C1CP22100K"/&gt; Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.290.5498.1903"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive summary"/&gt; In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;&lt;ref name="FAH for BOINC soon"/&gt; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.&lt;ref name="High-Per FAQ"/&gt;

==== Graphics processing units ====
The specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&amp;nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.&lt;ref name="10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x"/&gt; Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1109/MCSE.2010.27"/&gt;

Before 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.&lt;ref name="10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84"/&gt;

The first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&amp;nbsp;2, 2006,&lt;ref name="High-Per FAQ"/&gt; delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.&lt;ref name="ATI FAQ"/&gt; It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU news"/&gt;&lt;ref name="978-3-642-14389-2"/&gt; GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&amp;nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.&lt;ref name="ATI FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU2 open beta"/&gt; Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref name="ATI FAQ"/&gt; Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU2 goes live"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU2 going well"/&gt; Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&amp;nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU3 prep"/&gt; and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU3 prep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU3 open beta"/&gt; Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.&lt;ref name="forum: 7.1.38 released"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: GPU3 headless guide"/&gt; GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.&lt;ref name="FAH osstats2"/&gt;

Native support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.&lt;ref name="forum: core17 Linux"/&gt;

==== PlayStation 3 ====
{{further|Life with PlayStation}}
[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|280px|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]

From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biotech 27"/&gt; The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21054"/&gt; This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.&lt;ref name="cnn ps3"/&gt;

The PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&amp;nbsp;23, 2007.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS3 to study cancer"/&gt; Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.&lt;ref name="PS3 research project"/&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.&lt;ref name="Life With PS3 live"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: life with PS"/&gt; In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt; However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.&lt;ref name="cnn ps3"/&gt; The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt; The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21054"/&gt;

On November 6, 2012, Sony concluded support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and 7 months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a "game changer" for the project.&lt;ref name="PS3 FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LWP termination"/&gt;

==== Multi-core processing client ====
Folding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.&lt;ref name="typepad: what does SMP do"/&gt; A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069"/&gt;

In November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.&lt;ref name="High-Per FAQ"/&gt; These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.&lt;ref name="SMP FAQ"/&gt; This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.&lt;ref name="typepad: new client dev"/&gt; Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref name="typepad: what does SMP do"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: new client dev"/&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.&lt;ref name="SMP2 release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/&gt;

SMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,&lt;ref name="bigadv"/&gt; which was raised to sixteen later, on February&amp;nbsp;7, 2012.&lt;ref name="typepad: update on bigadv-16"/&gt; Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.&lt;ref name="typepad: bigadv points change"/&gt; The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.&lt;ref name="bigadv"/&gt; Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== V7 ====
[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|400px|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&amp;nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]

The V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.&lt;ref name="V7 install guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/&gt; It was released on March&amp;nbsp;22, 2012.&lt;ref name="typepad: v7 rollout"/&gt; Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.&lt;ref name="typepad: ATI core 16 released"/&gt; V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.&lt;ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/&gt;

V7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.&lt;ref name="FAHControl source code"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ticket #736"/&gt; This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.&lt;ref name="V7 install guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/&gt;

==== Google Chrome ====
In 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser.  The client uses [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@Home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=folding.stanford.edu|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Android ====
In July 2015, a client for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones was released on [[Google Play]] for devices running [[Android 4.4 KitKat]] or newer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vijay |last=Pande |title=First full version of our Folding@Home client for Android Mobile phones |url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/first-full-version-of-our-foldinghome-client-for-android-mobile-phones/ |work=Folding@Home |publisher=Stanford University |date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Folding@Home |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing |work=[[Google Play]] |date=2016 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to other molecular simulators ==
[[Rosetta@home]] is a distributed computing project aimed at protein structure prediction and is one of the most accurate [[tertiary structure]] predictors.&lt;ref name="10.1002/prot.21804"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1002/prot.22210"/&gt; The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations.&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0005840"/&gt; As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F@H vs R@h"/&gt;

[[Anton (computer)|Anton]] is a special-purpose supercomputer built for molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.&lt;ref name="typepad: comparison with Anton"/&gt; Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/&gt; such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1654059.1654099"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.1187409"/&gt; These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/&gt; However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|µs]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/&gt; In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.&lt;ref name="forum: 7610/7611 in beta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 7610"/&gt; However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/&gt;

== Notes ==
&lt;cite id="Note 1"&gt;[[#Note 1 back|Note 1:]]&lt;/cite&gt; Supercomputer FLOPS performance is assessed by running the legacy [[LINPACK]] benchmark. This short-term testing has difficulty in accurately reflecting sustained performance on real-world tasks because LINPACK more efficiently maps to supercomputer hardware. Computing systems vary in architecture and design, so direct comparison is difficult. Despite this, FLOPS remain the primary speed metric used in supercomputing.&lt;ref name="forum: GPU flop conversion 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="supercomputer only technically the fastest"/&gt; In contrast, Folding@home determines its FLOPS using [[wall clock time]] by measuring how much time its work units take to complete.&lt;ref name="forum: vs PPD numbers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: vs PPD numbers 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: GPU flops conversion"/&gt;

'''GeneQuant Spectrophotometer''' is an [[RNA]]/[[DNA]] calculator [[Electronic test equipment|tool]] that measures [[absorbance]] at 230, 260, 280, 320, 546, 562, 595 and 600&amp;nbsp;nm.  It can determine the concentration and purity of [[nucleic acid]]s after [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplification, calculate annealing temperatures for [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] prior to PCR upon entry of the [[oligonucleotide]] sequence and concentration and the total [[Buffer solution|buffer]] [[Molar concentration|molarity]], measure Optical Density (OD) 600 for bacterial cell culture solutions, and it may be used for [[protein]] determination using the [[Bradford protein assay|Bradford]], [[Biuret test|Biuret]], and [[Bicinchoninic acid assay|BCA protein assays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related+Content/Files/1314750913712/litdoc28925114AA_20110831033722.pdf|title=404 Not Found - GE Healthcare Life Sciences|website=www.gelifesciences.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

=== Nucleic Acid Quantification (NAQ) ===
{{confusing|section|date=January 2014}}
A solution of DNA or RNA with an optical density of 1.0 has a concentration of 50 or 40&amp;nbsp;ug/mL, respectively, in a 10&amp;nbsp;mm pathlength cell. Oligonucleotides have a corresponding factor of 33&amp;nbsp;ug/mL which can be calculated if the base sequence is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related+Content/Files/1314723116657/litdocGeneQuantpro_20110830203746.pdf|title=404 Not Found - GE Healthcare Life Sciences|website=www.gelifesciences.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentration = Abs260 * Factor

The instrument uses factors 50, 40 and 33 as defaults for RNA, DNA, and Oligonucleotides, respectively, and compensates for dilution and use of calls which do not have 10&amp;nbsp;mm pathlength.

Default units are converted using:
1&amp;nbsp;ug/mL = 1&amp;nbsp;ng/uL = 0.001&amp;nbsp;ug/uL
pmol/uL = (ug/mL * 1000)/ MW of oligo
pmol phosphate = (nucleotide concentration, ug/mL) / 315

Molecular weight of a DNA oligonucleotide is calculated:
MW (g/mole) = [(dA * 312.2) + (dC * 288.2) + (dG * 328.2) + (dT * 303.2)] + [(MW counter-ion) * (length of oligo in bases)]
*For RNA nucleotide, (dT * 303.2) is (dU * 298.2)

The MW is calculated using the following equation and adjusted for the contribution of the atoms at 5' and 3' ends:
Phosphorylated oligos add: [17 + (2 * MW counter-ion)]
Non-phosphorylated add: [61 + (MW counter-ion)]
MW (g/mole) of the most common counter-ions are NA, 23.0, K, 39.1, and TEA, 102.2.

'''General chemistry'''
(sometimes called "gen chem" for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in [[chemistry]] and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a "weed out" course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as [[organic chemistry]] or [[analytical chemistry]].

General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as [[stoichiometry]], prediction of reaction products, [[thermodynamics]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[electrochemistry]], [[chemical kinetics]], and many of the rudiments of [[physical chemistry]]. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.

== Concepts Taught ==
The concepts taught in a typical general chemistry course are as follows:
*[[Stoichiometry]]
*[[Conservation of energy]]
*[[Conservation of mass]]
*[[Atom|Elementary atomic theory]]
*[[Periodic table|Periodic table and periodicity]]
*[[Law of constant composition]]
*[[Gas law]]s
*[[Nuclear chemistry]]
*[[Solubility]]
*[[Acid-base chemistry]]
*[[Chemical bonding]]
*[[Chemical kinetics]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Electrochemistry]]
*[[Chemical equilibrium|Chemical equilibria]]

[[Image:Grapefruit Juice and Medicine May Not Mix (6774935740).jpg|thumb|500px]]
The effects are caused by [[furanocoumarin]]s (and, to a lesser extent, [[flavonoids]]). These chemicals inhibit key [[drug metabolism|drug metabolizing]] [[enzyme]]s, such as [[CYP3A4|cytochrome P450 3A4]] (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 is a metabolizing enzyme for almost 50% of drugs, and is found in the liver and small intestinal epithelial cells.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed"/&gt; As a result, many drugs are affected. Inhibition of enzymes can have two different effects, depending on whether the drug is either

#[[metabolized]] by the enzyme to an inactive [[metabolite]], ''or''
#activated by the enzyme to an [[active metabolite]].

If the active drug is metabolized by the inhibited enzyme, then the fruit will stop the drug being metabolized, leaving elevated concentrations of the medication in the body, which can cause adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Mitchell May 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=Steve |title=Why Grapefruit and Medication Can Be a Dangerous Mix |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/health/grapefruit-and-medications-can-be-a-dangerous-mix/ |website=Consumer Reports |accessdate=4 May 2016 |date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, if the medication is a [[prodrug]], it needs to be metabolised to be converted to the [[active metabolite|active drug]]. Compromising its metabolism lowers concentrations of the active drug, reducing its therapeutic effect, and risking therapeutic failure.

Low drug concentrations can also be caused when the fruit suppresses drug absorption from the intestine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm292276.htm FDA Consumer update]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989. The first published report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991 in the Lancet entitled "Interactions of Citrus Juices with [[Felodipine]] and [[Nifedipine]]," and was the first reported food-drug interaction clinically. However, the effect only became well-publicized after being responsible for a number of bad interactions with various medications.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

==Active ingredients==
Citrus fruits may contain a number of [[polyphenol]] compounds,&lt;ref name=bergamottin/&gt;&lt;ref name=edwardsa&amp;bernier1996/&gt; including the [[flavonoid]] [[naringin]] and [[furanocoumarin]]s (such as [[bergamottin]], [[dihydroxybergamottin]], [[bergapten]], and [[bergaptol]]){{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. These are natural [[chemical]]s. They may be present in all forms of the fruit, including freshly squeezed juice, frozen concentrate, and whole fruit.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

It can take up to 72 hours before the effects of the naringin on the CYP3A4 enzyme are seen. This is problematic as a 4 oz portion of grapefruit contains enough naringin to inhibit the metabolism of substrates of CYP3A4. Naringin is a flavonoid which contributes to the bitter flavour of grapefruit.&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;

==Mechanism==
{{Cleanup section|reason=lack of coherent overview|date=August 2017}}
Organic compounds that are derivatives of furanocoumarin interfere with liver and [[Intestine|intestinal]] enzyme CYP3A4 and are believed to be primarily responsible for the effects of grapefruit on the enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Veronese ML, Gillen LP, Burke JP, Dorval EP, Hauck WW, Pequignot E, Waldman SA, Greenberg HE |title=Exposure-dependent inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 in vivo by grapefruit juice |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |year=2003 |month=Aug |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=831–9 |doi=10.1177/0091270003256059 |pmid=12953340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cytochrome isoforms affected by grapefruit components also include [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], and [[CYP2D6]].&lt;ref name="Tassaneeyakul W"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tassaneeyakul W, Guo LQ, Fukuda K, Ohta T, Yamazoe Y |title=Inhibition selectivity of grapefruit juice components on human cytochromes P450 |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=378 |issue=2 |pages=356–63 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10860553 |doi=10.1006/abbi.2000.1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioactive compounds in grapefruit juice may also interfere with [[MDR1]] (multidrug resistance protein 1) and [[OATP]] (organic anion transporting polypeptides), either increasing or decreasing the bioavailability of a number of drugs.&lt;ref name="GSE_Drug_Effect"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1998 |title=Inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A4 by bergamottin, a component of grapefruit juice |journal=[[Chemical Research in Toxicology]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=252–9 |doi=10.1021/tx970192k |pmid=9548795 |vauthors=He K, Iyer KR, Hayes RN, Sinz MW, Woolf TF, Hollenberg PF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey_DG1998"&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 1998 |title=Grapefruit juice–drug interactions |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=101–10 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.1998.00764.x |pmc=1873672 |pmid=9723817 |vauthors=Bailey DG, Malcolm J, Arnold O, Spence JD }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbamazepine"&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 1998 |title=Effect of grapefruit juice on carbamazepine bioavailability in patients with epilepsy |journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=286–8 |doi=10.1016/S0009-9236(98)90177-1 |pmid=9757152 |vauthors=Garg SK, Kumar N, Bhargava VK, Prabhakar SK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey_DG2004"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2004 |title=Interactions between grapefruit juice and cardiovascular drugs |journal=American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281–97 |doi=10.2165/00129784-200404050-00002 |pmid=15449971 |vauthors=Bailey DG, Dresser GK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bressler_R"&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 2006 |title=Grapefruit juice and drug interactions.

When drugs are taken orally, they enter the gut lumen to be absorbed in the small intestine and sometimes, in the stomach. In order for drugs to be absorbed, they must pass through the epithelial cells that line the lumen wall before they can enter the hepatic portal circulation to be distributed systemically in blood circulation. Drugs are metabolized by drug-specific [[Drug metabolism|metabolizing enzymes]] in the epithelial cells. Metabolizing enzymes transform these drugs into metabolites. The primary purpose for drug metabolism is to detoxify, inactivate, solubilize and eliminate these drugs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pandit Introduction to Pharmaceutical Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2017}} As a result, the amount of the drug in its original form that reaches systemic circulation is reduced due to this first-pass metabolism.

Furanocoumarins (see section above) irreversibly inhibit a metabolizing enzyme [[cytochrome P450 3A4]] (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 is a metabolizing enzyme for almost 50% of drugs, and is found in the liver and small intestinal epithelial cells.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.f1|pmid=23297175|last1=Pirmohamed|first1=Munir|title=Drug-grapefruit juice interactions: Two mechanisms are clear but individual responses vary|journal=BMJ|date=12 January 2013|volume=346|issue=7890|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many drugs are impacted by consumption of citrus juice. When the metabolizing enzyme is inhibited, less of the drug will be metabolized by it in the epithelial cells. A decrease in drug metabolism means more of the original form of the drug could pass unchanged to systemic blood circulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2017}} An unexpected high dose of the drug in the blood could lead to fatal drug toxicity.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed"/&gt;
The CYP3A4 is located in both the liver and the [[enterocyte]]s. Many oral drugs undergo first-pass (presystemic) metabolism by the enzyme. Several organic compounds (see [[Grapefruit–drug interactions#Active ingredients|section above]]) found in citrus and specifically in grapefruit juice exert inhibitory action on drug metabolism by the enzyme.

This interaction is particularly dangerous when the drug in question has a low [[therapeutic index]], so that a small increase in blood concentration can be the difference between therapeutic effect and toxicity. Citrus juice inhibits the enzyme only within the [[intestines]] if consumed in small amounts. Intestinal enzyme inhibition will only affect the potency of orally administrated drugs.

When larger amounts are consumed they may also inhibit the enzyme in the liver. The hepatic enzyme inhibition may cause an additional increase in potency and a prolonged metabolic half-life (prolonged metabolic half-life for all ways of drug administration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Veronese ML, Gillen LP, Burke JP, etal |title=Exposure-dependent inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 in vivo by grapefruit juice |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=831–9 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12953340 |doi=10.1177/0091270003256059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of the effect varies widely between individuals and between samples of juice, and therefore cannot be accounted for ''a priori''.

Another mechanism of interaction is possibly through the MDR1 (multidrug resistance protein 1) that is localized in the [[wikt:apex|apical]] [[brush border]] of the enterocytes. [[P-glycoprotein]] (Pgp) transports [[lipophilic]] molecules out of the enterocyte back into the [[intestinal lumen]]. Drugs that possess lipophilic properties are either metabolised by CYP3A4 or removed into the intestine by the Pgp transporter. Both the Pgp and CYP3A4 may act synergistically as a barrier to many orally administered drugs. Therefore, their inhibition (both or alone) can markedly increase the bioavailability of a drug.&lt;ref name=newtype&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03722.x |pmid=21039758 |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=645–655 |last=Bailey |first=David G. |title=Fruit juice inhibition of uptake transport: a new type of food-drug interaction

==Duration and timing==
===Metabolism interactions===
Grapefruit–drug interactions that affect the pre-systemic metabolism (i.e., the metabolism that occurs before the drug enters the blood) of drugs have a different duration of action than interactions that work by other mechanisms, such as on absorption, discussed below.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed" /&gt;

The interaction is greatest when the juice is ingested with the drug or up to 4 hours before the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lundahl J, Regårdh CG, Edgar B, Johnsson G |title=Relationship between time of intake of grapefruit juice and its effect on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of felodipine in healthy subjects |journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=49 |issue=1–2 |pages=61–7 |year=1995 |pmid=8751023 |doi=10.1007/BF00192360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12891222"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenblatt DJ, von Moltke LL, Harmatz JS, etal |title=Time course of recovery of cytochrome p450 3A function after single doses of grapefruit juice |journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=121–9 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12891222 |doi=10.1016/S0009-9236(03)00118-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}}

The location of the inhibition occurs in the lining of the intestines, not within the liver.&lt;ref name=Greenblatt&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenblatt |first1=DJ |last2=Patki |first2=KC |last3=von Moltke |first3=LL |last4=Shader |first4=RI |year=2001 |title=Drug interactions with grapefruit juice: an update |url= |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=357–9 |doi=10.1097/00004714-200108000-00001 |pmid=11476118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects last because grapefruit-mediated inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes, like [[CYP3A4]], is irreversible;&lt;ref name=Greenblatt /&gt; that is, once the grapefruit has "broken" the enzyme, the intestinal cells must produce more of the enzyme to restore their capacity to metabolize drugs that the enzyme is used to metabolize.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed"/&gt; It takes around 24 hours to regain 50% of the cell's baseline enzyme activity and it can take 72 hours for the enzyme activity to completely return to baseline.&lt;ref name="PharmAnswers"&gt;{{cite web |title=Does Grapefruit Juice Really Interact With My Medication? |url=http://pharmacistanswers.com/grapefruit-juice-drug-interactions.html |website=PharmacistAnswers |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}} For this reason, simply separating citrus consumption and medications taken daily does not avoid the drug interaction.&lt;ref name="PharmAnswers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12891222" /&gt;

===Absorption interactions===
For medications that interact due to inhibition of OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptides), a relative short period of time is needed to avoid this interaction, and a 4-hour interval between grapefruit consumption and the medication should suffice.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed"/&gt;&lt;ref name=newtype/&gt; For drugs recently sold on the market, drugs have information pages (monographs) that provide information on any potential interaction between a medication and grapefruit juice.&lt;ref name="Pirmohamed"/&gt; Because there is a growing number of medications that are known to interact with citrus,&lt;ref name=forbidden /&gt; patients should consult a pharmacist or physician before consuming citrus while taking their medications.

==Affected fruit==
Grapefruit is not the only [[Citrus taxonomy#Common name confusions|citrus fruit]] that can interact with medications;&lt;ref name=forbidden/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bergamottin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tangortest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hybrid"/&gt; one medical review advised patients to avoid all citrus.&lt;ref name="nojuice"/&gt;

There are three ways to test if a fruit interacts with drugs:

#Test a drug-fruit combination in humans&lt;ref name=nojuice/&gt;
#Test a fruit chemically for the presence of the interacting polyphenol compounds&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;
#Test a fruit genetically for the genes needed to make the interacting polyphenol compounds&lt;ref name=fucangene&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1139/gen-2014-0164 |pmid=25756876 |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=537–545 |last1=Chen |first1=Chunxian |last2=Yu |first2=Qibin |last3=Wei |first3=Xu |last4=Cancalon |first4=Paul F. |last5=Gmitter Jr. |first5=Fred G. |last6=Belzile |first6=F. |title=Identification of genes associated with low furanocoumarin content in grapefruit |journal=Genome |date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first approach involves risk to trial volunteers. The first and second approaches have another problem: the same fruit [[cultivar]] could be tested twice with different results. Depending on growing and processing conditions, concentrations of the interacting polyphenol compounds can vary dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.healio.com/cardiology/chd-prevention/news/print/cardiology-today/%7B0c787159-ae5e-4b46-8777-080e952ff84c%7D/important-considerations-for-grapefruit-and-drug-interaction | title=Important considerations for grapefruit and drug interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=July 2017}} The third approach is hampered by a paucity of knowledge of the genes in question.&lt;ref name=fucangene/&gt;

===Citrus genetics and interactions===
[[File:Citrus tern cb simplified 1.svg|thumb|400px|left|Citrus fruits clustered by genetic similarity. Most commercial [[Citrus taxonomy|varieties of citrus]] are hybrids of the three species at the corners of the [[ternary diagram]], and genetically distinct hybrids often bear the same [[Folk taxonomy|common name]].&lt;ref name="limes and lemons"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Phylogenetic origin of limes and lemons revealed by cytoplasmic and nuclear markers | last1=Curk | first1=Franck | last2=Ollitrault | first2= Frédérique | last3=Garcia-Lor | first3= Andres | last4=Luro | first4=François | last5=Navarro | first5=Luis | last6=Ollitrault | first6=Patrick | journal=Annals of Botany | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=565–583 | year=2016 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcw005 | pmid=26944784 | pmc=4817432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fucomarin production has been inherited by some hybrid [[cultivars]]; others have not inherited the fucomarin-producing genes.]]

A descendant of citrus cultivars that cannot produce the problematic polyphenol compounds would presumably also lack the genes to produce them. Many citrus cultivars are hybrids of a small number of ancestral species, which have now been fully genetically sequenced.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genomics of the origin and evolution of ''Citrus'' | last1=Wu | first1=Guohong Albert | last2=Terol | first2=Javier | last3=Ibanez | first3=Victoria | last4=López-García | first4=Antonio | last5=Pérez-Román | first5=Estela | last6=Borredá | first6=Carles | last7=Domingo | first7=Concha | last8=Tadeo | first8=Francisco R | last9=Carbonell-Caballero | first9=Jose | last10=Alonso | first10=Roberto | last11=Curk | first11=Franck | last12=Du | first12=Dongliang | last13=Ollitrault | first13=Patrick | last14=Roose | first14=Mikeal L.

Many traditional citrus groups, such as true sweet oranges and lemons, seem to be [[bud sport]]s, mutant descendants of a single hybrid ancestor.&lt;ref name=citrustaxonomy&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12863-014-0152-1 |pmid=25544367 |pmc=4302129 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=152 |last1=Curk |first1=Franck |last2=Ancillo |first2=Gema |last3=Garcia-Lor |first3=Andres |last4=Luro |first4=François |last5=Perrier |first5=Xavier |last6=Jacquemoud-Collet |first6=Jean-Pierre |last7=Navarro |first7=Luis |last8=Ollitrault |first8=Patrick |title=Next generation haplotyping to decipher nuclear genomic interspecific admixture in Citrusspecies: analysis of chromosome 2 |journal=BMC Genetics |date=December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, cultivars in a bud sport group would be either all safe or all problematic. However, new citrus varieties arriving on the market are increasingly likely to be sexually created hybrids, not asexually created sports.

The ancestry of a hybrid cultivar may not be known. Even if it is known, it is not possible to be certain that a cultivar will not interact with drugs on the basis of taxonomy, as it is not known which ancestors lack the capacity to make the problematic polyphenol compounds. However, many of the citrus cultivars known to be problematic seem to be closely related.

====Ancestral species====
[[Pomelo]] (the Asian fruit that was crossed with an orange to produce grapefruit) contains high amounts of furanocoumarin derivatives. [[Grapefruit#Grapefruit relatives|Grapefruit relatives]] and other varieties of pomelo have variable amounts of furanocoumarin.&lt;ref name=bergamottin/&gt;&lt;ref name="tangortest"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;&lt;ref name=nojuice/&gt;

The [[Dancy (fruit)|Dancy]] cultivar has a small amount of pomelo ancestry,&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt; but is genetically close to a non-hybrid [[Mandarin orange#Genetics|true mandarin]] (unlike most commercial mandarins, which may have much more extensive hybridization). It has been tested once for furanocoumarins; none were detectable.&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;

No [[citron]] or [[Citrus micrantha|papeda]] seems to have been tested.

====Hybrid cultivars====
Both [[sweet oranges]] and [[bitter oranges]] are mandarin-pomelo hybrids.&lt;ref name=citrustaxonomy/&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt; Bitter oranges (such as the [[Seville orange]]s often used in [[marmalade]]) can interfere with drugs&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; including [[etoposide]], a chemotherapy drug, some [[beta blocker]] drugs used to treat high blood pressure, and [[cyclosporine]], taken by transplant patients to prevent rejection of their new organs.&lt;ref name=bbcfruit&gt;{{cite news |title=Fruit juice 'could affect drugs' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7572500.stm |work=BBC News |date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence on sweet oranges is more mixed.&lt;ref name=nojuice/&gt;

Tests on some tangelos (hybrids of mandarins/tangerines and pomelo or grapefruit) have not shown significant amounts of furanocoumarin.&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;

Common lemons are the product of orange/citron hybridization, and hence have pomelo ancestry, and although [[Key limes]] are papeda/citron hybrids, the more commercially prevalent [[Persian limes]] and similar varieties are crosses of the Key lime with lemons, and hence likewise have pomelo ancestry.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt; These limes can also inhibit drug metabolism.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;  Other less-common citrus species also referred to as lemons or limes are genetically distinct from the more common varieties, with different proportions of pomelo ancestry.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

=====Inaccurate labeling=====
Marketing classifications often do not correspond to taxonomic ones. The "Ambersweet" cultivar is classified and sold as an orange, but does not descend from the same common ancestor as sweet oranges; it has grapefruit, orange, and mandarin ancestry. Fruits are often sold as mandarin, [[tangerine]], or [[satsuma (fruit)|satsuma]] (which may be synonyms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2724336 |title=Synonymy of C. reticulata at The Plant List}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Fruit sold under these names include many which are, like Sunbursts and [[Murcott (fruit)|Murcott]]s, hybrids with grapefruit ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ch073 |title=Robinson Tangerine |author=Larry K.

In some countries, citrus fruit must be labelled with the name of a registered cultivar. Juice is often not so labelled. Some medical literature also names the cultivar tested.

===Other fruit and vegetables===
The discovery that flavonoids are responsible for some interactions make it plausible that other fruit and vegetables are affected.&lt;ref name=newtype/&gt;

====Apple juice====
Apple juice, especially commercially produced products, interferes with the action of [[Organic anion-transporting polypeptide|OATPs]].&lt;ref name="Andrade Review OATP Psych"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrade|first1=Chittaranjan|title=Fruit Juice, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides, and Drug Interactions in Psychiatry|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=24 November 2014|volume=75|issue=11|pages=e1323–e1325|doi=10.4088/JCP.14f09572|pmid=25470100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interference can decrease the absorption of a variety of commonly used medications, including [[beta blockers]] like [[atenolol]], [[antibiotics]] like [[ciprofloxacin]], and [[antihistamines]] like [[montelukast]].&lt;ref name="Andrade Review OATP Psych" /&gt;

===Traits===
The interaction between citrus and medication depends on the individual drug, and not the class of the drug. Drugs that interact usually share three common features: they are taken orally, normally only a small amount enters systemic blood circulation, and they are metabolized by CYP3A4.&lt;ref name=forbidden/&gt; However, the effects on the CYP3A4 in the liver could in principle cause interactions with non-oral drugs,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and non-CYP3A4-meditated effects also exist.&lt;ref name="newtype"/&gt;

Cytochrome isoforms affected by grapefruit components include [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], and [[CYP2D6]].&lt;ref name="Tassaneeyakul W"/&gt; Drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes may have interactions with components of grapefruit.

An easy way to tell if a medication may be affected by grapefruit juice is by researching whether another known CYP3A4 inhibitor drug is already contraindicated with the active drug of the medication in question. Examples of such known CYP3A4 [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] include [[cisapride]] (Propulsid),{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} [[erythromycin]], [[itraconazole]] (Sporanox), [[ketoconazole]] (Nizoral), and [[mibefradil]] (Posicor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/uploadedFiles/User_Content/Research/Institutes_and_Centers/CCOP_Research_Base/Protocols/98213/Appendices/Appendix%207%20%20Medication%20Reference%20List%20Am%206%2010.14.14(1).pdf |title=Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center |work=wakehealth.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Theoretical approach in sociology}}
'''Groupism''' is a [[theoretical approach]] in [[sociology]] that posits that [[conformity]] to the laws/norms of a group such as family, kinship, race, ethnicity, religion and nationality brings reciprocal benefits such as recognition, right, power and security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is the principle that a persons primary or prioritised identity is that of membership in a social network. Groupists assume that individuals in a group tend to have stronger affinity and obligation to a particular [[Social group|group]] when the influence of an authority figure brings a common goal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latella|first=Matthew|date=1994|title=Rethinking Groupism: An Alternative to the Postmodern Strategy|url=|journal=Dalhousie J. Legal Stud.|volume=3|pages=137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of groupism can be defined and criticized in varied ways for disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, political history and philosophy. Group-ism is defined in most dictionaries as the behavior of a member of a group where they think and act as the group norm at the expense of [[individualism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groupism|title=Groupism|last=|first=|date=|website=Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term originated around mid 19th century and the first known use of the word recorded was in 1851.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is a general definition often used in Indian English as the tendency to form [[wikt:faction|faction]]s in a system setting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The term had also been used for “the principles or practices of [[Oxford Movement|Oxford Group movement]]” which is now historical and rare.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/groupism|title=groupism {{!}} Definition of groupism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perspectives: criticism ==

=== Rogers Brubaker: Social groupism ===
"The tendency to take discrete, sharply differentiated, internally homogeneous and externally bounded groups as basic constituents of social life, chief protagonists of social conflicts, and fundamental units of social analysis" 

Groupism has been a deeply entrenched and fundamental aspect of social analysis of nationalism, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, sexuality, age, class&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Brubaker|first=Rogers|title=Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Minority Rights|pages=50–77|year=2004|chapter=Ethnicity without groups|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511489235.004|isbn=978-0-511-48923-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even groups with combination of these categories but with a common interest in other universal categories like sports, music and values. It is commonly seen on everyday context in media reports and even academic research leading to policy analysis. According to Brubaker, it is the view that division among humans such as ethnicity is an absolute, unchanging entity rather than a changing conceptual variable subject to time and context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=2005-01-11|pages=470–492|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-8588-2|doi=10.1215/9780822385882-016|title = Remaking Modernity|chapter = Ethnicity without Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the tendency to take discrete groups as chief protagonists of social conflicts, to reify such groups as if they were unitary collective actors. It is considered a "process in which individuals are reduced to specific group characteristic which are politicised as boundaries".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Susanne|date=2013|title=Privatizing Religion. Legal Groupism, No-Go-Areas, and the Public-Private-Ideology in Human Rights Politics|url=|journal=Constellations|volume=20|issue=1|pages=68–84|doi=10.1111/cons.12024|issn=1351-0487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual groupism involves essentialising groups without taking into account that such habit of giving groups performative character taken into account in ethnopolitical conflict analysis could lead to intentional/unintentional framing of conflict between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures of crisis in Southeast Europe.|last=editor.|first=Roth, Klaus, 1939- editor. Kartarı, Asker, 1952-|isbn=978-3-643-90763-9|oclc=951762202|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example of ethnic groups, it involves viewing an individual in the group as the collective representative of the values or conflicts associated with the social norm of that group.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valkonen|first=Jarno|last2=Valkonen|first2=Sanna|last3=Koivurova|first3=Timo|date=2016-06-19|title=Groupism and the politics of indigeneity: A case study on the Sámi debate in Finland|journal=Ethnicities|volume=17|issue=4|pages=526–545|doi=10.1177/1468796816654175|issn=1468-7968}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Rogers Brubaker]] has criticised conceptual groupism for its stereotypical approach in social and political analysis which leads to decisions that trivialize individual need to protect the labelled collective interest of a political group or institution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Brubaker suggests that instead of taking "groups" as substantial entities, social and political analysis of the "groupness" should be brought about interms of political, social, cultural and psychological processes listed below&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* Distinguishing practical [[Category of being|categories]] and [[Group|groups]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}
* Group making as a sociopolitical and cultural project
* From categories to cognitive schema
*[[Discursive psychology|Discursive frames]]
* Organizational routines
* Institutional forms
* Political projects
* Contingent events

According to Norwegian anthropologist [[Fredrik Barth|Fredric Barth]], ethnicity, race and nationality categories are a matter of factors such as self identification/external categorisation, at individual/institutional level or formal/ informal context. Research on how ethnic, racial and national groups are classified and categorised began through studies on the colonial and post colonial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BRUBAKER|first=ROGERS|last2=LOVEMAN|first2=MARA|last3=STAMATOV|first3=PETER|date=2004|title=Ethnicity as cognition|url=|journal=Theory and Society|volume=33|issue=1|pages=31–64|doi=10.1023/b:ryso.0000021405.18890.63|issn=0304-2421|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brubaker suggests that there should be a focus on categories so that ethnicity, race and nationhood can co exist without ethnic 'groups' as separate entities as transforming groups into categories reduces the extent to which misleading political and legal analysis based on groupism turns to a framed reality &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

===Susanne Baer: Legal groupism ===
Legal groupism is the construction of groups in legal matter as defined by the German legal scholar [[Susanne Baer]]. Legal groupism also posits that equal right should be given to groups hence assuming that people always belong to a "distinguishable" group rather than many. This concept is regarded as problematic because most groups have unclear and shifting boundaries due to individuals living multiple identities and group characteristics.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of comparative constitutional law|last=editor.|first=Rosenfeld, Michel, 1948- editor. Sajó, András|isbn=9780199689286|oclc=852806207|date = 2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Legal groupism come into conflict with the idea of individual rights when human rights issues are constructed as group issues in law and complete autonomy given to major religious institution in the name of religious freedom then curtail individual human right issues.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example when constitutional law allows churches and religious communities to self determine matters conflicting with human rights without considering the rights of diverse individuals within a seemingly homogeneous group&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;, such overlapping between human rights and religion has led to lack of legal intervention in matters like sexual discrimination. For example religious authority power to internally handle child abuse cases, the European Union's exemption of religious organisation from fundamental rights in the ''EU proposal for a new Directive against discrimination 2008.'' &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

== Case studies ==

=== Legal status of indigenous people: Sami focus ===
It has been estimated that there are over 300 million indigenous people around the world some among which includes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Red Indians]], [[Sami people|Sami]] in Northern Europe, the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders of Australia]] and the [[Māori people|Maori]] of New Zealand, [[Ainu people|Ainu]] people of Japan, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] in Somalia, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of the Middle east, the [[Kazakhs]], [[Mongols]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Uyghurs|Ugyur]], and [[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian Nomads]] of Kazakhstan, eastern Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/socstud/foundation_gr8/blms/8-5-2b.pdf|title=Indigenous Peoples of the World|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Manitoba|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to acquire group rights indigenous people also happen to be under the regulation of national and international law. Although International customary law at the United nation and elsewhere has regarded indigenous people as a category since the 20th century, the definition of indigenous people has been a subject of ongoing debate at the national level since their classification as a group by the national law has interfered with their traditional group making processes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, The Finland government ratified [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|ILO convention no.169]] in 1989 which involved declaration of right for indigenous people of Finland such as the following definition of legal requirement to vote to the election of the Sami parliament.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|last=Swepston|first=Lee|pages=343–358|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004289062|doi=10.1163/9789004289062_010|title=The Foundations of Modern International Law on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples|year=2015|chapter=Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"For the purpose of this Act, a Sami means a person who considers himself a Sami, provided: 

1. That he himself or at least one of his parents or grandparents has learnt Sami as his first language; 

2. That he is a descendant of a person who has been entered in a land, taxation or population register as a mountain, forest or fishing Lapp; or 

3. That at least one of his parents has or could have been registered as an elector for an election to the Sami Delegation or the Sami Parliament."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

This definition has led to the Sámi debate in Finland a problem of defining the legal status of [[Sami people|Sámi]] indigenous people as the groupist system of political and legal analysis has framed indigeinity as a political requirement rather than an ethnocultural reality hence the inconsistency between the definition that Sami people has held for their kinship.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Groupism in Japan ===
Groupism is viewed as deeply rooted part of the Japanese group oriented society known for their high productivity, cooperative attitude and surpassing international competitive strength.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haitani|first=Kanji|date=1990|title=The Paradox of Japan's Groupism: Threat to Future Competitiveness?|url=|journal=Asian Survey|volume=30|issue=3|pages=237–250|doi=10.1525/as.1990.30.3.01p03644|issn=0004-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the key aspects of groupism in Japanese society has been discussed in the journal article, 'The Paradox of Japan's Groupism: Threat to Future Competitiveness' by Kanji Haitani.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

# Identity and well being: u''nmei kyodotai'' meaning "communities of shared destiny" is a core principle in Japanese culture where individual's well being and sense of security is maximised as a result of recognition and prosperity they get as a group.
# Seniority: There is close correlation between a member's age and their rank in a system.
# Emphasis on the relationships of harmony and conflict (''wa''): The ''wa'' concept encompasses the concept of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Isshin – dotai''' meaning 'one mind – same body'. Here 'one mind' refers to how senior members take into account the views of junior members who reciprocally internalizes the wisdom of the senior members.
# The insider-outsider mentality: Insider and Outsider groups are generally separated with clear distinction.
# Rank and status consciousness
# The closed nature of Japanese market in context of international economy

==== Social hierarchy in traditional music making process ====
The ryūha-iemoto system refers to social organisation in Japanese traditional music making which is shown to be dominated by the hierarchical form of groupism. This involves an authoritative group called "''Miyagi- ha"'' at the top of hierarchy who gets the greatest benefits of musical freedom, recognition, power and money. This group is known for transmission of their composition to subgroups down in the hierarchy. One of the characteristics of this form of social organisation involves lifetime affiliation as a subgroup member whereby there is no "graduation" or "becoming a free musician".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halliwell|first=Patrick|date=2004|title=Groupism and Individualism in Japanese Traditional Music|url=|journal=The World of Music|volume=46|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects: conceptual links ==

=== Nationalism ===
A form of groupism which generally began as a sense of security provided by national identity to an unquestioning acceptance of a political agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on an abstract mentality of “victory” in one’s own group and considering the “other” as a separate entity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The irrational obedience of German citizens during the Nazi regime of the 1930s and 1940s [[The Holocaust|holocaust]] is a well known example of the negative consequences rooted in groupism.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology : from inquiry to understanding|last=author.|first=Lilienfeld, Scott O., 1960-|isbn=9780133793048|oclc=869584554|date = 2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of Legal studies, international lawyer Philip Allot has criticized the concept of state sovereignty in the current international laws in promoting groupism and the lack of reform in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prejudice and discrimination ===
Prejudice against certain groups of people is rooted in groupism whereby conclusions or attitude about a group of people is drawn without evaluating the evidence and often leads to discrimination which refers to the behaviour of treating other groups in a different way than one's own group.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

* In-group bias: The tendency to favor members of one's own group than a person outside the group such as in sports or celebrity fan behavior.
* Out group homogeneity: The tendency to view all members from other groups as highly similar rather than viewing them as individuals.

=== Persuasion ===
[[Persuasion]] through individuals, sub-groups or the group as a whole leads to behavioural change without rational choice. It also involves the power of normative influence from one's heritage, culture and tradition to which people comply with its social norms to gain recognition or to avoid other's disapproval.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These concepts are broadly summarised in terms of groupism and can have both positive and negative connotation based on varying scale of groupism in a formal or informal system. Extreme forms of groupism well known in the past and present includes racism, bigotry, terrorism, genocide, dictatorship and war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social psychology ===
Social Psychology brings the concept of how individual psyche is shaped by the sociological constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=House|first=James S.|title=The Future of Social Psychology|date=1991|pages=45–60|series=Recent Research in Psychology|chapter=Sociology, Psychology and Social Psychology (and Social Science)|publisher=Springer New York|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-3120-2_4|isbn=9780387974873}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, social constructs formed by prejudice, [[Social loafing|discrimination]], racism and nationalism can be ascribed to groupism which an individual can obtain throughout life based on their socio-cultural and historical context that leads to psychological development as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Development in the Indian Context, Volume II : a Socio-Cultural Focus.|last=Margaret.|first=Khalakdina|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications, Incorporated|year=|isbn=978-8132105817|location=|pages=|oclc=847948001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social loafing]] is the phenomenon when the presence of other members in a group causes some to avoid responsibilities and exert less effort towards a group goal. [[Social disruption]] whereby the presence of others negatively influences the performance of tasks. [[Social facilitation]] which is a phenomenon proposed by Robert Zajonc is another example of the positive aspects of groupism where the presence and influence of diverse groups enhances the performance of a task. This is the opposite of social disruption whereby the presence of others negatively influences the performance of tasks that are relatively difficult.

=== Group selection ===
Scientific evidence from early hominids in Africa that shows human have evolved as small [[social group]]s that are predisposed to include or exclude others in an instinctual manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in group processes : a research annual|last=J.|first=Lawler, Edward|date=1986|publisher=JAI Press|isbn=978-0-89232-572-6|oclc=21052740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution of humans as a unitary social species has led to the social status and sense of belonging that comes with identifying oneself or being identified as an individual in different categories of group.  Research by anthropologist [[Robin Dunbar|Robin Dunba]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r suggested that the ratio of the size of the [[neocortex]] to the brain size determines the amount of social relationship in different species and found that humans have relatively high social brain that can have tendency to form greater interpersonal networks of small groups than animals such as chimpanzees and dolphins with smaller neocortex size to brain size ratio hence smaller number of relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. I. M.|date=1993|title=Coevolution of neocortical size, group size and language in humans|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=16|issue=4|pages=681|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00032325|issn=0140-525X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupism has been explained in terms of a biological need to form social bonds according to the ''need to belong theory'' whereby deprivation of this need has been shown to have Bio-psycho-social consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|last2=Leary|first2=Mark R.|date=1995|title=The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=117|issue=3|pages=497–529|doi=10.1037//0033-2909.117.3.497|issn=0033-2909|pmid=7777651}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of evolution, social influences on the individual based on natural selection has led to better adaptation and survival in various environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The '''High Probability Instruction''' (HPI) treatment is a [[behaviorist]] [[psychological treatment]] based on the idea of [[positive reinforcement]].
It consists of the idea of reinforcing an instruction with a low probability of compliance by using the reinforcement of an instruction with a high probability

'''Hill people''' is a general term for people who live in [[hill]]s and [[mountain]]s. There are a wide variety of hill people around the world, many of whom live by small scale [[pastoralism]] or on small farms. Musical instruments of hill people, such as various forms of [[Blowing horn|horn]], are notable for their ability to be heard at great distances. Political borders often split hill peoples between countries, and they are sometimes minorities in their countries with a tradition of resisting control by central government.

===Drakensberg===
[[File:Utimuni.png|thumb|right|200px|Zulu Warrior [[Utimuni]], nephew of [[Shaka]], the Zulu king.]]
The [[Drakensberg]] are the highest mountain range in [[Southern Africa]], rising up to {{convert|3482|m|ft}} in height. The people of these mountains are mostly [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people who moved into the area from the north a thousand years ago, displacing the original [[Khoisan]] people. They include the [[Swazi people|Swazi]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]]. Traditionally these people lived by cattle herding and small-scale farming, growing crops such as sorghum, maize, corn, pumpkins, beans and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Mesthrie, Rajend 1995 49"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics|author=Mesthrie, Rajend|year=1995|isbn=0-86486-280-6|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the Europeans reached this part of [[South Africa]] (around 1830), the Zulu were temporarily in the ascendancy after a series of wars between the people of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morris, Donald R. |title=The Washing of the Spears: The Rise of the Zulu Nation |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Cambridge |year=1998 |pages=692 Pages |isbn=0-306-80866-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is divided between [[South Africa]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]], but the people move relatively freely between these states.&lt;ref name="Mesthrie, Rajend 1995 49"/&gt;

The country's population is highly diverse. Most of its people speak [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] or [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branches. The former includes [[Oromo language|Oromiffa]], spoken by the [[Oromo people]], and [[Somali language|Somali]], spoken by the [[Somali people]]; the latter includes [[Amharic language|Amharic]], spoken by the [[Amhara people]], and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], spoken by the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people]]. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afro-Asiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]], [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Hadiyya language|Hadiyya]] and [[Agaw languages|Agaw]] languages, as well as the Semitic [[Gurage language|Gurage]], [[Harari language|Harari]], [[Silt'e language|Silt'e]] and [[Argobba language|Argobba]] tongues.&lt;ref name="Tphce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Level |url=http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 |work=2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia |publisher=[[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|CSA]] |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=18 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114004942/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal crops include [[coffee]], [[pulses]] (e.g. beans), [[oilseeds]], [[cereals]], [[potatoes]], [[sugarcane]], and vegetables.

The Ethiopian state is ancient, dating back to at least the [[Aksumite Empire]] (which officially used the name "Ethiopia" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, [[D`mt]] (with early 1st millennium BC roots). Despite two attempts at conquest by the [[Italians]], the country has remained independent for almost all its history. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] church has a long history in Ethiopia. It was founded in 316 AD by Meropius, a Christian philosopher from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Harold G. |title=A History of Ethiopia |edition=updated |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-22479-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlas and Rif===
[[File:Berber-Tribe-Morocco.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Berber people|Berber]] family in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].]]
The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] is a [[mountain range]] across a northern stretch of Africa extending about {{convert|2,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} through [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Tunisia]], or the [[Maghreb]]. The highest peak is [[Jbel Toubkal]], with an elevation of {{convert|4167|m|ft|0}} in southwestern Morocco. The second highest mountain is the [[M'Goun]] of {{convert|4071|m|ft|0}}.

The population of the Atlas Mountains are mainly [[berber people|Berber]] tribes, speakers of an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]], including the [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], [[Chaoui]], [[Mozabite language|Mozabite]], [[Riffians]], [[Chleuh]], [[Sous]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and [[Zenata]]. Although nominally subject at times to [[Carthage]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Fatimid]] dynasty of [[Egypt]] (who originated in this area), the [[Ottoman Turks]] and more recently the French, for most of their history the tribes of the Atlas mountains have effectively been independent.

Most Berbers are farmers, living in mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, but the Tuareg and Zenaga of the southern Sahara are nomadic. The Berbers are sometimes treated as minorities in their countries, which are dominated by their [[Arabic]]-speaking relatives nearer to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Michael; &amp; Fentress, Elizabeth (1997).

==Europe==

===Pyrenees, Cantabrian Mountains and Galicia===
[[File:Gaiteiros em romaria galega.jpg|thumb|[[Galician people|Galician]] ''gaiteiros'']]
The [[Pyrenees]] are a range of mountains in southwest Europe that form a natural border between France and Spain. Lower mountains extend to the west ([[Cantabrian Mountains]]) into [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The inhabitants of the Pyrenees speak Spanish, [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (in [[Catalonia]] and [[Andorra]]) and the [[Basque language]]. A few speak the [[Occitan language]] (the [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Languedocien]] dialects in France and the [[Aranese language|Aranese]] dialect in the [[Aran Valley]]), and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]. In the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] [[Basque Language|Basque]], [[Asturian Language|Asturian]] and the [[Cantabrian dialect]] are spoken, apart from Spanish. In fact [[Cantabrian people|Cantabrians]] have traditionally also been referred to as "montañeses" (highlanders or mountain people)

It is thought that [[Basque people]] are a remnant of the early inhabitants of Western Europe. Basque tribes were already mentioned in Roman times by [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], including the [[Vascones]], the [[Aquitani]] and others. Their language is quite distinct from the [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in most of Europe, and possibly (although there is much debate) is related to [[Northeast Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/ A Basque Encyclopedia and other cultural and historical funds] (in Spanish, though it can be searched in English, Basque and French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alps===
[[File:Pontifical Swiss Guards in their traditional uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Swiss guards in their traditional uniform]]
The [[Alps]] are one of the great mountain ranges of Europe. They stretch from Austria and [[Slovenia]] in the east, through Italy, Switzerland, [[Liechtenstein]] and Germany, to France in the west. The highest mountain is Mont Blanc, at {{convert|4,808|m|ft|abbr=off}}, on the Italian–French border. The people of the Alps speak [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovene]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]. The German spoken in the [[Linguistic geography of Switzerland#German|German speaking part of Switzerland]] is a range of [[Swiss German|Swiss dialects]].

Early Alpine tribes included the [[Helvetii]] and [[Alemanni]]. The Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps founded by three [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] in 1291, later expanding to form the nucleus of modern Switzerland. Disciplined [[Swiss mercenaries]] armed with [[Pike (weapon)#Renaissance heyday|pikes]] gained a formidable reputation during the perennial European wars of the Middle Ages.

In the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]] the people rose up against the nobles and authorities. Although defeated, the revolt resulted in reforms that prevented the rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] as in other parts of Europe. The Swiss to this day have an unusual form of government where almost all major decisions are voted upon by the people.

The Alpine people have at times been subject in part or whole to neighboring countries, but many in the central Alps maintained the independence of their communities until 1848, when they combined into the federal state of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse (DHS), Editions Gilles Attinger, Hauterive, {{ISBN|2-88256-133-4}} (2002-)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italian Alps]] also contain a diverse array of mountain cultures and [[valley]] towns. In the southern Alps in [[Northern Italy]], the [[Camuni]] people are famous for their [[rock drawings in Valcamonica]].

===Apennines===
[[File:Castel del Monte 0328.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Castel del Monte (Abruzzo)|Castel del Monte]], one of [[Abruzzo]]'s little-known hill towns]]
The [[Apennine mountains]] in [[Italy]] were home to [[List of ancient Italian peoples|pre-Roman cultures]] and [[Italic tribes]] for centuries, most notably the [[Etruscans]], the mountainous peoples known as the [[Praetutii]] and [[Picentes]], the [[Vestini]], the [[Aequi]], and [[Oscan-Umbrian language|Oscan-Umbrian]] tribes, including the [[Sabines]], [[Umbri]], [[Samnites]], [[Marrucini]], [[Hernici]], [[Marsi]], and [[Paeligni]]. The Apennines were notably the birthplace of pre-Roman [[Apennine culture]], a cultural complex throughout the Apennines in [[central Italy|central]] and [[southern Italy]] spanning much of the [[Bronze Age]]. The people of the Apennine culture were cattle herdsmen grazing their ungulates over the meadows and groves of mountainous central Italy, though their range was not confined to the hills. These tribes lived in small hamlets located in defensible places. On the move between summer pastures they built temporary camps or lived in caves and rock shelters. Their pottery has been found on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]].

The Apennines stretch from modern day [[Liguria]] to [[Reggio Calabria]], and mountain towns and communities can be found throughout the whole of the Apennine mountain range. However, certain regions, especially [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], eastern [[Lazio]], [[Umbria]], and [[Marche]], are home to larger, more prototypical mountain cultures, and these cultures often remained largely isolated from the wider Italian peninsular culture until modern times. The region of Abruzzo in particular is well known for its mountain [[shepherd]] culture, with [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]], [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], and [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]] being the most mountainous of Abruzzo's provinces. Abruzzo holds many of Italy's best-preserved and most beautiful medieval and Renaissance hill towns. The region is also the location of [[Gran Sasso]] and [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo National Park]], a haven for mountain-dwelling fauna such as the [[Chamois|Abruzzo chamois]], [[Italian wolf]], and the [[Apennine brown bear]].

Shepherd culture, which often thrives in mountainous regions, has significantly influenced the cultures of the Abruzzese peoples and other central Apennine peoples. For instance, [[bagpipes]] known as [[zampogna]], traditionally made from [[sheep]] or [[goat]] skin or organs, are prominent in traditional Abruzzese and central and southern Apennine folk music. Sheep dishes such as [[arrosticini]] are also common in [[Cuisine of Abruzzo|Abruzzese cuisine]] and central Apennine cuisine. The region is also home to [[mountain dog]]s and [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dogs]] such as the [[Pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese]], [[Italian Shepherd]], and [[Abruzzese Mastiff]], dog breeds used to protect sheep and livestock from predators in mountainous terrain. Further north, in [[Emilia-Romagna]], the shepherds in the Apennines near [[Reggio Emilia]] developed the shepherd dog breed [[Cane Lupino del Gigante]]. The [[Piccolo Segugio dell'Appennino]] is another Apennine dog breed found throughout the mountain range.

===Scottish Highlands===
[[File:Highland Dance 001.jpg|thumb|200px|Scottish [[highland dancing]]. The dancer is wearing kilt with [[sporran]], jacket, and bonnet while performing the [[sword dance]]]]
The [[Scottish Highlands]] include the rugged and mountainous regions of [[Scotland]] north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. They are inhabited by people of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] culture, although most now speak English. Traditionally the people lived by [[crofting]], or small-scale farming, growing crops such as [[oats]], [[barley]] and [[kale]], and supplemented their diet with fish and [[red deer]].

On festive occasions, the people eat [[haggis]], made from a sheep's heart, liver and lungs, minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and boiled in the animal's stomach for three hours. The haggis was immortalized by the lowland poet [[Robert Burns]] in his [[Burns supper#Entrance of the haggis|''Address to a Haggis'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dickson Wright | first = Clarissa | authorlink = Clarissa Dickson Wright | title = The Haggis: A Little History.  | publisher = Pelican Publishing Company | year = 1998 | isbn =  1-56554-364-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish clan]]s have a tradition of feuding among each other and resisting the authority of the central government based in the lowland city of [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam, Frank; [[Thomas Innes of Learney|Innes of Learney, Thomas]]|title=The Clans, Septs &amp; Regiments of the Scottish Highlands|edition=8th|year=1970|publisher=Johnston and Bacon|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Scottish regiment|Highland regiments]] went to war wearing [[tartan]] [[kilts]] accompanied by bagpipe players &amp;ndash; a sight and sound calculated to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalhighlanders.co.uk/ royalhighlanders.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930221719/http://www.royalhighlanders.co.uk/ |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black, Ltd., p. 25. e-book #22257 in [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Balkan Mountains]] run 560&amp;nbsp;km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between [[Bulgaria]] and eastern [[Serbia]] eastward through central Bulgaria to [[Cape Emine]] on the [[Black Sea]]. The highest peaks of the Stara planina are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is [[Botev Peak|Botev]] (2,376 m).

Lying between Austria, Italy, Turkey and the [[Ukraine]], the Balkans have had a turbulent history. At different times different parts of the Balkans were controlled by the [[Macedon#Empire|Macedonian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] empires.

The Balkans are home to people speaking [[Slavic languages]] ([[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bulgarians]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (related to [[Italian language|Italian]]), [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and other languages. Through its history many other ethnic groups with their own languages lived in the area, among them [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Celts]], [[Germans]] and various Germanic tribes. In addition to language, the people are divided by religion, adhering to the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], and [[Muslim]] religions, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jelavich |first=Barbara |authorlink=Barbara Jelavich  |title=History of the Balkans |date=1983-07-29 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caucasus===
[[File:Caucasus-ethnic en.svg|thumb|200px|Ethnolinguistic groups in the Caucasus region]]
The [[Caucasus Mountains]] is a range between the [[Black sea]] and the [[Caspian sea]]. It is home to Europe's highest mountain ([[Mount Elbrus]]). Modern countries of the Caucasus are [[Chechnya]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Republic of Dagestan|Dagestan]], [[Republic of Adygea|Adyghea]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Karachay–Cherkessia]], [[North Ossetia]], [[Krasnodar Krai]] and [[Stavropol Krai]], all parts of the [[Russian Federation]], and the independent countries of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (including the disputed [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]]), [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and Turkey.

The people of these mountains have very diverse origins, with cultures influenced by periods of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Iran]]ian and [[Russians|Russian]] control. Some, including the Georgians and Armenians, are mostly Christian, while others are [[Muslim]] in religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f1/v5f1a032.html Caucasus and Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140601/http://iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f1/v5f1a032.html |date=2007-10-12 }} entry in [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu Kush and Balochistan===
[[File:Ghilzai nomads in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Ghilzai]] [[nomads]] of Afghanistan.]]
The [[Hindu Kush]] is a mountain range located between [[Afghanistan]] and Pakistan. It is the westernmost extension of the [[Pamir Mountains]], the [[Karakoram Range]], and is a sub-range of the [[Himalayas]]. Lower mountains including the [[Sulaiman Range]] extend south to the [[Arabian Sea]].

The people of this region generally speak [[Indo-Iranian languages]] such as [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and languages of the [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] and [[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]] groups. The [[Brahui people]] speak a [[Dravidian language]]. There are many distinct tribes. The history of the region has been turbulent, lying in the path of invasions from the [[Persia]]ns, the [[Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Arabs]], [[Mughals]] and British. Given the rugged geography, central governments have generally had limited control over the tribes, a situation that persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Banuazizi, Ali and [[Myron Weiner]] (eds.). 1994.

===Pamirs===
The Pamir Mountains are in [[Central Asia]], formed by the junction of the [[Tian Shan]], [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]], and [[Hindu Kush]] ranges. They are among the world's highest mountains and in Victorian times they were known as the 'Roof of the World'. The people of this region are mostly [[Tajik people]], and speak [[Pamir languages]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] (closely related to [[Persian language|Persian]]), [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]].

===Himalayas===
[[File:Baba in Nepal.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Old sadhu with white beard in Nepal.]]
The [[Himalayas]] lie between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Tibetan Plateau]], thrown up by the collision of two [[tectonic plates]]. They include world's highest peaks including [[Mount Everest]] and [[K2]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Himalayas stretch across [[Bhutan]], China, India, [[Nepal]], Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

People have filtered into the mountains from the northern plateau and from the southern plains and intermingled. They mostly speak [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] such as [[Gurung language|Gurung]] and [[Nepal Bhasa]] or [[Indo-Aryan languages]] such as [[Garhwali language|Garhwali]], [[Shina language|Shina]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Dogri]], [[Northern Indo-Aryan languages|Pahari]] (which means "language of the mountain people"), [[Kumauni language|Kumaoni]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Assamese language|Asamiya]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anthologia anthropologica. The native races of Asia and Europe;'' by James George Frazer, Sir; Robert Angus Downie&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurkha]] people of Nepal are well known for their history of bravery and strength, and still serve in foreign armies such as the [[British Army]]'s [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and the [[Indian Army]]'s [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/ Brigade of Gurkhas website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220195813/http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruit, vegetables and sheep flourish in the fertile valley of [[Kashmir]]. The people have evolved the unique and famous [[Kashmiri cuisine]] with Iranian, Indian and Turkic origins. While the stricter [[Hindus]] may restrict themselves to rice with vegetables, curd, milk and fresh fruit, the [[Muslims]] eat [[pilaf]] and [[mutton]] stuffed with spices, [[apricots]] stuffed with mutton, roast kid, fish and honey rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Godden | first =  Rumer | year = 1953 | title = Kingfishers Catch Fire | publisher = MacMillan | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further east, a typical Nepalese meal includes ''Dal'', a spicy lentil soup, served over ''bhat'' (boiled rice) with ''tarkari'' (curried vegetables) together with ''achar'' (pickles) or ''chutni'' (spicy condiment made from fresh ingredients). In the hills of Nepal, people enjoy their own kind of music, playing [[sarangi]] (a string instrument), [[madal]] (a hand drum) and [[flute]]. They also have many popular folk songs known as lok geet and lok dohari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_nepal.html National Geographic Country Profile: Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asian Massif and Zomia{{anchor|South-East Asia}}===
[[File:Elderly Akha woman2.jpg|thumb|left|Elderly Akha woman, Northeast Thailand]]
The mainland portion of [[Southeast Asia]] consists of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], and [[Assam]] in India. The hills of this region include tribes of [[Tibeto-Burman]] peoples including the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Bodo-Kachari]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]] Mien, [[Mizo people|Mizo]] (Mizo is under the sub-group of [[Zo people|Zomi]] )and [[Lisu people|Lisu]]. It is thought that they drifted down into the area from [[Tibet]].

Many of the tribes are spread across more than one country; the Karen people live in Burma and Thailand, the [[Zomi people]] live in the [[Chin State]], [[Sagaing Region]] of [[Burma]] and the [[Mizoram State]], [[Manipur]] in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. The Zomi are known as Chin-Kuki-Mizo. Their language is common or overlap approximately more than 40%. They live with three countries: India, Burma and [[Bangladesh]]. The Akha people live in small villages among the mountains of China, Laos, [[Burma]], and northern Thailand. They often retain their traditional way of life but are under increasing pressure to do so. As minorities, they tend to be less well off than the majority of people in the countries where they live.

Interesting theorisations about the hill people from this region include the notions of "Southeast Asian Massif" and "Zomia". [[Southeast Asian Massif]] was proposed by Laval University anthropologist Jean Michaud in 1997. This high region extending eastward from the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau covers more than 2.5 million square kilometers and comprises nearly one hundred million marginal peoples. This large area is inside the fringe of ten states and at the middle of none, stretching across the standard regional designations (South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia); along with its ecological diversity and its relation to states, it arouses a lot of interest. It stands for an original entity of study, a type of international Appalachia, and a different way in which to study regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Michaud | first= Jean |title= Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif| publisher= Scarecrow Press| year= 2006| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zomia (region)|Zomia]] is a geographical term coined in 2002 by historian Willem van Schendel of the University of Amsterdam to refer to the huge massif of mainland Southeast Asia that has historically been beyond the control of governments based in the population centers of the lowlands. The massif arose during the Alpine orogeny, when the African, Indian and Cimmerian Plates, and smaller Asian terrains, collided with that of Eurasia. The name is from Zomi, a term for highlander common to several related Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the India-Bangladesh-Burma border area.

The exact boundaries of Zomia differ among scholars: all would include the highlands of north Indochina (north Vietnam and all Laos,) Thailand, the Shan State of northern Burma, and the mountains of Southwest China, others extend the region as far west as Tibet, north India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. These areas share a common elevated, rugged terrain, and have been the home of ethnic minorities that have preserved their local cultures by residing far from state control and influence. Other scholars have used the term to discuss the similar ways that Southeast Asian governments have handled minority groups. Once such is Yale University Professor [[James C. Scott]], who address the issue in his 2009 book ''[[The Art of Not Being Governed|The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia]]''. From the Preface:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hill tribes] seen from the valley kingdoms as “our living ancestors,” “what we were like before we discovered wet-rice cultivation, Buddhism, and civilization” [are on the contrary] best understood as runaway, fugitive, maroon communities who have, over the course of two millennia, been fleeing the oppressions of state-making projects in the valleys — slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Thailand===
A 2013 newspaper article from the [[Bangkok Post]] said that "Nearly a million hill people and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders, criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land."&lt;ref name=Thainess&gt;[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/366720/time-ripe-for-whole-new-take-on-thainess Time ripe for whole new take on 'Thainess']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] of Vietnam have traditionally been populated by a majority of hill tribes, all of whom are culturally distinct from the ethnic Vietnamese population of the lowlands. Collectively known as [[Degar|Montagnard]] (French for "mountain people"), they are also referred derogatorily as ''mọi'' (literally "savage" in Vietnamese).&lt;ref&gt;H. Maître (1909) [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGu5mgEACAAJ ''Les Régions Moi du Sud-lndochinois: Le plateau de Darlac'']&lt;/ref&gt; While Vietnamese expansion into the Central Highlands dates back to the [[French Indochina|French colonial period]], large-scale settlement did not occur until after the [[Vietnam War]]. Today, the Montagnards form a minority in much of the Central Highlands, with the exception of a few areas.&lt;ref name=minority&gt;General Statistics Office (1996): Population Data of Sparsely Populated Areas in Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi&lt;/ref&gt;

Local Vietnamese assisted French colonial armies in suppressing rebellions among the hill tribes during the early 20th century, with some calls for completely ridding the Central Highlands of the "uncivilized" hill tribes for large-scale Vietnamese and French settlement. Political and economic barriers prevented hill tribes from obtaining high levels of education and entering commerce, although outright legal discrimination against Montagnards was made illegal by the colonial government.&lt;ref&gt;AOM Gougal F 03.79: Annexe du rapport politique de l'Annam, 9/1937&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vietnam War, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|American Special Forces]] trained many hill tribes in Vietnam to stop Viet Cong activity in the region and to prevent them from aligning with the Viet Cong.&lt;ref name= cmh&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.history.army.mil/BOOKS/Vietnam/90-23/90-23C.htm | title =  History of Special Forces in Vietnam, 1961-1971  | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | first = Francis John | last = Kelly | origyear = 1973| year = 1989 | location = Washington, D.C.| id =CMH Pub 90-23

===New Guinea highlands===
[[File:KorowaiHombre01.jpg|thumb|[[Korowai people|Korowai]] tribesman]]
[[New Guinea]], located just north of Australia, is the world's second-largest island. A central east-west mountain range dominates the geography of New Guinea and contains the highest mountains in [[Oceania]], rising up to 4884 m high. The island is populated by very nearly a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. They fall into one of two groups, speakers of the [[Papuan languages]] and later arrivals who speak [[Austronesian languages]].

The gardens of the [[New Guinea Highlands]] are ancient, intensive [[permaculture]]s, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000&amp;nbsp;mm/yr (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. The people use complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Native gardeners are as or more successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.

===Appalachians===
{{Main article|Appalachia}}
The [[Appalachian Mountains]] are a vast system of mountains in eastern North America. Before the Europeans reached the area around 1650, the mountains were inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] people; speakers of [[Iroquoian languages]] such as the [[Cherokee]]; and [[Siouan]] people such as the [[Occaneechi]], [[Tutelo]] and [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]]. Upon European arrival to the mountains, the American Indians were [[Indian Removal|driven west]] through a series of laws, wars, and treaties.  Many of these early inhabitants also died from European diseases (e.g. [[smallpox]]).  Few of the early inhabitants remain,&lt;ref&gt;Snipp, C. M. ''American Indians: The first of this land''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; but surviving communities include the [[Ramapough Mountain Indians]] and the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].

European migration was primarily led by the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], a group of people from northern England, the [[Scottish Lowlands]] (versus the [[Scottish Highlands]]) and [[Ulster|Ulster, Ireland]].  These yeoman farmers were romanticized for their independence, ruggedness, and self-sufficiency, perhaps best represented by the frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]].  The Appalachian settlers often had a hostile relationship with their lowland coastal neighbors, sometimes culminating in revolts like the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] and the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=drake&gt;Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[American Civil War]], tensions were so high between hill peoples and lowland peoples that 55 Appalachian counties broke away from the state of [[Virginia]] to form [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/statehood12.html |title="Chapter Twelve "Reorganized Government of Virginia Approves Separation" |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, negative stereotypes of the region and its people began to develop.  The [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]] (1878–1891) was widely reported and encouraged the stereotype of violent, vengeful and impoverished people.  The 1972 film ''[[Deliverance]]'' depicted the hill people as backward, hostile to outsiders, and potentially inbred (a stereotype of the "[[Hillbilly]]" culture).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0068473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the creation of the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965, the economic situation of the region has improved dramatically, and some aspects of the hillbilly stereotype have disappeared.  However, the people of Appalachia are still commonly viewed as uneducated and unrefined.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. "Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocky Mountains===
[[File:mesaverde cliffpalace 20030914.752.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Cliff Palace, [[Mesa Verde National Park]]]]
The [[Rocky Mountains]] stretch more than {{convert|4,800|km|mi|sp=us}} from northernmost [[British Columbia]], in Canada, to [[New Mexico]], in the United States. The range's highest peak is [[Mount Elbert]] in [[Colorado]] at {{convert|14,440|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level.

As the Europeans continued to move west, they took most of the lands of the people who lived in the Rockies, forcing the [[Ute tribe|Ute]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Apache]], [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] and other tribes to assimilate or move onto reservations. Some adapted to farming or sheep herding, but they are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups in the USA.

The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] who lived in the present-day [[Four Corners]] area of the [[Southwestern United States]] were noted for their distinctive pottery and dwelling construction styles. The cultural group is often referred to as the [[Anasazi]]. Some of their unusual cliff dwellings still stand today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/People/population_change.htm An Early Population Explosion on the Colorado Plateau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205191339/http://cpluhna.nau.edu/People/population_change.htm |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ishi]] (c. 1860 – March 25, 1916) was presumed to be the last member of the [[Yahi people]], the last surviving group of the [[Yana people]] in the U.S. state of California. What is now the [[Western United States]] has long been home to [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin]], who live mainly in desert regions and share characteristic with hill people.

===Mexican Sierras===

The [[American Cordillera]] in Mexico includes the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. The mountain valleys have a temperate climate and fertile soil, and were the cradles of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations that flourished long before Europeans discovered the area, including the [[Olmec civilization|Olmec]],  [[Teotihuacán]], [[Toltec]], [[Aztec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Mixtec]] cultures. The bold patterns and deep saturated colors of the Mesoamerican artists are echoed in modern [[Mexican art]] and architecture.

After the Spanish invasion of 1519, led by [[Hernán Cortés]], most people eventually adopted the [[Spanish language]], but there remain many groups who retain their original languages and live traditional ways of life. These include the [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotec people|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Otomí people|Otomí]], [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]], [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]], [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Mazateco]], [[Chinantec]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], [[Mixe]] and [[Tlapanec people|Tlapanec]].&lt;ref name="cdi"&gt;[http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=3 Los pueblos indígenas de México], Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Mexican diet is based on [[maize]], beans, [[chili pepper]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[cactus]] and other native plants, supplemented by [[iguana]], [[rattlesnake]], fish and venison. [[Mexican cuisine]] today is one of the most rich and varied in the world.&lt;ref name="Long-solís2005"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Long-solís | first1 = Janet | last2 = Vargas | first2 = Luis Alberto | year = 2005 | title = Food culture in Mexico | isbn = 978-0-313-32431-4 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Spanish came, the inhabitants of the land used [[drum]]s, [[flute]]s, [[maraca]]s, [[seashell]]s and voices to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/mexican_regional_756 National Geographic World Music entry - Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andes===
[[File:A Quechua girl and her Llama.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Quechua people|Quechua]] girl and her llama in [[Cuzco]]]]
The [[Andes]] form the world's longest exposed mountain range, a continuous chain of highland along the western coast of South America. The range is over {{convert|7,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|200|-|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide (widest between 18° to 20°S latitude), and of an average height of about {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Before the Spanish invasion led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in 1532 the Andes were primarily inhabited by [[Quechua people]]s such as the [[Inca]], [[Chancas]], [[Huancas]] and [[Cañari]] in the north, and [[Aymaras]] further south. Their economy was based on the [[potato]] crop, which originated in the area, and the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]], used for their wool and meat. Unlike most mountain people, the inhabitants of the Andes appear to have been generally unwarlike.&lt;ref&gt;Mariátegui, José Carlos, Siete ensayos de interpretación de la realidad peruana, Ediciones Era, 1979, p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21357">'''Informal logic''', intuitively, refers to the principles of [[logic]] and logical thought outside of a [[Formal logic|formal]] setting.  However, perhaps because of the "informal" in the title, the precise definition of "informal logic" is a matter of some dispute.&lt;ref&gt;See Johnson 1999 for a survey of definitions.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Johnson (philosopher)|Ralph H. Johnson]] and [[J. Anthony Blair]] define informal logic as "a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards, criteria, procedures for the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, criticism and construction of argumentation."&lt;ref name="J&amp;B"&gt;Johnson, Ralph H., and Blair, J. Anthony (1987), "The Current State of Informal Logic", ''Informal Logic'', 9(2–3), 147–151. Johnson &amp; Blair added "... in everyday discourse" but in (2000), modified their definition, and broadened the focus now to include the sorts of argument that occurs not just in everyday discourse but also disciplined inquiry—what Weinstein (1990) calls "stylized discourse."&lt;/ref&gt; This definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts.

Informal logic is associated with [[List of fallacies#Informal fallacies|(informal) fallacies]], [[critical thinking]], the thinking skills movement&lt;ref&gt;Resnick, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the interdisciplinary inquiry known as [[argumentation theory]]. [[Frans H. van Eemeren]] writes that the label "informal logic" covers a "collection of normative approaches to the study of reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the practice of argumentation than formal logic."&lt;ref name="LunsfordWilson2009"/&gt;

== History ==
{{undue weight|section|date=August 2014}}
Informal logic as a distinguished enterprise under this name emerged roughly in the late 1970s as a sub-field of [[philosophy]]. The naming of the field was preceded by the appearance of a number of textbooks that rejected the [[symbolic logic|symbolic]] approach to [[logic]] on [[pedagogical]] grounds as inappropriate and unhelpful for introductory [[textbooks]] on logic for a general audience, for example [[Howard Kahane]]'s ''Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric'', subtitled "The Use of Reason in Everyday Life", first published in 1971. Kahane's textbook was described on the notice of his death in the ''[[Proceedings And Addresses of the American Philosophical Association]]'' (2002) as "a text in informal logic, [that] was intended to enable students to cope with the misleading rhetoric one frequently finds in the media and in political discourse. It was organized around a discussion of fallacies, and was meant to be a practical instrument for dealing with the problems of everyday life. [It has] ... gone through many editions; [it is] ... still in print; and the thousands upon thousands of students who have taken courses in which his text [was] ... used can thank Howard for contributing to their ability to dissect arguments and avoid the deceptions of deceitful rhetoric. He tried to put into practice the ideal of discourse that aims at truth rather than merely at persuasion. (Hausman et al. 2002)"&lt;ref name=h25/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{JSTOR|3218569}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other textbooks from the era taking this approach were [[Michael Scriven]]'s ''Reasoning'' (Edgepress, 1976) and ''Logical Self-Defense'' by [[Ralph Johnson (philosopher)|Ralph Johnson]] and [[J. Anthony Blair]], first published in 1977.&lt;ref name=h25/&gt; Earlier precursors in this tradition can be considered [[Monroe Beardsley]]'s ''Practical Logic'' (1950) and [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s ''The Uses of Argument'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Fisher (2004) p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The field perhaps became recognized under its current name with the ''First International Symposium on Informal Logic'' held in 1978. Although initially motivated by a new pedagogical approach to undergraduate logic textbooks, the scope of the field was basically defined by a list of 13 problems and issues which Blair and Johnson included as an appendix to their [[keynote address]] at this symposium:&lt;ref name=h25/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Blair and Ralph H. Johnson (eds.), Informal Logic: The First International Symposium, 3-28. Pt. Reyes, CA: Edgepress&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hitchcock argues that the naming of the field was unfortunate, and that ''philosophy of argument'' would have been more appropriate. He argues that more undergraduate students in North America study informal logic than any other branch of philosophy, but that as of 2003 informal logic (or philosophy of argument) was not recognized as separate sub-field by the [[World Congress of Philosophy]].&lt;ref name=h25&gt;David Hitchcock, [http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~hitchckd/25.pdf Informal logic 25 years later] in ''Informal Logic at 25: Proceedings of the Windsor Conference (OSSA 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frans H. van Eemeren]] wrote that "informal logic" is mainly an approach to [[argumentation]] advanced by a group of US and Canadian philosophers and largely based on the previous works of [[Stephen Toulmin]] and to a lesser extent those of [[Chaïm Perelman]].&lt;ref name="LunsfordWilson2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Andrea A. Lunsford |editor2=Kirt H. Wilson |editor3=Rosa A. Eberly |title=The SAGE handbook of rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYRf2JACLGkC&amp;pg=PA117|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-0950-1|page=117|chapter=The Study of Argumentation|author=Frans H. van Eemeren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the symposia, since 1983 the journal ''Informal Logic'' has been the publication of record of the field, with Blair and Johnson as initial editors, with the editorial board now including two other colleagues from the [[University of Windsor]]—[[Christopher Tindale]] and Hans V. Hansen.&lt;ref&gt;http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/about/editorialTeam&lt;/ref&gt; Other journals that regularly publish articles on informal logic include ''Argumentation'' (founded in 1986), ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', ''[[Argumentation and Advocacy]]'' (the journal of the [[American Forensic Association]]), and ''[[Inquiry: Critical Thinking Across the Disciplines]]'' (founded in 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Blair (2000), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed definitions==
Johnson and Blair (2000) proposed the following definition: "Informal logic designates that branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; standards, criteria, procedures for the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, critique and construction of argumentation in everyday discourse." Their meaning of non-formal&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is taken from Barth and Krabbe (1982), which is explained below.

To understand the definition above, one must understand  "informal" which takes its meaning in contrast to its counterpart "formal." (This point was not made for a very long time, hence the nature of informal logic remained opaque, even to those involved in it, for a period of time.) Here it is helpful to have recourse&lt;ref&gt;As Johnson (1999) does.&lt;/ref&gt; to Barth and Krabbe (1982:14f) where they distinguish three senses of the term "form." By "form&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;," Barth and Krabbe mean the sense of the term which derives from the [[Plato]]nic [[Theory of forms|idea of form]]—the ultimate [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] unit. Barth and Krabbe claim that most traditional logic is formal in this sense. That is, syllogistic logic is a logic of terms where the terms could naturally be understood as place-holders for Platonic (or [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]) forms. In this first sense of "form," almost all logic is informal (not-formal). Understanding informal logic this way would be much too broad to be useful.

By "form&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;," Barth and Krabbe mean the form of sentences and statements as these are understood in modern systems of logic. Here [[Validity (logic)|validity]] is the focus: if the [[premise]]s are true, the conclusion must then also be true. Now validity has to do with the [[logical form]] of the statement that makes up the argument. In this sense of "formal," most modern and contemporary logic is "formal." That is, such logics canonize the notion of logical form, and the notion of validity plays the central normative role. In this second sense of form, informal logic is not-formal, because it abandons the notion of logical form as the key to understanding the [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] of arguments, and likewise retires validity as normative for the purposes of the evaluation of argument. It seems to many that validity is too stringent a requirement, that there are good arguments in which the conclusion is supported by the premises even though it does not follow necessarily from them (as validity requires). An argument in which the conclusion is thought to be "beyond reasonable doubt, given the premises" is sufficient in law to cause a person to be sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]], even though it does not meet the standard of logical validity. This type of argument, based on accumulation of evidence rather than pure [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], is called a conductive argument.

By "form&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;," Barth and Krabbe mean to refer to "procedures which are somehow regulated or regimented, which take place according to some set of rules." Barth and Krabbe say that "we do not defend formality&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of all kinds and under all circumstances." Rather "we defend the thesis that verbal [[dialectic]]s must have a certain form (i.e., must proceed according to certain rules) in order that one can speak of the discussion as being won or lost" (19). In this third sense of "form", informal logic can be formal, for there is nothing in the informal logic enterprise that stands opposed to the idea that argumentative [[discourse]] should be subject to norms, i.e., subject to rules, criteria, standards or procedures. Informal logic does present standards for the evaluation of argument, procedures for detecting missing premises etc.

Johnson and Blair (2000) noticed a limitation of their own definition, particularly with respect to "everyday discourse", which could indicate that it does not seek to understand specialized, domain-specific arguments made in natural languages. Consequently, they have argued that the crucial divide is between arguments made in [[formal language]]s and those made in [[natural language]]s.

Fisher and Scriven (1997) proposed a more encompassing definition, seeing informal logic as "the discipline which studies the practice of critical thinking and provides its intellectual spine". By "critical thinking" they understand "skilled and active interpretation and evaluation of observations and communications, information and argumentation."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Blair (2000), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some hold the view that informal logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even the view that there cannot be such a thing as informal logic.&lt;ref name="Massey, 1981"&gt;Massey, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Massey criticizes informal logic on the grounds that it has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the [[Validity (logic)|invalidity]] of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like [[psychology]], than to philosophy and logic.&lt;ref name="Massey, 1981"/&gt;

==Relation to critical thinking==
{{See also|Critical thinking}}

Since the 1980s, informal logic has been partnered and even equated,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2000) takes the conflation to be part of the Network Problem and holds that settling the issue will require a theory of reasoning.&lt;/ref&gt; in the minds of many, with critical thinking. The precise definition of "[[critical thinking]]" is a subject of much dispute.&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1992"&gt;Johnson, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Critical thinking, as defined by Johnson, is the evaluation of an intellectual product (an argument, an explanation, a theory) in terms of its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1992"/&gt; While critical thinking will include evaluation of arguments and hence require skills of argumentation including informal logic, critical thinking requires additional abilities not supplied by informal logic, such as the ability to obtain and assess information and to clarify meaning. Also, many believe that critical thinking requires certain dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;Ennis, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Understood in this way, "critical thinking" is a broad term for the attitudes and skills that are involved in analyzing and evaluating arguments. The critical thinking movement promotes critical thinking as an educational ideal. The movement emerged with great force in the '80s in North America as part of an ongoing critique of education as regards the thinking skills not being taught.

==Relation to argumentation theory==
{{See also|Argumentation theory}}

The social, communicative practice of argumentation can and should be distinguished from implication (or [[Logical consequence|entailment]])—a relationship between propositions; and from inference—a mental activity typically thought of as the drawing of a conclusion from premises. Informal logic may thus be said to be a logic of argumentation, as distinguished from implication and inference.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Argumentation theory is interdisciplinary in the sense that no one discipline will be able to provide a complete account. A full appreciation of argumentation requires insights from logic (both formal and informal), rhetoric, communication theory, linguistics, psychology, and, increasingly, computer science. Since the 1970s, there has been significant agreement that there are three basic approaches to argumentation theory: the logical, the rhetorical and the dialectical. According to Wenzel,&lt;ref&gt;Wenzel (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; the logical approach deals with the product, the dialectical with the process, and the rhetorical with the procedure. Thus, informal logic is one contributor to this inquiry, being most especially concerned with the norms of argument.

[[File:Gemeentehuis Tegelen.JPG|thumb|The former town hall of Tegelen]]

'''Ithaka Science Center''', a hands-on science education center in [[Tegelen]] in the [[Netherlands]] was founded in 2008 as a [[non-profit]] organization by Vaggelis E. Fragiadakis and Margriet van Tulder and funded as a [[public-private partnership]]. Its goal: to present interactive [[exhibits]], programs, public lectures, and other events for schools and the general public. 

==Building==
The [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] location at Raadhuislaan 11, in [[Tegelen]], the Netherlands, is a historic building that served as the [[city hall]] for Tegelen. The historic façade and many internal architectural details have been preserved.

==Exhibits==
A major feature of the center is a mixture of permanent and temporary exhibits that demonstrate scientific and technical principles. Exhibits are labeled in Dutch, English and in German, as the center is within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the border with Germany, and was designed to host visitors and schools from both countries. The first series of exhibits dealt with [[energy]], [[light]], and [[gravity]]. The center integrated science exhibits with art displays inspired by scientific themes. The art shown changes periodically.

==Science education==
Before the center moved into the former townhall, Ithaka created [[science education]] programs and conferences, such as energy exhibitions, science clubs, school activities, master classes, and other special events.

For classroom teachers, the Ithaka Science Center has assembled and provides science activity kits which included instruments, materials and instructions for topics including [[electricity]], [[air]], [[mechanics]], [[magnetism]], properties of [[solids]], [[liquids]] and [[gases]].

The center has hosted numerous speakers on science, [[technology]], and science education. Among them have been Nobel Laureates [[George Smoot]], [[Douglas Osheroff]], and [[Eric Maskin]].

The center has online activities for children, and had produced a children's science exploration [[television program]].

'''Jacques Huber''' (13 October 1867 [[Schleitheim]] – 18 February 1914 [[Belém]]) was a [[Swiss]]-[[Brazil]]ian [[botanist]] who did pioneering work on the flora of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] from 1895 until his death. He created and organized the herbarium and arboretum in [[Belém]], Brazil, and was director of the [[Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi]] from 1907 until he died.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2133">[[File:The Kaye-Effect.jpg|thumb|250px|A falling stream of shampoo shows the Kaye Effect]]

The '''Kaye effect''' is a property of complex liquids which was first described by the [[United Kingdom|British]] engineer [[Alan Kaye]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaye | first1 = A. | title = A Bouncing Liquid Stream | doi = 10.1038/1971001a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 197 | issue = 4871 | pages = 1001 | year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1963Natur.197.1001K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While pouring one viscous mixture of an [[organic liquid]] onto a surface, the surface suddenly spouted an upcoming jet of liquid which merged with the downgoing one.

This phenomenon has since been discovered to be common in all [[shear thinning|shear-thinning]] liquids (liquids which thin under [[shear stress]]). Common household liquids with this property are liquid hand soaps, shampoos and non-drip paint. The effect usually goes unnoticed, however, because it seldom lasts more than about 300 milliseconds. The effect can be sustained by pouring the liquid onto a slanted surface, preventing the outgoing jet from intersecting the downward one (which tends to end the effect).

It is thought to occur when the downgoing stream "slips" off the pile it is forming, and due to a thin layer of shear-thinned liquid acting as a lubricant, does not combine with the pile. When the slipping stream reaches a dimple in the pile, it will shoot off it like a ramp, creating the effect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The '''L5 Society''' was founded in 1975 by [[Carolyn Meinel]] and [[Keith Henson]] to promote the [[space colonization|space colony]] ideas of [[Gerard K. O'Neill]].

In 1987 the L5 Society merged with the [[National Space Institute]] to form the [[National Space Society]].

==Name==
[[Image:Lagrange points Earth vs Moon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram showing the five [[Lagrangian point]]s in a two-body system, with one body far more massive than the other (e.g. Earth and Moon). In this system {{L3}}–{{L5}} will appear to share the secondary's orbit, although they are situated slightly outside it.]]
The name comes from the {{L4}} and {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]]s in the [[Earth]]–[[Moon]] system proposed as locations for the huge rotating [[space habitat]]s that O'Neill envisioned. {{L4}} and {{L5}} are points of stable gravitational equilibrium located along the path of the moon's orbit, 60 degrees ahead or behind it.

An object placed in orbit around {{L5}} (or {{L4}}) will remain there indefinitely without having to expend fuel to keep its position, whereas an object placed at {{L1}}, {{L2}} or {{L3}} (all points of unstable equilibrium) may have to expend fuel if it drifts off the point.

==History==
===Founding of L5 Society===
[[Image:Stanford Torus interior.jpg|right|thumb|340px|Artist's conception of a [[space habitat]] called the [[Stanford torus]], by [[Don Davis (artist)|Don Davis]].]]
O'Neill's first published paper on the subject, "The Colonization of Space", appeared in the magazine ''[[Physics Today]]'' in September 1974. A number of people who later became leaders of the {{L5}} Society got their first exposure to the idea from this article. Among these were a couple from Tucson, Arizona, [[Carolyn Meinel]] and [[Keith Henson]]. The Hensons corresponded with O'Neill and were invited to present a paper on "Closed Ecosystems of High Agricultural Yield" at the 1975 Princeton Conference on Space Manufacturing Facilities, which was organized by O'Neill.&lt;ref name=oneilchilds&gt;[http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacemovement/chapter05.htm Chapter 5: O'Neills Children], Reaching for the High Frontier, The American Pro-Space Movement 1972–84, by Michael A. G. Michaud, National Space Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this conference, O'Neill merged the [[Solar Power Satellite]] (SPS) ideas of [[Peter Glaser]] with his [[space habitat]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacestudiesinstitute.wordpress.com/1975/12/ Pg 5], Archive for December, 1975, Space Studies Institute {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hensons incorporated the {{L5}} Society in August 1975, and sent its first 4-page newsletter in September to a sign up list from the conference and  O'Neill's mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt-Erichsen, David. The L5 Society. "Reprinted from Ad Astra, the magazine of the National Space Society, Nov.-Dec., 1994." Ad Astra, November/December 1994. Retrieved from http://www.nss.org/settlement/L5news/L5history.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first newsletter included a letter of support from [[Morris Udall]] (then a contender for US president) and said "our clearly stated long range goal will be to disband the Society in a mass meeting at {{L5}}."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/L5news/L5news/L5news7509.pdf L-5 News, 1975], L-5 News, A Newsletter from the L-5 Society, Number 1, September 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon Treaty===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:2001 film Clavius surveyors.jpg|thumb|350px|Establishing a permanent [[Colonization of the Moon|colony on the moon]] was not yet a reality by the time '''''2001''''' came and went (image: MGM).]] --&gt;
The peak of {{L5}}'s influence was the defeat of the [[Moon Treaty]] in the U.S. Senate in 1980 ("... L-5 took on the biggest political fight of its short life, and won").&lt;ref name=oneilchilds /&gt;  Specifically, {{L5}} Society activists campaigned for awareness of the provisions against any form of sovereignty or private property in outer space that would make space colonization impossible and the provisions against any alteration of the environment of any celestial body prohibiting [[terraforming]].  Leight "Ratiner [a Washington lawyer/lobbyist] played the key role in the lobbying effort, although he had energetic help from L-5 activists, notably Eric Drexler and Chris Peterson."[http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacemovement/chapter05.htm][http://www.nss.org/settlement/L5news/1980-treaty.htm]

Although economic analysis &lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Gerard K.  "Space Colonies and Energy Supply to the Earth,"  Science 190:943–947. December 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; indicated the SPS/space colony concept had merit, it foundered on short political and economic horizons and the fact that the transport cost to space was about 300 times too high for individuals to fund when compared to the [[Plymouth Rock]] and [[Mormon Corridor|Mormon colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;See the chapter "Pilgrims, Saints and Spacemen" in [[Freeman Dyson]]'s ''[[Disturbing the Universe]]'' for an analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger with National Space Institute===
In 1986, the {{L5}} Society, which had grown to about 10,000 members, merged with the 25,000 member [[National Space Institute]], to form the present-day [[National Space Society]].  The National Space Institute had been founded in 1972 by [[Wernher von Braun]], the former German [[rocket engineering|rocket engineer]] of the WW II  [[Nazi]] [[V-2 rocket facilities of World War II|V-2 rocket/ballistic missile program]], and of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and [[Project Apollo]] program manager. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/about/ About the National Space Society (NSS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the {{L5}} Society failed to achieve the goal of human settlements in space, it served as a [[Focal point (game theory)|focal point]] for many of the people who later became known in fields such as [[nanotechnology]], [[memetics]], [[extropian]]ism, [[cryonics]], [[transhumanism]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[tether propulsion]], such as [[K. Eric Drexler]], [[Robert Forward]], and [[Hans Moravec]].&lt;ref&gt;A journalistic account can be found  in ''[[Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition]]'' by [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]] (1990 – {{ISBN|0-201-09258-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A more scholarly treatment is the 2012 book ''The Visioneers'' by historian [[W. Patrick McCray]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.nss.org/settlement/L5news/index.html ''L5 News''] was the newsletter of the {{L5}} Society reporting on [[space habitat]] development and related space issues.  The {{L5}} News was published from September 1975 until April 1987, when the merger with the National Space Institute was completed and the newly formed National Space Society began publication of its own magazine, [[Ad Astra (magazine)|''Ad Astra'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5473">The '''Late Elongated Hypocotyl''' gene ('''LHY'''), is an [[oscillating gene]] found in [[plants]] that functions as part of their [[circadian clock]]. LHY encodes components of mutually regulatory negative [[feedback loop]]s with [[Circadian Clock Associated 1]] (CCA1) in which overexpression of either results in dampening of both of their expression. This negative feedback loop affects the rhythmicity of multiple outputs creating a daytime protein complex.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunlap | first1 = JC | year = 1999 | title = Molecular Bases for Circadian Clocks | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 96 | issue = 2| pages = 271–290 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80566-8 | pmid = 9988221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LHY was one of the first genes identified in the plant clock, along with [[TOC1 (gene)|TOC1]] and CCA1. LHY and CCA1 have similar patterns of expression, which is capable of being induced by [[light]].&lt;ref name="hypocotyl"&gt;Lu, S. X. , and S. M., Andronis. "CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL Function Synergistically in the Circadian Clock of Arabidopsis" Plant Physiology Vol. 150. (2009): 834–843.&lt;/ref&gt; Single loss-of-function mutants in both genes result in seemingly identical phenotypes, but LHY cannot fully rescue the rhythm when CCA1 is absent, indicating that they may only be partially functionally redundant. Under constant light conditions, CCA1 and LHY double loss-of-function mutants fail to maintain rhythms in clock-controlled RNAs.&lt;ref name = "first" &gt;Green, RM. "Loss of the circadian clock-associated protein 1 in Arabidopsis results in altered clock-regulated gene expression." Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Vol. 96. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian clock in plants has completely different components to those in the animal, fungus or bacterial clocks. The plant clock does have a conceptual similarity to the animal clock in that it consists of a series of interlocking transcriptional feedback loops. The genes involved in the clock show their peak expression at a fixed time of day. The peak expression of the CCA1 and LHY genes occurs at dawn, and the peak expression of the TOC1 gene occurs roughly at dusk. CCA1/LHY and TOC1 proteins repress the expression of each others genes. The result is that as CCA1/LHY protein levels start to reduce after dawn, it releases the repression on the TOC1 gene, allowing TOC1 expression and TOC1 protein levels to increase. As TOC1 protein levels increase, it further suppresses the expression of the CCA1 and LHY genes. The opposite of this sequence occurs overnight to re-establish the peak expression of CCA1 and LHY genes at dawn. 

CCA1 is generally a more significant component of this oscillator. Light induces its transcription, and [[mRNA]] levels peak at dawn along with LHY.&lt;ref name="Shlomit"&gt;Kangisser, Shlomit, Esther Yakir, and Rachel M. Green. "Proteasomal regulation of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) stability is part of the complex control of CCA1" Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior Vol. Volume 8, Issue 3. (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; CCA1 and LHY associate to inhibit transcription of the Evening Complex (EC) proteins: ELF4, ELF3 and LUX, which suppresses their accumulation until dusk when LHY and CCA1 protein levels are at their lowest. Four primary [[pseudo-response regulator]] proteins (PRR9, PRR7, PRR5 and [[TOC1 (gene)|TOC1]]/PRR1) perform the majority of interactions with other proteins within the circadian oscillator, and another (PRR3) that has limited function. These genes are all paralogs of each other, and all repress the transcription of CCA1 and LHY at various times throughout the day.

Plants that have lost function of LHY and CCA1 lose the ability to stably maintain circadian rhythm and other output phenomena. In one study, such plants showed photoperiod- insensitive early flowering under long- day (16 hours of light/ 8 hours of dark) conditions and short day (8 hours of light, 16 hours of dark conditions), and arrhythmicity under constant light conditions.&lt;ref name="Aihara"&gt;Aihara, Kohei, and Satoshi Naramoto. "Increase in vascular pattern complexity caused by mutations in LHY and CCA1 in Arabidopsis thaliana under continuous light" Plant Biotechnology Vol. 31. (2014): 43-47&lt;/ref&gt; However they retain some circadian function in light/dark cycles, showing that ''Arabidopsis'' circadian clock is not completely dependent on CCA1 and LHY activity.&lt;ref name = "alabadi"&gt;Alabadi, David, and Marcelo J. Yanovsky. "Critical Role for CCA1 and LHY in Maintaining Circadian Rhythmicity in Arabidopsis" Current Biology Vol. 12(9). (2002): 757–761&lt;/ref&gt; Plants with non-functioning LHY and CCA1 show a wavy leaf phenotype in constant light conditions. Mutants also have increased vascular pattern complexity in their leaves, with more areoles, branch points and free ends than wild-type ''Arabidopsis''.&lt;ref name=Aihara /&gt;

The function of LHY was initially demonstrated by a group in the [[Steve A. Kay|Steve Kay]] lab, including [[Andrew Millar (scientist)|Andrew Millar]].&lt;ref name = "McClung"&gt;C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4985">{{United States patent law}}
In [[United States patent law]], a '''method''', also called "process", is one of the four principal categories of things that may be patented through "utility patents".  The other three are a [[machine (patent)|machine]], an [[article of manufacture]] (also termed a ''manufacture''), and a [[composition of matter]].&lt;ref name="types"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/patdesc.htm |title=Types of Patents |author= |date=1 June 2000 |work=Technology Assessment and Forecast data base |publisher=USPTO |quote=Utility Patent- Issued for the invention of a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (...) |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that context, a method is a series of steps for performing a function or accomplishing a result.&lt;ref&gt;See Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 70 (1972) ("A process is a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing."). See also In re Kollar, 286 F.3d 1326, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("[A] process...consists of a series of acts or steps.... It consists of doing something, and therefore has to be carried out or performed.").&lt;/ref&gt; While the terms ''method'' and ''process'' are largely interchangeable,&lt;ref&gt;section 100(b) of the US patent act, 35 U.S.C. sec. 100(b), states that "[t]he term 'process' means process, art, or method, and includes a new use of a known process. . . ."&lt;/ref&gt; ''method'' usually refers to a way to use a product to accomplish a given result, and ''process'' usually refers to a series of steps in manufacture. Thus, one might speak about a method for curing headaches that comprises the administration of a therapeutically effective dose of aspirin or speak about a process for making soap or candles.

Not all methods, in the dictionary sense, are methods for purposes of United States patent law. The [[case law]] "forecloses a purely literal reading of § 101."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parker v. Flook]], 437 U.S. 584, 589 (1978). In [[Gottschalk v. Benson]], 409 U.S. 63, 64 (1973), the Court said, "The question is whether the method described and claimed is a 'process' within the meaning of the Patent Act." See also [[In re Bilski]] ("But the Supreme Court has held that the meaning of 'process' as used in § 101 is narrower than its ordinary meaning.").&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is elaborated in the article [[machine-or-transformation test]].

A method patent claim can only be infringed when a single person or entity (including contractually obligated agents, if any) practices all of the claimed steps.&lt;ref&gt;"[A] method claim is only infringed when a single party can be charged with performing each step of the asserted claim."  Muniauction v. Thomson Corp. and i-Deal, (Fed. Cir. 2008) [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1485.pdf opinion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527115237/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1485.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither a physical device, such as a product that can be used to practice the method, nor instructions for practicing the method, are infringing until they are used by a single person to perform all the steps together.  A potential exception to this rule for indirect infringement was implicit in the circuit court of appeal's ruling in Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (Fed. Cir. 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (Fed. Cir. 2012) [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/09/04/cafcs-joint-infringement-conundrum-p1/id=27774/ ipwatchdog review of decision]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's ruling on Monday, June 2, 2014 (docket number 12-786), holding that the circuit court had misread patent law to reach its decision. The court noted that the statute explicitly defines a method patent to cover only the entirety of the method, and doesn't confer any rights in the individual steps that make up the method.&lt;ref&gt;Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (S.C.o.t.U.S. docket #12-786) [https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2013/2013_12_786 LIMELIGHT NETWORKS v. AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Patent Convention does not mention method patents (called process patents) so prominently, and the same applies to the TRIPS Agreement. The prime characteristic of process patents in these treaties is that "the protection conferred by the patent shall extend to the products directly obtained by such process".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art. 28(1)(b) TRIPS provides a similar rule. This shows the historical background of process patents in chemistry, where there was a need to protect new processes to manufacture known substances.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Buster–Jangle}}

'''Operation Buster–Jangle''' was a series of seven (six atmospheric, one [[Explosion crater|cratering]]) [[nuclear weapon]]s tests conducted by the United States in late 1951 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. ''Buster-Jangle'' was the first joint test program between the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] (Operation ''Buster'') and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] National Laboratories (Operation ''Jangle''). As part of Operation ''Buster'', 6,500 [[troop]]s were involved in the [[Desert Rock exercises|Operation Desert Rock]] I, II, and III exercises in conjunction with the tests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/factsheets/Buster_Jangle.pdf Operation BUSTER-JANGLE Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218004910/http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/factsheets/Buster_Jangle.pdf |date=February 18, 2013 }}, Defense Threat Reduction Agency&lt;/ref&gt; The last two tests, Operation ''Jangle'', evaluated the cratering effects of low-yield nuclear devices. This series preceded ''[[Operation Tumbler-Snapper]]'' and followed ''[[Operation Greenhouse]]''.

== US Ground Forces Involvement ==
Four [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] units took part in the Operation Buster–Jangle "Dog" test for combat maneuvers after the detonation of a nuclear weapon took place. These units consisted of:
# 1st Battalion 188th Airborne Infantry Regiment [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]]
# 3rd Medical Platoon 188th Airborne Medical Company
# Platoon Company A [[107th Engineer Battalion|127th Engineer Battalion]]
# Battery C 546th Field Artillery Battalion
Personnel were instructed to create foxholes, construct gun emplacements and bunkers in a defensive position 11&amp;nbsp;km south of the detonation area. After the nuclear bomb was detonated, the troops were ordered to move forward towards the affected area. While traveling closer to ground zero, troops witnessed the nuclear weapon's effects on the fortifications that were placed in the location in preparation for the tests. The ground troops got as close as 900 meters from ground zero before they were instructed to move out of the area. The [[Human Resources Research Office]] was tasked with gathering data on the psychological experiences of the troops after witnessing such a detonation and moving closer towards the affected area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Radiation Protection Standards ===
For the Operation Buster–Jangle series of tests, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] created a set of criteria that must be followed if exposing armed forces, or civilians to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.
* Orientation and proper radiological training
* Dispersion of dosimeters amongst personnel
* Utilization of radiological protective equipment and clothing
* Active monitoring of radiological levels
* Briefing of personnel taking part in the exercise
* Decontamination of radioactive debris
A majority of the personnel that took part in the exercise received around 3 [[Roentgen (unit)|R]], with pilots receiving an average of 3.9 R. These estimates vary given the differing data provided by the Department of Defense over the years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{see also|List of nuclear weapons tests of the United States}}

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions – Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 – 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data (excepting Johnston Atoll) are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Porsch''' 12 September 1875 &amp;ndash; 2 January 1959) was an [[Austria]]n [[biologist]]. 

After his Ph.D he worked with [[Gottlieb Haberlandt]] in Graz and did his habilitation with [[Richard Wettstein]] in Vienna. He became first director of the botanical garden in Czernowitz (now [[Chernivtsi]], Ukraine) and later professor at the University of Czernowitz (now [[Chernivtsi University]]). Porsch became director of the botanical institute in Vienna in 1920. He retired in 1945 and died in 1959.

__NOTOC__
In the [[philosophy of science]], there are several definitions of '''protoscience'''.

Its simplest meaning (most closely reflecting its roots of ''[[wikt:proto-#Prefix|proto-]]'' + ''[[science]]'') involves the earliest eras of the [[history of science]], when the [[scientific method]] was still nascent. Thus, in the late 17th century and early 18th century, [[Isaac Newton]] contributed to the dawning sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], even though he was also an [[alchemy|alchemist]] who sought [[chrysopoeia]] in various ways including some that were unscientific. 

Another meaning extends this idea into the present, with protoscience being an emerging field of study which is still not completely scientific, but later becomes a proper science.&lt;ref name=Bunge&gt;{{cite article | last=Bunge | first=Mario | title=What is pseudoscience?| year=1984 | publisher=The Skeptical Inquirer |volume=9 | pages=36-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of it would the [[general theory of relativity]], which started being a protoscience (a theoretical work which had not been tested), but later was experimentally verified and became fully scientitific. Protoscience in this sense is distinguished from pseudoscience by a genuine willingness to be changed through new evidence, as opposed to having a theory that can always find a way to rationalize a predetermined belief.

[[Philosopher of chemistry]] Jaap Brakel defines protoscience as "the study of ''normative'' criteria for the use of experimental technology in science."&lt;ref&gt;Brakel, Jaap, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=XU1OwXNHN50C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=protoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xsn6Tty0BtO78gOz8oAZ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=protoscience&amp;f=false protoscience and protochemistry]", Philosophy of chemistry: between the manifest and the scientific image, Leuven Univ Pr, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Kuhn]] said that protosciences "generate testable conclusions but ... nevertheless resemble [[philosophy]] and [[the arts]] rather than the established sciences in their developmental patterns. I think, for example, of fields like [[chemistry]] and [[electricity]] before the mid-18th century, of the study of [[heredity]] and [[phylogeny]] before the mid-nineteenth, or of many of the [[social sciences]] today." While noting that they meet the demarcation criteria of [[falsifiability]] from [[Karl Popper|Popper]], he questions whether the discussion in protoscience fields "result[s] in clear-cut progress". Kuhn concluded that protoscience, "like the arts and philosophy, lack some element which, in the mature sciences, permits the more obvious forms of progress. It is not, however, anything that a methodological prescription can provide. ... I claim no therapy to assist the transformation of a proto-science to a science, nor do I suppose anything of this sort is to be had".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhn |first=Thomas |editors=Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave | chapter = Reflections on my critics |title=Criticism and the growth of knowledge: Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford college, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521096235 |edition=Reprint |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''prescientific'' means at root "relating to an era before science existed". For example, [[traditional medicine]] existed for thousands of years before medical science did, and thus many aspects of it can be described as prescientific. In a related but somewhat different [[word sense|sense]], protoscientific topics (such as the alchemy of Newton's day) can be called prescientific, in which case the ''proto-'' and ''pre-'' labels can function more or less [[synonym]]ously (the latter focusing more sharply on the idea that nothing but science is science).

Compare [[fringe science]], which is considered highly speculative or even strongly refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dutch, Steven I |title=Notes on the nature of fringe science |journal=[[J Geol Ed]] |issn=0022-1368 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6–13 |date=January 1982 |id=ERIC EJ260409 |oclc=427103550}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some protosciences go on to become an accepted part of [[Scientific consensus|mainstream science]].&lt;ref name=CFS&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419010537/http://www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/truzzi.html |date=April 19, 2012 |title=''Reflections on the reception of unconventional claims in science'' }}, newsletter ''Center for Frontier Sciences'', [[Temple University]] (1990).

'''''RV Sprightly''''' was a 42m research vessel owned by the [[CSIRO|Australian Commonwealth Scientific Research Organisation]] (CSIRO). ''Sprightly'' originally served as a salvage tug in the [[North Atlantic]] in [[World War II]]. Following the war it was purchased by the CSIRO where it spent 40 years on scientific duties before being retired and replaced by the ''[[RV Franklin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceimage.csiro.au/library/transportation/i/543/csiro-research-vessel-sprightly/4/large&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7859">'''Ru Chih Huang''' (born 1932) is a biology professor at Johns Hopkins University. She is a biochemist who worked with [[James F. Bonner]] and Doug Fambrough to characterize and discern functions for nuclear histones in the early 1960s when the field lacked a consensus on types and functions of individual histone proteins.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;RCC Huang and James Bonner.

== Early life and education ==
Ru Chih Chow was born April 2, 1932 in Nanjing, China (then called Nanking).  She moved to the US in 1954. She was inspired to go into science by reading a biography of Marie Curie.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Tom Pelton (2001). "Scientist, stung by criticism, is defiant."  ''Baltimore Sun,'' December 16, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She received the BS from [[National Taiwan University of Science and Technology|National Taiwan University]] in 1953, the MS from [[Virginia Polytechnical Institute]] in 1956, and the PhD from [[Ohio State University]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was a postdoctoral fellow with [[James F. Bonner]] at [[California Institute of Technology]] from 1960- 1965.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Academic and research career ==
Ru Chih Huang joined the faculty at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She was the first female science professor hired there.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Huang was an Assistant Professor from 1965-1971, an Associate Professor from 1971-1975, and a Professor from 1975 to the present.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Her title is McElroy Honorary Research Professor in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bio.jhu.edu/directory/ru-chih-huang/|title=Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, Johns Hopkins University|last=|first=|date=August 4, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Chairman of a Gordon Research Conference in1980, Chairman of the Board of Science Counselors of the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, from 1980 to 1984, a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute of Molecular Biology, Taiwan from 1987 to 1988, and a member of the Science Advisory Board of the National Cancer Institute.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In 1962, Ru Chih Huang and James Bonner published their finding that histone suppresses chromosomal RNA synthesis.  That paper became a Citation Classic.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;''Citation Classics'' '''12''', March 20, 1978, RC Huang and J Bonner (1962) "Histone, a suppressor of chromosomal RNA synthesis." ''Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. US'' '''48''':1216-22, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview recognizing her paper as a Citation Classic, Huang said, "The work ... was done when little was known about the molecular approach to gene expression. The term chromatin as an interphase state of chromosome was beginning to be accepted as a biochemical working usage. The isolation and purification of chromatin was still approached with more art than science, until the pea embryo was chosen."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; James Bonner commented about the state of histone knowledge in the early 1960s when Huang began to work in his laboratory in a biographical article published in 1994, saying, "Study of the literature on histones made it clear that not much was known about how many kinds of histones there were or whether there were different histones in different creatures or in different specialized cells. Nobody knew what histones were for and no one had studied histones in plants."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;James Bonner (1994) "Chapters from my life."  ''Annu Rev Plant Physiol. Plant Molecular Biol'' '''45''':1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonner got funding from NSF and other places to organize a conference on histones, trying to include all known histone researchers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  After the conference he summarized the overview they were left with as chaotic.  Estimates of the number of histone types ranged up into the thousands and there was no consensus about homology of histones between different species or even between different cells within one species.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Ru Chih Huang showed that histone proteins inhibited transcription of pea embryo and calf thymus DNA and worked out repeatable methods for studying individual histones while she was a postdoctoral fellow with James Bonner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Bonner's laboratory later purified and sequenced each histone type from peas in collaboration with Emil Smith.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the years that followed at Johns Hopkins, her research focused upon gene regulation in cancer,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; regulation of viral gene expression,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; expression of viral genome fragments in mammalian genomes,&lt;ref&gt;M Ono, MD Cole AT White, Ru Chih C Huang. (1980) “Sequence organization of clones intracisternal a particle genes.” ''Cell'' '''21''' (2):465-473.&lt;/ref&gt; and molecular biology of aging cells.&lt;ref&gt;L Hoopes, A Brown, and Ru Chih C Huang. (1983) Methylation and rearrangment of mouse intracisternal a particle genes in development aging and myeloma.  ''Molecular and Cellular Biology'' '''3''' (8):1371-1380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ru Chih Huang PhD is co-founder and Chief Scientific Advisor of  Erimos Pharmacueticals, LLC of Houston, TX.  This firm is developing her recently discovered mutation-insensitive antiviral and anticancer compounds which are derivatives of the plant lignan NDGA.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=47424786&amp;privcapId=11256245|title=Ru Chih Huang|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work was somewhat controversial when she first took it up.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Ru Chih Chow married PC Huang on June 10, 1956. In an article in 2001, her son is quoted about her wedding day at Virginia Tech as follows, '"The same day she received her degree, she changed into a wedding dress in a Shell gas station in Blacksburg, Va., and they got married in the university president's office, with just the president and two witnesses,"said Suber Huang."They knew literally no one in this country. But they survived through their wit, intelligence and drive."'&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Stochastic control''' or '''stochastic [[optimal control]]''' is a sub field of [[control theory]] that deals with the existence of uncertainty either in observations or in the noise that drives the evolution of the system. The system designer assumes, in a [[Bayesian probability]]-driven fashion, that random noise with known probability distribution affects the evolution and observation of the state variables.  Stochastic control aims to design the time path of the controlled variables that performs the desired control task with minimum cost, somehow defined, despite the presence of this noise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://answerphone/topic/stochastic-control-theory?cat=technology Definition from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The context may be either [[discrete time]] or [[continuous time]].

==Certainty equivalence==

An extremely well-studied formulation in stochastic control is that of [[linear quadratic Gaussian control]]. Here the model is linear, the objective function is the expected value of a quadratic form, and the disturbances are purely additive.  A basic result for discrete-time centralized systems with only additive uncertainty is the '''certainty equivalence property''':&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Gregory Chow|Chow]] |first=Gregory P. |year=1976 |title=Analysis and Control of Dynamic Economic Systems |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-15616-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the optimal control solution in this case is the same as would be obtained in the absence of the additive disturbances. This property is applicable to all centralized systems with linear equations of evolution, quadratic cost function, and noise entering the model only additively; the quadratic assumption allows for the optimal control laws, which follow the certainty-equivalence property, to be linear functions of the observations of the controllers.

Any deviation from the above assumptions—a nonlinear state equation, a non-quadratic objective function, [[Multiplier uncertainty|noise in the multiplicative parameters]] of the model, or decentralization of control—causes the certainty equivalence property not to hold. For example, its failure to hold for decentralized control was demonstrated in  [[Witsenhausen's counterexample]].

==Discrete time==

In a discrete-time context, the decision-maker observes the state variable, possibly with observational noise, in each time period. The objective may be to optimize the sum of expected values of a nonlinear (possibly quadratic) objective function over all the time periods from the present to the final period of concern, or to optimize the value of the objective function as of the final period only. At each time period new observations are made, and the control variables are to be adjusted optimally. Finding the optimal solution for the present time may involve iterating a [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control#Discrete time|matrix Riccati equation]] backwards in time from the last period to the present period.

In the discrete-time case with uncertainty about the parameter values in the transition matrix (giving the effect of current values of the state variables on their own evolution) and/or the control response matrix of the state equation, but still with a linear state equation and quadratic objective function, a Riccati equation can still be obtained for iterating backward to each period's solution even though certainty equivalence does not apply.&lt;ref name="Chow"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ch.13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=Turnovsky&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Stephen J. Turnovsky|Turnovsky]] |first=Stephen |title=Optimal Stabilization Policies for Stochastic Linear Systems: The Case of Correlated Multiplicative and Additive disturbances |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1976 |pages=191–94 |doi= 10.2307/2296614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The discrete-time case of a non-quadratic loss function but only additive disturbances can also be handled, albeit with more complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitchell |first=Douglas W. |title=Tractable Risk Sensitive Control Based on Approximate Expected Utility |journal=Economic Modelling |year=1990 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=161–164 |doi=10.1016/0264-9993(90)90018-Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

A typical specification of the discrete-time stochastic linear quadratic control problem is to minimize&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt;{{rp|ch. 13;}}&lt;ref name=Turnovsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnovsky |first=Stephen |year=1974 |title=The stability properties of optimal economic policies |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=136–148 |jstor=1814888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{E}_1\sum_{t=1}^S [y_t^T Qy_t + u_t^T Ru_t]&lt;/math&gt;

where E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[expected value]] operator conditional on ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, superscript ''T'' indicates a [[matrix transpose]], and ''S'' is the time horizon, subject to the state equation

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = A_ty_{t-1} + B_tu_t,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''y'' is an ''n'' × 1 vector of observable state variables, ''u'' is a ''k'' × 1 vector of control variables, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the time ''t'' realization of the [[stochastic matrix|stochastic ''n'' × ''n'' state transition matrix]], ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the time ''t'' realization of the stochastic ''n'' × ''k'' matrix of control multipliers, and ''Q'' (''n'' × ''n'') and ''R'' (''k'' × ''k'') are known symmetric positive definite cost matrices. We assume that each element of ''A'' and ''B'' is jointly [[iid|independently and identically]] distributed through time, so the expected value operations need not be time-conditional.

[[Bellman equation|Induction backwards in time]] can be used to obtain the optimal control solution at each time,&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt;{{rp|ch. 13}}

:&lt;math&gt;u_t^*=-[\text{E}(B^TX_tB+R)]^{-1}\text{E}(B^TX_tA)y_{t-1},&lt;/math&gt;

with the symmetric positive definite cost-to-go matrix ''X'' evolving backwards in time from &lt;math&gt;X_S = Q&lt;/math&gt; according to

: &lt;math&gt; X_{t-1} = Q+\text{E}[A^TX_tA] - \text{E}[A^TX_tB][\text{E}(B^TX_tB+R)]^{-1}\text{E}(B^TX_tA), \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is known as the discrete-time dynamic Riccati equation of this problem. The only information needed regarding the unknown parameters in the ''A'' and ''B'' matrices is the expected value and variance of each element of each matrix and the covariances among elements of the same matrix and among elements across matrices.

The optimal control solution is unaffected if zero-mean, i.i.d. additive shocks also appear in the state equation, so long as they are uncorrelated with the parameters in the ''A'' and ''B'' matrices. But if they are so correlated, then the optimal control solution for each period contains an additional additive constant vector. If an additive constant vector appears in the state equation, then again the optimal control solution for each period contains an additional additive constant vector.

The steady-state characterization of ''X'' (if it exists), relevant for the infinite-horizon problem in which ''S'' goes to infinity, can be found by iterating the dynamic equation for ''X'' repeatedly until it converges; then ''X'' is characterized by removing the time subscripts from its dynamic equation.

==Continuous time==

If the model is in continuous time, the controller knows the state of the system at each instant of time. The objective is to maximize either an integral of, for example, a concave function of a state variable over a horizon from time zero (the present) to a terminal time ''T'', or a concave function of a state variable at some future date ''T''. As time evolves, new observations are continuously made and the control variables are continuously adjusted in optimal fashion.

==Stochastic model predictive control==
In the literature, there are two types of MPCs for stochastic systems; Robust model predictive control and Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC). Robust model predictive control is a more conservative method which considers the worst scenario in the optimization procedure. However, this method, similar to other robust controls, deteriorates the overall controller's performance and also is applicable only for systems with bounded uncertainties. The alternative method, SMPC, considers soft constraints which limit the risk of violation by a probabilistic inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hashemian|last2=Armaou|title=Stochastic MPC Design for a Two-Component Granulation Process|date=2017|pages=4386–4391|arxiv=1704.04710| journal = IEEE Proceedings|bibcode=2017arXiv170404710H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In finance===

In a continuous time approach in a [[finance]] context, the state variable in the stochastic differential equation is usually wealth or net worth, and the controls are the shares placed at each time in the various assets. Given the [[asset allocation]] chosen at any time, the determinants of the change in wealth are usually the stochastic returns to assets and the interest rate on the risk-free asset. The field of stochastic control has developed greatly since the 1970s, particularly in its applications to finance. Robert Merton used stochastic control to study [[optimal portfolio]]s of safe and risky assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Merton |title=Continuous Time Finance |location= |publisher=Blackwell |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merton's portfolio problem|His work]] and that of [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes]] changed the nature of the [[finance]] literature. Influential mathematical textbook treatments were by [[Wendell Fleming|Fleming]] and [[Raymond Rishel|Rishel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W. |last=Fleming |first2=R. |last2=Rishel |title=Deterministic and Stochastic Optimal Control |location= |publisher= |year=1975 |isbn=0-387-90155-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUrvAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Fleming and [[Halil Mete Soner|Soner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W. |last=Fleming |first2=M. |last2=Soner |title=Controlled Markov Processes and Viscosity Solutions |location= |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques were applied by [[Jerome Stein|Stein]] to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name=stein&gt;{{cite book |first=J. L. |last=Stein |title=Stochastic Optimal Control and the US Financial Crisis |location= |publisher=Springer-Science |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximization, say of the expected logarithm of net worth at a terminal date ''T'', is subject to stochastic processes on the components of wealth. In this case, in continuous time [[Itô's lemma|Itô's equation]] is the main tool of analysis. In the case where the maximization is an integral of a concave function of utility over an horizon (0,''T''), dynamic programming is used. There is no certainty equivalence as in the older literature, because the coefficients of the control variables—that is, the returns received by the chosen shares of assets—are stochastic.

'''''The Sea Around Us''''' is a prize-winning and best-selling book by the American [[marine biologist]] [[Rachel Carson]], first published as a whole by Oxford University Press in 1951. It reveals the science and poetry of the sea while ranging from its primeval beginnings to the latest scientific probings. Often described as "poetic," it was Carson's second published book and the one that launched her into the public eye and a second career as a writer and conservationist; in retrospect it is counted the second book of her so-called sea trilogy.

''The Sea Around Us'' won both the 1952 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]]&lt;ref name=nba1952&gt;

==History==

[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] had published her first book ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' in 1941; it was reviewed favorably but it sold poorly. Carson initially planned to call the sequel ''Return to the Sea'', and began writing in 1948, just after hiring [[Marie Rodell]] as her [[literary agent]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Carson began by writing a single chapter (what would be "The Birth of an Island") along with a detailed outline, which Rodell used to pitch the book to publishers. During research for the book, Carson met with a number of oceanographers to discuss current research. Carson and Rodell had little initial success with magazines as outlets for the islands chapter, nor for a second chapter titled "Another Beachhead."  In April 1949, with about a third of the chapters complete, Rodell began trying to find a publisher for the entire book. By June she had arranged a contract with [[Oxford University Press]] that promised completion of the manuscript by March 1, 1950. Carson continued to write and research through 1949 and into 1950, despite unexpected health and financial difficulties. In part the research involved a trip aboard a [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] ship, ''Albatross III''. After revising the completion date, Carson completed the manuscript in June 1950. By that time, several periodicals (''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Science Digest]]'', and ''[[The Yale Review]]'') were interested in publishing some of the chapters.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine of fourteen chapters were serialized in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' beginning on June 2, 1951, and the book was published on July 2 by [[Oxford University Press]].  The serialization created a very large popular response, and the book was the subject of the feature review in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' the day before publication.  One chapter ("The Birth of an Island") was published in ''The [[Yale Review]]''; it won the George Westinghouse Science Writing prize from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

After the book's release, Carson was inundated with an unexpected volume of [[fan mail]] and media attention.  She was soon the object of attention from "the literary crowd," and because of a subsequent condensation in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', a broad general audience as well.  The book sold more than 250,000 copies in 1951, in addition to the condensation and excerpts published elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

A [[The Sea Around Us (film)|film version]] was filmed in 1952 and released in 1953; it won the 1953 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Documentary (though Carson was extremely disappointed with the script and would never sell film rights to her work again).&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Rachel Carson'', chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vindhyan Ecology and Natural History Foundation''' (VENHF) is a registered non-profit organisation (2012) with its headquarter in [[Mirzapur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] working for protection and conservation of the nature, natural resources and rights of the nature dependent communities in the ecologically fragile landscape of [[Vindhya Range]] in India. Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan is the flagship campaign of the organization.

==Programs==

===Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan===

Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan ({{IPA-hns|viŋd̪ʱyaː batʃaːoː|hi}} English meaning: ''Save Vindhya Campaign'') is the flagship program of VENHF which works towards environmental equity and bringing ecological justice through research-based environmental litigation, strengthening grass-root environmental movements, supporting institution of local governance and protecting the rights of nature dependent indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vindhyabachao.org/objective |title=Vindhya Bachao Portal - Objective |publisher=Vindhyabachao.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kanhar Dam====

Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan exposed the illegalities in environment clearance and forest clearance surrounding the controversial Kanhar Dam Project in [[Sonbhadra district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] on [[Kanhar River]]. The information collected by Vindhya Bachao using [[Right to Information Act, 2005]] was the basis of challenging the construction of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sandrp.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/kanhar-project-in-up-another-unwanted-dam/ |title=Kanhar Project in UP: Another unwanted dam |publisher=South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, 29 December 2014  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/magazines/conservation/10065-neglected-and-unprotected.html |title=Neglected And Unprotected |publisher= Sanctuary Asia  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Vindhya Bachao and [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] challenged the project in [[National Green Tribunal Act|National Green Tribunal]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/abandoned-dams-abandoned-people |title=Abandoned dams; abandoned people |publisher= India Water Portal, 19 May 2015 |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/why-villagers-protesting-against-up-dam-project-are-living-in-fear/story-uKHKOyg0lPP7qS1W167tlN.html |title=Why villagers protesting against UP dam project are living in fear |publisher= Hindustan Times, 17 May 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the dam was thereafter stayed by the National Green Tribunal in December, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naidunia.jagran.com/chhattisgarh/raipur-kanhar-dam-making-start-in-chhattisgarh-border-279906-1|title=छत्तीसगढ़ सीमा पर संगीनों के साए में कनहर बांध का निर्माण | publisher=Nai Duniya, 3 January 2015 |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/uttar-pradesh-police-opens-fire-on-antikanhar-dam-protestors-49391 |title=Uttar Pradesh police opens fire on anti-Kanhar dam protestors | publisher= Down to Earth, 14 April 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2831366/india_police_shoot_eight_indigenous_protestors_against_illegal_dam.html |title=India: police shoot eight indigenous protestors against illegal dam | publisher= The Ecologist, 15 April 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]] of [[Chhattisgarh]] government in April 2015 took note of the irregularities highlighted by Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to stop the construction until the survey and compensation for the affected villages are completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmo.cg.gov.in/hindi/user/News_Updates.aspx?guid=4486 |title=Chhattisgarh farmers' interests will be protected: Dr.Raman Singh : Kanhar dam construction on Uttar Pradesh border | publisher= The Chief Minister's Office, Chhattisgarh, 30 April 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Green Tribunal passed its final judgement on 7 May 2015 staying any new construction to be undertaken but allowed the construction already underway.

====Mirzapur Thermal Power Plant====

[[File:Environmentalists protest against coal based thermal power project in Delhi.jpg|thumb|300px|Members of Vindhya Bachao protesting against the Mirzapur Thermal Power Plant  of Welspun Energy outside the SCOPE Complex, New Delhi on 18 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vindhyabachao.org/activities/15-peaceful-demonstration-against-welspun-thermal-power-project-in-delhi|title= Peaceful Demonstration against Welspun Thermal Power Project in Delhi| publisher= Vindhya Bachao website, 18 November 2013  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] VENHF under the banner of Vindhya Bachao opposed the 1320 MW Coal Based [[Thermal Power Station]] in [[Mirzapur]] proposed by Ms [[Welspun Energy]] U.P. Private Limited since the year 2013. In a site visit report published by Vindhya Bachao in September, 2013 it was claimed that the project proponent concealed the information on the presence of forests and several Schedule I species under [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]] in the [[Environmental impact assessment|EIA]] Report it submitted to the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]]. In 2013 it was reported by [[Down to Earth (magazine)|Down to Earth]] that the plan was "mired in controversy following allegations that the company concealed information about the presence of forestland and endangered wildlife at the project site. The farmers in the region have also been protesting against the project, alleging the company bought land for the project by cheating them." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/did-welspun-fudge-facts-for-its-coalfired-power-plant-in-mirzapur--42768 |title= Did Welspun fudge facts for its coal-fired power plant in Mirzapur?| publisher= Down to Earth, 20 November 2013  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debadityo Sinha, founder of VENHF in his articles claimed that the project will be a threat to river Ganga and the upper Khajuri Reservoir for drinking and irrigation. It was apprehended that the project if comes into existence will also threat a historic waterfall of Mirzapur known as Wyndham Fall and will also jeopardise the drinking water supply of the newly established [[Rajiv Gandhi South campus]] of [[Banaras Hindu University]]. He also made an allegation that the Public Hearing process for the project was greatly compromised and local people were prohibited from entering the public hearing premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sandrp.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/water-for-power-irrigation-dam-to-be-used-for-thermal-power-drinking-water-supply-of-bhu-agriculture-and-existence-of-waterfalls-at-risk/ |title= Water for Power: Irrigation Dam to be Used for Thermal Power- Drinking Water Supply of BHU, Agriculture, and Existence of Waterfalls at Risk| publisher= South Asia Network on Dams Rivers and People, 20 March 2014  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/2014/08/power-play-at-a-thermal-power-plant-in-mirzapur/ |title= Power play at a Thermal Power Plant in Mirzapur| publisher= EJOLT, 21 August 2014  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research paper published by VENHF in an international open source scientific journal ''Present Environment and Sustainable Development'' of [[Walter de Gruyter]] in its October, 2015 edition, the land use land cover map of the project site submitted by the company is contradicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/pesd.2015.9.issue-2/pesd-2015-0031/pesd-2015-0031.xml?format=INT|title= Geospatial Technology In Environmental Impact Assessments – Retrospective| publisher= Present Environment and Sustainable Development-Walter de Gruyter 18 October 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volunteer computing''' is a type of [[distributed computing]], "an arrangement in which people, so-called volunteers, provide computing resources to projects, which use the resources to do distributed computing and/or storage".&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VolunteerComputing|title=VolunteerComputing – BOINC|author=|date=|website=boinc.Berkeley.edu|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, computer owners or users donate their computing resources (such as processing power and storage) to one or more "projects".

'''Volunteers''' are frequently members of the general public in the possession of their own personal computers with a Internet connection, but also organizations can act as volunteers and provide their computing resources.

'''Projects''' in this context are mostly science-related projects executed by universities or academia in general.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

==History==
The first volunteer computing project was the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]], which was started in January 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mersenne.org/various/history.php |title=GIMPS History |publisher=Great Internet Mersenne Primes Search |work=Mersenne.org |access-date=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in 1997 by [[distributed.net]]. In 1997 and 1998, several academic research projects developed Java-based systems for volunteer computing; examples include Bayanihan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sarmenta, L.F.G. |title=Worldwide Computing and Its Applications — WWCA'98: Second International Conference Tsukuba, Japan, March 4–5, 1998 Proceedings |chapter=Bayanihan: Web-Based Volunteer Computing Using Java |volume=1368 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE7KNkcTt1cC&amp;pg=PA444 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=1998 |pages=444–461 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/3-540-64216-1_67}} {{nowrap|&amp;bull; {{ISBN|978-3-540-64216-9}}}} (print) {{nowrap|&amp;bull; {{ISBN|978-3-540-69704-6}}}} (online)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--copyright holder: Springer-Verlag--&gt; Popcorn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1 = O Regev|author2 = Noam Nisan|authorlink2 = Noam Nisan|title = The POPCORN market—an online market for computational resources|booktitle = Proceedings of the first international conference on Information and computation economies (in Charleston, South Carolina)|date = October 28, 1998|chapterurl = http://gemini.econ.umd.edu/jrust/papers/popcorn.pdf|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=289027|publisher = ACM Press|place = New York, NY|pages = 148–157|doi = 10.1145/288994.289027|isbn = 1-58113-076-7}}&lt;!-- originally a date range, October 25-28, 1998 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Superweb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Alexandrov |first=A.D. |last2=Ibel |first2=M. |last3=Schauser |first3=K.E. |last4=Scheiman |first4=K.E. |title=SuperWeb: Research issues in Java-Based Global Computing |booktitle=Proceedings of the Workshop on Java for High performance Scientific and Engineering Computing Simulation and Modelling |publisher=Syracuse University |location=New York |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Charlotte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Baratloo |first=A. |last2=Karaul |first2=M. |last3=Kedem |first3=Z. |last4=Wyckoff |first4=P. |title=Charlotte: Metacomputing on the Web |booktitle=Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems |date=September 1996 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/article/baratloo96charlotte.html |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''volunteer computing'' was coined by Luis F. G. Sarmenta, the developer of Bayanihan. It is also appealing for global efforts on social responsibility, or [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] as reported in a Harvard Business Review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/email/pdfs/Porter_Dec_2006.pdf |title=The Link Between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility |author1=Michael Porter |author2=Mark Kramer |publisher=Harvard Business Review |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QJgO0oSz?url=http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/email/pdfs/Porter_Dec_2006.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |access-date=August 25, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or used in the Responsible IT forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.responsI.tk |title=ResponsI.TK |publisher=Responsible IT forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[SETI@home]] and [[Folding@home]] projects were launched. These projects received considerable media coverage, and each one attracted several hundred thousand volunteers.

Between 1998 and 2002, several companies were formed with business models involving volunteer computing. Examples include [[Popular Power]], [[Porivo]], [[Entropia, Inc. (company)|Entropia]], and [[United Devices]].

In 2002, the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) project was founded at University of California, Berkeley [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], funded by the National Science Foundation. BOINC provides a complete middleware system for volunteer computing, including a client, client GUI, application runtime system, server software, and software implementing a project web site. The first project based on BOINC was Predictor@home, based at the Scripps Research Institute, which began operation in 2004. Soon thereafter, SETI@home and ClimatePrediction.net began using BOINC. A number of new BOINC-based projects were created over the next few years, including Rosetta@home, Einstein@home, and [[AQUA@home]]. In 2007, IBM World Community Grid switched from the United Devices platform to BOINC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://worldcommunitygrid.org/forums/wcg/viewthread?thread=15715 |title=BOINC Migration Announcement |date=Aug 17, 2007 |access-date=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middleware==

The client software of the early volunteer computing projects consisted of a single program that combined the scientific computation and the distributed computing infrastructure. This monolithic architecture was inflexible. For example, it was difficult to deploy new application versions.

More recently, volunteer computing has moved to middleware systems that provide a distributed computing infrastructure independent from the scientific computation. Examples include:

* The [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) is the most widely used middleware system.  It offers client software for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and other Unix variants.
* XtremWeb is used primarily as a research tool. It is developed by a group based at the University of Paris-South.
* [[Xgrid]] is developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. Its client and server components run only on Mac OS X.
* [[Grid MP]] is a commercial middleware platform developed by [[United Devices]] and was used in volunteer computing projects including [[grid.org]], [[World Community Grid]], [[Cell Computing]], and [[Hikari Grid]].

Most of these systems have the same basic structure: a client program runs on the volunteer's computer. It periodically contacts project-operated servers over the Internet, requesting jobs and reporting the results of completed jobs. This "pull" model is necessary because many volunteer computers are behind firewalls that do not allow incoming connections. The system keeps track of each user's "credit", a numerical measure of how much work that user's computers have done for the project.

Volunteer computing systems must deal with several issues involving volunteered computers: their heterogeneity, their churn (the tendency of individual computers to join and leave the network over time), their sporadic availability, and the need to not interfere with their performance during regular use.

In addition, volunteer computing systems must deal with problems related to correctness:

* Volunteers are unaccountable and essentially anonymous.
* Some volunteer computers (especially those that are overclocked) occasionally malfunction and return incorrect results.
* Some volunteers intentionally return incorrect results or claim excessive credit for results.

One common approach to these problems is replicated computing, in which each job is performed on at least two computers. The results (and the corresponding credit) are accepted only if they agree sufficiently.

==Drawbacks for participants==

* Increased power consumption: A CPU generally uses more electricity when it is active compared to when it is idle. Additionally, the desire to participate may cause the volunteer to leave the PC on overnight or disable power-saving features like suspend. Furthermore, if the computer cannot cool itself adequately, the added load on the volunteer's CPU can cause it to overheat.
* Decreased performance of the PC:  If the volunteer computing application runs while the computer is in use, it may impact performance of the PC.  This is due to increased usage of the CPU, CPU cache, local storage, and network connection. If RAM is a limitation, increased disk cache misses and/or increased paging can result.  Volunteer computing applications typically execute at a lower CPU scheduling priority, which helps to alleviate CPU contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techreport.com/articles.x/4341/1 |title=Measuring Folding@Home's performance impact |author=Geoff Gasior |date=November 11, 2002 |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These effects may or may not be noticeable, and even if they are noticeable, the volunteer might choose to continue participating. However, the increased power consumption can be remedied to some extent by setting an option to limit the percentage of the processor used by the client, which is available in some client software.

==Benefits for participants==
* Volunteer computing can provide researchers with computing power that is not achievable any other way.  Approximately 10 [[petaflops]] of computing power are available from volunteer computing networks.
* Volunteer computing is often cheaper than other forms of distributed computing.
&lt;ref&gt;http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/derrick.kondo/pubs/kondo_hcw09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
==Importance==
Although there are issues such as lack of accountability and trust between participants and researchers while implementing the projects, volunteer computing is crucially important, especially to projects that have limited funding.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Since there are more than one billion PCs in the world, volunteer computing can supply more computing power to researches, that do not have the required competencies regarding the computing power, on any kind of topic; such as academic (university-based) or scientific researches. Also, advancements in the technology will provide the advancements in consumer products such as PCs and game consoles happen faster than any other specialized products which will increase the number of PCs and computing power in the world consequently.
* Supercomputers that have huge computing power are extremely expensive and are available only to some applications only if they can afford it. Whereas volunteer computing is not something that can be bought, its power arises from the public support. A research project that has limited sources and funding can get huge computing power by attracting public attention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* By volunteering and providing support and computing power to the researches on topics such as science, citizens are encouraged to be interested in science and also citizens are allowed to have a voice in directions of scientific researches and eventually the future science by providing support or not to the researches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VolunteerComputing|title=VolunteerComputing – BOINC|author=|date=|website=boinc.Berkeley.edu|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], the composition of two non-[[collinear]] [[Lorentz boost]]s results in a [[Lorentz transformation]] that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation. This rotation is called '''Thomas rotation''', '''Thomas–Wigner rotation''' or '''Wigner rotation'''. The rotation was discovered by [[Llewellyn Thomas]] in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derived by Wigner in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigner|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a sequence of non-collinear boosts returns an object to its initial  velocity, then the sequence of Wigner rotations can combine to produce a net rotation called the [[Thomas precession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|Semon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still ongoing discussions about the correct form of equations for the Thomas rotation in different reference systems with contradicting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebilas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Goldstein|Goldstein]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The spatial rotation resulting from the successive application of two non-collinear Lorentz transformations have been declared every bit as paradoxical as the more frequently discussed apparent violations of common sense, such as the [[twin paradox]].''
Einstein's principle of velocity reciprocity (EPVR) reads&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''We postulate that the relation between the coordinates of the two systems is linear. Then the inverse transformation is also linear and the complete non-preference of the one or the other system demands that the transformation shall be identical with the original one, except for a change of {{mvar|v}} to {{math|−v}}''
With less careful interpretation, the EPVR is seemingly violated in some models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mocanu|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, of course, no true paradox present.

===Two general boosts===

When studying the Thomas rotation at the fundamental level, one typically uses a setup with three coordinate frames, {{math|Σ, Σ&amp;prime; Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. Frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}.

The axes are, by construction, oriented as follows. Viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ}} are parallel (the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ}}.) Also viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the spatial axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are parallel (and the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an application of EVPR: If {{math|'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}, then {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime; {{=}} −'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. The velocity {{nowrap|{{math|3}}-vector}} {{math|'''u'''}} makes the ''same'' angles with respect to coordinate axes in both the primed and unprimed systems. This does ''not'' represent a snapshot taken in any of the two frames of the combined system at any particular time, as should be clear from the detailed description below.

This is possible, since a boost in, say, the positive {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}, preserves orthogonality of the coordinate axes. A general boost {{math|''B''('''w''')}} can be expressed as {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;('''w''')''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}}, where {{math|''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}} is a rotation taking the {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} into the direction of {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a boost in the new {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|pp=68&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cushing|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sard|1970|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each rotation retains the property that the spatial coordinate axes are orthogonal. The boost will stretch the (intermediate) {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} by a factor {{mvar|γ}}, while leaving the {{nowrap|intermediate {{math|''x''}}-axis}} and {{nowrap|{{math|''y''}}-axis}} in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that coordinate axes are non-parallel in this construction after ''two'' consecutive non-collinear boosts is a precise expression of the phenomenon of Thomas precession.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This preservation of orthogonality of ''coordinate axes'' should not be confused with preservation of angles between spacelike vectors taken at one and the same time in one system, which, of course, does not hold. The coordinate axes transform under the ''passive'' transformation presented, while the vectors transform under the corresponding ''active'' transformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} as seen in {{math|Σ}} is denoted {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}}, where ⊕ refers to the [[velocity addition formula|relativistic addition of velocity]] (and not ordinary [[vector addition]]), given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v}{c^2}} \left[\left(1 + 
\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}}{1+\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v \right)\mathbf u +
\frac{1}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf v \right],&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|VA 2}}}}

and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{|\mathbf{u}|^2}{c^2} } }&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]] of the velocity {{math|'''u'''}} (the vertical bars {{math|{{abs|'''u'''}}}} indicate the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude of the vector]]). The velocity {{math|'''u'''}} can be thought of the velocity of a frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}, and {{math|'''v'''}} is the velocity of an object, say a particle or ''another frame'' {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. In the present context, all velocities are best thought of as relative velocities of frames unless otherwise specified. The result {{math|'''w''' {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}} is then the relative velocity of frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}.

Although velocity addition is [[nonlinear]], non-[[associative property|associative]], and non-[[commutative property|commutative]], the result of the operation correctly obtains a velocity with a magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}. If ordinary vector addition was used, it would be possible to obtain a velocity with a magnitude larger than {{math|''c''}}. The [[Lorentz factor]] {{math|''γ''}} of both composite velocities are equal,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \gamma_{\mathbf {u} \oplus \mathbf{v}} = \gamma_{\mathbf {v} \oplus \mathbf{u}} = \gamma_\mathbf{u} \gamma_\mathbf{v}\left(1+ \frac{\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} }{c^2}\right) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s are equal under interchange of velocity vectors

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v| = |\mathbf v \oplus \mathbf u| = \frac{c}{\gamma}\sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the two possible composite velocities have equal magnitude, but different directions, one must be a rotated copy of the other. More detail and other properties of no direct concern here can be found in the main article.

===Reversed configuration===

Consider the reversed configuration, namely, frame {{math|Σ}} moves with velocity {{math|−'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, in turn, moves with velocity {{math|−'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. In short, {{math|'''u''' → − '''u'''}} and {{math|'''v''' → −'''v'''}} by EPVR. Then the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} is {{math|(−'''v''') ⊕ (−'''u''') ≡ −'''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. By EPVR again, the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}} is then {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. {{EquationRef|(A)}}

One finds {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. While they are equal in magnitude, there is an angle between them. For a single boost between two inertial frames, there is only one unambiguous relative velocity (or its negative). For two boosts, the peculiar result of ''two'' inequivalent relative velocities instead of one seems to contradict the symmetry of relative motion between any two frames. Which is the correct velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}? Since this inequality may be somewhat unexpected and potentially breaking EPVR, this question is warranted.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is sometimes called the "Mocanu paradox". Mocanu himself didn't name it a paradox, but rather a "difficulty" within the framework of relativistic electrodynamics in a 1986 paper. He was also quick to acknowledge that the problem is explained by Thomas precession {{harvtxt|Mocanu|1992}}, but the name lingers on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation in terms of Lorentz transformations==

[[File:Lorentz boosts and Thomas rotation 1.svg|310px|thumb|A frame Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; is boosted with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to another frame Σ&amp;prime;, which is boosted with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to another frame Σ.]]

===Two boosts equals a boost and rotation===

The answer to the question lies in the Thomas rotation, and that one must be careful in specifying which coordinate system is involved at each step. When viewed from {{math|Σ}}, the coordinate axes of {{math|Σ}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are ''not'' parallel. While this can be hard to imagine since both pairs {{math|(Σ, Σ&amp;prime;)}} and {{math|(Σ&amp;prime;, Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;)}} have parallel coordinate axes, it is easy to explain mathematically.

Velocity addition does not provide a complete description of the relation between the frames. One must formulate the complete description in terms of [[Lorentz transformation]]s corresponding to the velocities. A Lorentz boost with any velocity {{math|'''v'''}} (magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}) is given symbolically by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = B(\mathbf{v})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the coordinates and transformation matrix are compactly expressed in [[block matrix]] form

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \begin{bmatrix} c t' \\ \mathbf{r}' \end{bmatrix} \quad B(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma_\mathbf{v} &amp; - \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} \\ -\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v} &amp; \mathbf{I} + \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1} \dfrac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2} \\ \end{bmatrix} \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} c t \\ \mathbf{r} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and in turn, {{math|'''r''', '''r'''&amp;prime;, '''v'''}} are [[column vector]]s (the [[matrix transpose]] of these are row vectors), and {{math|''γ''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Lorentz factor]] of velocity {{math|'''v'''}}. The boost matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]]. The inverse transformation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf {v} )^{-1}=B(-\mathbf {v} )\quad \Rightarrow \quad X=B(-\mathbf {v} )X' &lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that to each admissible velocity {{math|'''v'''}} there corresponds a ''pure'' Lorentz boost,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \leftrightarrow B(\mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

Velocity addition {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} corresponds to the composition of boosts {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} in that order. The {{math|''B''('''u''')}} acts on {{math|''X''}} first, then {{math|''B''('''v''')}} acts on {{math|''B''('''u''')''X''}}. Notice succeeding operators act on the ''left'' in any composition of operators, so {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} should be interpreted as a boost with velocities {{math|'''u'''}} then {{math|'''v'''}}, not {{math|'''v'''}} then {{math|'''u'''}}. Performing the Lorentz transformations by block matrix multiplication,

:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(\mathbf{u}) X \quad \Rightarrow \quad X'' = \Lambda X &lt;/math&gt;

the composite transformation matrix is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = B(\mathbf{v}) B(\mathbf{u}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; -\mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\\
-\mathbf{b} &amp; \mathbf{M}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and in turn

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\gamma_\mathbf{v}\gamma_\mathbf{u}\left(1+\frac{\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =\frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{u}\oplus\mathbf{v} \,, \quad \mathbf{b} = \frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{v}\oplus\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}=\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}\frac{\mathbf{vu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}+\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1}\frac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right)\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1}\frac{\mathbf{uu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''γ''}} is the composite Lorentz factor, and {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are 3×1 [[column vector]]s proportional to the composite velocities. The 3×3 matrix {{math|'''M'''}} will turn out to have geometric significance.

The inverse transformations are

:&lt;math&gt; X = B(-\mathbf{u}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(-\mathbf{v}) X'' \quad \Rightarrow \quad X = \Lambda^{-1} X'' &lt;/math&gt;

and the composition amounts to a negation ''and'' exchange of velocities,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = B(-\mathbf{u}) B(-\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T}\\
\mathbf{a} &amp; \mathbf{M}^\mathrm{T}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the relative velocities are exchanged, looking at the blocks of {{math|Λ}}, one observes the composite transformation to be the [[matrix transpose]] of {{math|Λ}}. This is not the same as the original matrix, so the composite Lorentz transformation matrix is not symmetric, and thus not a single boost. This in turn translates to the incompleteness of velocity composition from the result of two boosts, symbolically;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v) \ne B(\mathbf v)B(\mathbf u) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

To make the description complete, it is necessary to introduce a rotation, before or after the boost. This rotation is the '''Thomas rotation'''. A rotation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = R(\boldsymbol{\theta})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the 4×4 rotation matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})={\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;\mathbf {R} ({\boldsymbol {\theta }})\end{bmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|'''R'''}} is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In the literature, the 3d rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} may be denoted by other letters, others use a name and the relative velocity vectors involved, e.g., {{math|tom['''u''', '''v''']}} for "Thomas rotation" or {{math|gyr['''u''', '''v''']}} for "gyration" (see [[gyrovector space]]). Correspondingly the 4d rotation matrix {{math|''R''}} (non-bold italic) in this article may be denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tom} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{tom}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathrm{Gyr} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{gyr}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the [[axis-angle representation]] is used, and {{math|'''θ''' {{=}} ''θ'''''e'''}} is the "axis-angle vector", the angle {{math|''θ''}} multiplied by a unit vector {{math|'''e'''}} parallel to the axis. Also, the ''right-handed'' convention for the spatial coordinates is used (see [[orientation (vector space)]]), so that rotations are positive in the anticlockwise sense according to the [[right-hand rule]], and negative in the clockwise sense. With these conventions; the rotation matrix rotates any 3d vector about the axis {{math|'''e'''}} through angle {{math|''θ''}} anticlockwise (an [[active transformation]]), which has the equivalent effect of rotating the coordinate frame clockwise about the same axis through the same angle (a passive transformation).

The rotation matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], its transpose equals its inverse, and negating either the angle or axis in the rotation matrix corresponds to a rotation in the opposite sense, so the inverse transformation is readily obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{-1}=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{\mathrm {T} }= R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad X=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})X'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

A boost followed or preceded by a rotation is also Lorentz transformation, since these operations leave the spacetime interval invariant. The same Lorentz transformation has two decompositions for appropriately chosen rapidity and axis-angle vectors;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{u})=R(\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathbf{v},\boldsymbol{\theta})=B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

and if these are two decompositions are equal, the two boosts are related by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{u})=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

so the boosts are related by a [[matrix similarity]] transformation.

It turns out the equality between two boosts and a rotation followed or preceded by a single boost is correct: the rotation of frames matches the angular separation of the composite velocities, and explains how one composite velocity applies to one frame, while the other applies to the rotated frame. The rotation also breaks the symmetry in the overall Lorentz transformation making it nonsymmetric. For this specific rotation, let the angle be {{math|''ε''}} and the axis be defined by the unit vector {{math|'''e'''}}, so the axis-angle vector is {{math|'''ε''' {{=}} ''ε'''''e'''}}.

Altogether, two different orderings of two boosts means there are two inequivalent transformations. Each of these can be split into a boost then rotation, or a rotation then boost, doubling the number of inequivalent transformations to four. The inverse transformations are equally important; they provide information about what the other observer perceives. In all, there are eight transformations to consider, just for the problem of two Lorentz boosts. In summary, with subsequent operations acting on the left, they are

Matching up the boosts followed by rotations, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (first diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (second diagram). If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (third diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (fourth diagram).

The cases of rotations then boosts are similar (no diagrams are shown). Matching up the rotations followed by boosts, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}. If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}.

===Finding the axis and angle of the Thomas rotation===

The above formulae constitute the relativistic velocity addition and the Thomas rotation explicitly in the general Lorentz transformations. Throughout, in every composition of boosts and decomposition into a boost and rotation, the important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{R}+\frac1{\gamma+1}\mathbf{ba}^\mathrm{T} &lt;/math&gt;

holds, allowing the rotation matrix to be defined completely in terms of the relative velocities {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. The angle of a rotation matrix in the axis–angle representation can be found from the [[Rotation matrix#Determining the angle|trace of the rotation matrix]], the general result for ''any'' axis is {{math|tr('''R''') {{=}} 1 + 2 cos''ε''}}. Taking the trace of the equation gives&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macfarlane|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=4, 11, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2013|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\epsilon = \frac{(1+\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+\gamma_\mathbf{v})^2}{(1+\gamma)(1+\gamma_\mathbf{u})(1+\gamma_\mathbf{v})} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The angle {{math|''ε''}} between {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is ''not'' the same as the angle {{math|''α''}} between {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}.

In both frames Σ and Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;, for every composition and decomposition, another important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{Ra} &lt;/math&gt;

holds. The vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are indeed related by a rotation, in fact by the same rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} which rotates the coordinate frames. Starting from {{math|'''a'''}}, the matrix {{math|'''R'''}} rotates this into {{math|'''b'''}} anticlockwise, it follows their [[cross product]] (in the right-hand convention)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}= \frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}(\gamma^2 -1)(\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{v}+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)}{c^2(\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1)(\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)(\gamma+1)} \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

defines the axis correctly, therefore the axis is also parallel to {{math|'''u'''×'''v'''}}. The magnitude of this pseudovector is neither interesting nor important, only the direction is, so it can be normalized into the [[unit vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = \frac{\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}|}&lt;/math&gt;

which still completely defines the direction of the axis without loss of information.

The rotation is simply a "static" rotation and there is no relative [[rotational motion]] between the frames, there is relative translational motion in the boost. However, if the frames accelerate, then the rotated frame rotates with an angular velocity. This effect is known as the [[Thomas precession]], and arises purely from the kinematics of successive Lorentz boosts.

== Finding the Thomas rotation ==
{{quote|text=The decomposition process described (below) can be carried through on the product of two pure Lorentz transformations to obtain explicitly the rotation of the coordinate axes resulting from the two successive "boosts". In general, the algebra involved is quite forbidding, more than enough, usually, to discourage any actual demonstration of the rotation matrix|source={{harvtxt|Goldstein|1980|p=286}}}}

In principle, it is pretty easy. Since every Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and a rotation, the consecutive application of two pure boosts is a pure boost, either followed by or preceded by a pure rotation. Thus suppose

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = B(\mathbf w)R.&lt;/math&gt;

The task is to glean from this equation the boost velocity {{math|'''w'''}} and the rotation {{math|''R''}} from the matrix entries of {{math|Λ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of events are related by

:&lt;math&gt;x'^\mu = {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu x^\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Inverting this relation yields

:&lt;math&gt;{(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu{\Lambda^\mu}_\rho x^\rho = {(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu x'^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_\mu}^\nu x'^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Set {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} (''ct''&amp;prime;, 0, 0, 0).}} Then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will record the spacetime position of the origin of the primed system,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_0}^\nu x'^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^0 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^1 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^2 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^3 ct'\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = (B(\mathbf w)R)^{-1} = R^{-1}B(-\mathbf{w}),&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying this matrix with a pure rotation will not affect the zeroth columns and rows, and

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma\beta_x ct' \\ \gamma\beta_y ct' \\ \gamma\beta_z ct'\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma w_x t' \\ \gamma w_y t' \\ \gamma w_z t'\end{pmatrix}
= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} ct' \\  w_x t' \\ w_y t' \\ w_z t'\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

which could have been anticipated from the formula for a simple boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction, and for the relative velocity vector

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ct}\mathbf x = \frac{\mathbf w}{c} = \boldsymbol \beta = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x_1} {ct} \\ \frac{x_2} {ct} \\ \frac{x_3} {ct}\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} \beta_x \\ \beta_y \\ \beta_z \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^1/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^2/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^3/{\Lambda_0}^0 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus given with {{math|Λ}}, one obtains {{math|'''β'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} by little more than inspection of {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (Of course, {{math|'''w'''}} can also be found using velocity addition per above.) From {{math|'''w'''}}, construct {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}}. The solution for {{math|''R''}} is then

:&lt;math&gt;R = B(-\mathbf w)\Lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = RB(\mathbf w),&lt;/math&gt;

one finds by the same means

:&lt;math&gt;R = \Lambda B(-\mathbf w).&lt;/math&gt;

Finding a formal solution in terms of velocity parameters {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} involves first ''formally'' multiplying {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}, formally inverting, then reading off {{math|'''β'''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form the result, ''formally'' building {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}} from the result, and, finally, formally multiplying {{math|''B''(−'''w''')''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}. It should be clear that this is a daunting task, and it is difficult to interpret/identify the result as a rotation, though it is clear a priori that it is. It is these difficulties that the Goldstein quote at the top refers to. The problem has been thoroughly studied under simplifying assumptions over the years.

==Group theoretical origin==

{{main|Lorentz group|Representation theory of the Lorentz group}}

Another way to explain the origin of the rotation is by looking at the generators of the [[Lorentz group]].

=== Boosts from velocities ===

The passage from a velocity to a boost is obtained as follows. An arbitrary boost is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1999|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-\boldsymbol \zeta \cdot \mathbf K},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''ζ'''}} is a triple of real numbers serving as coordinates on the boost subspace of the Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(3, 1)}} spanned by the matrices

:&lt;math&gt;(K_1, K_2, K_3) = \left( 
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right]
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The vector

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \zeta = \frac{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \tanh^{-1}\beta&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''boost parameter'' or ''boost vector'', its norm is the [[rapidity]]. Here {{mvar|β}} is the ''velocity parameter'', the magnitude of the vector {{math|'''β''' {{=}} '''u'''/''c''}}. While for {{mvar|ζ}} one has {{math|0 ≤ ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}} the {{mvar|β}} is confined by {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}}, and hence {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}}. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-(\tanh^{-1}\beta) \frac{ \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \cdot \mathbf K}
 = e^{-{\tanh^{-1}\beta \over c\beta} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf K} \equiv B(\mathbf u).&lt;/math&gt;

The set of velocities satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}} is an open ball in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is called the space of '''admissible velocities''' in the literature. It is endowed with a [[Velocity-addition formula#Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic geometry]] described in the linked article.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutators===

The [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Explicit formulas|generators of boosts, {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], in different directions do not commute. This has the effect that two consecutive boosts is not a pure boost in general, but a rotation preceding a boost.

Consider a succession of boosts in the x direction, then the y direction, expanding each boost to first order&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryder|1996|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = (I-\zeta_y K_y+\cdots)(I-\zeta_x K_x+\cdots)= I-\zeta_x K_x -\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x} = I+\zeta_x K_x +\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x +\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[group commutator]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x}e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = I &amp; + \zeta_x\zeta_y[K_y,K_x]-(\zeta_xK_x)^2-(\zeta_yK_y)^2 \\
&amp; +\zeta_x^2\zeta_y[K_x,K_y]K_x+\zeta_x\zeta_y^2K_y[K_y,K_x]\\
&amp; +(\zeta_x\zeta_y)^2K_yK_xK_yK_x +\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Three of the [[commutation relation]]s of the Lorentz generators are
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,J_y ] =  J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [K_x ,K_y ] = - J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,K_y ] = K_z &lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket {{math|[''A'', ''B''] {{=}} ''AB'' − ''BA''}} is a [[binary operation]] known as the ''[[commutator]]'', and the other relations can be found by taking [[cyclic permutation]]s of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).

Returning to the group commutator, the commutation relations of the boost generators imply for a boost along the x then y directions, there will be a rotation about the z axis. In terms of the rapidities, the rotation angle {{mvar|θ}} is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \tan \frac{\theta}{2}=\tanh \frac{\zeta_x}{2}\tanh \frac{\zeta_y}{2}  .&lt;/math&gt;

==Spacetime diagrams for non-collinear boosts==

The familiar notion of vector addition for velocities in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be done in a triangular formation, or since vector addition is commutative, the vectors in both orderings geometrically form a parallelogram (see "[[parallelogram law]]"). This does not hold for relativistic velocity addition; instead a [[hyperbolic triangle]] arises whose edges are related to the rapidities of the boosts. Changing the order of the boost velocities, one does not find the resultant boost velocities to coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varićak|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;
