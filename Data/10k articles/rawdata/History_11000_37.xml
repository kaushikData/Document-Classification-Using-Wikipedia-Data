[[File:AdaElizabethLevett.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Staff of St Hilda's College, Oxford, including Elizabeth Levett, October 1919]]
'''Ada Elizabeth Levett''' (1881–1932), known professionally as '''A. E. Levett''', was an Oxford-educated native of [[Bodiam]], Sussex, who became a pioneering woman economic historian specialising in medieval [[feudalism]]. Levett was Vice Principal of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]], and later took up an appointment to a history chair at [[Westfield College]] at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OP5ePl7i5EIC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;lpg=PA348&amp;dq=%22ada+elizabeth+levett%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aSEZZYG2iH&amp;sig=EFeAzsm6yDE3ri9QpwDvHdD8kCI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result The History of the University of Oxford, Trevor Henry Aston, J. I. Catto, T. A. Ralph Evans, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levett was born into an old Sussex family in [[Bodiam]], near the border between [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]], where her family had lived since medieval times. [[Bodiam Castle]] had been held by the [[Levett]] family during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and the lane near the castle was named for them.&lt;ref&gt;In 1623 John Levett of [[Salehurst]], Sussex, sold Bodiam Castle and the manor, which included the right to have a market, to Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubMHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=john+levett+bodiam+thanet+sold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4e9JDyWUx0&amp;sig=QjJDWdBq9i9165QGJGRcIEz96Oc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result] The castle changed hands several more times in the following centuries. Its owners included Sir Nathaniel Powell, 1st Baronet of Ewhurst, member of Parliament Sir [[Sir Thomas Webster, MP|Thomas Webster]], baronet, of [[Battle Abbey]], and ultimately [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], who restored Bodiam Castle and donated it to Britain.&lt;/ref&gt; The once-powerful [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] family, one of the county's oldest, had held manors and lands across Sussex. The study of medieval feudalism was probably in Levett's genes.

Levett's father was a simple yeoman farmer as well as an outdoor enthusiast. Academic pursuits were not encouraged in the household, especially for women. Nevertheless, both Elizabeth and her younger sister Mary Jane Levett (known professionally as M. J. Levett) became noted scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pRp1YdonaU4C&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=%22jane+austen%22+levett&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dCOoqJIjkQ&amp;sig=Fb_t2fE0yvZzvnq-P_-k3u3hquE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPR9,M1 The Theaetetus of Plato, M.J. Levett, Myles Burnyeat, Hackett Publishing, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Levett graduated from Oxford, then became Tutor in Modern History, writer, lecturer and Vice Principal at [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp66755&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit Staff of St. Hilda's College, Oxford, Bassono, National Portrait Gallery, npg.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; where her scrupulous research and lean writing style made her stand out, even among her women contemporaries at Oxford, who often chose the route of close archival study to set themselves apart from male contemporaries. These women were redefining the role of women at the University: women had been forbidden to be faculty members or examine for the university, nor were they allowed to take the M.A. diploma (they were permitted to take a B.A.). Oxford published women's examination results in a separate class-list up until 1952.

But some Oxford dons welcomed the new influence. Professor [[Ernest Barker]], for instance, taught both Elizabeth Levett and her gifted contemporary [[Maude Clark]] before departing Oxford to become principal of [[King's College, London]].

In her speciality of medieval economic history, Levett made use of archives in monasteries and local archives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CrswvYnJo5wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22ada+elizabeth+levett%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8MHubF_UK1&amp;sig=F73CMlqGNV1CEPwDZj-fLIVx5mM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Gender of History: Men, Women, and Historical Practice, Bonnie G. Smith, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Her style was known for its rigorous scholarship with attention to the minutest detail. In the Ewart lecture of 1916, Levett argued for "a stricter method, more rigidly exact in its collection of evidence." Her method, evident in her deeply researched works, was typical of her Oxford contemporaries, Levett noted. No detail should be left out, she said, "not even a mouse-trap, nor even, what is less, a peg for a harp."
[[Image:St Hilda's College Library.jpg|thumb|Library, St. Hilda's College, Oxford]]
Her most noted works are ''Studies in Manorial History'' and ''English Manorial History in the Fourteenth Century'', but she published scores of academic articles and monographs on medieval history—from the obscure details of feudalism to more sensational topics like the [[Black Death]].

A student of the legal and social historian Sir [[Paul Vinogradoff]] at Oxford, Elizabeth Levett took up the methods of careful scrutiny of archival sources, and added an economic historian's insights. Her study on the Black Death was groundbreaking at the time, and her work on the manorial courts of [[St Albans]] was seminal in the field. (She died before publication of the St. Albans work.) Speaking of her former professor Vinogradoff, Levett said "he taught me to unify my varied interests... into the great framework of Economics and Jurisprudence, and to bring it to bear on practical social history."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YlgvdIX7IVwC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22ada+elizabeth+levett%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Mxf7SNWWGZrStQOKtvjfCg A Woman in History: Eileen Power 1889–1940, Maxine Berg, Cambridge University Press, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

This growing wellspring of women historians was especially evident in the [[Victoria County History|''Victoria History of the Counties of England'']], where much of the text was written by female medievalists like Levett, poring over contemporaneous medieval records of peasantry at the time. It was an approach that Levett herself advocated and embraced, and historians saw its impact on her own work.

In writing about the property rights of peasant women during medieval times, for instance, Levett described the sale of land completed while a distraught wife sobbed in court—described in the Latin of medieval records as ''lacrimentem in pleno halimoto''. The transfer was later voided by the court after the husband's death because of the wife's protests, but it was accepted by the court at the time. By focusing on such particular incidents in the old records, Levett limned the societal rights (or lack of them) of medieval women, who were seen as subordinate tenants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BlPozsV5t_EC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22ada+elizabeth+levett%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=nxz7SNC3MY3sswPD_ZC4DA#PPA111,M1 Women in the Medieval English Countryside, Judith M. Bennett, Oxford University Press (U.S.), 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her carefully footnoted academic pieces, Levett delivered lectures and wrote articles on prostitution, on university women and religion, and on women in the postwar world. As her reputation grew, and strictures on women in academia loosened, Levett found that she was in great demand as a lecturer and writer. The award of a history chair at [[Westfield College]] crowned her career as one of a small number of emerging British women historians.

Elizabeth Levett died in 1932 at the age of 51 at the height of her professional career.

Levett's younger sister F. M. Jane Levett, early professor of logic at [[Glasgow University]], also went on to an illustrious career. She is best known for her translation (as M.J. Levett) of [[Plato]]'s [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]. Jane Levett died at her cottage near [[Tenterden]], Kent, not far from her Bodiam birthplace, in 1974.

He gave information on the design and layout of the pre-Islamic [[Ka'aba]] at [[Makka]] after its rebuilding following a fire in 603 AD until its possession by [[Mohammed]] in 630 AD.  The contents included a statue of [[Hubal]], the principal male deity of Makka, and a number of other pagan items, which were destroyed in 630 as idolatrous.  They also included a pair of ram’s horns said to have belonged to the ram sacrificed by the Prophet [[Abraham]] in place of his son, the Prophet [[Ishmael|Ismail]], and a painting (probably a fresco) of [[Jesus]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].  According to Al-Azraqi, Mohammed spared these items, which survived until the destruction by the Umayyads in 683 AD.   Al-Azraqi is silent on the fate of the images of trees that are known also to have decorated the interior of the Ka'aba, pictures of which formed part of the mosaic decoration on the walls of the cathedral of al-Qalis in [[Sana'a]], and were later to emerge in the [[Umayyad]] mosaics in the [[Dome of the Rock]], the [[Mosque of the Prophet]] in [[Medina]], and the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;King, G.

'''Alexander Semyonovich "Alyosha" Svanidze''' ({{lang-ka|ალექსანდრე სვანიძე}}; {{lang-ru|Александр Семёнович Сванидзе}}) (1886 – 20 August 1941) was a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] [[Old Bolshevik]] and historian. He was a personal friend of [[Joseph Stalin]] and a brother of Stalin’s first wife [[Ketevan Svanidze|Kato]]. Nevertheless, Stalin had him arrested during a [[Great Purge|purge]] in 1937. He was shot in prison in 1941.

Born of a [[aznauri|petty noble]] family in a small village of Baji in western Georgia, then part of the [[Russian Empire]], Svanidze was educated at [[Tiflis]] and later at [[Jena]] where he learned [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] and engaged in historical research of ancient civilizations. He joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1901 and worked in the Bolshevik underground until being forced to leave [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|independent Georgia]] in 1919. He worked for the [[Russian SFSR|Russian]] foreign office in the years 1920–1921 and then served as a [[People's Commissar]] for Finances of the [[Georgian SSR]] and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] in the years 1921–1922. In 1924, he was appointed a Soviet trade envoy to [[Germany]] and, upon his return to the [[Soviet Union]], became Deputy Chairman of the [[Gosbank|Soviet State Bank]] in 1935. At the same time, Svanidze continued his scholarship; he founded the ''[[Journal of Ancient History]]'', studied the [[Alarodian languages]], and translated into Russian the medieval Georgian poet [[Shota Rustaveli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/bio_s/svanidze_as.html  Сванидзе, Александр Семенович]. ''Hrono.ru''. Retrieved on 2008-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Great Purge, Stalin ordered Svanidze’s arrest in 1937. He refused defiantly to confess to being a German spy in return for his life as the [[NKVD]] demanded. "Such aristocratic pride," Stalin is quoted to have said. Svanidze, his wife Maria (née Korona; 1889–1941) — a singer for the [[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre|Tbilisi Opera House]] and his sister Mariko were executed in 1941 as the Germans advanced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore|Montefiore, Simon Sebag]] (2007), ''Young Stalin'', pp. 311-2.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
On 28 April 2014, Arif Yunus and his wife Leyla were detained at the [[Heydar Aliyev International Airport]] on their way to [[Doha]], Qatar for allegedly spying for [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Azerbaijan's Leyla Yunus, human rights defender, held|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27202134|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Leyla were then jailed.&lt;ref name=RFEarrest&gt;{{cite news|title=Leyla Yunus's Husband Arrested In Azerbaijan|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/yunus-arif-leyla-azerbaijan-prosecutor-rights-espionage-arrested-bagirov/26515004.html|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arif Yunus was released due to poor health and was placed under guard and prohibited from leaving Baku.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for the immediate and unconditional release of Leyla Yunus, Arif Yunus and Rasul Jafarov|url=https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/08/call-immediate-unconditional-release-leyla-yunus-arif-yunus-rasul-jafarov/|publisher=Index on Censorship|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hrwatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Leading Rights Defender Arrested|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/05/azerbaijan-leading-rights-defender-arrested|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arif Yunus was then detained and placed under detention on 5 August 2014. He has remained in detention since.&lt;ref name=stability&gt;{{cite web|title=Leyla Yunus|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=576|publisher=European Stability Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, during various trials, Arif Yunus has lost consciousness due to his health conditions.&lt;ref name=awid1 /&gt;

On 13 August 2015 Arif Yunus was sentenced to 7 years in jail, and his wife, Leyla, was sentenced to 8.5 years in jail on charges that include fraud and tax evasion. The couple also face treason charges in a separate case. Western governments and human rights groups have expressed concern over their prosecution. [[Human Rights Watch]] has denounced their case as a show trial, and [[Amnesty International]] says the couple are [[prisoners of conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Azerbaijan criticised for jailing activist couple|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/13/azerbaijan-criticised-for-jailing-activist-couple-leyla-arif-yunus|work=Guardian|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups Assail Sentencing of Azeri Rights Activist|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/groups-assail-sentencing-azeri-rights-activist/2916884.html|work=Voice of America|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International condemnation==
The detention of Arif and Leyla Yunus, as well as [[Rasul Jafarov]], has largely been regarded as another step in the state crackdown on civil society in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/azerbaijan-detains-human-rights-activists-fresh-crackdown|title=Azerbaijan detains prominent human rights activists in fresh crackdown|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions of the authorities have been harshly condemned by many prominent international human rights organizations, among them [[Amnesty International]] (which calls the Yunus "prisoners of conscience" and has called on the authorities to release them immediately),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur55/012/2014/en/ Document - Azerbaijan: Leyla Yunus in failing health in prison]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=5153&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=5|title=PACE: News|work=coe.int|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Augustus Le Plongeon''' (May 4, 1826 – December 13, 1908) was a French-American photographer, amateur archeologist, antiquarian and author who studied the [[pre-Columbian]] ruins of America, particularly those of the [[Maya civilization]] on the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. While his writings contain many controversial notions that were not well received by his contemporaries and were later disproven, Le Plongeon left a lasting legacy in his photographs documenting the ancient ruins. He should also be regarded as one of the earliest proponents of [[Mayanism]].

== Early life and careers ==
Le Plongeon was born on the island of [[Jersey]] on May 4, 1826.&lt;ref name="Desmond-2011"&gt;Desmond (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; At 19, he sailed to South America and shipwrecked off the coast of [[Chile]]. While there he settled in [[Valparaiso]] and taught mathematics, drawing, and languages at a local college. In 1849 he sailed to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] during the [[California gold rush]] to work as a [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], and also apprenticed to become a doctor of medicine. One of his accomplishments as a surveyor included drawing a plan for the layout of the town of [[Marysville, California]] in the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] in 1851. Augustus was paid for his services as a surveyor with land deeds. He profited from the sale of these plots and this income would fund the majority of his archeological expeditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dream of Maya|last=Desmond, Lawrence |author2=Messenger, Phyllis|first=|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1988|isbn=0-8263-1000-1|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Plongeon traveled to England and saw a demonstration for new photographic processes at [[The Great Exhibition]]. He then stayed in England to study photography under [[William Fox Talbot]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Augustus wanted to test these methods in tropical climates so he spent time traveling to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands as well as Mexico, Australia, China, and the Pacific Islands. He returned to San Francisco to open a [[daguerreotype]] portrait studio on Clay Street. In 1862, he traveled to [[Lima, Peru]] and opened another photography studio and an "electro-hydropathic" medical clinic based on an early form of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/2004.M.18/2004.M.18.xml;chunk.id=ref15;brand=default|title=Finding Aid for Augustus and Alice Dixon Le Plongeon Papers|last=Guynn|first=Beth Ann|date=|website=|publisher=Getty Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travels in Peru ==
Le Plongeon pioneered the use of photography as a tool for his studies. He began using the wet [[collodion]] glass-plate [[negative (photography)|negative]] process he used for studio portraits to record his explorations. He traveled extensively all over Peru for eight years visiting and photographing ancient ruins, including [[Tiwanaku|Tiahuanaco]]. Augustus also joined a number of [[E. G. Squier]]'s expeditions and took photographs out in the field. Le Plongeon was influenced by the work of [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]],  [[John Lloyd Stephens]], and [[Frederick Catherwood]]. These works, in combination with his own explorations in Peru, led Le Plongeon to believe that civilization had its origins in the New World.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While in Peru Augustus became interested in the causes of earthquakes. He was able to observe the [[1868 Arica earthquake]] and he studied the resulting damage and interviewed people about what they experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this time Le Plongeon began to speak out against abuses by Jesuit priests and the Catholic Church in Peru. He published two anti-Jesuit books, ''La religion de Jesus comparada con las ensenanzas de la Iglesia'' (1867), and ''Los Jesuitas y el Peru'' (1869).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1870, he left Peru and traveled back once again to San Francisco where he gave a number of illustrated lectures at the [[California Academy of Sciences]] on Peruvian archaeology and the causes of earthquakes. His travels then continued on to [[New York City|New York]], and by 1871 he was at the [[British Museum]] in London studying [[Mesoamerica]]n [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Alice Dixon Le Plongeon ==
[[File:Alice Dixon LePlongeon Portrait.jpeg|thumb|Portrait of [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon|Alice Dixon]], taken by her husband, Augustus]]

While in [[London]] he met [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon|Alice Dixon]], the woman with whom he would collaborate for the rest of his life. Alice was born in London in 1851. Her father, Henry Dixon, was recognized in the late nineteenth century for his contribution to the development of [[panchromatic]] photography, and for his photos of London architecture taken for the [[Society for Photographing Relics of Old London]]. Alice learned the techniques of photography from her father and worked as an assistant in his studio. After meeting Augustus, she became interested in ancient American civilizations and studied John L. Stephen's ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan.'' She agreed to accompany Augustus on an archaeology expedition to study Maya ruins in Mexico. The pair left for New York to finalize preparations for the trip. They married in New York before traveling to Mexico in 1873.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yucatan Through Her Eyes: Alice Dixon Le Plongeon, Writer &amp; Expeditionary Photographer|last=Desmond|first=Lawrence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8263-4595-0|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travels in Yucatán ==
In 1873, the Le Plongeons traveled to Yucatán to study ancient Maya sites. Their goal was to explore the possibility of links between the Maya and the civilizations of ancient Egypt and Atlantis. Their first stop was in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]] and they stayed there while Alice recovered from [[yellow fever]]. During her recuperation, the couple made connections with local scholars and both Augustus and Alice learned to speak [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Alice had recovered, the Le Plongeons made a short excursion to [[Uxmal]].

The Le Plongeons were in Yucatán during the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] – a conflict between the Maya, called the Chan  Santa Cruz, and the army of Yucatán. When they traveled to Chicen Itza in 1875, they were accompanied by a military escort. When they arrived at the site, local Maya men were hired to clear the vegetation and help with excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yucatan Through Her Eyes|last=Desmond|first=Lawrence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Le Plongeons were some of the first people to photograph and study Chicen Itza. Their photographic work was methodical and systematic, and they took hundreds of [[stereoscopy|3-D photos]]. They documented entire Maya buildings such as the "Governor's Palace" at [[Uxmal]] in overlapping photos by placing the camera on a tall tripod or scaffold to correct for perspective, and then processed the plates in the unlit rooms of Maya buildings. In addition to entire facades of buildings, they also photographed small [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and architectural details such as [[bas-relief]]s, [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic]] inscriptions, and [[sculpture]]s. They excavated buildings, drew maps and copied murals, and made molds of bas-reliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Chac Mool1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chacmool]] statue from the [[Chichen Itza]] site]]
At [[Chichen Itza]] they excavated a structure known as the Platform of the Eagles and Jaguars and unearthed a large statue or altar figurine. They coined the name "Chaacmol" (later "[[Chac Mool]]" or ''chacmool'') for it. Although their derivation of the name is known now to have had no association with figures of this type, the name has remained in general use among later archaeologists. This statue would later be used as a demonstration of [[Toltec]] influences at the site, with other examples found at the Toltec capital, [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]]. They also documented their excavation of the Platform of Venus with photos as well as plan and cross-section drawings.

From 1873–1884 the Le Plongeons visited and photographed other Maya sites such as [[Izamal]], [[Isla Mujeres]], [[Cozumel]], [[Cancún]], and [[Ake]], and traveled to [[Belize]] (British Honduras). During this time they made a few trips back to New York to attempt to sell bas-relief molds to museums, give lectures, and solicit financial backing for their studies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
{{-}}

== Theories  ==
By the 1880s, while most [[Mayanist]]s accepted that the Maya civilization postdated [[Ancient Egypt]], Le Plongeon stood by his theories. He cited his years of fieldwork and studies of archival sources, and challenged those he considered "armchair" archaeologists to debate the issues. But as evidence mounted against [[cultural diffusion]],  Le Plongeon became marginalized and his theories falling further outside the growing mainstream of Maya archaeology.&lt;ref name="Desmond-2011" /&gt;

Le Plongeon insisted that the symbols of [[Freemasonry]] could be traced to the ancient Maya, and that this ancient knowledge had come to ancient Egypt from the ancient Maya by way of Atlantis. He and Alice constructed an imaginative "history", with the Maya sites in Yucatán being the cradle of [[civilization]], with civilization then traveling east first to [[Atlantis]] and later to [[Ancient Egypt]]. The Le Plongeons named kings and queens of these dynasties, and said that various artworks were portraits of such ancient royalty (such as the famous [[Chacmool]], which the couple excavated at Chichén Itzá). The Le Plongeons reconstructed a detailed but fanciful story of Queen Moo and Prince Coh (also known as "Chac Mool") in which Prince Coh's death resulted in the erection of monuments in his honor (similar to the commemoration of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] by [[Queen Victoria]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Later Career and Legacy ==
While most of Le Plongeon's contemporaries dismissed his theories, individuals such as [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] and [[Helena Blavatsky]] drew upon Le Plongeon's research for their own theories. Augustus spent the remainder of his life in [[Brooklyn, New York]], writing about the connections between Maya and Egypt and defending himself against detractors. Augustus le Plongeon died in Brooklyn in 1908 at the age of eighty-three; Alice followed in 1910 at the age of fifty-nine.

A collection of the works of the Le Plongeons currently resides at the [[Getty Center|Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The archive contains original records covering their travels from the 1860s through the early 1900s, including diaries, unpublished scholarly manuscripts and notes, correspondence, and extensive photographic documentation of ancient architecture and sculpture, city views, and ethnographic studies.

Le Plongeon was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistl American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caio Domenico Gallo''' (28 February 1697 – 20 October 1780), was an Italian historian.{{r|trecc}} Gallo was born and died in [[Messina]], in the north-east of the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]]. His principal work, the ''Annali della città di Messina'', is a comprehensive history of that city from its beginnings up to the time of the plague of 1743. It was published in four volumes, of which only two appeared during his lifetime, in 1756 and 1758. The third volume was published posthumously in 1804, and the fourth in 1875. Two volumes of later history, by Gaetano Oliva, were added in 1896.{{r|trecc}}

=== Christian mission ===

Carl Reindorf was a mission assistant to the Basel missionary, August Steinhauser and ran administrative errands for him in [[Odumase Krobo|Odumase-Krobo]] to meet the paramount chief, Odonkor Azu, whose sons, including Sir Emmanuel Mate Kole, were educated by the Basel Mission.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; Reindorf succeeded Steinhauser at [[Abokobi]] as a missionary, following the 1854 bombardment of Christiansborg by the British [[naval ship]] ''H. M. S.'' ''Scourge,'' after the poll tax riots'','' compelling the mission to move from Osu to [[Abokobi]].&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; The local Abokobi shaman, ''Akoto Badu'' of ''Agbowo'', converted to Christianity while he was stationed there.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; He was transferred to [[Krobo Odumase|Krobo]] in 1859 to deputise [[Johannes Zimmermann]].&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; He was also missionary at [[Teshie]] but was unable to win any Christian converts.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; Reindorf was consecrated a full-time catechist in 1857.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; In 1869, he was elected a [[presbyter]] and assistant superintendent of the ''Christiansborg Church'', now the [[Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu]].&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; On 13 October 1872 he was ordained a minister of the Basel mission.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Role as a physician and farmer ===

Given his knowledge of traditional healing through [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], gleaned from travels around the Gold Coast, Reindorf acted as the [[physician]] and [[surgeon]] to the wounded soldiers during an 1870 local war between the [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga]] and [[Akwamu]] peoples. &lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; Four years earlier, he had performed a similar medical role in 1866 local war between the Dangmes of Ada and the Awuna Ewe people.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; In appreciation of his medical services in treating the wounded after the Ga-Akwamu war, he was the recipient of a citation of commendation from the Administrator (1867-1872) and later Governor (1879 -1880), H. T. Ussher during the welcome ceremonies for a visiting contingent from [[Lagos|Lagos, Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;

He also engaged in large-scale coffee farming at a place he named "[[Hebron]]" near the hamlet of Adenkrebi close to [[Aburi]]. &lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;

=== Teaching and writing ===

Reindorf taught as an assistant teacher of history at the [[Presbyterian College of Education, Akropong|Basel Mission Seminary]] at [[Akropong]] from November 1860 to April 1862. Other courses at the seminary included  [[English language|English]], [[Biblical exegesis]], [[Christian theology|theology]], [[geography]] and [[Classical language|classical languages]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was the [[Head teacher|headmaster]] of the all boys' middle boarding school, the ''[[Salem School, Osu|Salem School]]'' at [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] in 1873.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osusalem.org/pages/heads.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182955/http://www.osusalem.org/pages/heads.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-07-06|title=Presbyterian Boys Boarding School, Osu Salem|website=www.osusalem.org|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As principal, he mentored several students such as Christian Holm, Peter M. Anteson and William A. Quartey, who all became teachers and catechists of the Basel mission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Carl Reindorf taught literacy in the [[Ga language]] and composed church hymns in Ga in 1856 and 1857.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;   He established a boarding school at Mayera with a dozen Ga boys from Accra.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; He lived and worked in Mayera for a decade before returning to Christiansborg, Osu.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; In 1903, he was part of the committee at [[Abokobi]] that revised the Ga Bible, including Ludwig Richter, Jakob Wilhelm Werz, Christian Kölle and Daniel Saba.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The revision committee completed its work in 1912.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;  

He finished work on his notable book, ''A History of the Gold Coast and Asante'' in 1889.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; This literary piece was originally written in the [[Ga language]].&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The English translation of the book was published in [[Basel]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt; The inspiration or impetus for his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] came from a strong sense of nationalism and the linguistic work that had been carried out on Twi oral traditions by the German philologist and fellow Basel missionary, [[Johann Gottlieb Christaller]] (1827–1895).&lt;ref name="DACB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reindorf was also likely influenced by [[Christian Jacob Protten]] (1715–1769), a fellow Ga-Danish mulatto or [[Gold Coast Euro-Africans|Gold Coast Euro-African]] and a 17th-century Moravian missionary and educator in Christiansborg who wrote the first recorded grammatical pamphlet in the [[Ga language|Ga]] and [[Fante language|Fante]] languages, which was published in [[Copenhagen]] in 1764.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/protten-cj/|title=Christian Jacob Protten|last=Smith|first=Noel|date=|website=dacb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/protten-chrisjacob/|title=Christian Jacob Protten|last=Dreydoppel|first=Otto|date=|website=dacb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sebald|first=Peter|date=1994|title=Christian Jacob Protten Africanus (1715-1769) - erster Missionar einer deutschen Missionsgesellschaft in Schwarzafrika|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/christian-jacob-protten-africanus-1715-1769-erster-missionar-einer-deutschen-missionsgesellschaft-in-schwarzafrika/oclc/610701345&amp;referer=brief_results|journal=Kolonien und Missionen.|language=German|pages=109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonsen|first=Gunvor|date=April 2015|title=Belonging in Africa: Frederik Svane and Christian Protten on the Gold Coast in the Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/belonging-in-africa-frederik-svane-and-christian-protten-on-the-gold-coast-in-the-eighteenth-century/FD50A3811C421A5A91D9B1E2F7613BEA|dead-url=no|journal=Itinerario|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=91–115|doi=10.1017/S0165115315000145|issn=0165-1153|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618045639/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/belonging-in-africa-frederik-svane-and-christian-protten-on-the-gold-coast-in-the-eighteenth-century/FD50A3811C421A5A91D9B1E2F7613BEA|archive-date=18 June 2018|access-date=14 October 2018|via=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Moravian Missions|last=Hutton|first=J.

'''Clinique Laboratories, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|k}}) is an [[United States|American]] manufacturer of skincare, cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances, usually sold in high end department stores. It is a subsidiary of the [[Estée Lauder Companies]].

==History==
[[File:Clinique Farmers Dunedin 2013.jpg|thumb|Clinique counter at a [[Farmers Trading Company|Farmers]] [[department store]]]]
In 1967, American [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] magazine published an article called “''Can Great Skin Be Created''?”, written by beauty editor Carol Phillips with [[Norman Orentreich]], discussing the significance of a skin-care routine. Evelyn Lauder, daughter-in-law of Estée Lauder, read the article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skinbody.glam.com/topics/beauty_brands/clinique/ |title=Mode Glam |publisher=Skinbody.glam.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought it to Estée’s attention. Both Carol Phillips and Orentreich were recruited to help create the brand, and in August, 1968, Clinique premiered as the world’s first allergy tested, dermatologist-driven line at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rita Silvan |url=http://www.ellecanada.com/beauty/clinique-c-est-chic/a/24346 |title=Clinique, c'est chic. |publisher=Elle Canada |date=2005-03-10 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evelyn Lauder]], an executive at Estée Lauder and member of the Lauder family, created the Clinique [[brand name]] and developed its line of products.&lt;ref name=pbdn&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Dargan |title=Service to be Monday for Evelyn Lauder, beauty exec and pink ribbon co-creator |url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/service-to-be-monday-for-evelyn-lauder-beauty-1966283.html |work=[[Palm Beach Daily News]] |publisher= |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513210413/http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/service-to-be-monday-for-evelyn-lauder-beauty-1966283.html |archivedate=2012-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder worked as the training director for Clinique.&lt;ref name=pbdn/&gt; She was the first person to wear the trademark white [[lab coat]], now worn by Clinique Consultants worldwide.&lt;ref name=pbdn/&gt;

Clinique was the third brand that was "born" from the Lauder Group after Estée Lauder and Aramis.

In 2008, Clinique announced a partnership&lt;ref name="medpress"&gt;[http://www.cliniquemedical.com/press.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531053446/http://www.cliniquemedical.com/press.html |date=May 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Allergan]], the maker of Botox and former [[cosmeceutical]] partner of [[Elizabeth Arden]], with the result being a new line called Clinique Medical. The line is only available in physician's offices. The 5-product set is designed for pre- and post-operation skin care, and targets complications such as redness, tightness, burning, irritation, discoloration, among others that "slow the healing process."&lt;ref name="optimizing"&gt;[http://www.cliniquemedical.com/prof_optimizingRegimen.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903054238/http://www.cliniquemedical.com/prof_optimizingRegimen.html |date=September 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">'''Comédie du Cap''' was a theater in [[Cap-Français]] in [[Saint-Domingue]], active from 1740 to 1793; from 1764 as a public theater. It is regarded as a prototype for the theaters in Saint-Domingue, were theater were immensely popular. 

==History==
The Comédie du Cap was opened in 1740 as a private theater at Rue Vaudreuil, were [[amateur theater]] were performed for only the aristocracy personally acquainted to the amateur actors.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren R. Clay: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_oFcPJxucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lauren+clay+saint+domingue&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy6rjd26_VAhVFCpoKHQeOBIAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stagestruck: The Business of Theater in Eighteenth-Century France and Its colonies]''&lt;/ref&gt;      

In 1764, it became a public institution, and a new building was inaugurated in 1765. This was the result of the wish of the government of France to show favor to their Caribbean colonies after their loss of French Canada during the [[Seven Years' War]], and the theater was given great government support as a tool for representation of the French crown: in 1775, it was given direct financial support from the government during a period of economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren R. Clay: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_oFcPJxucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lauren+clay+saint+domingue&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy6rjd26_VAhVFCpoKHQeOBIAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stagestruck: The Business of Theater in Eighteenth-Century France and Its colonies]''&lt;/ref&gt;    

The theater had a seat for 1500 people, and a staff of twelve male and eight female actors. It hosted about 2000 plays, operas and concerts each year and public balls twice a weeks, and it was also rented for private functions. 

Theater was very popular in the colony, and the Comedie du Cap was one of the city's most prominent places of social life. As it was regularly visited by the same people, it was necessary to continually offer new performances, and the theater had a good reputation of offering the latest plays from Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren R. Clay: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_oFcPJxucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lauren+clay+saint+domingue&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy6rjd26_VAhVFCpoKHQeOBIAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stagestruck: The Business of Theater in Eighteenth-Century France and Its colonies]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of its remoteness and the bad reputation of the Caribbean colonies in 18th-century France, it was difficult to engage performers from France: it was therefore necessary to offer very high salaries to the professional performers engaged from France, but they were normally not willing to stay long.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren R. Clay: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_oFcPJxucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lauren+clay+saint+domingue&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy6rjd26_VAhVFCpoKHQeOBIAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stagestruck: The Business of Theater in Eighteenth-Century France and Its colonies]''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was however quite common for actors from France to tour in the colonies; the most famed occasion being the Parisian star Louis-Francois Ribie, who performed with a troupe composed of Parisian actors in Saint Domingue and Martinique in 1787-88 and 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren R. Clay: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_oFcPJxucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lauren+clay+saint+domingue&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy6rjd26_VAhVFCpoKHQeOBIAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stagestruck: The Business of Theater in Eighteenth-Century France and Its colonies]''&lt;/ref&gt;            

Initially closed for non-whites, it opened for all races in 1775, though the seats were segregated: the racial organisation of the theater has been referred to as a representation of the racial segregation of the entire colony. The theater was very popular among all classes and also affordable for most.

===Destruction===
The Comédie du Cap was likely destroyed during the [[Pillage of Cap-Français]] in June 1793.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6980">'''Corporate liberalism''' is a thesis in United States [[historiography]] in which the corporate elite become "both the chief beneficiaries of and the chief lobbyists for the supposedly anti-business regulations".&lt;ref name=Long/&gt; The idea is that both owners of corporations as well as high up government officials came together to become the class of elites. The elite class then conspires (or, less maliciously, the system motivates the elite) to keep power away from the low or middle class. Presumably, to avoid the risk of revolution from the poor and powerless and to avoid the realization of [[class conflict]], the elite have the working class pick sides in a mock conflict between business and state.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oglesby/&gt; 

== Overview ==
Corporate liberalism's principal text is [[James Weinstein (author)|James Weinstein]]'s ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State''.

{{quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = Corporate liberalism functions via a façade of opposition between a purportedly progressive statocracy and a purportedly pro-market plutocracy. The con operates by co-opting potential opponents of the establishment; those who recognise that something’s amiss with the statocratic wing are lured into supporting the plutocratic wing, and vice versa...Perhaps the balance of power shifts slightly toward one side or the other; but the system remains essentially unchanged. (Which explains, for example, why the recent much-trumpeted power shift in Congress has resulted in precious little policy change.)|source=—[[Roderick T. Long]]&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;}}
[[Carl Oglesby]] describes corporate liberalism as a cooperation between those with the most military power and those with the most industrial power. Oglesby suggests that "corporate liberalism...performs for the corporate state a function quite like what the Church once performed for the feudal state. It seeks to justify its burdens and protect it from change".&lt;ref name="Oglesby"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061011033218/http://www.radicaleducation.org/sds_documents/oglesby_future.html Let Us Shape the Future, November 27 1965, lecture by Carl Oglesby - SDS President - spoke at a March on Washington, Available at web.archive.org and accessed January 12 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roderick T. Long]] writes similarly that state and corporate power have a symbiotic relationship. Long writes about the alleged realizations of corporate liberalism during the 1960s, the realizations that the business class was hardly a "persecuted minority" and that the state hardly a "bulwark of the poor against the plutocracy".&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;[http://aaeblog.com/2007/02/06/remembering-corporate-liberalism/ "Remembering Corporate Liberalism", Austro-Athenian Empire: Roderick's blog, posted February 6 2007, accessed January 12 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinstein's idea of corporate liberalism should not be confused with [[Ellis W. Hawley]]'s use of the term ([[Daniel T. Rodgers]] noted that Hawley's use of "corporate liberalism" was more a description of [[liberal corporatism]] than anything else). It should not also be confused with the concepts developed by Martin J. Sklar, who invented the term "corporate liberalism" in an article on Woodrow Wilson first published in 1960 when he was in graduate school in history at the University of Wisconsin. Sklar published the essay in ''Studies on the Left'', where he and James Weinstein were co-editors. Sklar's writing about corporate liberalism was a major influence on Weinstein's thinking (which Weinstein himself acknowledged in the preface to his book, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State''). Arguing that the rise of the large corporation "as the dominant mode of business enterprise" was the result of a concerted effort by capitalists and like-minded political leaders and intellectuals, Sklar wrote that corporate liberalism was the "bourgeois Yankee cousin of modern European and English social democracy". 

Sklar subsequently refined and developed the corporate liberal concept in a 1988 book, ''The Corporate Reconstruction of American Capitalism'', which significantly differed from Weinstein's interpretation. On pages 34–35, Sklar defined corporate liberalism as the ideology of the political movement that accomplished the corporate reconstruction of the United States political-economic order on the basis of a mutual adjustment between [[corporate capitalism]] and the [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberal tradition]]. In keeping with that tradition, corporate liberalism upheld the corporate administered market and the rise of regulatory government, but not a "corporate state" or a statist command system. Sklar did not see corporate liberalism as simply the ideology of corporate capitalists, but rather as a broad cross-class ideology "expressing the inter-relations of corporate capitalists, political leaders, intellectuals, proprietary capitalists, professionals, and reformers, workers and trade union leaders, populists, and socialists—all of those who could, to a greater or lesser extent, identify their outlook or their interest in administered markets and government regulation, with the rise, legitimation, and institutionalization of the corporate capitalist order".  

According to Sklar’s account, corporate liberalism was not a monolithic ideology, but unfolded in several major political variants that there were at once "mutually complimentary and in conflict with one another". On the left, they were [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s "statist-tending corporate liberalism"; on the center-left, [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s "regulatory corporate liberalism"; and on the center-right, [[William Howard Taft]]'s "minimalist regulatory corporate liberalism". Sklar contined saying: "It was from this three-way progressive split that sprang the major divisions of twentieth-century American politics with respect to political-economic policy formation".

Other historians who advocate similar theories of United States history include [[Gabriel Kolko]] and [[Murray Rothbard]]. The thesis of corporate liberalism has similarities with the ideas of the [[organizational synthesis]] school of [[Alfred D. Chandler Jr.]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], [[Robert Wiebe]] and [[Louis Galambos]].

[[File:FastiCapitolini.JPG|thumb|A reconstruction of the ''Fasti Capitolini'', in the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill.]]
The '''''Fasti Capitolini''''', or '''Capitoline Fasti''', are a list of the chief [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] of the [[Roman Republic]], extending from the early fifth century BC down to the reign of [[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]].  Together with similar lists found at Rome and elsewhere, they form part of a chronology referred to as the ''Fasti Annales'', ''Fasti Consulares'', or ''Consular Fasti'', or occasionally just the ''fasti''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 218, 399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRA FA"&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', p. 523 ("Fasti Annales").&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capitoline Fasti were originally engraved on marble tablets erected in the [[Roman Forum|Roman forum]].  The main portions were discovered in a fragmentary condition, and removed from the forum in 1546, as ancient structures were dismantled to produce material for the construction of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  They were brought to the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the adjacent [[Capitoline Hill]], where they remain as part of the collection of the [[Capitoline Museums]], together with other Roman antiquities.&lt;ref name="Harpers Fasti"&gt;''Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', p. 662 ("Fasti").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with the histories of writers such as [[Livy]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], the Capitoline Fasti form one of the primary sources for Roman chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', vol. I, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''[[fasti]]'' originally referred to calendars published by the [[College of Pontiffs|pontifices]], indicating the days on which business could be transacted (''fasti'') and those on which it was prohibited for religious reasons (''nefasti'').&lt;ref name="Harpers Fasti"/&gt;  These calendars frequently included lists of the annual magistrates.  In many ancient cultures, the most common way to refer to individual years was by the names of the presiding magistrates.  The annually-elected [[Roman consul|consuls]] were the [[eponym]]ous magistrates at Rome, and so lists of the consuls going back many years were useful for dating historical events.  Over time such lists also became known as ''fasti''.&lt;ref name="Harpers Fasti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD Fasti"&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 2nd Ed., pp. 429, 430 ("Fasti").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La lupa a casa sua 1120996.JPG|thumb|left|The Sala della Lupa in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, with the [[Capitoline Wolf]] in the foreground, and behind her an entablature of ''Fasti Capitolini'', one of several in the hall.]]
The Capitoline Fasti are thought to have been engraved in one of two places: first, the wall of the [[Regia]], originally the residence or official seat of the [[King of Rome|Roman kings]], and later the official residence of the [[Pontifex maximus|Pontifex Maximus]], the chief priest of Rome, between 36 and 30 BC.&lt;ref name="Harpers Fasti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD Fasti"/&gt;  The ''[[Annales maximi|Annales Maximi]]'', records of Roman history from the earliest period to the late second century BC, and one of the sources consulted by ancient historians, were stored in the Regia.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', ii. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the ''Fasti Capitolini'' may have been inscribed on the [[Arch of Augustus, Rome|Arch of Augustus]], in 18 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', vol. I, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In either case, they were subsequently continued down to the death of Augustus in AD 14.&lt;ref name="DGRA FA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harpers Fasti"/&gt;

In 1540, [[Pope Paul III]] authorized the recycling of stone from the forum for the construction of St. Peter's Basilica.  The structures in the part of the forum where the fasti were discovered were dismantled between August 15 and September 14, 1546.  Some of the stone was sold to stonecutters to be reused in the construction, while some was sold to lime burners to be used for cement.  The work was carried out by a company of local quarrymen, with little regard for the archaeological value of the ancient structures, but the scholars [[Onofrio Panvinio]] and [[Pirro Ligorio]] observed the demolition, and noticed a portion of the fasti still embedded between [[pilasters]] in a wall.  Other portions were found scattered nearby, and the scholars rescued them, ordering further tunnels dug in order to search for more fragments.  Some were found embedded in nearby buildings, indicating that stone from the same area had previously been reused.&lt;ref name="Lanciani 68 ff"&gt;Lanciani, ''New Tales of Old Rome'', pp. 68–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty fragments of the Fasti Capitolini were recovered, along with twenty-six fragments of the ''Acta Triumphalia'', or ''[[Fasti Triumphales]]'', dating to the same period and recording the names of Roman generals who had been honoured with a [[Roman triumph|triumph]].  [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] brought them to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the nearby Capitoline Hill, where Ligorio and [[Michelangelo]] reconstructed them, based on the observations of Panvinio and Ligorio.&lt;ref name="Lanciani 68 ff"/&gt;  Two additional fragments were discovered during excavations in the forum in 1817 and 1818.&lt;ref name="DGRA FA"/&gt;  Others were discovered in excavations from 1872 to 1878, with the last discovered in the [[Tiber]] in 1888.&lt;ref name="Egbert 362"&gt;Egbert, ''Latin Inscriptions'', p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandys 168 ff"&gt;Sandys, ''Latin Epigraphy'', pp. 168–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Palazzo forms part of the Capitoline Museums, and the Capitoline Fasti are housed in the ''Sala della Lupa'', the Salon of the Wolf, together with the [[Capitoline Wolf]], for which the gallery is named.

[[File:Fasti Consularii (detail) - Sala della Lupa - Palazzo dei Conservatori - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A portion of the Fasti Capitolini, running from 264 to 172 BC.  In the upper left corner are Appius Claudius Caudex and Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, consuls in 264, at the beginning of the [[First Punic War]], and in the lower right are Gaius Popillius Laenas and Publius Aelius Ligus, the first pair of plebeian consuls, in 172.]]
Due to the fragmentary condition of the Fasti Capitolini, it is not entirely certain whether they began with the first year of the Republic, or with the [[Roman Kingdom|kings]], as did the related ''Fasti Triumphales''.  The first year which is partially extant is 483 BC.  The last surviving year is AD 13, and the fasti probably ended the following year.  The extant years include the names of the [[Roman consul|consuls]], who gave their names to each year, as well as consuls ''suffecti'', who replaced those who resigned or died during their year of office.  The fasti also include the [[Roman dictator|dictators]] and [[Magister equitum|magistri equitum]] for the years in which they were appointed, as well as the [[Roman censor|censors]], together with the [[Decemviri#Decemviri Legibus Scribundis Consulari Imperio|decemvirs]] and [[Tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribunes]] for the years in which they were elected in place of consuls.

The original form of the fasti is thought to have consisted of four large tablets, each of which was several feet high.  The first ran to 390 BC, the second to 293, the third to 154, and the fourth to 9 BC, with the remaining years to AD 14 in the margin.&lt;ref name="Egbert 362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandys 168 ff"/&gt;  The fasti include a number of notes, indicating when the office-holders mentioned resigned, died, or were killed during their years of office; and they provide additional information, such as the years in which important wars began, the reasons for the nomination of dictators, the number of the ''[[lustrum]]'' taken by the censors, and the number of years since the founding of Rome, according to the era of [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], given every ten years.  Cato placed the founding of Rome one year later than Varro, so the years given in the fasti appear later than the dates given in the columns on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Sandys, ''Latin Epigraphy'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capitoline Fasti were first transcribed and published by Marliani at Rome in 1549, Sigonius at Modena in 1550, and Robortelli at Venice in 1555.  Early publications were heavily edited to give the appearance of completeness.  The current reconstruction is part of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', appearing in the first volume, and since amended several times.&lt;ref name="Egbert 362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandys 168 ff"/&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
Although some scholars have questioned the accuracy of the Capitoline Fasti, particularly with regard to the earliest portion, the overall chronology is remarkably consistent from one source to the next, and all of the Roman historians and annalists place the beginning of the Republic within a span of about seven or eight years.  The ''Fasti Capitolini'' represent the longest version of the chronology, and current scholarly opinion accepts nearly all of the list, with two main exceptions: the so-called "dictator years", four years during the latter part of the fourth century BC, in which the dictators of the preceding years are said to have continued in office without the election of consuls; and also a span of time leading up to the passage of the ''[[lex Licinia Sextia]]'' in 367 BC, during which the [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes of the plebs]] are said to have prevented the election of annual magistrates for five years, in order to force the passage of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', vi. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diodorus xv 75"&gt;Diodorus Siculus, ''Bibliotheca Historica'', xv. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', pp. 109, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broughton I xi"&gt;Broughton, ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', vol. I, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 218–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four "dictator years" are generally regarded as a late interpolation, as such a remarkable departure from the Roman constitution, which normally limited the term of a dictator to six months, is not mentioned by any of the Roman historians, nor are the "dictator years" found in any source other than the Capitoline Fasti.&lt;ref name="Broughton I xi"/&gt;  The so-called "anarchy" earlier in the third century is less easily explained, since the story of this period is corroborated in multiple accounts, including Livy and [[Diodorus Siculus]], but the length of time that Rome was without annual magistrates may have been exaggerated; perhaps only one year, as stated by Diodorus.&lt;ref name="Diodorus xv 75"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 399–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription==
The following tables give the magistrates and events from the most recent reconstruction of the ''Fasti Capitolini''.&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1900|83}}; 1904, 114; {{AE|1927|101}}; 1940, 59, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  The years supplied are based on the Varronian chronology; years [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] given in the original table are provided under "notes".  Portions of names and text in square brackets have been interpolated.  Periods (full stops) have been supplied for abbreviations.  An m-dash is used for missing or unknown filiations or other abbreviated [[praenomen|praenomina]].  Other missing text is indicated with an ellipsis in brackets, [...].  These tables uses modern conventions for distinguishing between I and J, and between U and V.  Otherwise, the names and notes are given as spelled in the fasti.  Archaic Roman spellings, such as ''Aimilius'' for ''Aemilius'', and ''caussa'' for ''causa'', have been preserved.  A list of [[Latin]] phrases and abbreviations appearing below follows the last table.

===Magistracies===
* Censs. = ''censores'', censors
* Coss. = ''consules'', consuls
* Dict. = dictator
* Imp. = ''imperator'', emperor
* Mag. Eq. = magister equitum
* Tribuni Militum cos. pot. = ''tribuni militum consulari potestate'', military tribunes with consular powers, or "consular tribunes"
* IIIvir = ''triumvir rei publicae constituendae'', triumvir to restore the Republic

'''Gabriel ibn al-Qilai''' (in exact Arabic transcription: '''Jibrāyīl ibn al-Qilā'i''', in Latin: '''Gabriel Benclaius or Barclaius''',&lt;ref&gt;[Bar is the form Syriac corresponding to the Arab bin or bin.]&lt;/ref&gt; born in 1447 in [[Lehfed]], in the [[Jbeil District]], died in 1516 in [[Cyprus]]) was a Lebanese Christian religious, belonging to the [[Maronite Church]]. Al-Qilai entered in the Franciscan Order to 1470 and was consecrated bishop of [[Maronites in Cyprus]] in 1507.

==Biography==

Information about Gabriel al-Qilai are mostly found in the work of the historiographical patriarch [[Estephan El Douaihy]], which greatly was inspired by him. Defending the idea of perpetual Roman orthodoxy of the Maronites, the Patriarch Douaihy fought against the idea that Ibn al-Qilai had converted to Catholicism in 1494.&lt;ref&gt;[Apology of the Maronites, Book II, § 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel al-Qilai was son of Butrus al-Qilā'i and was born in the village of [[Lehfed]]. The word Qilā'i refers to a house in a rocky area.&lt;ref&gt;[Bayn al-Qila 'means "among the rocks."]&lt;/ref&gt; According to custom, he was entrusted to a priest named Ibrāhīm ibn Dray to learn from him the Syriac and the reading of the liturgical books. According to the Patriarch Douaihy he was attacked in his youth of ophthalmia which was the cause of his breakup with his fiancee and his withdrawal from society.

Towards 1470, he went on pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] with another young man named John.&lt;ref&gt;[Gabriel and Jean were accompanied by a third named François according to some sources.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this city he adhered the [[Custody of the Holy Land]] of the Franciscan order. The recruitment of two young Maronites in the order was assigned by the Flemish brother Gryphon of Courtrai (1405 - died at St. Francis Convent in [[Famagusta]] on 18 July 1475), attached in 1450 to his death at the Franciscan mission of [[Mount Lebanon]] and loaded relations with the Maronites.

The two youth Lebanese complete their last year of novitiate in the convent of [[Mount Zion]]. After their vows, they were sent to [[Venice]] to complete their training. Gabriel followed to Italy (in Venice and [[Rome]]) to study [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and [[theology]] that lasted at least seven years. He himself said that he stayed in Rome for seven months and performs with his friend Jean theological training at [[Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli|Aracoeli convent]]. In the eulogy he made with his friend John in Italy when they were often subjected to people who accused the [[Maronite Church]] from [[heresy]] a vigorous defence of their church. Both were ordained priests in Italy.

They did back to the East probably in 1483/85. Then, until his episcopal consecration in 1507, the life of Ibn al-Qilai took place between Qannoubine (center of the Maronite Church), [[Beirut]] (where there was a Franciscan monastery, Saint-Sauveur) and [[Jerusalem]] (where there was a Franciscan monastery, Mount Zion).

At that time, the Maronite Church was very torn between his long-standing ties with the papacy and the very strong presence in [[Lebanon]] of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite Church]], of which it was culturally very close (liturgy, use of Western [[Syriac language|Syriac]]). Noah Lebanese Bqoufa (born in [[Ehden]], in the heart of the Maronite country) was Patriarch of Antioch of the Jacobites from 1493 to 1509. There were no less than two convents in the region of Ehden that were occupied by Ethiopian monks members of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], in the same communion that the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]). Also a muqaddam (local chief) named Abdel Min'im Ayyub († 1495) had joined the Jacobite cause.

Ibn al-Qilai was particularly devoted to the fight against the Jacobite influences (who won, apparently, his native village of Lehfed and of his relatives) to secure the Maronites to the [[Catholic Church]].

On November 23, 1494, the Franciscan friar Francesco Suriano, then [[Custos (Franciscans)|custos]] of the Holy Land, sent an unfriendly letter to Maronite Patriarch Simeon Hadath: he marveled that he was elected in 1492 but has not yet sent anyone to Rome to request the [[pallium]] (the confirmation of his election); "enemies" of the new primate, grouped in Cyprus where the Maronite Church was well established, accused him of breaking the union with the papacy; Suriano asked the Patriarch to justify and renew in writing, with the bishops, priests and lay leaders of the Maronite nation, their membership of the Catholic Church. Then Gabriel ibn al-Qilai was sent by Suriano to investigate charges and collect the new act of faith of the patriarch and his people.

Ibn al-Qilai devoted himself to this task in Lebanon until at least 1499. In 1507, the bishop of the Maronites of Cyprus Joseph Kasaphani died and he was elected to succeed him. He first lived in the Saints Nuhra and Anthony convent of Nicosia, the traditional seat of the Maronite bishops, and then transferred the seat to Saint-Georges Convent of Tala.

Relations between the Maronite and Latin hierarchies in Cyprus were appalling: in 1514, Ibn al-Qilai wrote to [[Pope Leo X]] to complain about the nuisance that the Latin bishops to property inflicted the great Maronite monastery of Saint John Khuzbandu.&lt;ref&gt;[now disappeared Monastery, which was probably not far from the Greek monastery St. John Chrysostom Koutsovendis.]&lt;/ref&gt; The pope replied in 1515, confirming the rights of the Maronites and sent two other letters on this subject, to the Latin archbishop and the Venetian governor of the island.

Bishop al-Qilai died in 1516 in Cyprus.

==Work==

Gabriel ibn al-Qilai authored abundant literary works, mixing treated in prose and poetry, making him the first modern Maronite writer. The Maronite historians of the 17th and 18th centuries (Antoine Faustus Nairon,&lt;ref&gt;[Antoine Faustus Nairon (real Arabic name Merhej Mikhael ibn ibn Nimroun), born in Rome in 1628 of a native of Bane family in Lebanon, also died in Rome in 1711, brother or nephew of [[Abraham Ecchellensis]] and his successor as professor of Syriac at the College of Wisdom in Rome, author of two books on the history of the Maronites: origin Dissertatio, ac nomine religione Maronitarum (1679) and Euoplia fidei Catholicae ex Syrorum monumentis adversus AEVI novatores nostri (1694 ).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estephan El Douaihy]] and [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]]) were largely dependent him.

The '''Great Dark Horde''' is an independent "household" (a social sub-group or quasi-fraternal organization) within the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] (SCA) – a [[historical reenactment]] group founded with the aim of studying and recreating pre-17th century [[Western Europe]]an cultures and their histories.&lt;ref name="Legio"&gt;"Gunnbjorn Gunnarsson" (Michael S. Rosecrans) [http://www.legiodraconis.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=pnSections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=234&amp;POSTNUKESID=3bd76b5e1fb2666c8d4a7d227ea50795 "Households in the SCA"]. ''Legio Draconis''. Retrieved December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although one can also find members in other re-enactment groups, it may very well be the largest household in that organization.&lt;ref name="Legio"/&gt; It covers all the Kingdoms, though in some Kingdoms members do not always advertise themselves as Hordesmen. {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}}

The Dark Horde first appeared (or, as they put it, "walked out of the trees"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.di.org/history/DI_Timeline.html "Timeline of the Dorsai Irregulars"]&lt;/ref&gt;) at a Crown Tourney of the Middle Kingdom, on May 8, 1971 (A.S. V, in SCA notation). One of the more notable co-founders was [[fantasy author]] [[Robert Asprin]] (who in the SCA was known as "Yang the Nauseating").&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O'Donnell, ''The Knights Next Door: Everyday People Living Middle Ages Dreams'', 2004; p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; According to eyewitness accounts, some attendees wondered who let the bike gang in the event. According to Yang himself in a song he wrote describing the incident, he was hailed as the [[Khakhan]] of the Horde because while en route to that event he and his friends stopped at a bike shop that was having a sale on sheepskin biker's vests. The others all bought vests that had dyed fleece, while the only one he found that would fit him was natural. Because his was different from the rest, he had to be the "leader of the pack".&lt;ref&gt;''Yang: The Rise and Fall of the Dark Horde'', 3rd ed.; Urbana, IL: Folump Enterprises&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Dark Horde is particularly interested in the historical aspects of pre-1650 [[Mongol]] culture, some members have personae of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], Middle Eastern, [[Viking]], [[Celt]]ic, [[Cherokee]], German, Japanese, and Chinese origins, among others. Thus, one cannot always identify Hordesmen by their garb. They may very well be dressed as a [[Cavalier]], a [[Crusade]]r, or wearing a royal [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}}

This diversity is an homage to the fact that the historical [[Mongol Empire]] not only covered the greatest land-mass of any single country to date—but that the Mongols were among the more benign conquerors in terms of tolerating the cultural and religious differences of those they absorbed.  They did not impose their belief systems, customs, or mores on subjugated peoples, nor even much care how they lived or whom they worshiped—as long as they were prompt with required [[tribute|tributary]] payments, and did not try to rebel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/mongols/history/history7.htm Asia for Educators Program at Columbia University. "Asian Topics in World History: The Mongols in World History: The Mongols' Mark on Global History: A Tactic of Religious Tolerance"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Great Dark Horde are held to ideals of self-discipline, [[Honour|honor]], and the pursuit of [[perfection]]; [[Social equality|equality]] and [[respect]] for each person, regardless of race, sex, age, or allegiance; and [[Comrade|camaraderie]] and [[friendship]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}}

Although the role of the Horde is to serve as an anti-[[aristocracy|aristocratical]] alternative within the SCA, Horde members have served as King and/or Queen (and as Prince and/or Princess) in many SCA Kingdoms and Principalities; have served as officers at all levels of the SCA; have served as Baron/Baroness of SCA Baronies; and have earned almost every known award and rank of peerage the SCA has to offer.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}}

The emblem of the Great Dark Horde is a red and black [[yin-yang]] symbol traversed by a yellow lightning-bolt.  Those Horde members who wish to be known as such are identifiable by cords of braided, woven, or twisted red and black yarn which hang from the belt, commonly called "Horde Cords". Those who choose not to be openly known as such are sometimes jocularly referred to as "[[ninja (disambiguation)|ninjas]]".{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}}

==Early life and education==
He earned a Bachelor of Applied Arts in journalism, newspaper major, in 1993 from [[Ryerson Polytechnic University]].&lt;ref name=SlamBio/&gt;

==Writing==
He is the author of six books on professional wrestling, and five books on hockey. He is also the co-founder and producer of the [[Canoe.com|SLAM! Wrestling]] website, and has contributed to many other publications, including ''[[The Hockey News]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', ''[[Kingston Whig-Standard]]'', ''[[Kitchener-Waterloo Record]]'', ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', ''[[Fighting Spirit Magazine]]''.

==Criticism==
In July 2008, [[Bret Hart]], an acclaimed professional wrestler, spoke at the [[George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]], during the induction banquet for his father, [[Stu Hart]], about Oliver. Upset over his ranking in one of Oliver's books – #14 in the greatest Canadian performers, behind [[Midget wrestling|midget wrestler]] [[Sky Low Low]] – Hart called Oliver a "charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2008-07-transcript_of_bret_harts_hall_of_fame_speech-story.html |title=Transcript of Bret Hart's Hall of Fame speech - Baltimore Sun |first= Kevin|last= Eck|work=baltimoresun.com |date= 2008-07-03|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports journalist [[Heath McCoy]] also criticised Oliver for his placement of Hart and asked if Oliver was joking with that decision. McCoy also stated that he believed Oliver's book was highly biased towards Ontario wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =McCoy,  Heath | title = [[Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling]] | publisher =[[ECW Press]] | year = 2007 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-55022-787-1| page = 293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eastern name order|Györffy György}}

'''György Györffy''' ([[Szucság]] (Suceagu, today part of [[Baciu]]), 26 September 1917 &amp;ndash; [[Budapest]], 19 December 2000) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] historian, and member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] ({{lang-hu|MTA}}).

==Biography==
Györffy was born in [[Szucság]], Hungary the son of [[ethnography|ethnographer]] István Györffy and Anna Papp. He finished his secondary schooling in the [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. István]] [[Grammar school|Grammar School]] in 1935. Between 1935 and 1939 he studied at the Peter Pázmány University (now [[Eötvös Loránd University]]) under the historian Sándor Domanovszky, Elemér Mályusz, and the [[linguistics|linguist]] and [[turkology|turkologist]] Gyula Németh.

Towards the end of this time he took a [[sabbatical]] around the [[Baltic Sea]], Finland and [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]]. When he received the news of the start of World War II he returned to Hungary, arriving back in October 1939.

In June 1940, he was awarded a Doctorate in Hungarian Cultural History with his thesis {{lang|hu|"Besenyők és magyarok"}} ("[[Pecheneg]]s and [[Hungarians]]").

From September 1940 until the end of 1941 he worked in the university library as a trainee. From 1942 he was a trainee in the Department of Historical Research within the [[Pál Teleki]] Scientific Institute, where he later became a lecturer. From 1945 to 1949 he was the Head of the Department of [[Ethnology]] at the Institute.

At the end of 1951 he received an offer for the position of Senior Lecturer at the [[University of Debrecen]] but he refused it because of the serious political situation in Hungary at that time.

At the Department of History of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (MTA) he became a [[Fellow]], a [[Senior Fellow]] and then a Consulting Fellow. In 1987 he started using a computer to ease editing his work. He used it to process details of [[Pozsony]] ([[Bratislava]]), but this work was left unfinished.

In 1988 he retired and became a Fellow Emeritus.

==Awards==
* 1952 &amp;ndash; {{lang|hu|Kandidátus}} of Historical Science.
* 1969 &amp;ndash; Doctor of Historical Science with his thesis {{lang|hu|A magyar várostörténet kezdetei és Budapest kialakulása}} ("Early History of Hungarian Cities and the Evolution of Budapest")
* 1988 &amp;ndash; [[Herder Prize]]
* 1990 &amp;ndash; Associate Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
* 1991 &amp;ndash; Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
* 1992 &amp;ndash; [[Széchenyi Prize]]
* 1997 &amp;ndash; His work became a part of the {{lang|hu|Magyar Örökség}} ("Hungarian Heritage").

==Work==
Györffy's work concentrates on Hungarian history, such as the Great Migration from the Far East into Hungary, the [[Árpád]] Dynasty, the exploration of the Far East, [[topography]], and ancient [[given name]]s and settlement names. He excelled in [[linguistics]] and was a Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He contributed to the Academy's learned journal {{lang|hu|Magyar Nyelv}} ("Hungarian Language").

In 1957 he introduced ideas that would later make up his {{lang|la|[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]}} {{lang|hu|Az Árpád-kori Magyarország történeti földrajza.}} ("History of Hungarian Geography during the Árpád Dynasty"). In this work he recorded regional geographical names, settlement names, names of areas and borders, rivers, hills, forests and so on, and a great number of given names. He recorded the names in the original [[spelling]]. He recorded the names of trees in the border regions and other features of the landscape. His work is important in Hungarian linguistic studies.

== Biography ==
He began climbing and trekking in the range around [[Mumbai]], the [[Western Ghats]]. His first visit to the [[Himalaya]] was almost 40 years ago{{When|date=February 2011}}. His main contribution to Himalayan climbing has been to explore unknown areas and, in number of cases, to open up climbing possibilities. Some of his major ascents have been of Devtoli (6788 m), [[Bandarpunch]] West (6102 m), Parilungbi (6166 m), in 1995, [[Lungser Kangri]] (6666 m) the highest peak of [[Rupshu]] in [[Ladakh]]. He led eight international joint expeditions,&lt;ref name="Himalayan climber to give lecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapadia gets Patron’s Medal"/&gt; five with the [[British people|British]], two with the [[French people|French]] and one with the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] mountaineers,&lt;ref name="Kapadia gets Patron’s Medal"/&gt; to high peaks, such as [[Rimo I]] (7385 m), Chong Kumdan Kangri I (7071 m), Sudarshan Parvat, Padmanabh (7030 m), and the [[Panch Chuli]] and Rangrik Rang groups.&lt;ref name="Kapadia gets Patron’s Medal"/&gt;

Earlier, in 1974 he fell in a crevasse at 6200 m, deep inside the formidable ''[[Nanda Devi]]'' Sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Himalayan climber to give lecture"/&gt; He was carried by his companions for 13 days to the base camp where a [[helicopter]] rescued him. He was operated for a dislocated hip-joint and had to spend two years walking on crutches. But that did not keep him out for too long and he has climbed for three [[decades]] after the injury.

Kapadia has a degree in Commerce, Law and Management from [[University of Mumbai]] and he is a cloth merchant by profession. He has published twelve books. His ''Trek The Sahyadris'' has now become a standard reference for all trekkers in the [[Western Ghats]]. His other books, ''Exploring the Hidden Himalaya'' (with Soli Mehta) and ''High Himalaya Unknown Valleys'' and ''Meeting The Mountains'' cover his various trips to the Himalaya, while ''Spiti Adventures in the Trans-Himalaya'', covers climbing and trekking in that region. He has been the editor of the ''Himalayan Journal'' for the past 28 years, bringing the journal to international standards and continuing it as a major authentic reference on the range.

Kapadia has been elected an Honorary Member of the (British) [[Alpine Club]]. He was a Vice President of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (1997–1999). He was awarded the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF) Gold Medal by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation in 1993.&lt;ref name="Alpine Club Notes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1993_files/AJ%201993%20342-348%20AC%20Notes.pdf |title=Alpine Club Notes |publisher=alpinejournal.org.uk |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Queen approved the award of the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] to him. He has been invited to many countries to lecture on his Himalayan exploits, and is a member of several organisations. He is married, and lives in Bombay.

His son [[Lieutenant]] [[Nawang Kapadia]], who was commissioned on 2 September 2000 in the Fourth Battalion the Third [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha]] Rifles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nawang.com/ |title=Lt. Nawang Kapadia |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; died while fighting [[Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism|Pakistan-based terrorists]] in the jungles of Rajwar in Kupwara district of [[Srinagar]] on 11 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/3QfYqLadggrbnrn41H0mAJ/The-Nanda-Devi-mystery.html |title=The Nanda Devi mystery |date=18 April 2015 |work=Live Mint |publisher=HT Media  |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Harish Kapadia has taken to lecturing about this conflict, particularly in the [[Siachen Glacier]]. He has been discussing a proposal for a peace park in the Siachen glacier region and cleaning up the environmental damage there.&lt;ref name="Himalayan climber to give lecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meet Harish Kapadia, who knows the Himalayas, Sahyadri like the back of his hand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="In memory of an army officer slain in battle"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/aug/16spec.htm |title=In memory of an army officer slain in battle |publisher=rediff.com |publication-date=16 August 2002 |access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harish Kapadia has donated a substantial number of photographs and maps to the [[American Alpine Club]] and to the [[Swiss National Museum]], which are setting up the [[Lt. Nawang Kapadia Collection]]. This is in addition to the Lt. Nawang Kapadia Library already in existence at the [[Himalayan Club]].

His book, "Meeting The Mountains" is also seen while standing in line at Disney's Animal Kingdom for Expedition Everest.  While passing through the line you pass through many glass cases displaying the history of mountains and at one point, you come across something that is supposed to look like an office and his book can be seen on the top bookshelf of this section.

Due his long work as editor of the [[Himalayan Journal]], Kapadia became an important chronicler of mountaineering.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Jurgalski (2008). [http://www.8000ers.com/cms/en/history-of-chronicles-mainmenu-183.html ''History of chronicles''], 8000ers.com, retrieved 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2017 in Seoul, Korea, Harish Kapadia was awarded the Piolets d'Or Asia Life Time Achievement Award. He is the first Indian to receive this prestigious award for his outstanding carrier in mountaineering and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamwanderlust.com/news/first-indian-gets-piolets-dor-harish-kapadia-does-country-proud|title=First Indian gets Piolets d'Or; Harish Kapadia does country proud|date=3 November 2017|work=dreamwanderlust.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In appreciation of his authorship of many books and his stewardship of The Himalayan Journal as an Editor for 35 years he was further honoured by the Korea Alpen Book Club and made an Honorary member of the Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamwanderlust.com/news/rare-honour-for-veteran-indian-climber|title=Rare honour for veteran Indian climber|date=10 November 2017|work=dreamwanderlust.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herman e Karel Skorpil, museo archeologico, Varna, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|Hermann and [[Karel Škorpil]], [[Varna Archaeological Museum]]]]
'''Václav Hermenegild Škorpil''' ({{lang-bg|Вацлав Херменгилд Шкорпил}}; 8 February 1858{{spaced ndash}}25 June 1923) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Bulgaria]]n [[archaeologist]] and [[museum]] worker credited along with his brother [[Karel Škorpil|Karel]] with the establishment of those two disciplines in Bulgaria, as well as a [[geologist]], [[botanist]], [[architect]] and [[librarian]].

Born in the city of [[Vysoké Mýto]] (then ''Hohenmauth'' in [[Austria-Hungary]], now part of [[Ústí nad Orlicí District]], [[Pardubice Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]]) on 8 February 1858, he finished high school in [[Chrudim]] and [[Pardubice]] and graduated from the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|Technical University]] in [[Prague]] and in [[natural sciences]] from the [[University of Leipzig]]. From 1880 to 1906 he was a teacher at various Bulgarian cities: [[Plovdiv]], [[Sofia]], [[Sliven]], [[Rousse]] and [[Varna]], teaching [[natural history]], [[geography]], [[zoology]], botany, arithmetic and the [[German language]]. He was the author of the first [[geologic map]] of [[Southern Bulgaria]]. In 1884, he founded a museum in Sliven, as well as a museum of natural sciences in Rousse in 1902. From 1906 to his death, he was the [[curator]] of the [[Varna Archaeological Museum]]. He died in the city where he spent much of his life with his brother, the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] port of Varna, on 25 June 1923. He was buried in an area near the city where he had unearthed an early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[basilica]].

All research by the Škorpil brothers was self-funded and all unearthed monuments have been preserved in Bulgaria. A street in Varna where their house is located and the [[Black Sea]] village and [[seaside resort]] [[Shkorpilovtsi]] were named after the brothers. Their hometown Vysoké Mýto is also a [[twin towns and sister cities|twin town]] of Varna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34878">The [[Polish language]] is a [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]], and thus descends from [[Proto-Slavic]], and more distantly from [[Proto-Indo-European]]. More specifically, it is a member of the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] branch of the West Slavic languages, along with other languages spoken in areas within or close to the area of modern [[Poland]], including [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], [[Silesian language|Silesian]], and the extinct [[Slovincian language|Slovincian]] and [[Polabian language|Polabian]].

The history of the language can be divided into four periods of development: [[Old Polish language|Old Polish]], up to the start of the 16th century; Middle Polish, from the 16th century until the end of the 18th century; New Polish, up to 1930; and Modern Polish, since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120303214558/http://www.naszdziennik.pl/index.php?typ=kl&amp;dat=20090302&amp;id=kl12.txt Article "Polish language for centuries"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This page lists the most important changes that have taken place in the history of the Polish language.

== Phonetic processes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ==

* Addition of a [[voiced labiodental fricative]] before ''ǫ'':
:: ''ǫglь'' &gt; ''vǫglь'' &gt; ''węgiel'' ("coal")
* [[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]] (softening) of [[consonant]]s before front [[vowel]]s ''i'', ''ь'', ''e'', ''ę'', ''ě'':
:: ''sę'' &gt; {{IPA|/sʲã/}} &gt; ''się'' ({{IPA|/ɕɛ̃/~/ɕɛ/}}) (generic reflexive pronoun; self, oneself; myself, yourself, ourselves, yourselves, etc. also each other, one another)
:: ''bělъjь'' &gt; ''biały'' ("white")
* [[Apophony|Ablaut]] of vowels before hard (non-palatalized) [[alveolar]] consonants: ''e'' &gt; ''o'', ''ě'' &gt; ''a''
:: ''nesą'' &gt; ''niosę'' but ''nesešь'' &gt; ''niesiesz'' ("you carry")
:: ''bělъjь'' &gt; ''biały'' but ''bělitъ'' &gt; ''bieli'' ("whitens")
:* The traces of the transition of ''ě'' into ''a'' in verbs after ''j'', ''š'', ''ž'', ''č'' have disappeared
::: ''slyšatь'', ''slyšalъ'', ''slyšalь'' &gt; ''słyszeć'', ''słyszał'', ''słyszeli'' ("to hear, he heard, they heard"); compare [[Russian language|Russian]] слышать (''slyshat’'')
::: ''visětь'', ''visělъ'', ''visělь'' &gt; ''wisieć'', ''wisiał'', ''wisieli'' ("to hang, he hung, they hung")
::: The only remnants are ''stojatь'', ''bojatь'' ("to stand, to be afraid") &gt; ''stojać'', ''bojać'' in dialects of [[Greater Poland|Wielkopolska]] – ''stać'', ''bać'' in the dialect of [[Lesser Poland|Małopolska]] and in the [[literary language]]
* The disappearance of weak [[yer]]s and the change of strong [[yer]]s into {{IPA|/e/}}:
:: ''pьsъ'' &gt; ''pies'' ("dog ([[Nominative case|nom.]])") but ''pьsa'' &gt; ''psa'' ("dog ([[Genitive case|gen.]])")
:: ''sъnъ'' &gt; ''sen'' ("sleep (nom.)")
* Formation of long vowels as a result of:
:* contraction ([[synaeresis]]) of two [[syllable]]s into one (''ojo''-type groups), for example: ''nogojǫ'' &gt; {{IPA|/nɔɡãː/}} &gt; ''nogą'' ("leg ([[Instrumental case|inst.]])")
:* [[compensatory lengthening]] for the loss of yers
:* preservation of the old length of intonation ([[Proto-Slavic accent|from the neoacute accent]])
* Proto-Slavic ''ę'' and ''ǫ'' were merged (after ''ę'' had palatalized a previous consonant)
:* around the 11th century, there were 4 distinct nasal vowels {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ̃ː/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ̃ː/}}, as the long and short reflexes of ''ę'' and ''ǫ''
:* in the 12th century the pronunciation of ''ę'' and ''ǫ'' was lowered, eventually merging as {{IPA|/ã/}}
:* in the 13th and 14th century the only difference was in the [[vowel length]], hence the common symbol ''ø'' for all nasal vowels
* Then, after the nasal vowels had merged, the disappearance of long vowels:
:* the length of {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/ɨː/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}} disappeared without a trace in the early 16th century
:* the length of {{IPA|/aː/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}}, {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, {{IPA|/ãː/}} caused [[Relative articulation#Raised and lowered|raising]] (constriction) of these vowels in the early 16th century:
::* {{IPA|/ɔː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/o/}} &gt; {{IPA|/u/}}, written ''ó''
::* {{IPA|/ã/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}}, written ''ę'' (with loss of nasalization in some places); but {{IPA|/ãː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}}, written ''ą''
::* {{IPA|/aː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɑ/}} or {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, originally written ''á'' or ''å'', but eventually merged back to short {{IPA|/a/}} by the 18th century. However in many dialects it became {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (e.g. ''pon'' for standard ''pan'' "man")
::* {{IPA|/ɛː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} &gt; {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, written as ''é'' in the 19th century ("daléj, daléj/niech się na powietrzu spali" – Adam Mickiewicz's ''Forefathers' Eve''), but eventually it has merged with short {{IPA|/ɛ/}}
:::: ''nesǫtъ'' &gt; {{IPA|/nʲɔsãː/}} &gt; ''niosą'' ("they carry") but ''nesǫ'' &gt; {{IPA|/nʲɔsã/}} &gt; ''niosę'' ("I carry")
:::: ''bogъ'' &gt; {{IPA|/bɔːɡ/}} &gt; ''bóg'' ("god (nom.)") but ''boga'' &gt; {{IPA|/bɔɡa/}} &gt; ''boga'' ("god (gen.)")
:::: ''kurъ'' &gt; {{IPA|/kuːr/}} &gt; ''kur'' ("cockerel")
* Development of [[sonorant]]s from Proto-Slavic liquid diphthongs
:: X - any consonant
:: T - [[alveolar]]
:: Tʲ - palatalized alveolar (or [[palatoalveolar]])
:: P - [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[Velarized|labiovelar]]

== Changes in grammar ==

=== Declension ===

==== Nouns ====

The declension of nouns has become simpler.  Now it depends on the gender of a noun (smok, o smoku – foka, o foce) (''a dragon, about a dragon - a seal, about a seal'') and to some extent on the hardness of a noun's stem (liść, liście – list, listy) (''leaf - leaves, letter - letters'').  Two categories have appeared in the masculine gender: the category of animacy and of personhood (but, widzę but, widzę buty – kot, widzę kota, widzę koty – pilot, widzę pilota, widzę pilotów) (''a shoe, I see a shoe, I see shoes - a cat, I see a cat, I see cats - a pilot, I see a pilot, I see pilots'').

Traces of consonant stems still remain but almost exclusively in neuter noun stems ending in -en, -ent- (cielę – cielęcia, imię – imienia) (''a calf - of a calf, a name - of a name''). For all other stems, the long or short form has become characteristic of all cases. In general, in the past endings characteristic of stems ending in -o-, -jo- and -a-, -ja- were most common. Other endings were disappearing. The endings which did not cause the alteration of the stem were becoming more popular. Traces of the lack of softness in some forms of words softened by front vowels (mainly forms ending with a consonant or ending with -i-, e.g. krъvaxъ &gt; *krwach &gt; krwiach) have disappeared. Often softness is the only remnant of old noun endings (Gen. kamane &gt; kamienia) (''of stone'').

===== Singular =====

====== Nominative  ======https://web.archive.org/web/20120303214558/http://www.naszdziennik.pl/index.php?typ=kl&amp;dat=20090302&amp;id=kl12.txt
The disappearance of short forms of stems may be interpreted as the result of the introduction of the accusative noun form into the nominative.

: kamy &gt; *kamy &gt; kamień (kamenь) (''stone'')
:: kry &gt; *kry &gt; krew (por. krъvь) (''blood'')

For neuter nouns the ending -ьje sometimes produced a constricted -é (weselé) (''wedding''). Names of institutions such as podkomorzé, due to the influence of names such as łowczy (''hunting''), since the 16th century have been declined as adjectives: podkomorzy (''chamberlain'').

====== Genitive ======
The ending -y has come to be applied to all feminine nouns.

The ending -a has come to be applied to all neuter nouns and to the majority of masculine nouns. In the 16th century, the ending -å, in other words non-acute -a, was applied to neuter stems ending in -ьje: oká (''of an eye'') but wesela (of a wedding).

After a period of frequent changes (which still has not ended) the ending -u is still applied to some masculine non-personal nouns, but there is no major connection with the original form.

Until the 16th century, the ending -ej, used in the declension of pronouns, was applied to all nouns in the genitive and dative and to feminine nouns in the locative if a noun had an old stem ending in -ja-: paniej, rolej, duszej (lord, role, soul).

====== Dative ======
The ending -'e is still applied to feminine nouns with stems ending in -a-.

The ending -y is still applied to feminine soft-stem nouns. Occasionally, in the Old Polish ending -y was applied to neuter nouns with stems ending in a consonant: dziecięci, książęci (''child, prince'').

The ending -owi has come to be applied to almost all stems of masculine nouns.  Occasionally, it was applied to stems of neuter nouns.

The ending -ewi in the Old Polish was sometimes applied instead of the ending -owi to the soft-stem nouns and in the 15th and 16th century it was also applied to hard-stem nouns.

The ending -u has come to be applied to all stems of neuter nouns. It is still applied to some masculine noun forms ending in -o-, -jo-.  Until the 16th century it was used more frequently, especially following the preposition ''ku'' (człowieku (''human''), głosu (''voice''), ku południu (''towards the south'')).

====== Accusative ======
The accusative has remained the same as the nominative for all neuter nouns.

For masculine nouns, the accusative has remained the same as the nominative for inanimate nouns and for animate nouns it has become the same as the genitive.  The reason for this last change was most probably the free word order and the ambiguity that it could entail in phrases such as ''syn kocha ojciec'' (a son /nom./ loves a father /nom./) and ''ojciec kocha syn'' (a father /nom./ loves a son /nom./). The change of their forms into ''syn kocha ojca'' (son /nom./ loves father /acc./) and ''ojca kocha syn'' (father /acc./ loves son /nom./) helped to resolve this ambiguity. The accusative was the same as the nominative until the 14th - 15th century (in the region of Mazowsze until the 16th century), and nowadays this feature is preserved in common phrases such as ''iść za mąż'' (to get married), ''siąść na koń'' (to mount a horse), ''na miły Bóg'' (dear Lord!), ''być za pan brat'' (to be on intimate terms with sbd.).

The ending -0 is still applied to stems of feminine nouns for which this same ending is applied also in the nominative.

The ending -ę is still applied to the typically feminine nouns.

In Old Polish the ending -ą was applied instead of -ę to nouns which in the nominative ended with -å ''widzę duszę, boginię'' (I see a soul, a goddess) but ''wolą, pieczą'' (will, care).  Nowadays, the only remnant of this rule is the accusative form ''panią'' (lady).

====== Instrumental ======
The ending -ą is still applied to all stems of feminine nouns.

The ending -em has come to be applied to all stems of masculine and neuter nouns.  The development of -ъmь, -ьmь has contributed to the stabilization of the use of this ending.

The ending -im &lt; -ьjemь was applied to neuter nouns ending in the old -ьje: ''wiesielim, miłosierdzim'' (joy, mercy), ''wyobrażenim'' (imagination).

====== Locative ======
The ending -'e is applied to hard-stem nouns. Until 15th - 16th century it was also applied to masculine and feminine nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch: ''Bodze'' (god), ''gresze'' (sin), ''mlece'' (milk).  For noun stems ending in -n-: ''We dnie i w nocy'' (during the day and night), but in general: ''w dniu'' (during the day).

The ending -y has come to be applied to all feminine soft-stem nouns.  Until 14th - 15th century it was also applied to a very small number of stems ending in -jo-, especially i &lt; -ьji for neuter nouns ending in -ьje.

The ending -u has come to be applied to masculine and neuter hard-stem nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch.  It has also survived in forms ''o synu, domu'' (about a son, about a house) and is also present in the form ''o panu'' (due to the influence of the phrase ''w Panu Bogu'') (in the Lord God).

====== Vocative ======
The ending -'e (with -e, not -ě2, this is why there is the softening connected to the first palatalization) is applied to masculine hard-stem nouns.  Until the 16th century it was also applied to nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch. Nowadays it is present in forms such as ''Boże, człowiecze, Kozacze'' (also ''człowieku, Kozaku''), and also ''księże'', additionally after -ec: ''ojcze, starcze''(father, old man) (connected with the third palatalization).
https://web.archive.org/web/20120303214558/http://www.naszdziennik.pl/index.php?typ=kl&amp;dat=20090302&amp;id=kl12.txt
The ending -u has come to be applied to masculine soft-stem nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch and also feminine soft-stem nouns known as 'rodzinne' ('family nouns', used when addressing other family members) (''ciociu, Helu'') (auntie, Hela).  It has also survived in forms such as ''synu, domu''! (son, home!).

The ending -o has survived in the old feminine nouns ending in -a- and has also spread onto the majority of old feminine nouns ending in -ja-.

The ending -y is still applied to feminine nouns which stems in the nominative end with a consonant (''myszy, kości''!) (mice, bones!)  and has spread onto the nouns of the same type as ''pani'' (lady).

The forms of neuter nouns in the vocative have remained the same as their forms in the nominative.

===== Plural =====

====== Nominative ======
Until the 15th century the ending -i was the most widely applied ending to the stems of masculine nouns. From the 16th century onwards it was not applied to the stems of inanimate nouns, and from the 18th century – to the stems of nouns referring to non-persons.  Forms ''Włoszy, mniszy'' (Italians, monks) have been replaced by ''Włosi, mnisi'' with the phonetic softness introduced in the 17th century.

In the accusative -y was gradually replacing -i as the ending applied to the stems of masculine nouns.  Since the 16th century it was applied even to the stems of nouns referring to persons. It was popular especially in the Enlightenment (syny, wnuki, greki) (''sons, grandsons, Greeks'').  For feminine nouns it is still applied to the stems ending in -a- and also to some forms in the nominative singular ending in -0.

The ending -e, derived from the stems ending in -i- (gost-ьje, lud-ьje) (''guests, people''), -n- (dьn-e, kamen-e, mestjan-e) (''days, stones, townsmen'') and forms such as przyjaciele, cesarze (''friends, caesars''), have dominated soft-stem masculine nouns.  For feminine nouns it is still applied to the stems ending in -ja- and has spread onto some of the forms in the nominative singular ending in -0.

The ending -owie in the 14th - 15th century was applied to all stems of masculine nouns. Since the 16th century it has been gradually disappearing, especially from inanimate nouns and those referring to nonpersons, still [[Cyprian Norwid|Norwid]] (1821–1883) used obłokowie (''clouds'') to make up a rhyme.

In the Old Polish, soft-stem nouns sometimes had the ending -ewie applied instead of -owie.

The ending -a is still applied to the stems of neuter nouns. Due to the influence of the Latin language, it has been applied since the 15th century to the stems of male nouns borrowed from Latin and German: akta, fundamenta, grunta, (''files, foundations, grounds'') and temporarily (and incorrectly) also to originally Polish nouns: okręta, pociska (''ships, bullets'').  Nowadays, the ending -a applied to the stems of masculine nouns is in general considered as incorrect, however:  akta (''files'')||akty (''acts'').

The names of offices such as ''podkomorzé'' until the 15th century also had the ending -a applied in the plural.  In the 16th century forms ''chorążowie podczasze podchorąże ma pod sobą'' were widely used; nowadays in the nominative it is ''chorążowie'' (warrant officers), in the dative ''podchorążych'' (of cup bearers).

The ending -´a (-´å) &lt; -ьja today is used to construct forms such as brat – bracia  (''brother - brothers''), ksiądz – księża (''priest - priests'').  Initially, these forms were interpreted as collective nouns (bracia stała = braty stały) (''brothers stood''), księża poszła = księdzowie poszli (''priests went''), and were declined in the same way as female nouns (others of this type in the accusative had applied the ending -ą, in the genitive, dative and locative: -ej).  In the writings of [[Piotr Skarga|Skarga]] (1536–1612) they were declined in the same way as plural nouns (braciom, braćmi, braciach, księżom, księżmi, księżach) (''brothers, priests'').  In dialect forms such as swaciå, muzykanciå, adwokaciå (''matchmakers, musicians, lawyers'')can be found.

====== Genitive ======
The ending -0 has started to be widely applied to neuter and feminine hard-stem nouns. For soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied is -y. Until the 17th century, its traces were present in the old masculine stems ending in -o-, -jo-: genitive woz (''carriage''), god, tysiąc (''thousand''), dziej, włos (''hair''). Nowadays, it is present in forms such as przyjaciół (''friends''), dotychczas (''until now'').

The ending -ów has become characteristic of the masculine hard-stem nouns, for soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied is -y. In Old Polish it had a slightly different pronunciation and was more widely applied: pisarzow (''of writers''), koniow (''of horses''), dniow (''of days''), miesiącow (''of months''), in dialects: krolew (''of kings'').

For soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied instead of -ów/-0 is -y.

====== Dative ======
In the past, the ending -om has been widely applied to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns. Since the Middle Polish period it has started to be applied to the stems of feminine nouns.

In Old Polish -am prevailed as the ending applied to the stems of feminine nouns. In the 15th - 17th century it was applied also to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns.

The ending -em until the 17th century was sometimes applied instead of -om to the stems of masculine nouns. There are no traces of this ending being applied to the stems of neuter nouns.

The endings -um, -óm in Old Polish were sometimes applied to the stems of neuter nouns instead of -om.

====== Accusative ======
Initially, the endings -e/-y in the masculine accusative were distributed as endings applied to the stems of non-person nominative nouns. However, in the 17th century the accusative was made the same as the genitive. This change became common in the 17th century. Old accusative was and still is used for stylistic reasons: króle (''kings''), pany (''masters''), chłopy (''peasants'').

The forms of feminine and neuter nouns in the plural accusative have remained the same as in the plural nominative.

====== Instrumental ======
In the past, the ending -ami has been most widely applied to the stems of feminine nouns.  Since the 15th century it came to be applied to the stems of neuter nouns and in the 16th - 17th century, despite the resistance of grammarians, to the stems of masculine nouns.

The ending -mi was applied in Old Polish to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns, especially to soft-stem ones, and also to the stems of  some feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0.  In principle, today it is only applied to the stems of masculine and feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0 and having a phonetically soft-stem.

The ending -y was applied in Old Polish to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns, especially to hard-stem ones. Until now it has survived in phrases such as ''tymi czasy'' (these days).

The ending -oma, derived from the dual number, was applied to the stems of masculine nouns in the 16th - 17th century.

====== Locative ======
In the past, the ending -ach has been applied to feminine nouns. It could also be found in the masculine and neuter but came to be formally applied to nouns in these two genders in the 17th century.

The ending -'ech was applied in the Old Polish to masculine and neuter nouns, especially those with hard-stem: wilcech (''wolf''), syniech (''son''), skrzydlech (''wings''), leciech. The traces have remained in the names of countries: Na Węgrzech (''in Hungary'').

The ending -och was applied to nouns of all genders in the 14th - 16th century, especially to soft-stem nouns and also to those ending with -k, -g, -ch, most probably because of the influence of the endings such as -owie, -ów, -om.

====== Vocative ======
The plural vocative has remained the same as the nominative.

===== Mixed Declension  =====
The mixed declension is characteristic of forms such as poeta (''poet''), mężczyzna (''man''), Jagiełło, Fredro, sędzia (''judge'').

In Old Polish forms such as starosta (''prefect''), poeta (''poet'') were declined like feminine nouns. In the 16th century plural forms were changed due to their meaning (also plural dative such as ''mężczyznam'').
 
Until the 17th century, nouns such as Fredro in plural had forms ''Fredra, Fredrowi, Fredrę'' and so on.

In the 15th century nouns such as sędzia &lt; sądьja  (''judge'') were given in singular genitive, dative and accusative forms like adjectives. Later on, forms such as sędzim, sędziem (''judge'') appeared in the instrumental.  Sometimes the locative ''sędziej'' was also present.

==== Adjectives ====
The declension of adjectives as nouns has almost disappeared (exception: pełen) (''full'').

The adjectival declension in combination with the pronoun ''jь'' has given rise to a new type of declension combining the two: adjectival and pronoun declensions. It is different from the noun declension: jego, tego białego słonia (''his, of this white elephant'').

==== Pronouns with genders ====
The declension of hard-stem pronouns with genders has assimilated to the declension of soft-stem ones.

: těxъ &gt; *ciech &gt; tych jak ich (these as their)
: togo &gt; *togo &gt; tego jak jego (this as his)

Primarily, the singular feminine accusative ending was -ę.  The form ''ją'' (her) was the only exception. Due to the influence of adjectives the use of the form -ą came to be more widely applied. Nowadays, the only existing form is ''tę''. (In 1996 the accusative form ''tą'' was accepted as correct in the spoken language.)

==== Pronouns without gender ====
They have undergone just slight changes:

: azъ &gt; jazъ &gt; jaz &gt; ja (I)
: mene &gt; *mienie &gt; mnie (me)
: kogo &gt; kogo (without any major phonetic changes)
: čьso &gt; czso &gt; cso &gt; co (what)

The old genitive čьso was transferred to the accusative and has spread to be applied to the nominative.  The old accusative has preserved its prepositions: w niwecz &lt; vъ nivъčь, przecz &lt; prěčь, zacz &lt; začь.

==== Numerals ====
Ordinal, multiplicative and multiple numerals declined and still decline in the same way as adjectives so they will not be discussed here.

===== One =====
Numeral ''jedinъ'' has preserved the mixed pronoun-adjectival declension.

===== Two - four =====

===== Five - ten =====

===== One hundred =====
For the declension of numerals a new and quite irregular pattern has been constructed, based on the dual number.

===== Eleven - nineteen =====

===== Twenty - ninety, two hundred - nine hundred =====
Combinations of words have been turned into compounds.

===== Collective numerals =====
The forms of collective numerals have been blended ([[portmanteau]])

: masculine genitive dъvoj-a or dъvoj-ego &gt; dwoj(e)ga (two)

==== Dual number ====
Dual number has disappeared, only some endings have been preserved: oczy (eyes), uszy (ears), rękoma or rękami (with hands, both correct),  also in dialects and in proverbs: "mądrej głowie dość dwie słowie, lepszy wróbel w ręku niż gołąb na sęku". ("Two words are enough for a smart head, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush").

=== Conjugation ===
The distinction between stems of the present tense verbs and stems of the past tense verbs has been preserved.

==== Infinitive ====
The ending -i has disappeared (at first from endings *-cy &lt; -ci):

: by-ti &gt; *byci &gt; być (''to be'')
: nes-ti &gt; *nieści &gt; nieść (''to carry'')
: dvigną-ti &gt; *dźwignęci &gt; dźwignąć (to lift)

==== Present tense ====
It has undergone just slight changes:

: nes-ą &gt; niosę (''I am carrying'')
: rek-ą &gt; *rzekę &gt; rzeczę (I am saying), exception: tłukę (''I am smashing'')
: rec-i &gt; *rzec(y) &gt; rzeknij ? (you say), exception: tłucz (''you smash'')
: nes-e-mъ &gt; *niesiem &gt; niesiemy (''we are carrying'')

Many verbs have changed their present tense forms:

: żywię – żywiesz &gt; żyję – żyjesz (''I am alive / I live – you are alive / you live'')
: grzebę – grzebiesz &gt; grzebię – grzebiesz (''I am digging / I dig – you are digging / you dig'')
: kolę – kolesz &gt; kłuję – kłujesz (''I am stinging / I sting – you are stinging / you sting'')
: porzę – porzesz &gt; pruję – prujesz (''I am unstitching / I unstitch – you are unstitching / you unstitch'')
: rostę – rościesz &gt; rosnę – rośniesz (''I am growing / I grow – you are growing / you grow'')
: kradę – kradziesz &gt; kradnę – kradniesz (''I am stealing / I steal – you are stealing / you steal'')
: łupam – łupasz &gt; łupię – łupiesz (''I am splitting / I split – you are splitting / you split'')
: kłamam – kłamasz &gt; kłamię – kłamiesz (''I am lying / I lie – you are lying / you lie'')

Instead of -ętъ for athematic verbs or for verbs with stems ending in -i-, the form -jątъ is used:

: dus-ętъ &gt; *dusią(t) &gt; duszą (''they are strangling/they strangle'')
: dad-ętъ &gt; *dadzią(t) &gt; dadzą (''they will give'')

===== Conjugation ''-am,-asz'' =====
Based on the conjugation of athematic verbs, the new conjugation -am, -asz has been introduced (very rarely -em, -esz):

: gra-je-šь &gt; *gra-je-sz &gt; *gr-a:-sz &gt; grasz (''you play'')
: gra-je-tъ &gt; *gra-je-0 &gt; *gr-a:-0 &gt; gra (''he/she/it plays'')
: gra-je-mъ &gt; *gra-je-my &gt; *gr-a:-my &gt; gramy (''we play'')
: gra-je-te &gt; *gra-je-cie &gt; *gr-a:-cie &gt; gracie (''you-plural play'')

By analogy to ''dam'' (I will give) - ''dasz'' (''you will give''):

: gra-ją &gt; gra-j-ę (until 14th – 15th century) &gt; gram (''I play'')

in general (compare with dadzą) (''they will give''):

: gra-ją-tъ &gt; grają (''they play'')

==== Past tenses ====
Aorist - a past perfective tense, used to mark an action that happened only once and was fully accomplished in the past. Initially, it was used with both perfective and imperfective verbs. Out of the three types of aorist: asygmatic, sygmatic I and sygmatic II, only the sygmatic I was used in the Polish language. It was used with verbs which stems in the infinitive ended in a vowel.

Imperfect - was used to mark an action that took place or was repeated in the past. It was used with imperfective verbs.

[[Aorist]] and [[Imperfect]] merged and then disappeared. The ending characteristic of the aorist has remained present in some dialects: byłech, byłek (=byłem) (''I was'')

The past imperfective tense has become a past simple tense bylъ jes-mь &gt; byłem. (''I was'')

The [[pluperfect]] is currently disappearing.

==== Future tense ====
The present forms of perfective verbs have retained their future meaning.

The future tense of imperfective verbs is still constructed by combining a conjugated form of ''będę'' with an infinitive or a past participle: będę chwalić or będę chwalił. (''I will be praising'').

==== Conditional ====
The Protoslavic form of a conditional was replaced by the aorist (Old Polish ''bych''), which then underwent some changes due to the influence of past tense endings.

==== Participles ====

* The present tense active participle has come to be declined in the same way as adjectives. The present tense adverbial participle has also been introduced: gotujący, gotując (''cooking'').
* The traces of the present tense passive participle have remained in forms such as świadomy (''aware of''), rzekoma (''alleged'').
* The type I past tense active participle has remained in the form of the past tense adverbial participle: ugotowawszy (''having cooked''), kopnąwszy (''having kicked''), obdarłszy (''having stripped'').
* The type II past tense active participle has become the base for the construction of the past tense (gotowałem) (''I was cooking'') and also the future complex tense (będę gotował) (''I will be cooking''). It is still used with some intransitive verbs (zgniły, zmokły) (''rotten, soaked'').
* The past tense passive participle has remained animate: bity (''bitten''), poznana (''met''), wiedzione (''led'').

==== Dual number ====
Dual number survived until 14th - 15th century with some slight changes:

: first person -vě &gt; *-wie &gt; -wa (due to the influence of the first person masculine dual: dwa konja) (''two horses'').
: second person -ta &gt; -ta
: third person -te &gt; *-cie &gt; -ta (became the same as the second person to be differentiated from the second person plural)

In the 16th century dual number disappeared from the literary language. It has been preserved in a number of dialects but the meaning of words in the dual number is equal to their [[portmanteau|blending]] in plural. The first person ending -ma is sometimes used as a result of merging -wa with -my.

chodźwa, chodźma (=chodźmy) (''/we/let's go'').

Only in the region of Tarnobrzeg does the distinction still exist for niesiewa, nieśwa (dual number) and niesiemy, nieśmy (plural) (''we carry, let's carry'').

The '''history of the Arabs''' begins in the mid-ninth century BC, which is the earliest known attestation of the [[Old Arabic]] language. The Arabs appear to have been under the vassalage of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–612 BC), and the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] (626–539 BC), [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] (539–332 BC), [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;

Greenspahn |editor=Lindsay Jones|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|article=Ishmael|volume=7|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=|pages=4551–4552|quote=ISHMAEL, or, in Hebrew, Yishmaʿeʾl; eldest son of Abraham. Ishmael's mother was Hagar, an Egyptian slave girl whom Sarah gave to Abraham because of her own infertility; in accordance with Mesopotamian law, the offspring of such a union would be credited to Sarah (Gn. 16:2). The name Yishmaʿeʾl is known from various ancient Semitic cultures and means "God has hearkened," suggesting that a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise. Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen by Abraham and expelled with his mother at the instigation of Sarah, who wanted to ensure that Isaac would be Abraham's heir (Gn. 21). In the New Testament, Paul uses this incident to symbolize the relationship between Judaism, the older but now rejected tradition, and Christianity (Gal. 4:21–31). In the Genesis account, God blessed Ishmael, promising that he would be the founder of a great nation and a "wild ass of a man" always at odds with others (Gn. 16:12). He is credited with twelve sons, described as "princes according to their tribes" (Gn. 25:16), representing perhaps an ancient confederacy. The Ishmaelites, vagrant traders closely related to the Midianites, were apparently regarded as his descendants. The fact that Ishmael's wife and mother are both said to have been Egyptian suggests close ties between the Ishmaelites and Egypt. According to Genesis 25:17, Ishmael lived to the age of 137. Islamic tradition tends to ascribe a larger role to Ishmael than does the Bible. He is considered a prophet and, according to certain theologians, the offspring whom Abraham was commanded to sacrifice (although surah Judaism has generally regarded him as wicked, although repentance is also ascribed to him. According to some rabbinic traditions, his two wives were Aisha and Fatima, whose names are the same as those of Muhammad's wife and daughter Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples.

Surrounding it on land on every side were the two rival empires of Persia and Byzantium. The countries of what now make up the Arab world were divided between the two of them—Iraq under Persian rule, Syria, Palestine, and North Africa part of the Byzantine Empire. They spoke a variety of different languages and were for the most part Christians, with some Jewish minorities. Their Arabization and Islamization took place with the vast expansion of Islam in the decades and centuries following the death of the Prophet in 632 CE. The Aramaic language, once dominant in the Fertile Crescent, survives in only a few remote villages and in the rituals of the Eastern churches. Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy. Some earlier languages have survived, notably Kurdish in Southwest Asia and Berber in North Africa, but Arabic, in one form or another, has in effect become the language of everyday speech as well as of government, commerce, and culture in what has come to be known as “the Arab world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs forged the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] (632–661), [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (661–750) and the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] (750–1258) caliphates, whose borders reached southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Anatolia]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south.

==Antiquity==
{{Main article|Pre-Islamic Arabia}}
{{History of the Arab States}}
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to&amp;nbsp;[[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam. Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was [[Dilmun]], which arose around the 4th millennium BC and lasted to 538 BC, and [[Thamud]], which arose around the 1st millennium BC and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BC, [[South Arabia|Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean kingdom]], and the coastal areas of [[Eastern Arabia]] were controlled by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanians]] from 300 BC.

===Classical kingdoms===
{{main article|Palmyra|Nabataeans}}
[[File:Petra, Al-Khazneh 2.jpg|thumb| Façade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]].]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and [[Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]]&amp;nbsp;– Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 15.jpg|left|thumb|The ruins of Palmyra. The Palmyrenes were a mix of Arabs, [[Amorites]] and [[Arameans]].]]
Arabs arrived in the [[Palmyra]] in the late first millennium BC.{{sfn|Bryce|2014|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xno9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278 278]}} The soldiers of the [[sheikh]] Zabdibel, who aided the Seleucids in the battle of Raphia (217 BC), were described as Arabs; Zabdibel and his men were not actually identified as Palmyrenes in the texts, but the name "Zabdibel" is a Palmyrene name leading to the conclusion that the sheikh hailed from Palmyra.{{sfn|Bryce|2014|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xno9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA359 359]}} Palmyra was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] after its 634 capture by the Arab general [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], who took the city on his way to Damascus; an 18-day march by his [[Rashidun army|army]] through the Syrian Desert from Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Burns|2007|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=poCBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 99]}} By then Palmyra was limited to the Diocletian camp.{{sfn|Speake|1996|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;pg=PA568 568]}} After the conquest, the city became part of [[Jund Hims|Homs Province]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1890|p= 36}}

[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|Near East in 565, showing the Lakhmids and their neighbors.]]
The [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindites]] were the last major migration of pre-Islamic Arabs out of Yemen to the north. The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Byzantine province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], Palestine and East Jordan.
[[File:Roman Empire 125 political map.svg|thumb|left|The [[imperial province]] of [[Arabia Petraea]] in 117–138 CE.]]
Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen "[[Arabia Felix]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dionysius Periegetes|url=http://www.cartographic-images.net/Cartographic_Images/117_Dionysius_Periegetes.html|website=www.cartographic-images.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] ''[[Arabia Petraea]]'', after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].

The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]]. They ended up allying with the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] against the Ghassanids and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persian]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bailey [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-521-20092-X}} p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arabia from "Qaryah Dhat Kahl" (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw). They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, until they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]].

In 661, the Rashidun Caliphate fell into the hands of the [[Banu Umayya|Umayyad dynasty]] and [[Damascus]] was established as the empire's capital. The Umayyads were proud of their Arab identity and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[Raqqa]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.&lt;ref name="Lunde"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50–52 |location=New York |isbn=0-7894-8797-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect, as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Before the Arab conquest, North Africa was conquered or settled by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Romans. After the [[Abbasid Revolution]], the Umayyads lost most of their territories with the exception of Iberia. Their last holding became known as the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. It wasn't until the rule of the grandson of the founder of this new emirate that the state entered a new phase as the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]].  This new state was characterized by an expansion of trade, culture and knowledge, and saw the construction of masterpieces of [[al-Andalus]] architecture and the library of [[Al-Ḥakam II]] which housed over 400,000 volumes. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

The Abbasids were&amp;nbsp;the descendants of&amp;nbsp;[[Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same&amp;nbsp;[[Banu Hashim]]&amp;nbsp;clan. The Abbasids led a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all parts of the Empire with the exception of [[al-Andalus]]. In 762, the second Abbasid Caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded the city of [[Baghdad]] and declared it the capital of the Caliphate. Unlike the Umayyads, the Abbasids had the support of non-Arab subjects.&lt;ref name="Lunde" /&gt;

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city of [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as "The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs" stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the "[[House of Wisdom]]" ({{Lang-ar|بيت الحكمة}}) in Baghdad. Rival dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="Vartan"&gt;Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 {{ISBN|0-8157-3283-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation sent by [[Charlemagne]].]]
The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture in the 10th century; afterwards, in the 1190s, there was a revival of their power, which was ended by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], who [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|conquered Baghdad]] in 1258 and killed the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]]. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

===Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171)===
{{main article|Fatimid Caliphate}}

The Fatimid caliphate was founded by [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|al-Mahdi Billah]], a descendant of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad, in the early 10th century. Egypt was the political, cultural, and religious centre of the Fatimid empire. The Fatimid state took shape among the [[Kutama]] Berbers, in the West of the North African littoral, in Algeria, in 909 conquering [[Raqqada]], the [[Aghlabid]] capital. In 921 the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of [[Mahdia]] as their new capital. In 948 they shifted their capital to [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Al-Mansuriya]], near [[Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and in 969 they conquered Egypt and established [[Cairo]] as the capital of their caliphate.

Intellectual life in Egypt during the Fatimid period achieved great progress and activity, due to many scholars who lived in or came to Egypt, as well as the number of books available. Fatimid Caliphs gave prominent positions to scholars in their courts, encouraged students, and established libraries in their palaces, so that scholars might expand their knowledge and reap benefits from the work of their predecessors.&lt;ref name="imamreza.net"&gt;Shorter Shi'ite Encyclopaedia, By: Hasan al-Amin, http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]] and the [[Al-Azhar University]].

It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shias]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. According to some modern historians. their influx was a major factor in the arabization of the Maghreb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;pg=PA668&amp;lpg=PA668&amp;dq=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xJfyHTcsc_&amp;sig=jUAPDgpbO-pTex_sv26Cp-5Z9P4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiok7rbpP7VAhWo1IMKHQc1DWUQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=arabization%20tribes%20maghreb%20banu%20hilal&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135456702|location=|pages=668|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MVQlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dvwaIK4s6h&amp;sig=OiMRYpYeMc9RCmohlLsVrwEYPiY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiok7rbpP7VAhWo1IMKHQc1DWUQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=arabization%20tribes%20maghreb%20banu%20hilal&amp;f=false|title=Poems for the Millennium, Volume Four: The University of California Book of North African Literature|last=Joris|first=Pierre|last2=Tengour|first2=Habib|date=2012|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520269132|location=|pages=42|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.).

===Ottoman Empire (1299–1922/1923)===
{{Main article|Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate}}
[[File:030Arab.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Arab Army]] in the [[Arabian Desert]] carrying the [[Flag of the Arab Revolt]].]]
From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans defeated the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed [[al-Fatat]] ("the Young Arab Society"), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was "raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations." In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the [[Arab Congress of 1913]] in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.&lt;ref name="Choueiri166"&gt;Choueiri, pp.166–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.

==Modern period==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in Western Asia, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]].

'''Homeric scholarship''' is the study of any [[Homer]]ic topic, especially the two large surviving [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. It is currently part of the academic discipline of [[classical studies]]. The subject is one of the oldest in scholarship. For the purpose of the present article, Homeric scholarship is divided into three main phases: antiquity; the 18th and 19th centuries; and the 20th century and later.

==Ancient scholarship==

===Scholia===
[[File:Venice, Libreria Marciana.jpg|thumb|left|Library of St. Mark's, Venice, home of Venetus A.]]
[[Scholia]] are ancient commentaries, initially written in the margins of manuscripts, not necessarily at the bottom, as are their modern equivalents, the notes. The term [[marginalia]] includes them. Some are [[Interlinear gloss|interlinear]], written in very small characters. Over time the scholia were copied along with the work. When the copyist ran out of free text space, he listed them on separate pages or in separate works. Today’s equivalents are the chapter notes or the notes section at the end of the book. Notes are merely a continuation of the practice of creating or copying scholia in printed works, although the [[incunabula]], the first printed works, duplicated some scholia. The works of Homer have been heavily annotated from their written beginnings{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The total number of notes on manuscripts and printed editions of the Iliad and Odyssey are for practical purposes innumerable.

The number of manuscripts of the Iliad is currently (2014) approximately 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Limbaugh | title=Jesus on Trial: A Lawyer Affirms the Truth of the Gospel | location=New York | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=2014 | page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papyri of the Odyssey are less in number but are still in the order of dozens{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The inventory is incomplete, and new finds continue to be made{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, but not all these texts contain scholia. No [[compendium]] has collated all of the Homeric scholia.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Following the [[Principle of Economy]]: the allocation of scarce publication space to overwhelming numbers of scholia, the [[Anthology|compilers]] have had to make decisions about what is important enough to compile. Certain types, or lines, have been distinguished; scholia have lines of descent of their own. [[Eleanor Dickey]] summarizes the most important three, identified by letter as A, bT, and D.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|pp=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A, "the Venetian scholia",  are most of the scholia of [[Venetus A]], a major manuscript of the Iliad, dated to the 10th century, and located in the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] (Library of St. Mark’s) of [[Venice]]. The sources of the scholia are noted at the end of each book. There are basically four. The hypothetical original text of the scholia, a manuscript of the 4th century CE, is therefore called, in German, the ''Viermännerkommentar'' (VMK), "four-man commentary", where the men are [[Aristonicus of Alexandria|Aristonicus]], [[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]],  [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]], and [[Nicanor Stigmatias|Nicanor]]. Their comments, and these scholia, are termed [[Critical thinking|"critical"]]. A-scholia are found in other manuscripts as well. Venetus A contains some bT scholia.

bT scholia came from two sources: the 11th century T, the "Townleian" scholia, so designated because the manuscript, Townleyanus, was once in the collection of [[Charles Townley|Lord Townley]], and a lost manuscript, b, of the 6th century, which has descendants, including Venetus B. The bT manuscripts descend from an earlier c. bT scholia are termed [[Exegesis|exegetical]], as opposed to critical. They are from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus]], with some from Didymus.

The D scholia, or scholia Didymi, named erroneously for Didymus, are the earliest and largest group. They occur primarily in the 9th century Z (Rome, [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma|Biblioteca Nazionale]]), and the 11th century Q, but also in some others, such as A and T. The D scholia were once thought to be the work of the 1st century BCE scholar Didymus; they are now known to go back to 5th and 4th century BC school manuscripts, pre-dating the Alexandrine tradition, and representing “the oldest surviving stratum of Homeric scholarship.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also called the scholia minora and the scholia vulgata, the former name referring to the short length of many. These are glossaries. Among the non-minor scholia are mythological (allegorical) [[Etiology|aetia]], plots, and paraphrases, explaining the meanings of obscure words.

The order of precedence and chronological order of these Iliad scholia is D, A, bT, and other. Material in them probably ranges from the 5th century BCE (the D scholia) to as late as the 7th or 8th century CE (the latest bT scholia). The same scheme applies to the Odyssey, except that A scholia, mainly of the Iliad, are in deficit. There are no printed works publishing all the scholia on the Iliad and Odyssey. Only partial publications according to various principles have been possible.

The first was that of [[Janus Lascaris]] in 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Joannes Andreas |  last=Lascaris | year=1517 | title=Scholia palaia ton pany dokimoneis ten Homerou Iliada  | language=Greek | location=Roma | publisher=in domo [[Angelo Colocci|Angeli Colotii]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqVCDGO4ljwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Vale&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contained D-scholia of Porphyry. Some subsequent works concentrate on manuscripts or parts of them, others on type of scholia, and still others on books of the Iliad, or source. Larger compendia are relatively recent. One that has already become a standard is the 7-volume compendium of A- and bT-scholia by [[Hartmut Erbse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hartmut | last=Erbse | authorlink=Hartmut Erbse | title=Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem | series=Scholia Vetera | location=Berlin | publisher=de Gruyter | year=1969{{ndash}}1988 | language=Greek, Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volumes 1{{ndash}}5 are reserved for a number of books of the Iliad each, amounting to some 3000 pages, approximately. The last two volumes are indices. And yet, Dickey says of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “The seven volumes of Erbse’s edition thus represent only a small fraction of all the preserved scholia …,” from which it can be seen that the opinions, elucidations and emendations to the Iliad and Odyssey in manuscript texts far outweigh those texts in numbers of pages.

===Classical scholarship===
By the [[Classical Greece|Classical Period]] the [[Homeric Question]] had advanced to the point of trying to determine what works were attributable to [[Homer]]. The [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]] were beyond question. They were considered to have been written by [[Homer]]. The D-scholia suggest that they were taught in the schools; however, the language was no longer self-evident. The extensive glossaries of the D-scholia were intended to bridge the gap between the spoken language and [[Homeric Greek]].

The poems themselves contradicted the general belief in the existence and authorship of Homer. There were many variants, which there should not have been according to the single-author conviction. The simplest answer was to decide which of the variants was most likely to represent a presumed authentic original composition and to discount the others as spurious, devised by someone else.

====Peisistratean edition====
[[File:Fragment of freize sic of the Parthenon in Acropolis museum.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the [[Parthenon Frieze]], depicting the [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic Festival]]. [[Elgin Marbles|Elgin marble]], located in the [[British Museum]].]]
[[Strabo]] reports an account by Hereas accusing [[Peisistratos]], tyrant of Athens, r. 561-527 BCE, or [[Solon]] (638-558 BCE), sometime eponymous archon and lawgiver, starting 594 BCE, of altering the Iliad’s [[Catalogue of Ships]] to place the 12 ships from [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in the Athenian camp, proving that Athens owned Salamis in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo IX.394.10 concerning B558, mentioned in {{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others denied the theory, Strabo said. The story implies that Peisistratos or Solon had some authority over a presumed master text of the Iliad, and yet Athens at the time had little political power over the Aegean region. Strabo was not the only accuser. [[Plutarch]] also accuses him of moving a line from [[Hesiod]] to λ630 (Odyssey Book 11).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diogenes Laertius]] relates that in the time of Solon the Iliad was being “rhapsodized” (''rhapsodeisthai'') in public recitations. One of Solon’s laws mandates that, in such performances, one rhapsode was to pick up where the previous left off.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, Book I, Paragraph 57 (Life of Solon). D.L. gives the source as Dieuchidas. Mentioned in {{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of a state official in these rhapsodizations can be explained by their being performances at state-sponsored sacred festivals.

[[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;’’De Oratore’’ III.137&lt;/ref&gt; says that previously the books of Homer were “confused” (''confusos''), but that Peisistratos  “disposed” (''disposuisse'') them as they were then. A scholion on Iliad, Book K, in manuscript T, says that they were “arranged” (''tetachthai'') by Peisistratos into one poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the impromptu composition of shorter poems on a known theme was forced into a continuous presentation by Solon, and edited by Peisistratos.

A number of other fragments testify to a written edition by Peisistratos, some credible, some not. A few mention the establishment of a Peisistratean school. In others, [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)]] published the edition and passed a law that it must be read at the [[Panathenaic Games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p-505}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in 566 BCE, before the tyranny of his father, from 561 BCE. Peisistratos was succeeded by his sons in 527 BCE.

====Ionicization of the text====
The linguist, [[August Fick]], hypothesized a “metamorphosis of the originally Achaean Iliad into its present Ionic form.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jevons|1886|p=295}} He refers to Fick, ‘’Homerische Ilias’’, Göttingen, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; By Achaean he meant [[Aeolic Greek]], and by Ionic form, [[Ionic Greek]]. He based his theory on the partial substitution of Ionic words for Aeolic ones; i.e., where the Ionic forms fit the meter, which was [[Dactylic hexameter]], they replaced the Aeolic, but where they did not, the Aeolic was left intact. For example, Atreidēs, “sons of Atreus,” the [[nominative case]], is Ionic, but the [[Genitive case|genitive plural]] is Atreidaōn, an Aeolic form, instead of the Ionic Atreideōn, which does not fit the meter.

Fick uses the device to date the transformation.  Old Ionic lēos, “people,”  is used in post-Homeric lyric poetry, but the Iliad uses lāos,  an Aeolic form. Lēos was displaced by Ionic leōs after [[Hipponax]], c. 540 BCE. Lēos and lāos have the same meter, long and short (or two longs before a word beginning with a consonant), but leōs is short, long. In Fick’s view, lāos was left to prevent change to leōs. The opposition, therefore, dates to after 540 BCE, corresponding to the period of the Peisistratean edition. This coincidence suggests that the modern Iliad, which descends from a text the Alexandrian scholars called “the Vulgate,” is linked to the Peisistratean edition. Proving it, however, is another issue.

====Search for the classical vulgate====
Between the hypothetical Peisistratean edition and the Vulgate [[recension]] of the Alexandrines is a historical gap. Fick’s work indicates a connection, which also is suggested by the peripatetic associations of the Library of Alexandria (below). Moreover, some of the D-scholia redated to the 5th century BCE indicate that some sort of standard Iliad existed then, to be taught in the schools. These broad events are circumstantial evidence only. Nagy says,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; “As of this writing, Homeric scholarship has not yet succeeded in achieving a definitive edition of either the Iliad or the Odyssey.”

He quotes the view given by [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]], first publisher (1788) of the scholia on [[Venetus A]], that Peisistratus, in the absence of a written copy, had given a reward for verses of Homer, inviting spurious verses. There had been, in other words, a master copy, but  it had been lost. Not having a theory of oral transmission, Villoison regarded the poems as “extinct.” The problem then became to distinguish which of the purchased verses were spurious.

The opposite view, expressed by [[Friedrich August Wolf]] in ‘’Prolegomena ad Homerum’’, 1795, is that Homer never wrote the Iliad. The variant manuscripts seen by the Alexandrines were not corruptions, but rhapsodic variants, as is attested by [[Flavius Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]''. He said that the poetry of Homer was “preserved by memory … and assembled … later from the songs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link missing from the evidence, apart from the circumstantial, is the connection between the texts produced by Peisistratus and the Alexandrine Vulgate. What is lacking is either an “Athenian prototype,”,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a conjectural “Wolfian vulgate,” or multi-text assembled from oral variants wrongly marked as spurious by the Alexandrines.

The Homeric classicists of the 19th century believed they had inferred a ''Voralexandrinsche Vulgata'', “Pre-Alexandrine Vulgate,” to use the expression of Arthur Ludwich. This was a hypothetical 4th- and 5th-century BCE version of the Alexandrine Vulgate. The latter had to have had precedents. The problem was to prove it.

Ludwich assembled a list of all the lines put forward as quotations from Homer in pre-Alexandrine authors: some 29 authors plus some unknown fragments, amounting to about 480 ''verse'', or “lines.”&lt;ref name=ludwich138-140&gt;{{cite book | title=Die Homervulgata als voralexandrinisch erwiesen | first=Arthur | last=Ludwich | location=Leipzig | publisher=B.G.

Monro used this database to compare the percentage of non-Vulgate lines in the quotes with a control group, the  non-Vulgate lines in the fragments of the papyri known to him then.&lt;ref name=monro426-430&gt;{{cite book | title=Homer's Odyssey, Books 13-24 | first=David Binning | last=Monro | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1901 | pages=426–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging from the fragments, 60 of the 480 lines ought to be missing from the Vulgate. The number is only 12, from which Monro concludes: “The quotations, in short, prove that there was a pre-Alexandrian vulgate agreeing much more closely with the modern vulgate than with any text of which the papyrus fragments can be specimens.”

According to Monro,&lt;ref name=monro426-430/&gt; based on Ludwich,&lt;ref name=ludwich138-140/&gt; [[Plato]] is the most prolific quoter of Homer, with 209 lines. Next most is Aristotle, with 93 lines. Of the 209, only two differ from the Vulgate, in Iliad Book IV, which Ludwich termed ''Kontaminiert'', “corrupted.” Several were marked as spurious (Ludwich’s ''aufser'') by the Alexandrians. There was only one instance of four lines not in the Vulgate (Ludwich’s ''Zusatzversen''), From Iliad IV. Monro asserts “… whatever interpolated texts of Homer were then current, the copy from which Plato quoted was not one of them.” Aristotle’s quotations do not have the same purity, which is surprising. For about 20 years they were at the same school, the [[Platonic Academy]].

The Platonic view of Homer is exceptional for the times. Homer and Hesiod were considered to have written myths as allegory. According to J.A. Stewart, "… Homer is an [[Inspired Teacher]], and must not be banished from the curriculum. If we get beneath the literal meaning, we find him teaching the highest truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.A. | last=Stewart | authorlink=John Alexander Stewart (philosopher) | title=The Myths of Plato | year=1905 | location=London; New York | publisher=Macmillan | page=231 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Homer+Plato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zKGFVILpJYmVNsrDg4AH&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Homer%20Plato&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', however, Plato denies that children can distinguish literal and allegorical truth and advocates censoring the myth-makers, including Homer. The ''Republic'' expresses a concept of a society established according to the Platonic ideal, in which every aspect is monitored and controlled under the guidance of a philosopher-king drafted from ascetic poverty for the purpose. It was not a popular view.

====Peripatetic connection====
[[File:Athens Lyceum Archaeological Site 2.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the Lyceum in Athens.]]
The archetype of Hellenistic libraries was that of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] in classical Athens. Its founder, [[Aristotle]], had been a student, and then an associate, at [[Plato]]’s [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. He was Plato’s star student, but as a [[metic]], or resident foreigner (he was still Greek), he could not own property or sponsor the other metics. Consequently, after the death of Plato, not having been appointed director, he departed Athens for an educational opportunity in [[Mysia]], which fell through when Mysia was captured by the Persians. He was subsequently hired by his boyhood companion, now [[Philip II of Macedon]], to tutor the latter’s teen-age son, the future [[Alexander the Great]], on whose behalf he built a school, the Nymphaeum, at [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]].

Alexander became an enthusiastic member of Aristotle’s inner circle. Immediate association was terminated within a few years when Alexander assumed the duties of monarch after the assassination of his father in 336/335. His main duty was to lead a planned invasion of the east to settle the rivalry with Persia. During it he kept by his bedside a manuscript of Homer personally emended by Aristotle, a gift of the latter. He later placed it in an expensive casket captured from the Persian king, Darius, from which it was called "the Casket Homer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=E. Cobham | last=Brewer | title=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | year=1898 | website=Bartleby.com | url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/3118.html}}. The story comes from Plutarch’s ''Life of Alexander''.&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote, if true, reveals a belief by Aristotle’s circle in an authentic text, as well as editorial activity to recapture it. Alexander was a Homer enthusiast.

Aristotle’s approach to Homer and statesmanship was different from Plato's. Politics and Poetry were two of his research topics. His theoretical treatise, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' is not a presentation, like Plato’s, of an ideal state according to some philosophy, but is a presentation and classification of real states as they were then, discovered by research. Similarly, Homer does not play a role in any censorial evaluation of Aristotle as a critic, but appears in a professional study of poetry, the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paragraphs 461a, b, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the difficulty with some of his language. Aristotle’s main study of Homer did not survive. It is listed in [[Diogenes Laertius]]' ''Life of Aristotle'' as "Six books of Homeric problems".

Of the 93 quotations, Mitchell Carroll says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mitchell | last=Carroll | title= Aristotle's Poetics, C. XXV: In the Light of the Homeric Scholia | year=1896 | publisher=John Murphy and Company | location=Baltimore | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Aristotle’s hearty veneration for Homer is shown by the numerous citations of the Iliad and the Odyssey in his works, and by the frequent expressions of admiration occurring in the ''Poetics''; ….” , Despite this enthusiasm, Monro notes that the “poetical quotations are especially incorrect,”&lt;ref name=monro426-430/&gt; with regard to the errors and additional lines. This is not the expected result if Aristotle had received the pure edition from which Plato had quoted. Monro’s solution is to adopt the view of Adolph Römer, that the errors can be attributed to Aristotle personally, and not to variant manuscripts. This was obviously not history’s final verdict.

===Hellenistic scholars and their aims===
Many ancient Greek writers discussed topics and problems in the Homeric epics, but the development of scholarship ''per se'' revolved around three goals:

# Analyzing internal inconsistencies within the epics;
# Producing editions of the epics' authentic text, free of interpolations and errors;
# Interpretation: both explaining archaic words, and exegetical interpretation of the epics as literature.

The first philosopher to focus intensively on the intellectual problems surrounding the Homeric epics was [[Zoilus]] of Amphipolis in the early 4th century BCE. His work ''Homeric Questions'' does not survive, but it seems that Zoilus enumerated and discussed inconsistencies of plot in Homer. Examples of this are numerous: for example, in ''Iliad'' 5.576-9 [[Menelaus]] kills a minor character, Pylaemenes, in combat; but later, at 13.758-9, he is still alive to witness the death of his son Harpalion. These have been humorously described as points where Homer "nodded off," from which comes the [[proverbial phrase]] "[[Continuity (fiction)#Homeric Nod|Homeric Nod]]." [[Aristotle]]'s ''Homeric Problems'', which does not survive, was probably a response to Zoilus.

Critical editions of Homer discuss three special steps in this process. First is the hypothetical "Peisistratean recension". There is a long-standing, but somewhat old-fashioned, tradition in modern scholarship which holds that in the mid-6th century BCE the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]] had the Homeric epics compiled in a definitive edition. It is known that under Peisistratus, and later, [[rhapsode]]s competed in performing Homer at the [[Panathenaia|Panathenaic festival]]; and a scholion on ''Iliad'' 10.1 accuses Peisistratus of inserting book 10 into the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. T on ''Il''. 10.1: "They say that this episode was composed by Homer privately, and not to be part of the ''Iliad''; but that it was inserted into the poem by Peisistratus." Book 10, often known as the ''Doloneia'', is still the most widely rejected part of the Homeric epics.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is little evidence for a Peisistratean recension, and most present-day scholars doubt its existence; at the very least it is disputed what is to be understood by the term "recension".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. G. Nagy (1996), ''Poetry as Performance'' (Cambridge), pp. 115-27 on the meaning of the Greek words for "edition", {{lang|grc|ἔκδοσις}} and διόρθωσις.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third key moments are the critical editions made by the 3rd and 2nd century BCE [[Alexandria]]n scholars [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchus]] respectively; both of these scholars also published numerous other works on Homer and other poets, none of which survive. Zenodotus' edition may well have been the first to divide the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' into 24 books.

Aristarchus' edition is probably the single most important moment in the whole history of Homeric scholarship. His text was more conservative than Zenodotus', but it became the standard edition of Homer for the ancient world, and almost everything in modern editions of Homer passed through Aristarchus' hands. Like Zenodotus, Aristarchus did not delete passages that he rejected, but (fortunately for us) preserved them with an annotation indicating his rejection. He developed Zenodotus' already sophisticated system of critical symbols to indicate specific kinds of issues with particular lines, and a significant proportion of the terminology is still in use today ([[obelus]], [[wikt:athetize|athetising]], etc.). From the scholia a great deal is known about his guiding principles, and those of other editors and commentators such as Zenodotus and [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]]. The chief preoccupations of the Alexandrian scholars may be summarised as follows:

# Consistency of content: the reasoning is that internal inconsistencies imply that the text has been ineptly changed. This principle apparently pursues the work of Zoilus.
# Consistency of style: anything that appears only once in Homer &amp;mdash; an unusual poetic image, an unusual word (a ''[[hapax legomenon]]''), or an unusual epithet (e.g. the epithet "Kyllenian Hermes" in ''Odyssey'' 24.1) &amp;mdash; tends to be rejected.
# No repetitions: if a line or passage is repeated word-for-word, one of the exemplars is often rejected. Zenodotus is known to have applied this principle rigidly, Aristarchus less so; it is in tension with the principle of "consistency of style" above.
# Quality: Homer was regarded as the greatest of poets, so anything perceived to be poor poetry was rejected.
# Logic: something that makes no sense (such as [[Achilleus]] nodding at his comrades as he goes running after Hektor) was not regarded as the product of the original artist.
# Morality: [[Plato]]'s insistence that a poet should be moral was taken to heart by Alexandrian scholars, and scholia accuse many passages and phrases of being "unsuitable" ({{lang|grc|οὐ πρέπον}} ''ou prepon''); the real Homer, goes the reasoning, being a paragon of perfection, would never have written anything immoral himself.
# Explaining Homer from Homer ({{lang|grc|Ὅμηρον ἐξ Ὁμήρου σαφηνίζειν}}): this motto is Aristarchus', and means simply that it is better to solve a problem in Homer using evidence from within Homer, rather than external evidence.

To a modern eye it is evident that these principles should be applied at most on an ''ad hoc'' basis. When they are applied across the board the results are frequently bizarre, especially as no account whatsoever is taken of [[poetic licence]]. However, it should be remembered that the reasoning seems persuasive when built up gradually, and then it is a very difficult mindset to escape: 19th century Analyst scholars (see below) adopted most of these criteria, and applied them even more stringently than the Alexandrians did.

It is also sometimes difficult to know what exactly the Alexandrians meant when they rejected a passage. The scholia on ''Odyssey'' 23.296 tell us that Aristarchus and Aristophanes regarded that line as the end of the epic (even though that is grammatically impossible); but we are also told that Aristarchus separately rejected several passages after that point.

===Allegorical readings===
Exegesis is also represented in the scholia. When the scholiasts turn to interpretation they tend to be most interested in explaining background material, e.g., reporting an obscure myth to which Homer alludes; but there was also a fashion for allegory, especially among the [[Stoics]]. The most notable passage is a scholion on ''Iliad'' 20.67, which gives an extended allegorical interpretation of the battle of the gods, explaining each god as symbolic of various elements and principles in conflict with one another, e.g., [[Apollo]] is opposed to [[Poseidon]] because fire is opposed to water.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Allegory is also represented in some surviving ancient monographs: the ''Homeric Allegories'' by an otherwise unknown 1st century BCE writer [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus]], the 2nd century CE [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Life and Poetry of Homer'', and the works of the 3rd century CE [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], particularly his ''On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey'' and ''Homeric Questions''. Many extracts from Porphyry are preserved in the scholia, especially the D scholia (although the current standard edition, that of [[Hartmut Erbse|Erbse]], omits them).

Allegorical interpretation continued to be influential on [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars such as [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]] and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]]. But allegorising non-allegorical literature has not been a fashionable activity since the [[Middle Ages]]; it is common to see modern scholars refer to such allegorising in the scholia as "inferior" or even "contemptible".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. McLeod 1971, review of Erbse, ''Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem'' vol. 1, in ''Phoenix'' 25.4: 373.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these texts are now rarely read.

==18th and 19th centuries==
{{main article|Homeric question}}

The 18th century saw major developments in Homeric scholarship, and also saw the opening phase of the discussion which was to dominate the 19th century (and, for some scholars, the 20th): the so-called "[[Homeric question]]". Homer was first seen as the product of his primitive time by the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]], in ''An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer'' (1735).

Another major development was the enormous growth of linguistic study on Homer and the [[Homeric dialect]]. In 1732, [[Richard Bentley|Bentley]] published his discovery of the traces left in the text of Homer by the [[digamma]], an archaic Greek consonant that was omitted in later, classical, Greek [[orthography]]. Bentley showed conclusively that the vast majority of metrical anomalies in Homeric verse could be attributed to the presence of digamma (though the idea was not well received at the time: [[Alexander Pope]], for one, satirised Bentley). Important linguistic studies continued throughout the next two centuries alongside the endless arguments over the Homeric question, and the work by figures such as [[Philipp Karl Buttmann|Buttmann]] and [[David Binning Monro|Monro]] is still worth reading today; and it was the linguistic work of [[Milman Parry|Parry]] that set in motion a major paradigm shift in the mid-20th century. Another major 18th century development was [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]]'s 1788 publication of the A and B scholia on the ''Iliad''.

The Homeric question is essentially the question of the identity of the poet(s) of the Homeric epics, and the nature of the relationship between "Homer" and the epics. In the 19th century it came to be the fulcrum between two opposed schools of thought, the ''Analysts'' and the ''Unitarians''. The issue came about in the context of 18th-century interest in popular lays and folktale, and the growing recognition that the Homeric epics must have been transmitted orally before being written down, possibly much later than "Homer" himself. The Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] argued that the epics were the products not of an individual genius poet but rather the cultural products of an entire people; and [[Robert Wood (engraver)|Wood]]’s 1769 ''Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer'' argued emphatically that Homer had been illiterate and the epics had been transmitted orally. (Less fortunately, Wood drew parallels between Homer and the poetry of the supposed [[Scotland|Scottish]] oral poet [[Ossian]], published by [[James Macpherson]] in 1765; Ossian turned out later to have been wholly invented by Macpherson.)

The scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] brought matters to a head. His review of Villoison's edition of the scholia acknowledged that they proved conclusively the oral transmission of the poems. In 1795, he published his ''[[Prolegomena ad Homerum]],'' in which he argued that the poems were composed in the mid-10th century BCE; that they were transmitted orally; that they changed considerably after that time in the hands of bards performing them orally and editors adapting written versions to contemporary tastes; and that the poems' apparent artistic unity came about after their transcription. Wolf posed the perplexing question of what it would mean to restore the poems to their original, pristine, form.

In the wake of Wolf, two schools of thought coalesced to oppose one another: Analysts and Unitarians.

===Analysts===
19th-century Analysts argued that the epics were composed by many hands, a hodge-podge of interpolations and incompetent editing that concealed the original genius of Homer, or at the very least that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were composed by different poets. In this they followed in the steps of ancient scholars like Zoilos and the so-called "separatists" (χωρίζοντες ''chōrizontes'', the best known of whom, Xenon and Hellanicus, are nonetheless very obscure figures).

Among Analysts, [[Gottfried Hermann|Hermann]]'s 1832 ''De interpolationibus Homeri'' ("On interpolations in Homer") and 1840 ''De iteratis apud Homerum'' ("On repetitions in Homer") argued that the epics, as they now stood, were encrustations of second-rate later material around a pristine kernel: a hypothetical "Ur-''Iliad''". Conversely, [[Karl Lachmann|Lachmann]]'s 1847 ''Betrachtungen über Homers Ilias'' ("Studies on Homer's Iliad") argued that the ''Iliad'' was a compilation of 18 independent folk-lays, rather as the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' actually was, compiled in the 1820s and 1830s by [[Elias Lönnrot|Lönnrot]]: so, he argued, ''Iliad'' book 1 consists of a lay on Achilleus' anger (lines 1-347), and two continuations, the return of Chryseis (430–492) and the scenes in Olympus (348-429, 493-611); book 2 is a separate lay, but containing several interpolations such as Odysseus' speech (278–332); and so on. (Lachmann also tried to apply Analyst principles to the mediaeval German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.) [[Johann Wilhelm Adolf Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]]'s 1859 edition of the ''Odyssey'' argued that the Ur-''Odyssey'' had comprised just books 1, 5-9, and parts of 10-12, that a later phase had added most of books 13-23, and a third phase had added the bits about Telemachos, and book 24.

The climax of Analysis came with [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|Wilamowitz]], who published ''Homerische Untersuchungen'' ("Homeric studies") in 1884 and ''Die Heimkehr des Odysseus'' ("The homecoming of Odysseus") in 1927. The ''Odyssey'', he argued, was compiled about 650 BCE or later from three separate poems by a ''Bearbeiter'' (editor). Subsequent Analysts often referred to the hypothesised ''Bearbeiter'' as the "B-poet" (and the original genius, Homer himself, was sometimes the "A-poet"). Wilamowitz' examination of the relationship between these three layers of the ''Odyssey'', further complicated by later, minor, interpolations, is enormously detailed and complex. One of the three poems, the "old ''Odyssey''" (most of books 5-14 and 17-19) had in turn been compiled by a ''Redaktor'' from three even earlier poems, two of which had originally been parts of longer poems. Like most other scholars caught up in the opposition between Analysis and Unitarianism, Wilamowitz equated poetry that he thought poor with late interpolations. But Wilamowitz set such a high standard in the sophistication of his analysis that 20th century Analysts seem to have found difficulty in moving forward from where Wilamowitz left off; and over the course of the following decades attention drifted away, particularly in the English-speaking world.

===Unitarians===
[[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch|Nitzsch]] was the earliest scholar to oppose Wolf and argue that the two Homeric epics showed an artistic unity and intention that was the work of a single mind. Nitzsch's writings cover the years 1828 to 1862. In his ''Meletemata'' (1830) he took up the question of written versus unwritten literature, on which Wolf's whole argument had turned; and in his 1852 ''Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen'' ("The oral poetry of the Greeks") he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems and their relation to other, non-extant, epics which narrated the story of the [[Trojan War]], the so-called ''[[Epic Cycle]].''

However, most Unitarian scholarship tended to be driven by literary interpretation and was therefore often more ephemeral. Even so, many scholars who examined the archaeology and social history of Homeric Greece did so from a Unitarian perspective, perhaps out of a wish to avoid the complexities of Analysis and Analysts' tendency to re-write each other's work indefinitely. [[Benedictus Niese|Niese]]'s 1873 ''Der homerische Schiffskatalog als historische Quelle betrachtet'' ("The Homeric catalogue of ships studied as a historical source") stands out. [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]], who began excavating [[Hisarlik]] in the 1870s, treated Homer as a historical source from an essentially Unitarian viewpoint.

===Common ground between Analysts and Unitarians===
Broadly speaking, Analysts tended to study the epics philologically, bringing to bear criteria, linguistic and otherwise, that were little different from those of the ancient Alexandrians. Unitarians tended to be literary critics who were more interested in appreciating the artistry of the poems than in analysing them.

But artistic merit was the unspoken motivation behind both schools of thought. Homer must at all costs be hallowed as the great, original, genius; everything good in the epics is to be attributed to him. So Analysts hunted for errors (as Zoilus had done), and blamed them on incompetent editors; Unitarians tried to explain errors away, sometimes even claiming they were really the best bits.

In both cases, therefore, there came to be a very strong tendency to equate good with authentic, and shoddy with interpolated. This, too, was a mindset inherited from the Alexandrians.

==20th century==
20th century Homeric scholarship had the shadow of Analysis and Unitarianism hanging over it, and much important work was done by old-style Analysts and Unitarians even up to the end of the century. Perhaps the most important Unitarian in the first half of the century was [[Samuel E. Bassett]]; and, as in the 19th century, some interpretive work argued for Unitarianism (e.g. [[George E. Dimock]]'s 1989 ''The Unity of the Odyssey''), while other literary criticism merely took a Unitarian perspective for granted. Some of the most important work on textual criticism and [[papyrology]] was done by Analyst scholars such as [[Reinhold Merkelbach]] and [[Denys L. Page]] (whose 1955 ''The Homeric Odyssey'' is a merciless but sometimes hilariously witty polemic against Unitarians). The biggest commentary on the ''Odyssey'', published in the 1980s under the general editorship of [[Alfred Heubeck]], is largely Analyst in tone, especially the commentary on books 21-22 by [[Manuel Fernández-Galiano]]. Some monographs from a strongly Analyst perspective continue to come out, primarily from the German-speaking world.

However, the most important new work on Homer done in the 20th century was dominated by two new schools of thought, most frequently referred to as "Oral Theory" (the term is resisted by some Oralists, especially [[Gregory Nagy]]); and "Neoanalysis". Unlike in the 19th century, however, these schools of thought are not opposed to one another; and in the last few decades they have been drawing on each other more and more in very constructive ways.

===Oral Theory===
Oral Theory, or Oralism, is a loosely used term for the study of the mechanisms of how the Homeric epics were orally transmitted, in terms of linguistics, cultural conditions, and literary genre. It therefore embraces philological analysis and literary criticism simultaneously. It has its origins in linguistics, but it was foreshadowed in some respects by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] in the 18th century, and more immediately by [[Gilbert Murray]]. Murray was an Analyst, but his 1907 book ''The Rise of the Greek Epic'' contained some of the core ideas of Oralism: particularly the idea that the epics were the end result of a protracted process of evolution, and the idea that an individual poet named Homer had relatively little importance in their history.

The two figures at the head of Oralism are [[Milman Parry]] and his student [[Albert Lord]], who continued his work after Parry's premature death. Parry was a [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] linguist (he studied under [[Antoine Meillet]], who in turn studied under [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]) who set out to compare Homeric epic with a living oral tradition of epic poetry. In the 1930s and 1950s he and Lord recorded thousands of hours of oral performance of epic poetry in the former [[Yugoslavia]], primarily in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. Lord's later work (his 1960 book ''The Singer of Tales'' is the most pertinent to Homer) kick-started oral poetics as an entire new sub-discipline in anthropology. For Homeric scholarship the most important results of their work, and that of later Oralists, have been to demonstrate that:

# Homeric epic shares many stylistic characteristics with known oral traditions;
# thanks to the sophistication and mnemonic power of the [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|formulaic system in Homeric poetry]], it is entirely possible for epics as large as the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' to have been created in an oral tradition;&lt;ref&gt;Parry aimed to prove this by asking [[Avdo Međedović]], an illiterate singer who worked in the oral tradition, to create a poem of Iliadic length; the result was Avdo's three-day performance, recorded by phonograph, of a version of the well-known theme ''The Wedding of Smailagić Meho''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# many curious features that offended the ancient Alexandrians and the Analysts are most probably symptomatic of the poems' evolution through oral transmission and, within limits, poets re-inventing them in performance (some have compared this to improvisation, rather as jazz musicians improvise upon a theme).

The biggest complete commentary on the ''Iliad'', 1993's six volume ''The Iliad: A Commentary'' as edited by [[G.S. Kirk]], is Oralist in its approach and emphasizes issues related to live performance such as rhythm; and the pedagogical commentaries by [[Peter Jones (classicist)|Peter Jones]] are heavily Oralist.

Some Oralists do not go so far as to claim that the Homeric epics actually are products of an oral epic tradition: many limit themselves to claiming that the Homeric epics merely draw on earlier oral epic. For much of the mid-20th century much of the resistance to Oral Theory came from scholars who could not see how to preserve Homer as the great original poet: they could not see how there was any room for artistry and creativity in a formulaic system where set-piece episodes ([[Walter Arend]]'s "[[type scene]]s") were as formulaic as Parry's metrical epithet-noun combinations. Some scholars divided Oralists into "hard Parryists", who believed that all aspects of Homeric epic were predetermined by formulaic systems, and "soft Parryists", who believed that Homer had the system at his command rather than the other way round. More recently, books such as Nagy's influential 1979 book about epic heroes, ''The Best of the Achaeans'', and [[Egbert Bakker]]'s 1997 linguistic study ''Poetry as Speech'', work on the principle that the radical cross-fertilisation and resonances between different traditions, genres, plot lines, episodes, and type scenes, are actually the driving force behind much of the artistic innovation in Homeric epic.

Where the joke about 19th century Analysts had it that the epics "were not composed by Homer but by someone else of the same name", now the joke is that Oral Theorists claim the epics are poems without an author. Many Oralists would happily agree with this.

===Neoanalysis===
Neoanalysis is quite separate from 19th century Analysis. It is the study of the relationship between the two Homeric epics and the ''[[Epic Cycle]]'': the extent to which Homer made use of earlier poetic material about the Trojan War, and the extent to which other epic poets made use of Homer. The main obstacle to this line of research &amp;ndash; and, simultaneously, the main impetus for it &amp;ndash; is the fact that the Cyclic epics do not survive except in summaries and isolated fragments. [[Ioannis Kakridis]] is usually regarded as the founding figure of this school of thought, with his 1949 book ''Homeric Researches'', but [[Wolfgang Kullmann]]'s 1960 ''Die Quellen der Ilias'' ("The sources of the ''Iliad''") is even more influential. Neoanalytic topics have become much more prominent in English-language scholarship since 1990, notably in a series of articles by [[M. L. West]] in ''Classical Quarterly'' and in [[Jonathan Burgess]]' 2001 book ''The Tradition of the Trojan War in Homer and the Epic Cycle''. The recent upsurge is due in no small part to the publication of three new editions of the fragmentary Greek epics, including a translation by West for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] series.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bernabé 1987, ''Poeticae Epici Graeci Testimonia et Fragmenta'' (vol. 1) (Leipzig); M. Davies 1988, ''Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta'' (Göttingen); M.L. West 2003, ''Greek Epic Fragments'' (Cambridge, MA).&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most frequently cited and characteristic topic raised in Neoanalysis is the so-called "Memnon theory" outlined by [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]] in a 1951 paper. This is the hypothesis that one major plot-line in the ''Iliad'' is based on a similar one in one of the Cyclic epics, the [[Aithiopis]] of [[Arctinus]]. The parallels run as follows:

| An enraged Achilleus pursues Memnon to the gates of Troy, where he kills him
| An enraged Achilleus pursues Hector to the gates of Troy, chases Hector around the city walls, and kills him
|-
| Achilleus is in turn killed there by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]

|}

What is debated in the Memnon theory is the implications of these similarities. The most immediate implication is that the poet of the ''Iliad'' borrowed material from the ''Aethiopis''. The debatable points are the poet's reasons for doing so; the status and condition of the ''Aethiopis'' story when this borrowing took place, that is to say whether it was Arctinus' epic that Homer borrowed from, or something less concrete, like a traditional legend; and the extent to which the ''Aethiopis'' and ''Iliad'' played off one another in their subsequent development.

==Recent developments==
The dating of the Homeric epics continues to be a controversial topic. The most influential work in this area in the last few decades is that of [[Richard Janko]], whose 1982 study ''Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns'' uses statistics based on a range of dialectal pointers to argue that the text of both epics became fixed in the latter half of the 8th century, though he has since argued for an even earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol3no3/janko.html R. Janko 1996, "The performance of Homeric epic", ''Didaskalia'' 3.3].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no shortage of alternative datings, however, based on other kinds of evidence (literary, philological, archaeological, and artistic), ranging from the 9th century to as late as 550 BCE (Nagy suggests in a 1992 paper that the text's "formative" period lasted until 550). At present most Homeric scholars opt for the late 8th or early 7th century, and a date of 730 BCE is often quoted for the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin L. West in his 2010 commentary on the ''Iliad'' (and in earlier scholarly writings) argues for a dating of the poem in the period 680-650 BC, based in part on apparent references to works of other poems, e.g. [[Hesiod]] and [[Tyrtaeus]], and in part on artistic and other comparative evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Homeric interpretation has been increasingly influenced by [[literary theory]], especially in literary readings of the ''Odyssey''. [[Post-structuralism|Post-structuralist]] [[Semiotics|semiotic]] approaches have been represented in the work of [[Pietro Pucci]] (''Odysseus Polytropos'', 1987) and [[Marylin Katz]] (''Penelope's Renown'', 1991), for example.

Perhaps the most significant developments have been in [[narratology]], the study of how storytelling works, since this combines empirical linguistic study with literary criticism. [[Irene de Jong]]'s 1987 ''Narrators and Focalizers: The Presentation of the Story in the Iliad'' draws on the work of the theorist [[Mieke Bal]], and de Jong followed this up in 2001 with her ''Narratological Commentary on the Odyssey''; Bakker has published several linguistic-narratological studies, especially his 1997 ''Poetry as Speech''; and [[Elizabeth Minchin]]'s 2001 ''Homer and the Resources of Memory'' draws on several forms of narratology and cognitive science, such as the [[script theory]] developed in the 1970s by [[Roger Schank]] and [[Robert Abelson]].

'''Hulas''', located in the [[Saharanpur]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], is a late [[Indus Valley Civilization]] archeological site.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=upinder+singh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oX_tT-OZIMHPrQfrzei9DQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hulas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
Hulas is one of the 70 odd sites belonging to Chalcolithic Culture Phase in [[Doab]] which are located mostly along the higher banks of  tributaries of [[Yamuna]], namely, [[Hindon River]], [[Krishni]], [[Kathanala]] and [[Maskara]].&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; Most of these settlements are small, the largest one measuring 200x200 m, and three of these sites are excavated (Hulas, [[Alamgirpur]] and [[Bargaon]]). Occupation of this late [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] site goes back to 2000 BC and it seems it continued up to 1000 BC. 
&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt;

==Excavation==
{{Empty section|date=July 2012}}

==Architecture==
Rectangular mud structures with rammed floors, post-holes and hearths were identified in the earliest phase. In the Middle phase, clusters of two or three circular storage bin–type structures were found inside some of rectangular mud houses. Five round furnaces were found in some of the structures belonging to final phase.&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt;

==Artefacts found==
Hand made and wheel made pottery with geometric or naturalistic designs painted in black, chert blades, bone points etc.
&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; Terrecotta inscribed sealing was also recovered from Hulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=1.Lal,2.guptha|first=1.Braj Basi,2.Swarajya Prakash|title=Frontiers of the Indus Civilisation|year=1984|publisher=Books &amp; Books for ASI|location=University of Michigan|isbn=9780856722318|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEAbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=hulas+indus&amp;dq=hulas+indus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2cvtT8q1G463rAfGkMS-DQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural activity==
Horse gram, Cow pea (which is of African origin), [[walnut]]s, oats, lintel, pea, chickpea,  [[Eleusine coracana|ragi]], rice (both wild and cultivated variety) were grown at Hulas. Fruits of pipal tree (ficus religiosa) were also recovered from this site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=The Ancient Indus Valley : New Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781576079072|pages=110–114, 121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;dq=the+Ancient+Indus+civilisation&amp;q=hulas#v=snippet&amp;q=hulas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25268">'''Jean Alexandre Vaillant''' (1804 - 21 March 1886) was a French and [[Romania]]n teacher, political activist, historian, linguist and translator, who was noted for his activities in [[Wallachia]] and his support for the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Wallachian Revolution]]. A [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], he was an associate of the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal faction]] in both Wallachia and [[Moldavia]], as well as a collaborator of [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], [[Ion Câmpineanu]], [[Mitică Filipescu]], and [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]].

A [[tutor]] and later teacher at the [[Saint Sava College|Saint Sava School]] in [[Bucharest]] during the 1830s, he rose suspicions for his involvement in [[Conspiracy (political)|political conspiracies]] and was ultimately banned from Wallachia. Vaillant advocated the unification of the [[Danubian Principalities]] and other [[Romanians|Romanian]]-inhabited areas, an ideal he notably expressed in his 1844 work ''La Roumanie''. Credited with having publicized the Romanian cause in his native country during the 1850s, and with having introduced the modern references to "Romania" in international discourse, he briefly returned to Bucharest and was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] by the new Romanian state in 1864. The state of the [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma community]] was another one of Vaillant's interests, and the practice of [[Slavery in Romania|Roma slavery]] led him to express support for [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] goals.

==Career==

===Private tutor===
[[File:Stavropoleos Preziosi.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Stavropoleos Church in an 1868 watercolor by [[Amedeo Preziosi]]]]
Vaillant arrived in Bucharest on November 4, 1829, being first employed as a French language tutor by the [[Ban (title)|Great Ban]] George Iordachi, a member of the [[Filipescu family]] of [[boyar]]s.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.14"&gt;Ursu, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Joining a sizable community of French and other European expatriates,&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.274; Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet...''&lt;/ref&gt; he was, according to historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], "the only one [of them] whose literary activity was able serve the ''[[rapprochement]]'' between distant France and this [[Italic peoples|Latin]] country on the [[Danube]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet...''&lt;/ref&gt;

He terminated his contract in spring of the following year, and decided to open of school for boys aged 12 to 15; the initiative was publicized by Heliade Rădulescu's magazine ''[[Curierul Românesc]]''.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.14"/&gt; Vaillant's school was located in buildings owned by ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]'' Popa, in the vicinity of [[Stavropoleos Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.211; Ursu, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the similar activities of Félix Colson (who was tutoring young members of the [[Văcărescu family]]), and those of the Moldavian-based Cuénim and the ''[[abbé]]'' Lhommé,&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p.211"&gt;Djuvara, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; this brought an important step in the [[Westernization]] of Romanian society, while contributing to enforcing admiration for France among young boyars.&lt;ref&gt;Drace-Francis, p.105; Djuvara, p.211; Giurescu, p.274&lt;/ref&gt; It also signified a breaking point with education in [[Greek language|Greek]], which had been the norm before and during the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] age (ever since the 17th century initiatives of [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Matei Basarab]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.211-212&lt;/ref&gt; The memoirist [[Ion Ghica]] later noted that, among Vaillant's pupils, were scions of the Filipescu family, as well as those of the [[Grădişteanu family|Grădişteanus]], [[Bălăceanu family|Bălăceanus]], [[Rosetti family|Rosettis]], [[Golescu family|Golescus]] and his own family (the [[Ghica family|Ghicas]]).&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p.211"/&gt; Another of his pupils was the future [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] politician and historian [[Nicolae Bălcescu]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Vaillant was also a teacher at a school for girls, which functioned without [[tuition]].&lt;ref&gt;Drace-Francis, p.104; Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet...''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Sava professor===
In 1832, he was appointed French-language teacher and head of the [[boarding house]] at the prestigious [[Saint Sava College|Saint Sava School]],&lt;ref&gt;Drace-Francis, p.104; Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet...''; Polet, p.953; Ursu, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; which he had been commissioned to [[Modernization|modernize]].&lt;ref name="Polet, p.953"&gt;Polet, p.953&lt;/ref&gt; This came upon the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829]], when [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] troops had taken over administration of Wallachia, without removing it from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] tutelage. Vaillant was able to persuade the new authorities after authoring a poem in honor of Governor [[Pavel Kiselyov]].&lt;ref name="Drace-Francis, p.104"&gt;Drace-Francis, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

The high standards he endorsed earned him even more popularity, as well as a salary worth twice that of local staff.&lt;ref name="Drace-Francis, p.104"/&gt; Nevertheless, his contract was terminated in 1833 or 1834. The reason for this is unclear: some sources have attributed it to Vaillant's advocacy of nationalist tenets in front of his students, which reportedly rose suspicions from Russia, who was overseeing administration of the country under the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime;&lt;ref name="Polet, p.953"/&gt; others still indicate that he was involved in a conflict with [[Inspector]] [[Petrache Poenaru]] (in turn, this clash was attributed to Valliant's activities as [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] or to him having continued to teach privately, thus competing with his state employers).&lt;ref name="Drace-Francis, p.104"/&gt;

Vaillant also published a concise textbook of [[Romanian language]] and [[Romanian grammar|grammar]] (1836), intended as a learning instrument for French people (''Grammaire valaque à l'usage des français'').&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.14"/&gt; It featured a [[glossary]], as well as a historical overview and translations of poems (notably, [[Vasile Cârlova]]'s ''Ruinurile Târgoviştii'' and Heliade Rădulescu's ''Visul'').&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.14"/&gt; In the preface to this work, Vaillant stressed the [[Latin]] origin of the Romanian language (in relation to other [[Romance languages]]), and, elaborating, argued that "Wallachian is nothing less than a [[Romanian dialects|dialect]] of the ''Roumannesque'' language, a name which in itself serves to indicate its descent".&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.14"/&gt;

===Conspiracies and return to Paris===
By the late 1830s, Jean Alexandre Vaillant became involved with the liberal trend in opposition to the ''Regulamentul Organic'' regime, engaging in conflict with Prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]]. As such, he first associated with [[Ion Câmpineanu]], who stood out in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Wallachian Assembly]] in opposition to Ghica's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet...''; Ursu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iorga, he was also sympathetic to the cause of other [[Balkans|Balkan]] peoples in their conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]] (including the rebellious activities of [[National awakening of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] activists in [[Brăila]] and the plans devised by the former [[List of Serbian monarchs|Prince]] of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia|Miloš Obrenović]], who was residing in Bucharest at the time).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

By that time, he was a noted figure in [[Freemasonry in Romania|Wallachian Freemasonry]], which reportedly owed inspiration to a conspiratorial system first applied by the [[Filiki Eteria]] during the early stages of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence War]]; other people involved in this subversive movement were, among others, Câmpineanu, Heliade Rădulescu, [[Mitică Filipescu]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Eftimie Murgu]].&lt;ref name="Lăzărescu"&gt;Lăzărescu&lt;/ref&gt; After Câmpineanu was defeated, Vaillant rallied with a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] formed around Filipescu; on November 18, 1840, as authorities clamped down on Filipescu's movement, he fled Bucharest, heading for the Moldavian capital of [[Iaşi]].&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"&gt;Ursu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iorga, Vaillant's involvement with the revolutionary milieu, and especially with Filipescu and Heliade Rădulescu, had made him the object of suspicion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was in Iaşi that he became an associate of Kogălniceanu, after taking an interest in Moldavian [[chronicle]]s which the latter was reviewing and publishing;&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; later, it was proposed that Vaillant's 1844 volume, ''La Roumanie'', featured sections of text actually contributed by the Moldavian writer.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; On June 19, 1841, the Wallachian Assembly voted to expel him indefinitely from the country for his role in Filipescu's revolutionary attempt.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt;

Vaillant returned to Paris, where he continued publicizing his arguments in favor of Wallachian and Moldavian causes.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; On August 2, 1844, he spoke in front of the ''[[Société Orientale]]'', of which he had been made a member, protesting against [[censorship]] imposed by Russia in the [[Danubian Principalities]] (he expanded on this perspective in ''La Roumanie'').&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; At the time, he became close to [[Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys]], President of the ''Société Orientale'', whose support for the cause of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] he consequently enlisted.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; He also contacted the poet [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], who, in 1846, became head of ''Societatea Studenţilor Români'' (the Society of Romanian Students).&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt;

Vaillant continued to publish various works by Romanian writers, this time in the ''[[Revue de l'Orient]]'' &amp;mdash; among its contributors were [[Vasile Alecsandri]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Cezar Bolliac]], Kogălniceanu, and [[Costache Negruzzi]] (the latter notably sent his novella ''[[Alexandru Lăpuşneanu (novella)|Alexandru Lăpuşneanu]]'').&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; He would later publish a volume grouping several of Bolliac's works.&lt;ref name="Polet, p.953"/&gt; Vaillant also welcomed Romanian students into any of three Parisian [[Masonic Lodge|Lodges]] he had helped create: ''La Loge du Parfait Silence'' ("The Lodge of Perfect Silence"), ''La Loge de la Bonne Amitié'' ("The Lodge of Good Friendship"), and ''La Loge de l'Athénée des Étrangers'' ("The Lodge of the Atheneum of Foreigners").&lt;ref name="Lăzărescu"/&gt;

===Later activism and naturalization===
After 1848, when the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution]] ended in occupation by Ottoman and Russian troops, and until the [[Crimean War]], Vaillant continued to print [[pamphlet]]s supporting the Romanian cause.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848...''; Ursu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As Russian troops retreated, to be replaced by a provisional [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] administration, in turn superseded by a [[protectorate]] of powers (including the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]]), he issued text supporting a Moldo-Wallachian union and emphasizing the two countries' autonomy in respect to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; In 1857, he authored an appeal to [[Alexandre Joseph Count Colonna-Walewski|Duke Colonna-Walewski]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Minister]], in which he called for "France's sympathies" in respect to "the Moldo-Wallachians", based on "their magnificent past and the hope of their future".&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; At the time, he made several references to Romania as ''la langue d'or'' ("the golden language"), a name notably featured in the title of a [[Romanian literature]] collection he printed in 1851.&lt;ref name="Polet, p.953"/&gt; Vaillant also wrote pieces criticizing Moldavian [[Separatism|separatists]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The union he supported was accomplished in 1859, through the election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as ruler of both countries. Three years later, Vaillant was back in [[Bucharest]] for a few months, giving free lectures on [[ancient history]].&lt;ref&gt;Polet, p.953; Ursu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] Romanian in 1864, at the same time as his compatriots and fellow pro-Romanian activists [[Paul Bataillard]] and [[Jean Henri Abdolonyme Ubicini]].&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; In addition, ''[[Domnitor]]'' Cuza awarded him a [[pension]] worth 4,000 [[French franc]]s.&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt;

Jean Alexandre Vaillant died in Paris 22 years later, and was buried with full honors at the expense of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; The [[Romanian Ambassadors to France|Romanian Legation]], headed by its secretary [[George Bengescu (diplomat)|George Bengescu]], and other members of the Romanian community in the city accompanied the [[hearse]].&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt; Bengescu spoke at the ceremony, referring to Vaillant as "a brother", he noted that he had been one of "the courageous and enthusiastic pioneers of the Romanian people's political and national regeneration".&lt;ref name="Ursu, p.15"/&gt;

===''La Roumanie''===
[[File:Vaillant - La Roumanie.JPG|thumb|230px|Front page of ''La Roumanie'', 1844]]
Vaillant's 1844 ''La Roumanie'' (in its long version, the title was given as ''La Roumanie, ou Histoire, langue, littérature, orogrphie, statistique des peuples de la langue d'or, Ardialiens, Vallaques et Moldaves, résumés sur le nom de Romans'') was notably reviewed by [[Nicolae Iorga]] in his 1918 essay on French-Romanian relations). He noted that Vaillant extended the scope of his researches into [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] out of Wallachia and Moldavia, and into [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Transylvania]]: "He preoccupied himself [...], for the first time, with the Romanians in Transylvania, [a region] which he named, taking in view the national [Romanian] term serving to designate this enslaved land, ''Ardeal'' (''Ardial''), whence ''Ardialiens'' (in Romanian: ''Ardeleni'')".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Iorga also concluded that Vaillant was among the first persons to use the terms "Romania" and "Romanian" in the modern sense, after they had been in circulation for some time as designations of Wallachia and its citizens (commonly known in Romanian as ''Ţara Românească'', the latter principality had, Iorga contended, come to adopt the term ''România'' as self-reference by the time Vaillant was writing his essay).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The names were subsequently adopted by [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and other Romanian revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The French versions of the names "Romania" and "Romanians", in the form supported by Vaillant, were to be ''Romanie'' and ''roma[i]n'', both alluding to [[Ancient Rome]] &amp;mdash; these were not received as [[neologism]]s, and the enduring names in became ''Roumanie'' and ''roumain'', probably based on the Romanian folk references to ''rumân''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''La Roumanie'' provided a detailed account of the region's history, highlighting Vaillant's arguments in various controversial aspects. It began with an account of [[Dacia]] and [[Roman Dacia]], which detailed the impact of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], as well as the eventual retreat of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] administration to the south of the [[Danube]] under [[Aurelian]] by 270.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Commenting at length on the [[origin of the Romanians]], he stressed that the Roman colonists had stayed behind during the [[Migration Period]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Arguing that these had come from a ''[[latifundia]]''-dominated [[Italian Peninsula]] to Dacia "as if to an [[El Dorado]]", he elaborated that it was impossible for them to have forsaken their property and become [[nomad]]s (as suggested by various other historians).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Vaillant notably drew comparisons with the end of [[French colonial empires|colonial rule]] over [[New France]], as well as with [[Early Modern Romania|Early Modern Romanian history]] (noting that, during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish Wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]] and related incursions, while the [[boyar]]s and other notabilities took refuge in various regions, "the [[Proletariat|proletarians]] did not follow suit").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Thus, he claimed, when Transylvania was taken over by the [[Hungarians]] in the 9th century, Romanians were the main presence in the area; he believed that the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] name for Transylvania, ''Erdély'', was borrowed from Romanian, and had its origins in the Latin name ''[[Jupiter]]'' (''see [[Historical names of Transylvania]]'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Vaillant also supported the view that Walachia had been established by Romanian Transylvanians who wanted to preserve their [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] faith in front of Roman Catholic pressures stemming in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] &amp;mdash; Iorga disagreed with this thesis, stressing his own (according to which Wallachia was created through the union of several local polities).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Vaillant gave a summary of subsequent developments in [[History of Transylvania|Transylvanian history]], making references to the [[Budai Nagy Antal Revolt]], to the careers of [[John Hunyadi]], his son [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]], and [[Nicolaus Olahus]] (viewing all three as Romanians, he erroneously argued that John was a native of [[Oltenia]]), and to the Transylvanian conquests of the [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Petru Rareş]] (who, he believed, had been assigned the [[List of rulers of Transylvania|Transylvanian throne]] by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The account he gave of [[Michael the Brave]]'s rule, during which Wallachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia were first gathered under one rule, was to inspire his pupil [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] (who was to author an entire volume on this period, titled ''Românii supt Mihai-Voievod Viteazul'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He attributed Michael's expedition in Transylvania to him having "seen his brothers treated like [[Serfdom|serfs]] by the Magyar conquerors and the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] foreigners", and deplored his "cowardly assassination" on the orders of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] general [[Giorgio Basta]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He notably attributed the policy failures of Wallachian Prince [[Radu Şerban]] to Imperial opposition, claiming that he could have otherwise reestablished Michael's domain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In reference to the 18th and early 19th centuries, Vaillant mentioned in passing the start of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule in Transylvania, the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] conversions among Romanians in exchange for the unfulfilled promise of [[political rights]], and the interest [[Moise Nicoară]] had taken in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Quoting [[George Bariţ]], a major figure of the [[Transylvanian School]], he noted that most Transylvanians were Romanian (1.2 million, as opposed to the 900,000 members of all other ethnicities), and recounted his own dissemination of unification ideals among Transylvanian expatriates in Wallachia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Sclavi Tiganesti.jpg|thumb|250px|1852 poster advertising the sale of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] slaves in [[Bucharest]]]]
In addition to these tenets, ''La Roumanie'' provided details on the [[history of Bucharest]] during the 1830s, including the number and type of [[wagon]]s and [[carriage]]s (70 [[hansom cab]]s, 1,775 [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaetons]] and 7,502 wagons),&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; and that of inns and hotels (he calculated that there were 20 of each).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.314&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Roma slavery===
Vaillant also authored a work on the history of the [[Romani people]], to whom he referred as ''Romes'' or "the actual ''[[Bohemianism|Bohémiens]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848...''; Polet, p.953; Pons, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Centered on the [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma community in Wallachia and Moldavia]], the work was an investigation of [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]], to which Roma people were subjected in both lands. Making reference to the ''[[corvée]]s'' required from peasants, Vaillant stressed: "if the peasant is a [[Serfdom|serf]], the Gypsy is entirely a slave", while noting the prevalence of slavery among in Romanian society, the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] included ("the state sells them, the private entrepreneurs buy them, and the [[monk]]s also sit around with their palms exposed").&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

He noted that the institution relied on Roma settlement, indicating that most members of the ethnic group had abandoned their semi-nomadic lifestyle, commenting that the remaining few "do not pay taxes, but neither are they worth more than the wolves in the forest to their country".&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on the status of slaves involved in manual labor, he provided an indignant account of the way in which they were chained.&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillant's [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] views were probably an influence on his students, and arguably contributed to the proclamation ending slavery that was issued during the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4381">'''Jean Sirmond''' (1589, [[Riom]], [[France]] - 1649, [[Riom]], [[France]]) was a neo-Latin poet and French man of letters, historiographer of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].

==Biography==
Sirmond is known especially for his lifelong feud with [[Mathieu de Morgues]], known as the son of Saint-Germain, who favored [[Marie de Médicis]] and was against [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Jean Sirmond answers it with a series of small works which he writes under various pseudonyms, such as Julius Pomponius Dolabella, the faithful French or Sieur of the Mountains.

{{cquote|He is nephew of [[Jacques Sirmond|P. Sirmond Jésuite]], Confessor of [[King Louis XIII]], &amp; one of the wiser men of our century. He came to the Court, &amp; by the favour of the Cardinal of Richelieu, which he estimated one of the best writers then, he was made Historiographer of the King...&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Pellisson]], ''Histoire de l'Académie françoise'', volume I, p. 279 (1653)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the time of his stay in [[Paris]], Sirmond collaborated in the drafting of the statutes of the l'[[Académie française]], of which he became one of the first members in 1634. He also authored a ''Life of the Cardinal of Amboise'', published in 1631, and wrote Latin poems, published posthumously in 1653. After the death of the king and the cardinal, he withdrew to his native [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], finding himself without support after having fought so much.

[[Paul Pellisson]] paid Sirmond a personal homage, which also constitutes a testimony on the evolution of the [[French language]], which some said was now sufficiently "reasonable" to be worthy to replace Latin and the Greek as the erudite and literary language of the day. Pellison writes:

{{cquote|J'ajoûterai ici par une espèce de reconnaissance, qu'un de ses ouvrages est une des premières choses, qui m'ont donné goût pour notre Langue. J'étois fraîchement sorti du Collège : on me présentoit je ne sais combien de Romans, &amp; d'autres pièces nouvelles, dont tout jeune, &amp; tout enfant que j'étois, je ne laissois pas de me mocquer, revenant toûjours à mon [[Cicero|Cicéron]], &amp; à mon [[Terence|Térence]], que je trouvois bien plus raisonnables. Enfin, il me tomba presque en même temps quatre livres [de Jean Sirmond] entre les mains [...]. Dès-lors, je commençai non-seulement à ne plus mépriser la Langue Françoise ; mais encore à l'aimer passionnément, à l'étudier avec quelque soin, &amp; à croire, comme je fais encore aujourd'hui, qu'avec du génie, du temps, &amp; du travail, on pouvoit la rendre capable de toutes choses.&lt;ref&gt;''Op. cit.'', p. 281-82&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Laotian Civil War''' (1959–75) was fought between the Communist [[Pathet Lao]] (including many [[North Vietnam]]ese of [[Lao people|Lao]] ancestry) and the [[Royal Lao Government]], with both sides receiving heavy external support in a [[proxy war]] between the global [[Cold War]] superpowers. It is called the '''Secret War''' among the [[Special Activities Division|CIA Special Activities Division]] and Hmong veterans of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephenmbland.com/#!meet-the-laotians-clearing-their-country/c1miw]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126132658/http://www.stephenmbland.com/|date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kingdom of Laos]] was a [[covert]] [[Theatre (warfare)|theatre]] for other belligerents during the [[Vietnam War]]. The Franco–Lao Treaty of Amity and Association (signed 22 October 1953) transferred remaining French powers to the Royal Lao Government (except control of military affairs), establishing Laos as an independent member of the [[French Union]]. However, this government did not include representatives from the [[Lao Issara]] anti-colonial armed nationalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=90&amp;regionSelect=7-Eastern_Asia |title=Laos |author=Uppsala Conflict Data Program |date=2 November 2011 |publisher= Uppsala University Department of Peace and Conflict Research |accessdate=11 November 2002

The following years were marked by a rivalry between the neutralists under Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], the right wing under Prince [[Boun Oum]] of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassak]], and the left-wing Lao Patriotic Front under [[Prince Souphanouvong]] and half-Vietnamese future Prime Minister [[Kaysone Phomvihane]]. Several attempts were made to establish coalition governments, and a "tri-coalition" government was finally seated in [[Vientiane]].

The actual fighting in Laos involved the [[North Vietnamese Army]], [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam|U.S.]] troops and [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Thai]] forces and [[ARVN|South Vietnamese]] army forces directly and through irregular proxies in a struggle for control over the Laotian Panhandle. The North Vietnamese Army occupied the area to use for its [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] supply corridor and as staging area for offensives into South Vietnam. There was a second major theater of action on and near the northern [[Plain of Jars]].

The North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao eventually emerged victorious in 1975, as part of the general communist victory in all of former French [[Indochina]] that year. A total of up to 300,000 people from Laos fled to neighboring [[Thailand]] following the Pathet Lao takeover.&lt;ref name="The Black Book of Communism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Courtois|first1=Stephane|last2=Werth|first2=Nicolas|last3=Panne|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Paczkowski|first4=Andrzej|last5=Bartosek|first5=Karel|last6=Margolin|first6=Jean-Louis|displayauthors=1|title=The Black Book of Communism|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2|page=575|title-link=The Black Book of Communism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the communists took power in [[Laos]], Hmong rebels fought the new government. The Hmong were persecuted as traitors and "lackeys" of the Americans, with the government and its Vietnamese allies carrying out human rights abuses against Hmong civilians. The incipient conflict between [[Vietnam]] and [[China]] also played a role with Hmong rebels being accused of receiving support from China. Over 40,000 people died in the [[Insurgency in Laos|conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sozialwiss.uni-hamburg.de/onTEAM/preview/Ipw/Akuf/kriege/183_laos.htm ''Laos (Erster Guerillakrieg der Meo (Hmong))''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209005259/http://www.sozialwiss.uni-hamburg.de/onTEAM/preview/Ipw/Akuf/kriege/183_laos.htm |date=9 December 2010 }} Kriege-Archiv der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Kriegsursachenforschung, Institut für Politikwissenschaft, Universität Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lao royal family]] were arrested by the Pathet Lao after the war and sent to labor camps, where most of them died in the late 1970s and 1980s, including King [[Savang Vatthana]], Queen [[Khamphoui]], and Crown Prince [[Vong Savang]].&lt;ref&gt;http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Laos/sub5_3a/entry-2943.html .

{{History of Laos}}
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
The [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] established Laotian neutrality. The [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN), however, continued to operate in both northern and southeastern Laos. There were repeated attempts from 1954 onward to force the North Vietnamese out of Laos, but regardless of any agreements or concessions, [[Hanoi]] had no intention of withdrawing from the country or abandoning its Laotian communist allies.

North Vietnam established the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] as a paved highway in southeast Laos paralleling the Vietnamese border. The trail was designed to transport North Vietnamese troops and supplies to the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]], as well as to aid the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|National Liberation Front]] (Viet Cong).

North Vietnam also had a sizable military effort in northern Laos, while sponsoring and maintaining an indigenous communist rebellion, the [[Pathet Lao]], to put pressure on the Royal Lao Government.

The U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), in an attempt to disrupt these operations in northern Laos without direct military involvement, responded by training a guerrilla force of about thirty thousand Laotian hill tribesmen, mostly local [[Hmong people|Hmong]] (Meo) tribesmen along with the [[Yao people|Mien]] and [[Khmu people|Khmu]], led by [[Royal Lao Army]] General [[Vang Pao]], a Hmong military leader. This army, supported by the CIA proprietary airline [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], Thailand, the [[Royal Lao Air Force]], and a covert air operation directed by the United States ambassador to Laos, fought the People's Army of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front (NLF), and their Pathet Lao allies to a seesaw stalemate, greatly aiding U.S. interests in the war in Vietnam.

The status of the war in the north throughout the year generally depended on the weather.  As the [[dry season]] started, in November or December, so did North Vietnamese military operations, as fresh troops and supplies flowed down out of North Vietnam on newly passable routes, either down from [[Dien Bien Phu]], across [[Phong Saly Province]] on all-weather highways, or on Route 7 through [[Ban Ban]], Laos on the northeast corner of the [[Plain of Jars]]. The CIA's covert operation's clandestine army would give way, harrying the PAVN and Pathet Lao as they retreated; [[Raven FACs]] would direct massive air strikes against the communists by [[USAF]] jets and [[RLAF]] [[T-28 Trojan|T-28s]] to prevent the capture of the Laotian capitals of [[Vientiane]] and [[Luang Prabang]]. When the [[rainy season]] six months later rendered North Vietnamese supply lines impassable, the Vietnamese communists would recede toward Vietnam.

The war in the southeastern [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] against the Ho Chi Minh Trail was primarily a massive air interdiction program by the USAF and [[United States Navy]] because political constraints kept the trail safe from ground assault from South Vietnam. Raven FACs also directed air strikes in the southeast. Other [[Forward Air Control]]lers from South Vietnam, such as Covey FACs from the [[20th Tactical Air Support Squadron]] and Nail FACs from the [[23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron]], also directed strikes. Other air strikes were planned ahead. Overall coordination of the air campaign was directed by an [[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Command and Control Center]], such as those deployed in [[Operation Igloo White#Operations in Laos|Operation Igloo White]].

The existence of the conflict in Laos was sometimes reported in the U.S., and described in press reports as the CIA's "Secret War in Laos" because details were largely unavailable due to official government denials that the war existed. The denials were seen as necessary considering that the North Vietnamese government and the U.S. had both signed agreements specifying the neutrality of Laos. U.S. involvement was considered necessary because the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) had effectively conquered a large part of the country and was equally obfuscating its role in Laos. Despite these denials, however, the civil war was the largest U.S. [[covert operation]] prior to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], with areas of Laos controlled by North Vietnam subjected to years of intense US aerial bombardment, representing the heaviest bombing campaign in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54/057.html |title=Bombing Laos |website=Hartford-hwp.com |date=1995-10-09 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Branfman | first = Fred | url = http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2001/05/18/kissinger/ | title = Wanted | newspaper = Salon | date = 18 May 2001 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110130154904/http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2001/05/18/kissinger | archivedate = 30 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-11-laos-bombs_x.htm | work= USA Today | title = 30-year-old bombs still very deadly in Laos | first =Paul | last =Wiseman | date = 11 December 2003 | accessdate =7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overshadowing it all was the struggle of the [[Cold War]], with the United States' policy of the [[containment]] of communism and the policies of the [[People's Republic of China]] and the Soviet Union of spreading communism via subversion and insurgency.

== Chronology of the Laotian Civil War ==
{{Main article|List of military operations of the Laotian Civil War|History of Laos since 1945}}

=== 1945: Prelude to war ===
The end of World War II left Laos in political chaos. The French, who had been displaced from their protectorate by the Japanese, wanted to resume control of Laos, and sponsored guerrilla forces to regain control. The Japanese had proclaimed Laos independent even as they lost the war. Though King [[Sisavang Vong]] thought Laos was too small for independence he had proclaimed the end of the French protectorate status though he favored the French return. He let it be known he would accept independence if it should occur. Thus there was a nascent movement for independence amid the turmoil.

Underlying all this was a strong undercurrent of Vietnamese involvement. Sixty percent of the population of Laos's six urban areas were Vietnamese, with the Vietnamese holding key positions in the civil bureaucracies and the police. Since the 1930s the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] had established wholly Vietnamese cells in Laos.

Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa]], as Viceroy and Prime Minister, established the Lao royal treasury account with the Indochinese treasury in [[Hanoi]] in an attempt to establish a functional economy.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031095538/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0026%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

French commandos parachuted into Laos beginning in 1945 to organize guerrilla forces. By November, they had formed the guerrillas into four light infantry battalions of the newly founded French Union Army.&lt;ref name="War in Laos"&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The officers and sergeants of the new Lao battalions were French.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, a Lao nationalist movement called [[Lao Issara]] (Free Laos) was founded as a new government for Laos. Among Lao Issara's prominent members were three European-educated princes; brothers [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa]] and [[Souvanna Phouma]], and their half brother, [[Souphanouvong]]. The former became the titular founder of [[Lao Issara]]. Souphanouvong became commander in chief, as well as minister of foreign affairs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government, 1955&amp;nbsp;– 1975 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050228065607/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0027%29]&lt;/ref&gt; Souvanna Phouma became minister of public works.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

Independence began with an uprising of the Vietnamese residents in [[Savannakhet]]. Prince Souphanouvong took command of a band of partisans armed with weapons looted from the local militia. The band moved northward to the administrative capitol of [[Vientiane]] with its provisional revolutionary government. Souphanouvong then urged the signing of a military cooperation treaty with the newly established [[North Vietnam]]ese communist government, which was done. The French military mission was escorted out of Laos into Thailand by a contingent of Chinese troops.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

However, the Lao Issara never gained more than a tenuous hold on the entirety of Laos. Roving [[Viet Minh]] detachments ruled the northeast, but the Viet Minh declined to aid the new government. Chinese troops,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050228065502/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0028%29]&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Chinese Nationalist]] 93rd Division,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050228065416/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0032%29]&lt;/ref&gt; occupied cities as far south as [[Luang Prabang]]. The French-sponsored guerrillas controlled the southern provinces of Savannakhet and [[Khammouan]]. Prince [[Boun Oum]], who sympathized with the French, occupied the rest of the southern panhandle.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031092223/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0028%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

For these, and other reasons, Lao Issara could not hold the country against the returning French colonial government and its troops. The French negotiated a Chinese withdrawal from Laos prior to their own return, removing them from the field.

=== 1946: French return; Vietnamese arrive ===
In January 1946, the French began the reconquest of Laos by sweeping the Bolovens Plateau.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; They had organized six battalions of light infantry, to which they added a minor force of French troops.&lt;ref name="War in Laos" /&gt;

On 21 March 1946, Souphanouvong and his largely Vietnamese force fought the French Union troops at Savannakhet, to no avail; the attackers mustered paratroopers, artillery, armored cars, and Spitfire fighter-bombers. The Lao Issara troops suffered 700 killed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; They fled, leaving behind 250 bodies and 150 prisoners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

On 24 April, the French dropped a paratroop battalion on the outskirts of Vientiane, and took the city without resistance. On 9 May, they repeated their airborne tactics with a drop outside [[Luang Prabang]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; This was coupled with a thrust to the north by the French forces, from Vientiane to Luang Prabang, that chased [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa]] and the Lao Issara ministers out of Laos. The king reinstated the French rule by repudiating his actions that had been pressured from him by the Japanese, Chinese, and Lao Issara.

By September 1946, the Lao Issara had been defeated and had fled to exile in Bangkok.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; One of its splinter groups, led by [[Thao O Anourack]], fled to Hanoi.
There he allied himself with two men trusted by [[Ho Chi Minh]]; [[Nouhak Phoumsavanh]] was Vietnamese, and [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] was Vietnamese-Lao. These three men founded the military movement that would become the Pathet Lao (Land of Laos).

[[Thao O Anourack]] established the initial Pathet Lao base at [[Con Cuong]], Vietnam. [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] organized the first detachment of the new force. By the end of 1946, at least 500 [[Viet Minh]] agents had crossed into Laos.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050228065410/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0031%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1947–1952: Build-up of forces ===
{{Main article|Royal Lao Army|Pathet Lao}}

On 11 May 1947, King [[Sisavang Vong]] granted a constitution declaring Laos an independent nation within the [[French Union]]. This began the building of a new government over the next few years, including the establishment of a national army, the Armée Nationale Laotienne, which was the first iteration of the [[Royal Lao Army]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050228065658/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0030%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nascent army was plagued by lack of Lao leadership, and its weaponry was a hodgepodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus
the new Armée Nationale Laotienne consisted of light infantry battalions officered by the French. There was one paratroop battalion included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page=4 &amp; 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French began training Lao officers and non-commissioned officers even as they continued to lead and train the new army.

In opposition, the Viet Minh raised a subsidiary revolutionary movement, the Pathet Lao, starting with an initial guerrilla band of 25 in January 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1949, the exiled [[Lao Issara]] dissolved and the three royal brothers each chose a separate destiny.

[[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa]] chose to remain in Bangkok. His stay was temporary. He would once again become the viceroy of Laos.

[[Souvanna Phouma]] chose to return to Laos via an amnesty, believing that the Lao would soon free themselves. In 1951 he became Prime Minister for the first time and held that office until 1954.

[[Souphanouvong]], who had spent seven years in [[Nha Trang]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated7" /&gt; during his sixteen years in [[Vietnam]],&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt; met [[Ho Chi Minh]], and acquired a Vietnamese wife while in Vietnam, solicited Viet Minh aid in founding a guerrilla force.

In August 1950, Souphanouvong had joined the Viet Minh in their headquarters north of [[Hanoi]], Vietnam, and become the head of the [[Pathet Lao]], along with its political arm dubbed [[Neo Lao Hak Sat]] (Lao Patriotic Front).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government, 1955–1975 |pages=7, 142–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to give a false front of authority to the Lao communist movement by claiming to represent a united non-partisan effort. Two of its most important founders were members of the [[Indochinese Communist Party]], which advocated overthrow of the monarchy as well as expulsion of the French. This got Laos involved in the [[First Indochina War]] but it started off mainly against the French.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031093445/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0031%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 1950, the Pentalateral Mutual Defense Assistance Pact was signed by the United States, France, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; it was a tool to transfer American military aid to the French war effort in Indochina.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Statler, ''Replacing France: The Origins of American Intervention in Vietnam'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2007) p. 197; {{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government, 1955–1975 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year also marked the infiltration of at least 5,000 more [[Viet Minh]] into Laos.

In February 1951, the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] decided to split in three to sponsor war against the French in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], along with the war in Vietnam. The new Laotian branch consisted of 2,091 members, but included only 31 Lao.

Also, by 1951, the Pathet Lao had mustered sufficient trained troops to join the Viet Minh in military operations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

By October 1951, the Armée Nationale Laotienne had raised two more battalions of infantry and begun training a battalion of paratroops. The ANL ended the year with a strength of 5,091.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1952, the [[Royal Lao Army]] had grown to include a battalion of troops commanded by Laotian officers, as well as 17 other companies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;

=== 1953–54: First North Vietnamese invasion and French defeat ===
[[File:FrenchLaos1953.png|thumb| French [[Raoul Salan|General Salan]] and [[Sisavang Vatthana|Prince Sisavang]] in the Lao capital, Luang Prabang, 4 May 1953]]

In April, 1953, the Viet Minh's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) invaded the northeastern part of what was still the [[French Protectorate of Laos]] with 40,000 troops commanded by General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]]; including 2,000 Pathet Lao soldiers led by [[Souphanouvong]]. The objective of the two-pronged invasion was the capture of the royal capital of Luang Prabang and of the [[Plain of Jars]]. In 9 November the Pathet Lao began its conflict with the Kingdom of Laos thus beginning the civil war and technically the Second Indochina War while the First Indochina War was still going.

They were opposed by 10,000 Lao troops and 3,000 French regulars.

The North Vietnamese invaders succeeded in conquering the border provinces of [[Phongsali]] and [[Xam Neua]], which were adjacent to northern Vietnam and on the northeastern verge of the [[Plain of Jars]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government, 1955&amp;nbsp;– 1975 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then moved aside to allow the Pathet Lao force with its mismatched scrounged equipment to occupy the captured ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Souphanouvong moved the Pathet Lao headquarters into [[Xam Neua]] on 19 April.

The other strike, moving from [[Điện Biên Phủ]] and aimed downriver at Luang Prabang, was thwarted by oncoming monsoons and resistance by the French.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;
[[File:PathetLao002.jpg|thumb|left|Pathet Lao soldiers in [[Xam Neua]], 1953]]
The Vietnamese invasion was stalled, but only because the French had airlifted in battalions of [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legionnaires]] and [[Moroccans|Moroccan]] [[Tirailleur]]s.

In December, the French Union Army, as part of its attempt to protect Laos from the PAVN, recaptured the Dien Bien Phu valley.&lt;ref name="War in Laos" /&gt;

{{Main article|Battle of Dien Bien Phu}}

In January 1954, the PAVN launched two assaults on Laos. One thrust crossed the top of the panhandle to the Mekong River town of [[Thakhek]]. The other was again  aimed at Luang Prabang. Both were thwarted in a month.

These were diversions&lt;ref name="War in Laos" /&gt; to the famous [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], which took place from March through May 1954 within ten kilometers of the Lao border, on the lines of communication into the [[Plain of Jars]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; The ruggedness of the karst mountains of northern Laos channels movement into a few canyons; small watercraft could move from [[Điện Biên Phủ]] down to the [[Nam Ou]], and thence directly downriver to Luang Prabang, or they cross into the PDJ via

The United States used [[Civil Air Transport]], which later morphed into [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], in a covert operation to fly supplies to the embattled French in Điện Biên Phủ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government, 1955&amp;nbsp;– 1975 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAVN also launched a diversionary thrust at [[Seno, Laos]] aimed at cutting away the panhandle from the main body of Laos. This thrust was foiled by paratroopers from the French Union's Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

When the relief troops failed to lift the siege in time, the French and their local allies lost the bastion of  Điện Biên Phủ. One of the troopers in the relief column marching from Luang Prabang was a young [[Hmong people|Hmong]] named [[Vang Pao]].

The French loss at Điện Biên Phủ marked the end of the [[First Indochina War]]; the French were driven to negotiate for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |pages=4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July, the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos was signed, ending French rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031095421/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0004%29]&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the North Vietnamese established a support group for [[Pathet Lao]] forces at [[Ban Nameo]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170904014932/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?cstdy%3A1%3A.%2Ftemp%2F~frd_6n5k%3A%3A]&lt;/ref&gt; well within northeastern Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LA/14/Ban_Nameo.html |title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Ban Nameo, Laos |website=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gen-commons.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954.]]

The Agreement radically changed the geography of Indochina, resulting in independence for Laos. On 1 August 1954 the French army withdrew from Laos declaring independence for the nation alongside [[North Vietnam]], [[South Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] which ended the [[First Indochina War]] but the Laotian Civil War was still ongoing. The northern half of Vietnam became independent of the French imperialist enterprise and was ruled by an independent Vietnamese Communist government. Lao French Union troops joined the military of independent Laos, however France kept two military bases in Laos and maintained its "military advisors" in the new Lao military. The Royal Lao government military also received its first aircraft from the French in 1954; nine [[Morane-Saulnier MS-500]] Criquets were supplied for support and medevac.&lt;ref name="War in Laos" /&gt;

=== 1955–58: The lull ===

See also [[Operation Booster Shot]]

In January, 1955, French advisors began training the first Lao aviation force. Later that year, Thailand would supply [[Sikorsky H-19]] helicopters and volunteer pilots to the Lao military. The Thais also trained thirty Lao officers in weapons use at [[Hua Hin]], Thailand.&lt;ref name="War in Laos" /&gt;

In early 1955, a United States Operation Mission was set up in Laos. Its primary purpose was supply of military defense materials to the [[Royal Lao Government]]; 80% of its budget was dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government 1955&amp;nbsp;– 1975 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States paid 100% of the Lao military budget.&lt;ref name="War in Laos" /&gt; However, the embassy staff was not up to monitoring this program. There was an obvious need for a [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]]; however, the United States had signed a treaty that expressly forbade such.

U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s solution was to establish the [[Programs Evaluation Office]] (PEO) in December, 1955, staffed by American civilians with prior military experience and headed up by retired [[Brigadier General]] Rothwell Brown. These civilians were given U.S. State Department status. However, they did not work strictly for the State Department. On military matters, they reported to the [[United States Pacific Command|Commander in Chief Pacific Command]], with information supplied to the American ambassador; on non-military matters, they reported directly to the ambassador.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

1955 was also notable for the despatch of Royal Lao Government troops to [[Sam Neua]] and [[Phong Saly]], which was much resented by the Pathet Lao. As a result of this resentment, and disputes about electoral procedures, the Laotian communists boycotted that year's national elections.

On 21 March 1956, [[Souvanna Phouma]] began his second term as prime minister. He opened a dialogue with his brother, [[Souphanouvong]]. In August, they announced the intention of declaring a ceasefire and reintegrating the Pathet Lao and their occupied territory into the government. However, the Pathet Lao claimed the right to administer the provinces they occupied.

At the same time, they and their North Vietnamese backers ran a massive recruitment campaign, with the aim of forming nine battalions of troops. Many of the new recruits were sent into North Vietnam for schooling and training. This led to United States concern that the [[Royal Lao Army]] would be inadequately equipped and trained because there was only one small French military mission working with the RLA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031091017/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0033%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 1957, the [[Programs Evaluation Office]] personnel began supplying training materials to the French Military Mission that was charged with training the [[Royal Lao Army]]. The rationale was that improved training would better fit the army with defending its country. As part of this process, the United States even took over paying the [[Royal Lao Army]]'s salaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050228065816/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0036%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in March, 1957, the Royal Lao Army began shuttling arms to [[Hmong people|Hmong]] guerrillas, to enable them to fight on the side of the RLA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031095001/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0042%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 1957, a coalition government incorporating the Pathet Lao was finally established. Using the slogan, "one vote to the right, one vote to the left to prevent civil war", pro-communist parties received one-third of the popular vote and won 13 of 21 contested seats in the elections of 4 May 1958.&lt;ref name="Martin103"&gt;Stuart-Fox, Martin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VvvevRkX-EC A history of Laos]'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; With these additional seats, the left controlled a total of 16 seats in the 59 member National Assembly.&lt;ref name="Martin103" /&gt; Combined with independents, this was enough to deny Souvanna's center right, neutralist coalition the two-thirds majority it needed to form a government.&lt;ref name="Martin103" /&gt; With parliament deadlocked, the U.S. suspended aid in June to force a devaluation of the overpriced currency, which was leading to the abuse of U.S. aid.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Assembly responded by confirming a right-wing government led by [[Phuy Xananikôn]] in August.&lt;ref name="Martin105"&gt;Martin, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; This government included four members of the U.S.-backed Committee for the Defence of the National Interest (none of them National Assembly members).&lt;ref name="Martin105" /&gt; Three more unelected CDNI members were added in December, when Phuy received emergency powers to govern without the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="Martin105" /&gt;

In November, 1958, Brigadier General John A. Heintges reviewed the [[Programs Evaluation Office]]. He promptly replaced General Brown, and forged a new agreement with the Lao and the French. Integral to the new agreement was the displacement of the French military trainers by Americans. As a result, PEO expanded over twentyfold. Included in the expansion were 149 [[Special Forces]] on temporary duty, and 103 Filipino military veterans working for a newly formed front company named Eastern Construction Company in Laos.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== 1959: Second North Vietnamese invasion ===
{{Main article|North Vietnamese invasion of Laos|Group 559|Ho Chi Minh Trail}}
[[File:HoChiMinhTrial001.jpg|thumb|The Ho Chi Minh trail was used by Vietnamese and Laotian people from the very beginning. Captured Viet Cong, circa 1959]]
On 15 May 1959, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] established [[Group 559]]; this unit was charged with the logistics of moving the necessities of war from North Vietnam to the South. Its foremost feat was building and maintaining the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] down the eastern spine of Laos. Eventually, this transportation network would power the Vietnamese communists to victory. It would have to survive a relentless air campaign comparable to any interdiction bombing in World War II.

Also in May, the long-awaited integration of 1,500 Pathet Lao troops into the national army was scheduled. The U.S. embassy told the Lao government that it would be difficult to gain congressional approval of aid to Laos with communists serving in the army. The [[Pathet Lao]] stalled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031093035/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0037%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under orders from Souphanouvong, the Pathet Lao battalions refused to be integrated into the Royal Lao Army. Souphanouvong was then arrested and imprisoned, along with his aides. The two Pathet Lao battalions, one after the other, escaped during the night with no shots fired, taking their equipment, families, and domestic animals with them. On 23 May, [[Souphanouvong]] and his companions also escaped unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government 1955&amp;nbsp;– 1975 |pages=19–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, U.S. Special Forces Mobile Training Teams from the [[77th Special Forces Group]], working under the code name Hotfoot, began training the Royal Laotian army. The Green Berets were attached to the Programs Evaluation Office, and like other PEO employees, were nominal civilians and dressed as such.

The RLA was being formed into Groupement Mobiles—regimental-sized units of three battalions. The training teams were assigned one per GM, with some battalions also meriting a team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |pages= 7, 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, [[PAVN]] units attacked all along the North Vietnamese-Lao border. As they took ground from the Royal Lao Army, they moved in Pathet Lao as occupation troops.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; Poor battle performance by the RLA seemed to verify the need for further training; the RLA outnumbered the attackers, but still gave ground.

Also in July, the American embassy began to contract for aerial resupply for RLA troops, hiring Robert Brongersma and his [[Beech 18]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Group 100 was succeeded by Group 959; the North Vietnamese were upgrading their military mission to the Pathet Lao, just as the Americans had expanded PEO. Both sides were raising larger client armies, in hopes the Lao would fight.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

=== 1960: The neutralist coup ===
[[File:LaosTraining.jpg|thumb|The Laotian Armed Forces training Center at [[Khang Khai, Laos]], March 1960]]
On 9 August 1960, Captain [[Kong Le]] and his [[Special Forces]]-trained Neutralist [[paratroop]] battalion were able to seize control of the administrative capital of Vientiane in a virtually bloodless coup,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031091831/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0039%29]&lt;/ref&gt; while Prime Minister [[Tiao Samsanith]], government officials, and military leaders met in the royal capital, [[Luang Prabang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |pages= 32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakquda.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jarred James Breaux |url=http://nakquda.com/essays/history/laotiancivilwar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125115450/http://nakquda.com/essays/history/laotiancivilwar |archivedate=2009-01-25 |title=NAKQUDA.com - - - Anthropology, Architecture, Art, Computer Science, Foreign Language, History, Humanities, Literature, Music, Philosophy, Politics, Psychology, Religion, Science, Sociology, Miscellaneous, Mathematics, Rocktry, &amp; Theoretical Physics Essays |website=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stated aim for the coup was an end to fighting in Laos, the end of foreign interference in his country, an end to the consequent corruption caused by foreign aid, and better treatment for his soldiers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government 1955–1975 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kong Le's coup did not end opposition to him, and there was a scramble among unit commanders to choose up sides. If one was not pro-coup, then he had the further decision to make as to whom he would back to counter the coup. The front runner was General [[Phoumi Nosavan]], first cousins with the prime minister of [[Thailand]], Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |pages= 33–35, 40, 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s support, Field Marshal Sarit set up a covert Thai military advisory group, called Kaw Taw. Kaw Taw supported a counter-coup against the new Neutralist Lao government in Vientiane, supplying artillery, artillerymen, and advisers to Phoumi's forces. It also committed the CIA-sponsored [[Border Patrol Police#Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit|Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit]] (PARU) to operations within Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |pages= 33–35, 40, 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside its covert Kaw Taw operation, immediately after Kong Le's coup the government of [[Thailand]] began an [[embargo]] via [[land blockade]], cutting off the main source of imported goods for [[Vientiane]]. The United States Secretary of State, [[Christian Herter]], stated that the United States supported the "legitimate government under the King's direction." The United States supported the pro-Western government of Prime Minister Tiao Samsanith while at the same time the CIA supported the covert counter-coup effort organized by Sarit against the Neutralist government in Vientiane.  

The Neutralist forces in Vientiane organized the Executive Committee of the High Command of the Revolution as the interim government in Laos the following day. General [[Phoumi Nosavan]], stated on 10 August that he planned to retake Vientiane by force. The United States Ambassador to Laos, [[Winthrop G. Brown]], responded to General Phoumi by stating that the United States supported a restoration of peace "through quick and decisive action."&lt;ref name="nakquda.com" /&gt;

PEO had turned its support to General Phoumi. With the help of CIA [[front organization]] [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] and covert aid from [[Thailand]], the general and his troops moved north toward [[Vientiane]] from [[Savannakhet]] in southern Laos, in November.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8" /&gt;

The Soviet Union began a military air bridge into Vientiane in early December; it was characterized as the largest Soviet airlift since World War II.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031093740/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0041%29]&lt;/ref&gt; This air bridge flew in PAVN artillery and gunners to reinforce the Neutralist/Pathet Lao coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos |page= 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their side, the United States flew four [[B-26 Invader]] bombers from [[Taiwan]] into [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]], poised to strike into Laos. They were later joined by an additional eight B26s. With a dozen guns, half a dozen rockets, and a napalm canister apiece, they were a potent threat, but were never used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December, Phoumi's army began a three-day bombardment of Vientiane. Five hundred civilians and seventeen of Kong Le's paratroopers were killed by the shellfire. On the 14th, a U.S. carrier task force went on alert, and the Second Airborne Brigade stood by to seize selected Laotian airfields. The U.S. was poised to rescue its paramilitary and diplomatic advisers in Laos.

Kong Le and his Neutralists finally withdrew northward to the [[Plain of Jars]]. Their withdrawal was covered by artillery fire from the PAVN 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers rushed in from Hanoi, and supported by Soviet airdrops of crucial supplies of rations, munitions, and radios. In the retreat, Kong Le picked up 400 recruits, swelling his force to 1,200 men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9" /&gt;

Phoumi's coup was thus successful, but the end result was the alliance of the Neutralists with the Pathet Lao on 23 December. As 1960 ended, the nation of Laos had become an arena of confrontation for the world's superpowers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: U.S. Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government 1955&amp;nbsp;– 1975 |pages=21–25, 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1961: Superpowers' involvement deepens ===
{{Main article|Vang Pao}}
Beginning on 1 January, a new coalition of Kong Le's Neutralists, Pathet Lao, and [[PAVN]] drove 9,000 Royal Lao Army troops from the Plain of Jars.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031092528/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0043%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January, the [[Royal Laotian Air Force]] (RLAF) received its first counter-insurgency aircraft, American-built [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texans]], via the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] (RTAF). These four reconfigured trainers were armed with two .30 caliber machine guns and five-inch rockets, and could carry 100-pound bombs. Four previously trained Lao pilots undertook transition training in Thailand; on 9 January, the pilots flew the new RLAF fighter-bombers to Vientiane. Two days later, they flew their first combat sorties, against PAVN and Pathet Lao covering Kong Le's retreat into the Plain of Jars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Shadow War in Laos |pages= 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hmongs.jpg|thumb|300px|Anti-communist Hmong guerrilla troops in 1961.]]
Russian Soviet air supply continued, bringing in heavy weapons to supplement the light arms previously delivered. On 7 January, the North Vietnamese presence was escalated by an additional four battalions; two of the battalions immediately moved to the point of conflict, on Route 7, which connected to Vientiane. A third PAVN battalion moved into action at Tha Thom, south of the Plain of Jars.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; On 15 January, the entire [[925th Independent Brigade]] of the PAVN had crossed into Laos to reinforce the Pathet Lao/Neutralist coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Shadow War in Laos |page= 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US decided to counter-escalate by airdropping arms to a force of 7,000 [[Hmong people|Hmong]] guerrillas later in the month.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; The US Navy transferred four [[Sikorsky H-34|H-34]] helicopters to CIA [[front organization]] [[Air America (airline)|Air America]].

By the beginning of February 1961, the first four Thai pilots arrived to fly four more T-6s supplied to the Royal Laotian Air Force (RLAF). The Thai pilots had been officially discharged from the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) and held no official position in the RLAF. The growth of the RLAF would be nullified by its casualties, as five of the T-6s were lost in action by the end of March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shadow War: The CIA's Shadow War in Laos |pages= 47, 50–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inter-agency task force set up by the incoming [[Kennedy administration]] in early February undertook a two-month study of possible American responses to the Laotian civil war. Even as the French ended their training mission, American training efforts were ramped up: Sixteen H-34 helicopters were transferred from the U.S. Marine Corps to Air America; maintenance facilities were established at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base|Udorn]] in northern Thailand, about 85 kilometres south of Vientiane. The most drastic alternative the task force envisioned was a 60,000 man commitment of American ground troops in southern Laos, with a possible use of [[nuclear weapons]]. These latter options were not elected. 

On 9 March, the communists captured the only road junction between [[Luang Prabang]] and Vientiane. When RLA troops were ordered to counterattack and retake the junction, they dropped their weapons and ran. Special Forces Team Moon was assigned as advisers to the RLA unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam |pages=29–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 1961, Team Moon was overrun. Two sergeants were killed, and team leader Captain Walter H. Moon was captured; he was later executed while trying to escape captivity. Another sergeant was released sixteen months later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page= 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At War in the Shadow of Vietnam |page= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Operation Millpond]] B-26s had been scheduled to strike at Kong Le, but the strike was stayed by an event on the far side of the world. The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] failed, and that failure gave pause to U.S. actions in Laos. A ceasefire was sought. Simultaneously, the Programs Evaluation Office shed its civilian guise and went above ground to become a [[Military Advisory Assistance Group]]. Emblematic of the change, the Hotfoot teams donned their U.S. uniforms and became White Star Mobile Training Teams.

The truce supposedly went into effect the first week of May, but was repeatedly breached by the communists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page= 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Royal Lao Army ineffective, the Hmong guerrillas were left as the only opposition to the communists. In early June, they were forced from their beleaguered position at the [[Battle of Ban Pa Dong|Ban Padong]] by an artillery barrage followed by a ground assault. Under command of General [[Vang Pao]], they fell back to [[Long Tieng]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031095109/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0045%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had begun secretly recruiting Lao montagnards into [[Table of organization and equipment for an ADC company|100 man militia companies]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Riflemen trained for these militias would receive eight weeks basic training, then serve several months in their militia. Once they had that experience, which often included their first combat, they were further recruited into battalions of irregular troops called [[Special Guerrilla Units]]. The battalions were filled out along ethnic lines, most being Hmong, but some being [[Yao people|Yao]] ([[Iu-Mien]]) or [[Lao Theung]] ([[Lao Saetern]]). SGUs, once formed up, underwent three further months training by Thai officers and sergeants in [[Phitsanuloke]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spymaster |page= 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By summer, the CIA had mustered 9,000 hill tribesmen into the ranks of the Armée Clandestine. It was aided by 9 CIA agents, 9 Special Forces augmenters, and 99 Thai Special Forces troopers from the Police Aerial Resupply Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ravens: The Men Who Flew in America's Secret War in Laos |page= 134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By autumn, the future course of American involvement was set. Paramilitary trainers would train guerrilla units, with resupply coming via airdrops, and specialized short takeoff and landing aircraft using makeshift dirt airstrips. Other trainers would try to mold the Royalist regulars into a fighting force. Fighter-bombers would serve as flying artillery to blast the communist forces into retreat or submission.

In December, the Royalists decided to assert control over the provincial capital of [[Nam Tha]], which was on the northwestern border, almost in southern China. Laotian Army Groupement Mobiles (GMs) 11 and 18 were stationed there, and soon came under pressure from the communists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

By February, the Royal Lao Government's hold on Nam Tha seemed tenuous enough that it was reinforced by the paratroopers of GM 15. That gave a numerical edge to the defenders and should have guaranteed Nam Tha's retention. The presence of armed [[American Special Forces]] advisors should have stiffened them with military expertise.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In May, a PAVN assault broke the RLG forces and routed them. The Royalist soldiers fled southward across the entirety of northwestern Laos into Thailand, a retreat of over a hundred miles.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Faced with this fiasco, the U.S. and other foreign powers pressured the RLG into a coalition with the Pathet Lao and Kong Le's Forces Armee Neutrale. This technically fulfilled the Geneva Agreements on Laos and triggered the treaty requirement that foreign military technicians be withdrawn from Laos by October. The United States disbanded its Military Assistance Advisory Group and withdrew its military mission. The Vietnamese communists did not; they repatriated only a token 40 technicians out of an estimated 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |pages= 13, 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 1962 saw the field tests of [[Pilatus PC-6|Pilatus Porter]] Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft by Bird and Sons. The original two Porters' performance was degraded by heat and height robbing power from engine performance. One of the Porters crashed in December, killing all on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page= 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies of hill tribes irregulars were sent to [[Hua Hin]], Thailand for training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |page= 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1963: Stasis ===
See also [[Battle of Lak Sao]]

By the middle of the year, the Pathet Lao and Neutralists had begun to squabble with one another. The neutralist group was soon divided between right-leaning neutralists (headed by Kong Le) and left-leaning neutralists (headed by Quinim Polsena and Colonel Deuane Sunnalath). On 12 February 1963 Kong Le's second in command, Colonel Ketsana, was assassinated. Shortly afterwards Quinim Polsena and his deputy were also assassinated. The neutralist camp was split with some going over to the Pathēt Lao. Fighting between the Pathet Lao and government troops soon resumed.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Vang Pao gathered three SGU battalions into Groupement Mobile 21 and spearheaded a drive into Sam Neua against the Pathet Lao. His offensive was resupplied by supplies airdropped by the civilian aircraft of Air America and Bird and Sons.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the meantime, the United States re-established a Military Assistance Advisory Group to support its efforts in Laos, basing it in [[Bangkok]]. The Requirements Office of the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane was manned by civilians and monitored the need for U.S. military aid to Laos.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In August, the Royal Laotian Air Force received its first four [[T-28 Trojan]]s that had been adapted for counter-insurgency warfare.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The irregular companies trained the previous year in Thailand were now formed into a battalion called SGU 1. Irregular forces proliferated throughout the country. In Military Regions 3 and 4, action, intelligence, and road watch teams infiltrated the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

In December, Vang Pao was promoted to Brigadier General by King Sisavong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Laos |pages=14–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1964–65: Escalation and US Air Force involvement ===
{{Main article|Operation Barrel Roll}}
[[File:BR65.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Operation Barrel Roll|Barrel Roll]]'' operational area, 1964]]

On 1 April, the USAF set up [[Project Waterpump]], which was a pilot training program in [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] to supply Lao pilots for the Royal Laotian Air Force.&lt;ref name="chancefac.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chancefac.net/Laos/begin__air_ops_Laos.htm |title=Beginning Of Air Operations In Laos |website=Chancefac.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RLAF also began augmenting its ranks with Thai volunteer pilots in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= War in Laos |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Run by a 41-man team from Detachment 6 of the [[1st Air Commando Wing]], this facility was an end run around the treaty obligation that forbade training in Laos. Besides training pilots, Waterpump encouraged cooperation between the RLAF and the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. It was also tasked, as a last resort, to augment the RLAF to counter a renewed Communist offensive in Laos.&lt;ref name="chancefac.net" /&gt;

In Laos itself, there was an effort to train Laotians as forward air guides. Meantime, the Butterfly forward air control program began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= War in Laos |page= 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as the air commandos established themselves in Udorn and Laos, several Lao generals attempted a coup in Vientiane. With the capital in turmoil, the Communists on the Plain of Jars attacked and overran the Royalist and Neutralist positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite book |title= War in Laos |page= 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States then released the necessary ordnance for the RLAF to bomb Communist encampments, beginning on 18 May.

On 19 May, the [[United States Air Force]] began flying mid and low-level missions over the renewed fighting, under the code name Yankee Team.&lt;ref name="chancefac.net" /&gt; They also began reconnaissance missions over the Laotian panhandle to obtain target information on men and material being moved into South Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. By this time, the footpaths on the trail had been enlarged to truck roads, with smaller paths for bicycles and walking. The Trail had become the major artery for use by North Vietnam to infiltrate South Vietnam.

On 9 June, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ordered an [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] strike against the enemy in retaliation for the shoot down of another U.S. aircraft.

The summer of 1964 was marked by a successful attack by the Forces Armee Royale. [[Operation Triangle]] cleared one of the few roads in Laos; Route 13 connected the administrative capitol of Vientiane with the royal capitol of Luang Prabang.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

The Plain of Jars activities expanded by December 1964, were named [[Operation Barrel Roll]], and were under the control of the U.S. ambassador to Laos, who approved all targets before they were attacked.

==== Operations Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound ====
{{Main article|Operation Steel Tiger|Operation Tiger Hound}}
[[File:Map of Laos showing area of operations for Barrel Roll and Steel Tiger.jpg|thumb|250px|''Barrel Roll'' and ''[[Operation Steel Tiger|Steel Tiger]]'' operational area, 1965.]]

1965 began with an event that showed how the commanding generals of the five military regions of Laos were essentially warlords of their own domains.

In February, Commanding General of Military Region 5 [[Kouprasith Abhay]] mounted a coup against the group of generals who had attempted a coup the previous year. Among the losers fleeing into exile were General [[Phoumi Nosavan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

On 3 April, the U.S. began Operation Steel Tiger over the Laotian panhandle and the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Vietnamese DMZ]] to locate and destroy enemy forces and materiel being moved southward at night on the Ho Chi Minh Trail into South Vietnam. However, since circumstances made it a highly complex matter in regard to the apparent neutrality of Laos, target approval had to come from the U.S. government in Washington, D.C.. Additionally, the U.S. ambassadors in South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand were involved in controlling these U.S. air operations.

Late in 1965, the communists greatly increased their infiltration along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The United States decided to concentrate airpower upon a small segment of the Trail closest to South Vietnam and used most extensively by the enemy. As a result, Operation Tiger Hound was initiated in December 1965, utilizing aircraft from the Air Force, the [[United States Navy]], and [[U.S. Marines]], the [[Vietnamese Air Force]], and the Royal Laotian Air Force. On 11 December, [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] heavy bombers were called in to this tactical operation, in their first use over Laos.

From 1965 to 1973, the civil war moved back and forth in northern Laos, characterized by short but often very intense engagements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031094446/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0047%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nvamarch.jpg|thumb|left|North Vietnamese troops march through Laos, 1967]]
In the far northwest, Team Fox, an intelligence team of Mien hill tribesmen began long range reconnaissance of southern China.

In July, Royal Lao Government (RLG) forces seized the Nam Bac Valley. Three Infantry Regiments, one independent infantry battalion, and one artillery battalion took Nam Bac and established a defensive line north of [[Luang Prabang]].&lt;ref name="Victory in Vietnam, p. 213"&gt;''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Plain of Jars, the Pathet Lao advance gradually slowed due to the destruction of its supplies by airpower, and Laotian troops then counter-attacked. By August 1966, they had advanced to within 45&amp;nbsp;miles of the DRV border. North Vietnam then sent thousands of its regular troops into the battle and once again the Laotians were forced to retreat.

''Steel Tiger'' operations continued down the length of the panhandle in 1966, with special emphasis upon the ''Tiger Hound'' area. Since most of the communist truck traffic was at night, the Air Force developed and began using special equipment to detect the nighttime traffic.

[[File:Steel Tiger.jpg|thumb|250px|''Barrel Roll'', ''Steel Tiger'' and ''[[Operation Tiger Hound|Tiger Hound]]'' operational areas.]]

In eastern Laos, U.S., Royal Laotian, and VNAF aircraft continued their attacks on traffic along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. During 1967, B-52s flew 1,718 sorties in this area, almost triple their 1966 record. The major targets were trucks which had to be hunted down and destroyed one-by-one. This seemed to be irrational thinking to many Americans flying these combat missions for these trucks could have been destroyed en masse before, during, or after their unloading from the freighters that had hauled them to North Vietnam if bombing of [[Haiphong]] had been permitted. The presence of Soviet, British, Greek and Panamanian neutral ships in Haiphong prevented any United States bombing for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debate Bombing Russian Ships at Haiphong|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19651118&amp;id=9lEpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wGYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6969,5403245&amp;hl=en|accessdate=15 May 2015|publisher=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=18 Nov 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Laos, the Communists continued their slow advance across the Plain of Jars in 1967. Laotian victories were few and far between, and by the end of the year, the situation had become critical even with the air support which had been provided by the [[Royal Lao Air Force]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Laotian tribal irregulars were operating out of Nam Bac, under CIA direction from Luang Prabang, some 60&amp;nbsp;miles south of the guerrilla base. In midyear, over the objections of Lao colonels, American advisors pressured Royal Lao troops into forming their smaller units into combat battalions. Despite the poor training of the Lao soldiers, some of whom had never fired a weapon, these raw new units were moved northward out of Luang Prabang over a several month period to garrison Nam Bac. By mid-October, some 4,500 government troops held the valley to secure the air strip for their resupply, a la [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]]. The American intent was the establishment of Nam Bac as the keystone of an "iron arc" of defensive positions across northern Laos.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"&gt;{{cite book |title= Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley and the CIA's Crusaders |pages= 153–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[PAVN]] [[316th Infantry Division]] was dispatched to Laos to assault Nam Bac.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Royalist garrison was soon surrounded. They had American-supplied 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers for artillery support. They could also call on [[Royal Lao Air Force]] T-28s for close air support. U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers struck the Communist supply lines. Communist gunfire closed the Nam Bac airstrip to fixed wing resupply. Air America copters flew in supplies and evacuated the wounded; American C-123s parachuted supplies ferried from [[Udorn RTAFB]] to the beleaguered government troops. The Royalist troops would not launch a clearing attack to regain use of the runway for resupply. On 25 December, a Vietnamese artillery barrage kicked off their offensive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153" /&gt;

=== 1968: Royal Lao Army neutralized ===
[[File:HoCMT.png|thumb|250px|A map of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]], 1967.]]
On 13 January the North Vietnamese launched a multi-division attack on the Royal Lao Army at [[Nam Bac]], Laos. Some of the government troops began withdrawing from the valley. After about a third of the defenders had retreated, the final assault on the Royalist garrison came out of a heavy mist and hit the Royalist command post. Its communications with the defenders was cut; the rout was on.&lt;ref name="autogenerated154"&gt;{{cite book |title= Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley and the CIA's Crusaders |pages= 154–156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy weapons and scale of the PAVN attack could not be matched by the national army and it was effectively sidelined for several years.&lt;ref&gt;''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the government soldiers scattered into the surrounding hills; about 200 of the defenders were killed in action. Of the 3,278 Royalist soldiers, only about a third returned to government service. The Royalists had suffered such a staggering defeat that their army never recovered; the government was left with only tribal irregulars using guerrilla tactics fighting on its side.&lt;ref name="autogenerated154" /&gt;

Throughout 1968, the communists slowly advanced across the northern part of Laos, defeating Laotian forces time and time again. An important U.S. navigation aids site fell in the [[Battle of Lima Site 85]] on 10 March 1968. This success was achieved despite U.S. military advice and assistance. In November, the U.S. launched an air campaign against the Ho Chi Minh Trail because North Vietnam was sending more troops and supplies than ever along this route to South Vietnam. This new operation, named [[Operation Commando Hunt]], continued until 1972, with little success.

=== 1969–72 ===
[[File:SOS Huey in Laos.jpg|thumb|left|A U.S. Air Force Bell UH-1P from the 20th Special Operations Squadron "Green Hornets" at a base in Laos, 1970.]]

On 23 March 1969, the [[Royal Lao Army]] launched a large attack ([[Cu Kiet Campaign]]) against the communists in the [[Plain of Jars]]/Xieng Khoang areas, supported by its own air units and the U.S. Air Force. In June, Pathet Lao and PAVN launched an attack of its own and gained ground, but by August, Royal Laotian forces attacked again and regained what had been lost. In all these operations, the U.S. Air Force flew hundreds of ''Barrel Roll'' missions; however, many were canceled because of poor weather.

Pathet Lao forces were supported by PAVN's 174th Vietnamese Volunteer Regiment. By September, the 174th had to fall back to regroup. In mid-September, they launched a counterattack and recovered the Plain of Jars. Forces participating in the campaign included the 316th and 312th Infantry Divisions, the 866th Infantry Regiment, the 16th Artillery Regiment, one tank company, six sapper and engineer battalions, one [[Nghệ An Province]] local force battalion, and ten PL battalions.

On 11 February, the offensive (Campaign 139) opened. By the 20th, control of the Plain of Jars was secure. RLG forces withdrew to [[Muong Xui]]. On 25 February, the RLG abandoned [[Xieng Khoang]] city. [[Xam Thong]] fell on 18 March and [[Long Tieng]] was threatened. On 25 April, the campaign ended. After the end of the campaign, the "316th Division, the 866th Regiment, and a number of specialty branch units were ordered to stay behind to work with our Lao friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1970, fresh troops from North Vietnam advanced through northern Laos. The Air Force called in B-52s and, on 17&amp;nbsp;February, they were used to bomb targets in northern Laos. The enemy advance was halted by Laotian reinforcements, and for the remainder of the year it was a "seesaw" military campaign.

On 1&amp;nbsp;May, elements of SVN PAVN units (28th and 24A regiments) joined with North Vietnamese Army and Pathet Lao to seize [[Attopeu]].&lt;ref&gt;''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although communist movements down the Ho Chi Minh Trail grew during the year, the U.S. war effort was reduced because authorities in Washington, believing the U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia were being achieved, imposed budget limits, which reduced the number of combat missions the USAF could fly.

{{Main article|Operation Lam Son 719}}

Because of significant logistical stockpiling by PAVN in the Laotian Panhandle, South Vietnam launched Operation Lam Son 719, a military thrust on 8&amp;nbsp;February 1971. Its goals were to cross into Laos toward the city of [[Xekong Province|Tchepone]] and cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, hopefully thwarting a planned North Vietnamese offensive. Aerial support by the U.S. was massive since no American ground units could participate in the operation. On 25&amp;nbsp;February, PAVN launched a counterattack, and in the face of heavy opposition, the South Vietnamese force withdrew from Laos after losing approximately a third of its men.

Combined offensive to take Plain of Jars.
On 18 December, PAVN and Pathet Lao forces launched counteroffensive ([[Campaign Z]]) to recover the Plain. Volunteer forces included the 312th and 316th Divisions, the 335th and 866th Infantry Regiments, and six artillery and tank battalions. [[Xam Thong]] fell and the push continued toward [[Long Tieng]].&lt;ref name="Victory in Vietnam, p. 288"&gt;''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower Laos&amp;nbsp;– the 968th Infantry Regiment and Pathet Lao forces reclaimed the [[Tha Teng]] and [[Lao Nam]] areas, and captured the [[Bolaven Plateau]].&lt;ref name="Victory in Vietnam, p. 288" /&gt;

During the dry season 1971–72, PL/PAVN forces dug into defensive positions and fought for permanent control of the Plain of Jars. Units participating included the 316th Infantry Division, the 866th, 335th, and 88th Regiments, and nine specialty branch battalions under the command of Senior Colonel Le Linh. Seven PL battalions also participated.

On 21 May, RLG forces attempted to seize the Plain. The battle lasted 170 days (until 15 November 1972). The communists claimed to have killed 1,200 troops and captured 80.&lt;ref&gt;''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

When PAVN launched the ''Nguyễn Huệ Offensive'' (known in the West as the [[Easter Offensive]]) into South Vietnam on 30 March, massive U.S. air support was required inside South Vietnam and its air strikes in Laos dropped to their lowest point since 1965.

In northern Laos, the communists made additional gains during the year but failed to overwhelm government forces. In November, the Pathet Lao agreed to meet with Laotian government representatives to discuss a cease-fire.

The war had resulted in a large number of refugees with a peak number of 378,800 internally displaced persons under government control in October 1973.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13" /&gt;

=== 1973–74 ===
[[File:Vientianne1973.jpg|thumb|left|Pathet Lao soldiers in Vientiane, Laos, 1973]]
{{Main article|Paris Peace Accord}}
The US pulled out of Laos in 1973, as stipulated by the [[Paris Peace Accord]]. North Vietnam was not required to remove its forces under the terms of the treaty.

The national government was forced to accept the Pathet Lao into the government.
During 1974 and 1975 the balance of power in Laos shifted steadily in favour of the Pathēt Lao as the U.S. disengaged itself from Indochina. Prime Minister [[Souvanna Phouma]] was tired and demoralised, and following a heart attack in mid-1974 he spent some months recuperating in France, after which he announced that he would retire from politics following the elections scheduled for early 1976.
[[File:Hmong woman and child in Laos 1973.jpg|thumb|[[Hmong people|Hmong]] woman and child at [[Long Tieng]], Laos military base in 1973.]]
The anti-communist forces were thus leaderless, and also divided and deeply mired in corruption. [[Souphanouvong]], by contrast, was confident and a master political tactician, and had behind him the disciplined cadres of the communist party and the Pathēt Lao forces and the North Vietnamese army. The end of American aid also meant the mass demobilization of most of the non-Pathēt Lao military forces in the country. The Pathēt Lao on the other hand continued to be both funded and equipped by North Vietnam.

In May 1974 Souphanouvong put forward an 18-point plan for "National Reconstruction", which was unanimously adopted&amp;nbsp;– a sign of his increasing dominance. The plan was mostly uncontroversial, with renewed promises of free elections, democratic rights and respect for religion, as well as constructive economic policies. But press censorship was introduced in the name of "national unity", making it more difficult for non-communist forces to organise politically in response to the creeping Pathēt Lao takeover. In January 1975 all public meetings and demonstrations were banned. Recognising the trend of events, influential business and political figures began to move their assets, and in some cases themselves, to Thailand, France or the U.S.

=== Taking of Vientiane ===
In March 1975 the North Vietnamese began their final military offensive in South Vietnam, which by the end of April carried them to victory with the [[fall of Saigon]]. Thirteen days earlier the [[Khmer Rouge]] army had captured [[Phnom Penh]]. The Pathēt Lao now knew that victory was within reach, and with the Vietnam War over the North Vietnamese authorised the seizure of power in Laos. Pathēt Lao forces on the Plain of Jars supported by North Vietnamese heavy artillery and other units began advancing westward.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In late April, the Pathēt Lao took the government outpost at Sala Phou Khoum crossroads which opened up Route 13 to a Pathēt Lao advance toward Muang Kassy. For the non-Pathēt Lao elements in the government, compromise seemed better than allowing what had happened in Cambodia and South Vietnam to happen in Laos. A surrender was thought to be better than a change of power by force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Demonstrations broke out in Vientiane, denouncing the rightists and demanding political change. Rightist ministers resigned from the government and fled the country, followed by senior Royal Lao Army commanders. A Pathēt Lao minister took over the defence portfolio, removing any chance of the Army resisting the Pathēt Lao takeover. Prime Minister [[Souvanna Phouma]], dreading further conflict and apparently trusting [[Souphanouvong]]'s promises of a moderate policy, gave instructions that the Pathēt Lao were not to be resisted, and the U.S. began to withdraw its diplomatic personnel.

The Pathēt Lao army entered the major towns of southern Laos during May, and in early June occupied Luang Phrabāng. Panic broke out in Vientiane as most of the business class and many officials, officers and others who had collaborated with the U.S. scrambled to get their families and property across the Mekong to Thailand. Recognising that the cause was lost, Vang Pao led thousands of his Hmong fighters and their families into exile&amp;nbsp;– eventually about a third of all the Lao Hmong left the country. Pathēt Lao forces captured Vientiane in August.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://robolenin.com/2014/05/29/glory-of-laos-the-lao-national-museum/ |title=Glory of Laos: The Lao National Museum |website=Robolenin.com |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a few months the Pathēt Lao appeared to honour their promises of moderation. The shell of the coalition government was preserved, there were no arrests or show-trials, and private property was respected. Diplomatic relations with the U.S. were maintained, despite an immediate cut-off of all U.S. aid. (Other western countries continued to offer aid, and Soviet and eastern European technicians began to arrive to replace the departed Americans.) But in December there was a sharp change in policy. A joint meeting of the government and the Consultative Council was held, at which Souphanouvong demanded immediate change. There was no resistance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

On 2 December when [[Vientiane]] fell to the [[Pathet Lao]] King [[Savang Vatthana]] agreed to abdicate, and Souvanna Phouma resigned. The Lao People's Democratic Republic was proclaimed, with Souphanouvong as [[President of Laos|President]]. [[Kaisôn Phomvihān]] emerged from the shadows to become Prime Minister and the real ruler of the country. No more was heard of elections or political freedoms: non-communist newspapers were closed, and a large-scale purge of the civil service, army and police was launched. Thousands were dispatched for "re-education" in remote parts of the country, where many died and many more were kept for up to ten years. The vast majority of the royal family of Laos, including the deposed king, were also sent to the "re-education camps" and eventually died due to hard labor in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dWIj5Q8l08wC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=laotian+royal+family+executed#v=onepage&amp;q=laotian%20royal%20family%20executed&amp;f=false | title=Tragic Mountains: The Hmong, the Americans, and the Secret Wars for Laos, 1942-1992| isbn=978-0253207562| last1=Hamilton-Merritt| first1=Jane| year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted a renewed flight from the country. "About 90 percent" of Laos's "intellectuals, technicians, and officials" left Laos following the communist takeover. Many of the professional and intellectual class, who had initially been willing to work for the new regime, changed their minds and left&amp;nbsp;– a much easier thing to do from Laos than from either Vietnam or Cambodia. In proportional terms, Laos experienced the largest refugee flight of the Indochina nations with 300,000 people out of a total population of 3 million crossing the border into Thailand.&lt;ref name="The Black Book of Communism"/&gt;

Once in power, the Pathet Lao economically cut its ties to all its neighbors (including China) with the exception of the DRV and signed a treaty of friendship with Hanoi. The treaty allowed the Vietnamese to station soldiers within Laos and to place advisers throughout the government and economy. This is considered by most historians and journalists to be the end of the Second Indochina War. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Evacuation of the Hmong ==
A dramatic event during the takeover of Laos by the communists was the evacuation of Vang Pao and other Hmong leaders by air from [[Long Tieng]]. The end came for Vang Pao on 5 May 1975 when he was called before Souvanna Phouma, the Prime Minister of Laos, and ordered to cooperate with the communist Pathet Lao. Vang Pao took the general's stars off his collar, threw them on the desk of Souvanna Phouma, and stalked out of the room. Four days later the official Pathet Lao newspaper warned that the [[Hmong people]] would be exterminated "to the last root."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton, ''Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975–1982'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2010, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Daniels]], Vang Pao's CIA case officer, was the only American remaining in Long Tieng and he began to plan an evacuation of the Hmong. However, he had only one airplane to evacuate the 3,500 Hmong leaders and families he judged to be at risk of execution by the Pathet Lao then advancing on Long Tieng. Brigadier General [[Harry C. Aderholt|Heinie Aderholt]] in Bangkok helped to find additional planes and sent three pilots flying two C-46 and one C-130 transport aircraft to Long Tieng. The planes were "[[wikt:sheep-dip|sheep-dipped]]" to remove any U.S. markings as the operation was carried out in secret. The pilots were American civilians: Les Strouse, Matt Hoff, and Al Rich.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

With the three American planes, the evacuation began in earnest on 13 May with each transport aircraft making four flights each that day from Long Tieng to [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base|Udorn]], Thailand and transporting more than 65 people per airplane on each trip&amp;nbsp;– far more than the 35 maximum passengers dictated by safety conditions at mountain-ringed Long Tieng. Thousands of Hmong clustered around the airstrip at Long Tieng awaiting evacuation and the situation became increasingly ugly. On 14 May, Vang Pao and Jerry Daniels were evacuated secretly by helicopter to Thailand and the air evacuation came to an end. The next day the Pathet Lao marched into Long Tieng unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 57–58; See also Morrison, Gayle, L. ''Sky is Falling: an Oral History of the CIA's evacuation of the Hmong from Laos'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Daniels accompanied Vang Pao to exile in Montana and then returned to Thailand to help the Hmong refugees there.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

What nobody had anticipated was the tens of thousands of Hmong left behind in Long Tieng and Laos would follow Vang Pao and other Hmong leaders to Thailand. By the end of 1975 about 40,000 Hmong had succeeded to reaching Thailand, traveling on foot through the mountains and floating across the [[Mekong River]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 60&lt;/ref&gt; How many died or were killed in the attempt to escape Laos is not known, but the flight of Hmong and other Laotian highland peoples into Thailand would continue for many more years. They faced repression at home from the communist government as the price of their collaboration with the Americans. Most of the Hmong in Thailand would eventually be resettled in the United States and other countries. Between 1975 and 1982, 53,700 Hmong and other highland Laotian refugees were [[Hmong American|resettled in the United States]] and thousands more in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Vietnam War]], the Laotian War has been almost forgotten by the majority of people around the world, even in the United States and Vietnam.

Twenty-two years following the end of the Laotian War, on 15 May 1997, the U.S. officially acknowledged its role in the Secret War. A memorial to honor of American and Hmong contributions to U.S. air and ground combat efforts during the conflict was established by the [[Lao Veterans of America]], [[the Center for Public Policy Analysis]], in cooperation with the [[US Congress]] and others. The [[Laos Memorial]] is located on the grounds of the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] between the [[John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame]] and the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]].

===Plight of Hmong and other US-allied veterans===
Many former ethnic Hmong and Laotian veterans and their families, led by Colonel Wangyee Vang of the [[Lao Veterans of America Institute]] and [[Lao Veterans of America]] worked to establish a non-profit organization and advocate for honorary [[U.S. citizen]]ship for the Secret Army veterans. In 2000, the [[Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000]] was passed by the Republican-controlled [[US Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].

Many of the Hmong people have come down from the mountains and surrendered to the Lao government, while others found their way to refugee camps in Thailand. In 2008, however, a repatriation agreement between the Thai and Lao governments resulted in a mass forced deportation of the people in these camps, and reports of atrocities committed against them by the Lao military spurred activist groups to try and persuade the Thai government to keep granting asylum to the refugees, but to no avail.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2004, following several years of pressure from a coalition of U.S. [[human rights activists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n20_v47/ai_17443642 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070705214752/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n20_v47/ai_17443642 |archive-date=5 July 2007 |title="Acts of Betrayal: Persecution of Hmong", by Michael Johns, ''National Review'', 23 October 1995 |dead-url=yes |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. government reversed its policy of denying immigration to Hmong who had fled Laos in the 1990s for refugee camps in Thailand. In a major victory for the Hmong, the US government recognized some 15,000 Hmong as political refugees and afforded them expedited U.S. immigration rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvo.com/beaulier/hmongimmigration/ |title=Hmong Immigration |website=Nvo.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507165941/http://www.nvo.com/beaulier/hmongimmigration/ |archivedate=7 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of bombardment===
The U.S. dropped 2,756,941 tons of [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] on 113,716 Laotian sites in 230,516 sorties between 1965 and 1973 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Kuznick, Peter, "The Untold History of the United States" (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2012), p. 389 citing Marilyn B. Young, ''The Vietnam Wars, 1945–1990'' (New York: [[Harper Perennial]], 1991), pp. 234–236; and Fred Branfman, ''Voices of the Plain of Jars: Life Under an Air War'' (New York: [[Harper &amp; Row]], 1972), pp. 3 and 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1969, the [[Plain of Jars|Plain of Jar]] was largely deserted.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Kuznick, Peter, "The Untold History of the United States" (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 2012), p. 389 ''citing'' "Marilyn B. Young, "The Vietnam Wars, 1945-1990" (New York: Harper Perennial, 1991), p. 234-236; and Fred Branfman, "Voices of the Plain of Jars: Life under an Air War" (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972), pp. 3 and 18-20&lt;/ref&gt; 

U.S. aircraft dropped more ordnance on Laos than on all countries during [[World War II]], leaving Laos with about 78 million pieces of [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO) by the end of the war.{{sfn|Khamvongsa|Russell|2009|p=282}} Casualties continue to mount from UXO dropped by the U.S. and Laotian Air Forces from 1964 to 1973. It has been reported that, between 1964 and 1973, areas controlled by the invading [[communist]] North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao were hit by an average of one [[B-52|B‑52]] bomb-load every eight minutes, 24 hours a day. More than 2 million tons of bombs were dropped on Laos, particularly on [[Xiangkhouang Province]], 30 percent of which failed to explode immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/03/laos-cluster-bombs-uxo-deaths | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Forty years on, Laos reaps bitter harvest of the secret war | first=Ian | last=MacKinnon | date=3 December 2008 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UXO remains dangerous to persons coming in contact, purposefully or accidentally, with bombs. Casualties in Laos from UXO are estimated at 12,000 since 1973. Thirty-three years after the last bomb was dropped and after decades of UXO clearance programs, 59 people were known to have been killed or injured by UXO in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maic.jmu.edu/journal/12.1cp/laopdr/laopdr.htm |title=James Madison University - CISR Home |website=Maic.jmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; So abundant are the remnants of bombs on the [[Plain of Jars]] that the collection and sale of scrap metal from bombs has been a major industry since the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; About 300 Laotians are killed or injured per year by UXO.{{sfn|Khamvongsa|Russell|2009|p=282}}

[[File:Rotterdam kunstwerk lost luggage depot.jpg|thumb|300px|Sculpture ''Lost Luggage Depot'' (2001) by the Canadian artist Jeff Wall, Wilhelminakade, Rotterdam]]
'''Lost luggage''' is [[luggage]] conveyed by a [[common carrier|public carrier]] such as an airline, seafaring cruise ship, shipping company, or railway which fails to arrive at the correct destination with the passenger. In the United States, an average of 1 in 150 people have their checked baggage misdirected or left behind each year.

==Issues==
Luggage is more likely to be lost or misdirected if the journey has several legs, as each transfer between different vehicles increases the chance that bags will be mishandled. There are many causes of lost luggage. If a passenger arrives late for a flight, there may not be time for their luggage to be loaded onto the plane. If [[bag tag|tags]] are accidentally torn off, the airport may not know where to send the luggage. Human error is also common: tags may be misread or luggage may be sent to the wrong place. Occasionally, a plane may lack sufficient space or have reached its [[maximum takeoff weight]]. Security delays can also cause bags to arrive on a later flight than their owner. Luggage is taken through customs after its owner claims it.

Most lost luggage is quickly sent by the airline to the correct destination. Airlines will often reimburse passengers for toiletries, clothing, and other essentials if the arrival airport is away from the passenger's home area. In most cases, when delayed luggage arrives, a courier service will deliver it to the passenger's home or hotel. The airline usually pays for this.

In case of lost luggage, travelers are advised to carry all essentials in a carry-on bag, including a change of clothes and anything they would be greatly troubled to lose because of its monetary or emotional value (this excludes security restricted items, that can not be carried inside the passenger cabin). Occasionally luggage is completely lost and cannot be recovered. The airline will then normally compensate the owner. The passenger must then list the contents of their baggage and file a claim.

Bags can also be damaged during travel, but most damage (such as broken wheels and handles) is not covered under the airlines' contract of carriage. Some airlines, however, will still repair such damage as a good faith gesture, or offer a discount voucher for a future flight. In general airlines regard the purpose of luggage to be the protection of its contents during transit. If the luggage is damaged, even severely, but the contents are unharmed, then airlines regard the luggage as having fulfilled its purpose and will not compensate owners.

==Compensation==
Compensation for lost luggage is governed by the [[Montreal Convention]] and its predecessor the [[Warsaw Convention]]. Per the Montreal Convention, the maximum liability of an airline per lost checked item is 1131 [[special drawing rights]] (SDR), while under the Warsaw Convention the maximum liability is 17 SDR per kilogram.

==Unclaimed baggage center==
Most airlines maintain stores where they sell the contents of lost or abandoned luggage. If a baggage is never recovered, it is usually because it has been mistaken by another passenger as his or her own baggage. Alternatively it could have been stolen either by another passenger or an airport employee (perhaps with an [[accomplice]]).

In 2004, a [[baggage handler]] at [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] was arrested for the theft of mail sent by airplane, including credit cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2004/09/06/daily9.html BWI baggage handler arrested for mail theft]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of unclaimed baggage in the United States, whether by being lost or misdirected, or simply forgotten by travelers, is handled by the Unclaimed Baggage Center in [[Scottsboro, Alabama|Scottsboro]], Alabama, which has contracts with most major airlines. Eventually, the luggage sent to UBC is resold for a profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/ Unclaimed Baggage Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] maintains air travel consumer reports, which include statistics on mishandled baggage. For the first quarter of 2017, [[Virgin America]] was ranked first for reports of lost luggage with 1.45 reports per 1,000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/air-travel-consumer-reports Air travel consumer reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates for lost luggage decreases year after year, due to the constant efforts made by the airlines. The handling market is $2.74&amp;nbsp;billion in 2013 and is expected to grow by 2.1% until 2023. After a significant decrease in the first decade of 2000, number of lost luggage cannot drop much more again, or at the margin only. There is now under 3‰ luggage lost per 1,000 passengers carried on US domestic flights.

'''Louis A. Barbé''' (1845–1926) was born in France&lt;ref&gt;Barbé's biography for the Institute of Journalists states that he was born in France. However the 1891 and 1901 censuses give his birthplace as Channel Islands, Guernsey. His wife was born there and it is possible that Barbé wished to consolidate his British nationality by so stating. As his father was a 'French Naval Officer' is unlikely that he was stationed in the British Channel Islands.&lt;/ref&gt; and came to [[Glasgow]] as a French teacher. He settled in Scotland and wrote innumerable books on Scottish history and biography. He was born on 15 November 1845, son of Charles Barbé, Commissaire de Marine,&lt;ref&gt;In Louis Barbé's death certificate, his father, Charles Barbé, is referred to as a 'French Naval Officer'.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cherbourg]]. His mother was Desirée Barbé, née Javelot. He was educated in France and began his teaching career as Professor of English at the College Jean-Bart,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. this translated website about the [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://copainsdavant.linternaute.com/etablissement/445691/1/college_jean_bart/&amp;ei=kXosTIOKAYipsAaU0oHhAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDcQ7gEwBg&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DCollege%2BJean-Bart,%2BDunkerque%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG Collège Jean Bart]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dunkirk|Dunkerque]]. For six years he was tutor to the Princes of [[Schaumburg-Lippe]]. In 1880, he married Alice Rosa Allen, who was the daughter of John George Allen of Guernsey. He moved to Glasgow in 1884 and was head of the Modern Languages department at the [[Glasgow Academy]] from 1884 to 1918. He was employed as a reviewer with the [[Glasgow Herald]] from 1887 to 1926 and joined the [[Institute of Journalists]] in 1893. He acted as an examiner in French at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1901 and in Modern Languages at the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in Edinburgh. His books are remarkably well-written and show no obvious French influence. He died on 10 September 1926 at [[Dunbar]], [[East Lothian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5361">'''Lynn Abrams''' is a historian and Professor of History at the [[University of Glasgow]], and a [[Fellow of the British Academy]]. She is [[Professor of Modern History (Glasgow)|Chair in Modern History at the University of Glasgow]], where her research and teaching interests include the [[History of women in the United Kingdom|history of women and gender relations in Britain]], and [[oral history]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/lynnabrams/|title= Professor Lynn  Abrams |publisher=University of Glasgow  |website=School of Humanities - Sgoil nan Daonnachdan|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Abrams is the author of 35 publications, including four books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She is co-editor of the journal [[Gender &amp; History]], along with [[Alexandra Shepard|Dr Alexandra Shepard]] and Professor Eleanor Gordon also of the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was convenor of Women's History Scotland from 2008 to 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/lynn-abrams.html|title=Lynn Abrams|website=Edinburgh University Press Books|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to promote study and research in women's and gender history.

She coordinated the public event ''Reinventing Scotland's Woollen Traditions'' in Glasgow in 2012, which explored the history and influence of knitting on Scotland, as well as the impact of it resurgence in popularity on Scotland's creative industries and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19986283|title=Knitting event explores history|date=2012-10-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 her research study on masculinity in Highland men between 1760 and 1840 was subject to media attention, when it received criticism from [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] writer [[Angus Peter Campbell]]. Abrams studied the records of courts in Inverness and found a model of "disciplined masculinity" which subsumed a previously more lawless and violent Highland culture. Campbell argued the research was flawed because of the difficulty of understand Highland society at that time without a knowledge of Gaelic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13100395.Backlash_after__wild_men_of_the_Highlands__study/|title=Backlash after 'wild men of the Highlands' study|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Abrams led a research project on the experiences of those who were rehoused in high rise flats in Glasgow in the 1960s and 1970s. The Housing, Everyday Life and Wellbeing team aimed to look at social history of public housing in Glasgow, focusing on 20th century social housing such as the [[Red Road Flats|Red Road]] high rise flats, rather than the tenement on which previous research had tended to focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/11/glasgow-red-road-flats-come-down-but-not-without-a-fight|title=Glasgow's Red Road flats come down – but not without a fight|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=2015-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scottishhousingnews.com/2712/university-study-to-record-social-history-of-glasgows-high-rises/|title=University study to record social history of Glasgow’s high rises - Scottish Housing News|date=2015-03-31|work=Scottish Housing News|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Abrams joined calls for public memorials to Scottish women accused of and executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries, saying it reflected a wider dearth of visible monuments to Scottish women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/calls-for-memorial-to-victims-of-scotland-s-witch-trials-1-4595365|title=Calls for memorial to victims of Scotland’s witch trials|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15611886.Calls_for_national_memorial_to_Scottish_witches/|title=Calls for national memorial to Scottish witches|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Abrams was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/education/three-scots-academics-honoured-with-prestigious-fellowship-1-4771415|title=Three Scots academics honoured with prestigious fellowship|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/record-number-academics-elected-british-academy|title=Record number of academics elected to British Academy {{!}} British Academy|website=British Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of her contribution to scholarship and research in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_598330_en.html|title=University of Glasgow - University news - Three UofG academics elected Fellows of the British Academy|website=www.gla.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maba Man''' (Traditional: 馬壩人, simplified: 马坝人 pinyin: mǎbà-rén) is the pre-modern hominid whose remains were discovered in 1958 in caves near the town called [[Maba, Guangdong|Maba]], near [[Shaoguan]] city in the north part of [[Guangdong]] province, [[China]].&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/17130-ancient-human-head-trauma.html|title=Ancient Human's Head Trauma Points to Foul Play|last=Welsh|first=Jennifer|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wu R.

The Maba Men lived in caves at Lion Rock, near Maba.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;  The site is now a park and tourist attraction including the possibility to visit the cave and a museum nearby.

Although described at the site as "ape-men",  the Maba Men were not really very apelike and were comparable to [[Europe]]an [[Neanderthal]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">'''Maurus Dantine''' (1688–1746) was a Belgian [[Benedictine]] of the [[Congregation of Saint-Maur]] and [[chronologist]].

==Biography==
He was born at Gonrieux near [[Namur (city)|Namur]] on 1 April 1688. Like many of the members of his [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] he was one of the so-called Appelants who in 1713 did not accept the [[Papal Bull]] "[[Unigenitus]]", but appealed to a general council. He died in the monastery of the "Blancs-Manteaux" in [[Paris]] on 3 November 1746.

==Works==
Dantine's chief merit is the work he did in [[chronology]]; he can, in reality, be called one of the founders of this branch of history, on account of the carefully elaborated plan he drew up for the great publication: "L'Art de vérifier les dates historiques, des chartes, des chroniques et autres monuments, depuis la naissance de J.-C.". He did most of the preparatory work for this publication, constructing more exact chronological tables and introducing a better method for calculating historical dates. Due to illness, he was unable to continue his labours and was obliged to leave their completion to other members of his order, his chief successor being [[Charles Clémencet]].

He also devoted himself to linguistic studies and as a result of these published a translation with commentary of the [[Psalms]] under the title: "Les psaumes traduits sur l'hébreu avec des notes" (Paris, 1739). This work attracted so much attention that in the same year a second, and in the following year a third edition became necessary.

In collaboration with [[Dom Carpentier]] he prepared a new edition of the great lexicon originally published in 1678 by [[Du Cange]], and afterwards continued by the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists, its first Benedictine editor being [[Dom Guesnié]], who was followed by [[Nicolas Toustain]] and [[Louis Le Pelletier]].

The edition of Dantine and Carpentier, half as large again as that of Du Cange, appeared in six volumes at Paris, 1733–36, under the title: "Glossarium ad scriptores mediæ et infimæ latinitatis, editio locupletior operâ et studio monachorum O.S.B." Dantine's labours greatly increased the value of this work, which is not only of the importance for the knowledge of Latin, but is also a source for the study of law and morals in the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

'''Medieval aesthetics''' refers to the collective [[Aesthetics|philosophy]] of [[beauty]] and its nature during the [[Middle Ages|Medieval period]]. [[Aesthetics]] did not exist as a field of study during the Middle Ages, and thus analyses of medieval aesthetics are taken from more general writings by influential thinkers active during the period. Medieval aesthetics is characterized by its synthesis of [[Ancient philosophy|Classical]] and [[Christian philosophy|Christian]] conceptions of beauty. The thought of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] framed by that of the [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|Neoplatonist]] [[Plotinus]] inspired the emphasis on concepts such as harmony, light, and symbolism&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/m-aesthe/#SH2a|title=Medieval Theories of Aesthetics|last=Spicher|first=Michael R.|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the [[Bible|Holy Scripture]] inspired the interrogation of the relationship between nature and the divine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/813220944|title=The Routledge companion to aesthetics|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Gaut, Berys Nigel., Lopes, Dominic.|year=|isbn=9780415782869|edition= Third|location=London|pages=27–28|oclc=813220944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought of [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]] integrated Plato and Plotinus with early Church Doctrine, while [[Thomas Aquinas|St Thomas Aquinas]] incorporated [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] into his discussion of beauty in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The theological concern of these writers has meant that their aesthetic theories received relative neglect until the 19th Century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and their influence has been extensive, especially during the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15488935|title=Art and beauty in the Middle Ages|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300036760|location=New Haven|pages=2–3|oclc=15488935}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the works of Spanish director [[Luis Buñuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Largier|first=Niklaus|date=2008-11-01|title=Praying by Numbers: An Essay on Medieval Aesthetics|url=http://rep.ucpress.edu/content/104/1/73|journal=Representations|language=en|volume=104|issue=1|pages=1–3|doi=10.1525/rep.2008.104.1.73|issn=0734-6018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
Aesthetics as a philosophical branch did not exist during the Middle Ages. This means that medieval aesthetics as a topic comprised various extractions from key thinkers made by important writers such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Edgar de Bruyne]]. This is in part due to the fact that the broader philosophical milieu was highly traditional and that 'innovation came without fanfare'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15488935|title=Art and beauty in the Middle Ages|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300036760|location=New Haven|pages=2|oclc=15488935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Eco, rather than viewing aesthetics as it is understood today as a 'particular conception of art', it must be viewed as 'the ways in which a given epoch solved for itself aesthetic problems as they presented themselves at the time to the sensibilities and culture of its people'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Origins ==
Medieval aesthetics largely derive from the Classical thought of Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus and they are informed by [[Biblical exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1527|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages.|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1|oclc=1527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Bible ===
Aesthetic consideration of the material world comes mainly from the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to Tatarkiewicz, the importation of the Greek concept of ''[[Beauty|kalos]]'' into Christian thought during the translation of the Hebrew into the Greek meant that the passage in ''[[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]]'', 'And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very beautiful,' emphasised the aesthetic qualities of creation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=5–6|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was similarly translated into the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'' which advances the mathematical nature of aesthetics and aligns the work of both God and humanity through their common manipulation of these mathematical qualities in order to create beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=7|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plato ===
In the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' the notion of the beautiful soul is introduced as more valuable than material beauty and aligns with Christian spirituality. Beauty is therefore aligned with the [[Good]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/437300350|title=Magnificence and the sublime in Medieval aesthetics : art, architecture, literature, music|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Jaeger, C. Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780230618985|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=17–18|oclc=437300350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's [[Theory of forms|theory of the forms]] underlies much of the writings of St Augustine and Pseudo-Dionysius.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The theory refers to the way in which material objects are merely the reflection or attempt at representation of an abstract reality and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Plato|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition= Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Plato's framework, the reality is determined by a [[demiurge]], but the Christian interpretation of Augustine and Dionysius holds that the forms mirror the perfection of God's own mind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This notion underlies the more significant notion of mimesis whereby art and material beauty are considered the mere reflection of the beauty of that realm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle followed Plato's example in the ''[[Hippias Major]]'' and the ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' of positing the inferiority of smell, taste and touch by connecting aesthetic experience with the higher sensations of sight and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/esthetics-of-the-middle-ages/oclc/1527|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages.|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=26|oclc=1527}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' he established some grounds for the Medieval argument that the beautiful can be equated with the good as 'he believed a tragedy could cleanse negative emotions such as fear and pity'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Plotinus ===
Plotinus is notable for his writings about beauty, which form a substantial part of what has come to be known as Neoplatonism. Plotinus particularly influenced Medieval aesthetics by expanding the notion of beauty so that it was not exclusively conceived in terms of symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/654158532|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=34–35|oclc=654158532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key thinkers ==

=== St Augustine ===
[[File:Champaigne, Philippe de - Saint Augustin - 1645-1650.jpg|thumb|St Augustine by [[Philippe de Champaigne]].]]
The aesthetics of St Augustine are less theological than that of subsequent thinkers due in part to his earlier life as a pagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=47–49|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conversion to Christianity allowed him to implant Christianity with Classical ideals, whilst innovating Platonic and [[Cicero]]nian ideas with Christian belief.&lt;ref name="1886-1980, 49"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=49|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His notion of beauty's objective existence is one of his most fundamental ideas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He writes that its objectivity can be attributed to the external existence of beauty because humans contemplate beauty without creating it itself, asserting that something 'pleases because it is beautiful'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=50|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He highlights that beauty is in and of itself an indispensable aspect of creation; it is inherently harmonious and its existence aligns with humanity's deepest, but 'proper' desires&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1527|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages.|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=20|oclc=1527}}&lt;/ref&gt; because ''measure'', ''form'' and ''order'' make something good. In his work, ''On Music,'' he asserts that beauty is the unity of disparate parts, such as lines, colours and sounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1886-1980, 49"/&gt;

Augustine also expanded the Roman notion of number in rhythm to beauty more generally by regarding it as the sole source of beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that every experience originates in and is determined by rhythm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even though he placed heavy emphasis on the beauty of number and therefore equality or balance, he also realised the purpose of contrast or the inequality of parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, he attributed the beauty of the world to the contrast of things and this means that the correct and natural place of things results in beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=50–51|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudo-Dionysius ===
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|St Thomas Aquinas by [[Carlo Crivelli]].]]
Pseudo-Dionysius continued the Classical notion that the beautiful is aligned with the good because beauty is the manifestation of goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=28|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; He justifies this assumption through his idea that God is the Cause of everything, meaning that beauty and the beautiful are the same because they have the same [[Causality|cause]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He asserts that all things have beauty because everything originates in the Cause and that this means nothing can lose its beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda K.|date=1935|title=Mediaeval Aesthetic: I. Dionysius the Pseudo-Aeropagite, and Ulrich Engelberti of Strassburg|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3045565|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39|doi=10.2307/3045565|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there exists an Absolute Beauty from which all material beauty is derived through 'emanation'; an extension of Neoplatonism. This results in the earthly encounter with divine beauty, even though it may appear imperfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=29|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a conception, according to [[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Ananda K. Coomaraswamy]], is important because Medieval aesthetics were thereafter 'fundamentally based on [his] brief treatment of the Beautiful' in ''On the Divine Names''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda K.|date=1935|title=Mediaeval Aesthetic: I. Dionysius the Pseudo-Aeropagite, and Ulrich Engelberti of Strassburg|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3045565|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=17|issue=1|pages=32|doi=10.2307/3045565|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment also involved the important step of using 'Beauty' as a [[Names and titles of God in the New Testament|divine name]], according to Brendan Thomas Sammon, which influenced how St Thomas Aquinas came to treat beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf4sw|title=The God Who Is Beauty: Beauty as a Divine Name in Thomas Aquinas and Dionysius the Areopagite|last=Sammon|first=Brendan Thomas|date=2013|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co Ltd|year=|isbn=9780227174296|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St Thomas Aquinas ===
St Thomas Aquinas gave two individualised definitions of beauty in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].''&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=247|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first asserts that the beautiful is experienced through visual pleasure, while the second states that the beautiful is a pleasurable perception.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These amount to a single definition of beauty that accounts for both subjective and objective experiences of beauty where the emphasis on sight and perception creates a holistic groundwork for understanding beauty.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; His most historically important idea regarding aesthetics was that the beautiful is pleasurable, while not all pleasures are beautiful.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Unlike his predecessors Pseudo-Dionysius who started his aesthetics from the assumption of an absolute and divine beauty, Aquinas took material beauty, subject to empiricism as his starting point.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In departing from the Platonic transcendent, Aquinas moved towards Aristotelianism which enabled the exploration of the beautiful and the good independent of each other.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=248|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move thus enabled Aquinas to develop an implicit criteria for beauty: actuality, proportion, radiance and wholeness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proportion ==
Due to the enduring legacy of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Musica'', musical principles of proportion were applied to the arts more generally, but with prominence in music and architecture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15488935|title=Art and beauty in the Middle Ages|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300036760|location=New Haven|pages=29–32|oclc=15488935}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the re-appropriation of the Pythagorean notion ''[[Musica universalis|musica mundana]]'' whereby the world was viewed as a harmonious interaction of contrasts, namely that between macrocosm and microcosm, which results in the beauty of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15488935|title=Art and beauty in the Middle Ages|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300036760|location=New Haven|pages=32|oclc=15488935}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, proportion was considered an aspect of reality because it was 'not a product of the human mind, nor an invention of the musician'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=126|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The work of bishop and philosopher, [[Robert Grosseteste]], exemplifies these assumptions as it used mathematics to explore harmony as a condition of beauty, writing, such as in his belief that the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 were the sources of musical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=226|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Umberto Eco, Medieval conceptions of beauty were based on the prior Classical attempt to link mathematics with beauty, writing, '[This conception of beauty's] many variations are reducible to the one fundamental principle of unity in variety.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15488935|title=Art and beauty in the Middle Ages|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300036760|location=New Haven|pages=29|oclc=15488935}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aesthetics also had a moral dimension borrowed from Pythagoras with particular musical proportions believed to lead to sins, for instance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

These musical principles were often enacted into architecture so that buildings would be built according to an 'order reminiscent of a musical melody'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/654158532|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F.

[[File:Robert Grosseteste.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Grosseteste]] whose work influenced Medieval thought on proportion and light.]]

== Light ==
A systematic aesthetics of light began to appear in the 13th Century and it was believed to endow physical objects with nobility and beauty because it 'constitut[ed] the essence of colour and at the same [was] the external condition of its visibility,' according to Edgar De Bruyne. The Medieval concern with [[light]] was constant throughout aesthetics because it extended the Neoplatonist notion that light was [[Emanationism|emanation]] by placing it within an [[Aristotelian cosmology]] and asserting that it was the emanation of God.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is to be found particularly in the work of Pseudo-Dionysius where the sun symbolises the eternity of light and therefore the constancy of beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Robert Grosseteste]]'s ''On Light'' is an example of the movement during the Middle Ages of trying to understand light in terms of beauty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a member of the 13th Century [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], he helped to develop a 'metaphysics of light', whereby it was believed that the world was formed by the presence of light as the straight rays of the sun impressed orderliness on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=227|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, light was intrinsically connected to heat which is revealed by the belief that male beauty comprised a 'fresh and rosy, halfway between pale and flushed' complexion, which was influenced by the soul's warming of the blood because the soul had properties of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/654158532|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=55|oclc=654158532}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bruyne also points to the contemporary focus on rare stones and metals as evincing the aesthetics of light because the Latin etymologies of the French for bronze, gold and silver reflect a belief that they were made of illuminated air and that this was the source of the beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/654158532|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=56|oclc=654158532}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Symbolism ==
[[Johan Huizinga|J. Huizinga]] points to the importance of [[symbol]]ism during the Middle Ages as a way of comprehending the purpose of existence and is therefore key to understanding the Medieval paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15488935|title=Art and beauty in the Middle Ages|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300036760|location=New Haven|pages=52–53|oclc=15488935}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, aesthetics were underlaid by theological and philosophical principles because the base assumption of the era was that God created everything in His likeness, meaning that aspects of His being could be perceived through a symbolic view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1527|title=The esthetics of the Middle Ages.|last=de Bruyne|first=Edgar|date=1969|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67–68|oclc=1527}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, art did not explicitly depict the transcendentals of truth and beauty because symbolism was instead considered the closest way to apprehending 'traces' of the transcendentals in creation.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=291|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representation (arts)|Representational art]] was imbued with symbolism because it was considered the balance between truth as a universal concept grounded in natural observation and the attempt to depict the spiritual world, which is inherently different to reality and thus required its idealisation without distorting truth.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

As outlined by Tatartkiewicz, architecture was heavily founded upon notions of symbolism based on numbers with 'five doors symboli[sing] the five wise virgins, and twelve columns the twelve apostles. Pulpits were supported by eleven columns, symbolising the eleven apostles who were present at the Descent of the Holy Ghost, and the ciborium on ten columns symbolises the apostles who were not present at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=20-21|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently churches evinced considerable symbolism, which is particularly noticeable in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]] where the writing of Pseudo-Dionysius enjoyed considerable attention, as his notion of emanation allowing churches to be viewed as extension of God.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979634314|title=Medieval Aesthetics|last=Tatarkiewicz|first=Władysław|publisher=|others=Barrett, C.,|year=|isbn=9783110808223|location=Berlin|pages=32|oclc=979634314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edessa Cathedral, for instance, was built so that light entered it though three windows with three facades in order to symbolise the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], whilst the roof represented the sky.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="84208">'''Roman comedy''' is represented by two Latin playwrights, [[Plautus]] (writing between c.205 and 184 BC) and [[Terence]] (writing c.166-160 BC). The works of other playwrights such as [[Livius Andronicus]], [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]] and [[Ennius]] are now lost except for a few lines quoted in other authors. 20 plays of Plautus survive complete, and 6 of Terence.

Various metres are used in the plays. As far as is known, the iambic senarii were spoken without music; trochaic septenarii (and also iambic septenarii and trochaic and iambic octonarii)&lt;ref name=For22&gt;Fortson (2008), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; were chanted or recited (or possibly sung) to the sound of a pair of pipes known as ''tībiae'' (the equivalent of the Greek [[aulos]]), played by a ''tībīcen'' ("piper"); and other metres were sung, possibly in an operatic style, to the same ''tibiae''. In Plautus about 37% of lines are unaccompanied iambic senarii,&lt;ref name=Grat&gt;A.S. Gratwick (1982), in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature'', vol. 2 part 1, pages 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; but in Terence more than half of the verses are senarii. Plautus's plays therefore had a greater amount of musical accompaniment than Terence's. Another difference between the playwrights was that polymetric songs (using metres other than iambic and trochaic) are frequent in Plautus (about 14% of the plays), but hardly used at all by Terence.&lt;ref name=For22 /&gt;

The different metres lend themselves to different moods: calm, energetic, comic, mocking, high-flown, grandiose, humorous, and so on. Certain metres are also associated with different kinds of characters; for example, old men frequently use the iambic senarius, while the iambic septenarius is often used in scenes when a prostitute is on the stage.

==The metres==
A publicly available database by Timothy J. Moore at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (see External links below) usefully identifies the metre of every line of the two poets (based on the work of [[Cesare Questa]] and [[Wallace Lindsay]]) and detailed statistics for the use of the various metres. From this database it is apparent that by far the commonest metres are the following two:
*Iambic senarii (ia6): 11,170 lines
::| x – x – | x – x – | x – u – |
*Trochaic septenarii (tr7): 10,019 lines
::| – x – x | – x – x || – x – x | – u – |

The following iambic and trochaic lines are less common:
*Iambic septenarii (ia7): 1,718 lines
::| x – x – | x – u – || x – x – | x – – | 
*Iambic octonarii (ia8): 1,267 lines
::| x – x – | x – x – | x – x – | x – u – |
*Trochaic octonarii (tr8): 211 lines
::| – x – x | – x – x || – x – x | – x – – |

The following are found only in Plautus:
*Anapaestic septenarii (an7): 216 lines
::| u u – u u – | u u – u u – || u u – u u – | u u – – |
*Anapaestic octonarii (an8): 212 lines
::| u u – u u – | u u – u u – || u u – u u – | u u – u u – |
*Anapaestic quaternarii (an4): (at least) 135 lines
::| u u – u u – | u u – u u – |

The following are used for songs, and are found mainly in Plautus:
*Bacchiac quaternarii (ba4): 375 lines
::| x – – | x – – || x – – | x – – |
*Cretic quaternarii (cr4): 259 lines
::| – x – | – u – || – x – | – u – |

In the above schemata, the symbol "–" represents a long element or ''longum'', "u" a short element or ''breve'', and "x" an ''anceps'', an element that can be either long or short. Note that the schemata above are the basic patterns, and do not take into account the variations which may occur, for example the substitution of two short syllables for a long one, or vice versa. These are explained in greater detail below.

Together, the metres listed above account for all but about 1% of the 27,228 lines of the two poets.

These metres are used in different proportions by the two playwrights. In Plautus, 47% of the lines are iambic, 43% trochaic, and 10% in other metres (mostly anapaestic, bacchiac, and cretic). In Terence, 75% of the lines are iambic, 24% trochaic, and only 1% in other metres (bacchiac and cretic).

In Plautus, 37% of the lines are unaccompanied iambic senarii, but in Terence 56%. More than 4% of Plautus's lines are anapaestic, but this metre is not used at all in Terence. The trochaic septenarius is much commoner in Plautus (41%) than in Terence (22%). The trochaic octonarius is slightly more frequent in Terence (1.5%) than in Plautus (0.6%).

A change of metre in Plautus often accompanies the exit or entrance of a character, and thus frames a scene.&lt;ref&gt;Moore in ''Terentius Poeta'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times it indicates a change of pace, such as when Amphitruo's slave Sosia suddenly changes from iambic octonarii to a more excited cretic metre when he begins to describe a battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Amphitruo'' 219ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Terence different metres accompany different characters: for example, in each of Terence's plays, the woman loved by a young man uses iambic septenarii; in the ''Heauton Timorumenos'', ''Eunuchus'', and ''Phormio'', one of the two young men is associated with trochaics, the other with iambics.&lt;ref&gt;Moore in ''Terentius Poeta'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there can be frequent changes of metre within a single scene.

About 15% of Plautus's plays on average consists of polymetric ''cantica'' (songs in a mixture of metres).&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro, p. 487-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In these, the most common metres are the bacchius (x – – ) and cretic (– x –), together with anapaests (u u –), but sometimes with other metres mixed in. One play (''Miles'') has no polymetric cantica, but ''Casina'' has four. Because of metrical ambiguities, the analysis of the metres of cantica can be disputed.

==The ABC metrical pattern==
It has been noted that in both playwrights, but especially in Plautus, the use of different metres tends to form a pattern, which Moore refers to as the "ABC succession".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', pp. 237-42, 253-8, 305-8, 367-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Often a play can be divided into sections, which follow the pattern: A = iambic senarii, B = other metres, C = trochaic septenarii. In Plautus's ''Menaechmi'', for example, the first four sections follow the ABC scheme, and only the 5th is different; thus the whole scheme is ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ACBCBC. In his ''Pseudolus'', in the same way, the ABC pattern is used four times, followed by a final scene of 91 lines in other metres, making ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, B. However, not all plays follow this scheme. For example, in Terence's ''Adelphoe'', the pattern is ABCBAB, ABC, BCACB, AC, ABABC. In general it appears that Terence changes mode more frequently than Plautus.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of Plautus's plays (''Cistellaria'', ''Stichus'', ''Epidicus'', and ''Persa'') open directly with music, omitting the customary expository speech in unaccompanied iambic senarii.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', pp. 243-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The B-sections of the plays tend to be songs in which the characters express their mood or character, or sing of love. The C-sections (in trochaic septenarii) tend to be associated with advancement of the plot. "The beginning of the first long series of trochaic septenarii usually marks a moment at which, after exposition and presentation of character, the plot begins to proceed in earnest." (Moore)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; When a playwright moves directly from A to C, it often marks urgency or an especially significant moment in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'' p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosody of Plautus and Terence==
===Brevis brevians (iambic shortening)===
The prosody and grammar of Plautus and Terence differ slightly from that of later poets such as Virgil and Ovid, and they tend to follow the rhythms of spoken Latin rather than literary rules. One such difference is the phenomenon of ''brevis brevians'' or "iambic shortening", in which an iambic rhythm (u –) can change to a pyrrhic (u u), provided that the long syllable is unstressed and does not coincide with a long element in the metre. (The meaning of ''brevis brevians'' is "a short syllable which shortens (a following long one)".)&lt;ref&gt;Article "Brevis Brevians", ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, ''apúd me'' "at my house", in its normal pronunciation where ''púd'' is accented, will be scanned (u – –) as expected, but ''apŭd mé'' "at ''my'' house" (with emphasis on ''mé'') is scanned (u u –).&lt;ref name=Grat /&gt;

In some examples, a stressed syllable immediately follows the iamb: ''&lt;u&gt;Iovĭs&lt;/u&gt; iússu'', ''&lt;u&gt;volŏ&lt;/u&gt; scíre'', ''&lt;u&gt;minŭs&lt;/u&gt; qu(am) úllus'', ''&lt;u&gt;volŭp&lt;/u&gt;tás mea''; in others, the stressed syllable is further away: ''&lt;u&gt;quíd ĕst&lt;/u&gt;? quid métuis?'', ''&lt;u&gt;hábĕs&lt;/u&gt; quod fácias'', ''&lt;u&gt;tíb(i) hŏc&lt;/u&gt; praecípio'', ''háud &lt;u&gt;mală (e)st&lt;/u&gt; múlier''.

As a rule, ''brevis brevians'' is commonly found when a long element is resolved into two short ones;&lt;ref name=Melo&gt;de Melo (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; it is also common in the double short element in an anapaest (u u –), as in ''&lt;u&gt;vidĕn&lt;/u&gt; hanc?''. Less frequently, it is found in the second and third syllables of the sequence u u u –, as in ''nullá &lt;u&gt;mihĭ&lt;/u&gt; rés'' or ''út &lt;u&gt;egŏ&lt;/u&gt; núnc''. It cannot be found when the long syllable of the iamb coincides with a long element of the metre, as in ''si &lt;u&gt;amant&lt;/u&gt;'' (u u –) (anapaests) or in ''quia cúltr(um) &lt;u&gt;habés&lt;/u&gt;; &lt;u&gt;cocúm&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;decét&lt;/u&gt;'' (uu – u – u – u –) (iambics).

It has been speculated that a condition for ''brevis brevians'' is that the first syllable of the sequence u – should not have full stress, but that rather, in a phrase such as ''volŏ scíre'', the first word must become de-stressed before the ''brevis brevians'' can take place.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Devine , Laurence D. Stephens (1980). Review Article: Latin Prosody and Meter: Brevis Brevians. ''Classical Philology'', 75, No. 2, pp. 142-157; p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although iambic shortening is common in iambo-trochaic metres and anapaests, it is almost never found in cretics or bacchiacs.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', pp. 191, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elision===
[[Elision]] (the removal or partial removal of a final vowel when the next word starts with a vowel or h) is "far more frequent and various in Plautus and Terence than in other Latin verse-writers".&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick, ''Menaechmi'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the trochaic septenarii lines which follow:
:áttat! íllic húc itúrust. íbo ego íllic óbviám,
:néque ego hunc hóminem huc hódie ad áedis hás sinam úmquam accéderé&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Amphitruo'' 263-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

are pronounced approximately as:

:áttat! íllĭc húc itúrust. / íb' eg' íllīc óbviám,
:néqu' eg' hunc hómin' huc hódi' ad áedis / hás sin' úmqu' accéderé

:| – u – – | – u – – || – u – – | – u – |
:| uu u uu – | uu u – – || – u – – | – u – |

:"Aha! here he comes; I will go to meet him,
:nor shall I ever allow this man to come here near to this house today."

Note that a final syllable ending in -m (such as in ''hominem'' or ''umquam'') will also be elided. Long open monosyllables such as ''de, quae, hi, dum, quom, rem'' are sometimes totally elided, and sometimes merely shortened.&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick, ''Menaechmi'' p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barsby (1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

How exactly an elision was pronounced is unknown. It is possible that a short vowel was completely omitted. When a long vowel was involved, however, it is probable that an element of it could still be heard,&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in W. Sidney Allen, ''Vox Latina'', 2nd ed. (1978) pp. 78-82.&lt;/ref&gt; for example in the following line, where complete omission might cause ambiguity:&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Amphitruo'' 278.&lt;/ref&gt;
:óptum(o) óptum(e) óptum(am) óperam / dás, datám pulchré locás

:| – u – u | – u uu – || – u – – | – u – |

:"You are giving an excellent service excellently for the most Excellent; and you will be rewarded well for your gift."

Sometimes in Plautus (but not in Terence)&lt;ref name="Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 54"&gt;Gratwick, ''Menaechmi'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; there can be a hiatus (i.e. no elision) between vowels at the break between the two halves of a verse, that is after the fifth element of a senarius or the 8th element of a septenarius. There can also be [[brevis in longo]] at this point. But frequently at the break there is no hiatus but an elision. Elision can also take place when there is a change of speaker in the middle of a line.

===Prodelision===
Prodelision (the removal of the first vowel of ''est'' or ''es'') is also common, for example ''pugnatumst'' for ''pugnatum est'' and ''ituru'st'' for ''iturus est''.&lt;ref name=Melo /&gt;

===Synizesis===
Quite commonly in Plautus the two adjacent vowels in words such as ''eosdem, ni(h)il, eum, eo, huius, eius, cuius, mi(h)i, meas, tuom'' were merged into one syllable by a process known as [[synizesis]]. However, if it suited the metre, they could also be kept separate.

===Other points===
Vowels which later became shortened before -t, -l, or -r retained their length in Plautus, e.g. ''velīt'', ''habēt'', ''labōr'', ''habitāt'', ''mātēr'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, ''Captivi'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''miles'' was still pronounced ''miless''.&lt;ref&gt;W. de Melo, ''Amphitryon'' (etc.), (Loeb Classical Library), introduction, p. lxxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plautus also made use of alternative forms, such as ''sim/siem'', ''dem/duim'', ''surpio/surripio'', ''dixti/dixisti'', ''malim/mavelim'', ''ille/illĭc'', ''me/med'', ''te/ted'', ''hau/haud'', when it suited his metre.&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick, ''Menaechmi'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In words ending in -us, such as ''fluctibu(s)'', the -s could be omitted.

Words of the rhythm | u u u x |, such as ''malitia'' or ''facilius'', appear usually to have been stressed on the first syllable in both poets.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay ''Captivi'' p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mute plus liquid consonant (e.g. ''tr'' in ''patrem'') did not make the previous syllable long in Plautus or Terence. Some words ending in ''-e'', such as ''nempe'', ''unde'' could be pronounced ''nemp’'', ''und’'' before a consonant.&lt;ref name=Melo /&gt;

The pronoun ''hic'' "this man", which was later pronounced ''hicc'',&lt;ref&gt;W. Sidney Allen ''Vox Latina'', pp. 64-77.&lt;/ref&gt; was still pronounced with a single c in Plautus. The combinations ''hic quidem'' and ''si quidem'' can be pronounced with a short vowel in the first syllable, i.e. either | u u – | or | – u – |.&lt;ref name=Melo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barsby (1999), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse ictus and accent===
There is some controversy among scholars over whether Greek and Latin verse had a regular "beat" (''ictus'') like modern western music.&lt;ref&gt;Denniston, J.D., Article "Metre, Greek", ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'' 2nd ed. p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Sturtevant (1929); Beare (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; On one side, supporting the idea of ictus, are scholars such as [[W. Sidney Allen]],&lt;ref&gt;Allen, W.S. ''Vox Graeca'', 2nd ed. (1974) p. 120, 3rd ed. (1987) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Pearson,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Lionel (1990). ''Aristoxenus: Elementa rhythmica. The fragment of Book II and the additional evidence for Aristoxenean rhythmic theory'' (Oxford), p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; and from an earlier generation [[Edgar Howard Sturtevant|E.H. Sturtevant]] and [[Wallace Lindsay]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, ''Captivi'', pp. 861ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Sturtevant writes: "It is scarcely possible any longer to doubt that accent was an important feature of early dramatic verse; the quantitative nature of the measures was carefully preserved, but at the same time accent was constantly taken into account."&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant (1919), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many scholars, such as [[Paul Maas (classical scholar)|Paul Maas]], [[Cesare Questa]], and Wolfgang de Melo argue that there was no beat or "ictus"; in their view, rhythm is "simply the regulated sequence of short and long syllables".&lt;ref name=Melo /&gt; Similarly, Benjamin Fortson writes: "The theory that there was a verse-ictus, never universally accepted, has by now been thoroughly discredited."&lt;ref&gt;Fortson, B. in James Clackson "A Companion to the Latin Language". Wiley-Blackwell (2011); Fortson (2008), pp. 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Gratwick, in his edition of the ''Menaechmi'', takes an intermediate position, rejecting "both the Anglo-German view that the lines are isochronous with a regular metrical beat attached to every longum, and the Franco-Italian view that there is no ictus at all in such verses".&lt;ref name=Grot&gt;Groton (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

One fact which is generally agreed on is that in iambic and trochaic metres, there was usually a fairly strong agreement between where the ictus is assumed to be and the accent of the words. Thus in iambics a word-accent is generally heard on the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th elements of the line:
:Ne quís mirétur quí sim, páucis éloquár.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Aulularia'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;
:| – – – – | – – – – | – – u – |
:"In case anyone is wondering who I am, let me explain briefly."

Whereas in trochaics, the accent is usually heard on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements:
:vívo fít quod númquam quísquam / mórtuó faciét mihí.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Amphitruo'' 459.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| – – – – | – – – – || – u – uu | – u – |
:"It's happening to me alive what no one will ever do to me when I am dead!"

Thus even though both lines begin with a series of long syllables, it is immediately obvious on reading them that the first is iambic and second trochaic. Those who argue that there is no ictus say that, given that there is generally a word-break (''caesura'') after the 5th element of the iambic senarius, the word accents tend to fall naturally on the second and fourth elements rather than on the ''anceps'' elements.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final metron, there is often a clash between ictus and accent. Gratwick's view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially at the beginning and end of the line, to avoid monotony.

Another question is whether, if there was a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the ''anceps'' syllables were long or short.&lt;ref name=Grot /&gt; Not all scholars agree with this, however; Pearson, in his edition of Aristoxenus's treatise on rhythm, argues that it was possible or likely that in an iambic line the length of the syllables was adjusted to make the bars of equal length.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson (1990), pp. xli–xlvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of interest is whether, if there was a beat, there was one beat per foot or one every metron (group of two feet); and if it was one per metron, on which of the two long elements was it heard? As far as Ancient Greek poetry was concerned, "Ancient discussions of the trochaic tetrameter and similar metres repeatedly refer to one ''percussio'' per metron" (Moore).&lt;ref name=Moore162&gt;Moore, Timothy J., ''Music in Roman Comedy'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this also applied to Latin, where for example Horace describes the senarius as having six beats per line (''senos ictus''),&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Ars Poetica'' 253.&lt;/ref&gt; is unclear. Should the following trochaic septenarius be read with eight beats, for example?
:nónn(e) hac nóctu nóstra návis / húc ex pórtu Pérsicó

Or is it better to read it with four beats, as follows?
:nónn(e) hac noctu nóstra navis / húc ex portu Pérsico

After examining the evidence Moore comes to the conclusion that in Roman comedy, the pipe-player (''tibicen'') "provided some emphasis to all strong elements, maintaining the sense of feet, but that the "beats" on the odd-numbered feet were stronger."&lt;ref name=Moore162 /&gt; Similarly Gratwick, although marking all the ictus-syllabus with sublinear dots, recommends that the 1st, 3rd, and 5th ictus-positions be given a stronger sound when reading a line, unless occupied by a definitely unstressed syllable, in which case the natural word-stress should be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick ''Menaechmi'', pp. 61-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Various illustrations from the time of the Roman empire show a ''tibicen'' wearing a sort of clapper, called a ''scabillum'', on one foot. One such mosaic, showing a ''tibicen'' accompanying a dancer, is illustrated in Moore's book ''Music in Roman Comedy''.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, T.J. ''Music in Roman Comedy'', p. 160; the page is available on the Internet.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero mentions the word in connection with a mime performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Caelio'' 65.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that such a clapper was used to accompany Roman comedies.

Following the example of Gratwick in his edition of the ''Menaechmi'' edition, and Barsby in his edition of Terence's ''Eunuchus'', the position of the strong element in each foot in the iambo-trochaic metres is marked in this article, but with an accent rather than a sublinear dot. It is argued that this can help the reader with syllable division, the recognition of elisions, and division into feet.&lt;ref&gt;Barsby, ''Eunuchus'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the following iambic septenarius (Terence ''Phormio'' 820), where the three elisions (''s(um)'', ''ses(e)'', ''fratr(i)''), the brevis brevians (''utŭt''), and the pronunciation of ''meae'' as one syllable by synizesis make the rhythm of the line difficult for the untrained reader unless the ictus is marked:

:laetús s(um), utŭt meáe res sés(e) habént, / fratr(i) óptigísse quód volt.
:| – – uu – | – – u – || – – u – | u – – |
:"I am happy, however my own situation may be, that things have turned out for my brother as he wishes."

But though such markings may help with scansion and the rhythm with which the line should be read, these days it is not generally thought that the accent was heard on those syllables if there was a clash between the ictus and the natural accent of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Sonnenschein (1929); Fortson (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the word accent is at odds with the ictus, it is more natural to follow the accent (just as is the case when reading Virgil).&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick, ''Menaechmi'', p. 62; Fontaine &amp; Scafuro, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, however, an apparent clash between ictus and accent may indicate the actual pronunciation; for example, it is believed that the phrase ''volŭptás mea'' "my darling" was pronounced with the accent on ''-tas''. Similarly, ''vae miseró mihi'' "o wretched me!" appears to have been pronounced with the accent on ''-ro''.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay ''Captivi'' p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iambic metres==
===Iambic senarius===
Used for the prologues of plays and for the more serious speeches, the iambic senarius (ia6) is the commonest metre in Roman comedy&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music in Roman Comedy'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only metre which was unaccompanied by music. It is commoner in Terence than in Plautus.

The Latin line is based on the Greek [[Prosody (Greek)|iambic trimeter]], which goes as follows (in the notation used here, – is a long syllable, u a short one, and x an ''anceps'', that is, either long or short):
:| x – u – | x – u – | x – u – |

The Latin equivalent of this is slightly different and has ''anceps'' syllables in place of the first and second shorts:
:| x – x – | x – x – | x – u – |

However, the various ''anceps'' syllables in the line are not equal. Those in the 3rd and 7th positions are long (or double short) in about 60% of lines; those in 1st and 5th positions are long in 80% of lines; and the one in the 9th position is long in 90% of lines.&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick, ''Menaechmi'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, what was a short syllable in Greek (i.e. positions 3 and 5) is more often than not long in Latin, but less likely to be long than what was an ''anceps'' in the Greek line.

As well as | – – | and | u – |, the group | x – |  can be replaced by a dactyl | – uu | or by an anapaest | uu – |, except in the last two positions in the line. In the scansions below, a double short syllable replacing a long one is marked "uu". As a rule, in iambics, the dactyl is much commoner than the anapaest, and the reverse is true in trochaics; that is to say, it is much commoner for a ''longum'' syllable to be replaced by two short syllables than for an ''anceps'' to be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The final element of the line is always a single syllable, either long or ''brevis in longo''.

In most (but not all) iambic senarius lines there is a word-break or [[caesura]] after the fifth element, corresponding to the dieresis in the centre of the trochaic septenarius. However, as can be seen from the examples below, there is usually no break in the sense at this point. The main effect of this break is that the fourth element of the line usually coincides with the word-accent.

The iambic senarius is often used for exposition and explaining a situation, for example in the prologue of almost every play, such as Plautus's ''Amphitruo'':&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Amphitruo'' 97-101.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Haec úrbs est Théb(ae). in íllisc(e) hábitāt áedibús 
:Amphítruo, nátus Árgis éx Argó patré, 
:quic(um) Álcuména (e)st núpt(a), Eléctri fíliá. 
:is núnc Amphítruo práefectúst legiónibús,
:nam cúm Telebóis béllum (e)st Thébanó popló.

&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;
| – –  –  –  | – – – uu | –  – u – |
| – uu –  –  | u – – –  | –  – u – |
| – –  u  –  | – – – –  | –  – u – |
| – –  –  uu | – – – –  | uu – u – |
| – –  uu –  | – – – –  | –  – u – |
&lt;/pre&gt;
:"This city is Thebes. In that house lives
:Amphitruo, born in Argos from an Argive father,
:with whom Alcmena is married, daughter of Electer (Electryon).
:This Amphitruo is now in command of the legions,
:for the Theban people are having a war with the Teleboans."

The iambic senarius is also used for dialogue, especially when old men are speaking (6235 out of 7659 lines spoken by old men, that is more than 80% of their dialogue, are in this metre).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Meters of Roman Comedy'' database.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the following extract from Terence's ''Andria'' (35-39) spoken by the old man Simo to his freedman Sosia:
:ego póstquam t(e) ém(i), a párvol(o) út sempér tibí
:apúd me iúst(a) et clémens fúerit sérvitús 
:scis. féc(i) ex sérv(o) ut ésses líbertús mihí, 
:proptérea quód servíbas líberálitér: 
:quod hábui súmmum prétium pérsolví tibí.

&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;
| uu –  –  – | –  –  u  –  | –  –  u  – |
| u  –  –  – | –  –  –  uu | –  –  u  – |
| –  –  –  – | u  –  –  –  | –  –  u  – |
| –  uu –  – | –  –  –  –  | u  –  u  – |
| –  uu –  – | –  uu –  –  | –  –  u  – |
&lt;/pre&gt;

:"After I bought you, how from childhood onwards 
:your servitude with me was always just and mild,
:you know. From a slave I made you to be my freedman,
:because you used to serve me generously.
:I paid the highest price which I had for you."

====Meyer's law====
Very frequently in a senarius, there will be a ''[[caesura]]'' (word-break) after the 5th element. Because Latin words are accented on the penultimate syllable if this is long, this will automatically put a stress on the 4th element. Occasionally, however, a non-monosyllabic word with unstressed final syllable will end a metron, like ''amans'' in the line below. If so, by a rule called "Meyer's Law",&lt;ref name=Grat56&gt;Gratwick ''Menaechmi'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; the preceding ''anceps'' will usually be a short syllable. The effect of this rule is that the 3rd element of the metron is usually either stressed or long, but not both. In this way the basic | x – u – | rhythm of the Ancient Greek iambic trimeter remains clear:
:sed póstqu(am) '''ǎmáns''' accéssit prétium póllicéns&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Andria'' 76.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;
| –  –  u  – | –  –  –  uu | –  –  u  – |
&lt;/pre&gt;
:"But after a lover approached promising money..."

Sometimes, however, it seems that the poet will deliberately break Meyer's Law in the second metron to express a strong emotion, as in the word ''vēmenter'' "very greatly" in the following line, where the strong stress as well as the unexpected length on the normally weak 3rd position serve to emphasise the word:&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature'', vol 2 part 1, pp 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
:amóqu(e) et láud(o) et '''vḗmentér''' dēsíderó&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Hecyra'' 490; translation by Gratwick.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;
| u  –  –  – | –  –  –  –  | –  –  u  – |
&lt;/pre&gt;
:"I love and praise and oh, so badly miss her!"

It is common for violations of Meyer's law in the second metron to be followed by a four-syllable word (like ''desídero'' above)&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature'', vol. 2 part 1, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; or a monosyllable plus three-syllable (such as ''si díxerit'');&lt;ref&gt;Traill (2009);
Fortson, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; so that even though there is a clash between ictus and accent in the second metron, coincidence is restored in the third.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Fortson, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the line quoted below, the long word ''legionibus'', with its coincidence of ictus and accent, filling the third metron, makes up for the fact that the word-accent of ''praefectust'' clashes with the ictus:
:is núnc Amphítruo '''práefectúst''' legiónibús&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Amphitruo'' 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| – – – uu | – – – – | uu – u – |
:"that Amphitruo is now in command of the legions"

When Meyer's law is violated in the first metron, the following element is usually a monosyllable, maintaining the usual caesura:&lt;ref&gt;Fortson p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
:veniát quandó '''volt''', átqu(e) ita né mihi sít moráe&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Bacchides'' 224.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| uu – – – | – – uu – | uu – u – |
:"Let him come whenever he wants, so I don't have to wait."

====Luchs' law====
Another law affecting the iambic senarius is "Luchs' Law", sometimes known as "Bentley-Luchs' Law".&lt;ref name=Grat56 /&gt; This states that when an unstressed word-end coincides with the second element of the last metron, as with ''humano'' below, the first element should normally be long (or double short), not short:&lt;ref&gt;For exceptions see Fortson (2008), pp. 37ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
:humána mátre nátus, '''húmanó''' patré&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Amphitruo'' 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| – – – – | u – u – | – – u – |
:"born from a human mother and a human father"

It is argued that the rationale behind this law is that an iambic word at the beginning of the third metron might give the false impression that the line had come to an end.&lt;ref name=Melo /&gt; The rule inevitably means that the word-accent will be heard on the first element of the metron (i.e. contrary to the presumed ictus); but apparently in the last metron rhythmical considerations were more important than stress.

This law does not apply to the first metron of a line,&lt;ref name=Grat90&gt;Gratwick in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature'', vol. 2, part 1, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; so in the following line, the word ''păter'', which breaks the rule, is acceptable:

:'''Pătér''' nunc íntus sú(o) animó mōrém gerít&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Amphitruo'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| u – – – | – uu u – | – – u – |
:"At the moment Father is inside spending his time as he wishes."

The situation rarely arises in the second metron, because most lines have a caesura (word-break) after the fifth element.

====Locus Jacobsohnianus====
When there is a word-break between the second and third metron or a senarius there is sometimes a hiatus (lack of elision) at this point. This is known as a locus Jacobsohnianus, for example:&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traill (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
:PYR. edepól memóriā (e)s '''óptumá'''. || ART. offáe monént.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Miles'' 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| uu – u uu | – – u – || – – u – |
:PYR. By the god Pollux, you have a good memory! ART. It's the dinners which prompt it!

Sometimes there is even a [[brevis in longo]] (short syllable standing for a long one), as if it were the end of a line, even when there is no break in sense:
:PYR. quid, brácchi(um)? ART. íllud '''dícerĕ''' / voluí, femúr.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Miles'' 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
:| – – u – | – – u x || uu – u – |
:PYR. What, its arm? ART. I meant to say thigh.

A locus Jacobsohnianus is also sometimes found in trochaic septenarii five elements before the end of the line. Usually, just as with a real line end, the element immediately preceding the locus Jacobsohnianus is short.&lt;ref&gt;Fortson, pp. 76-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iambic septenarius===
:| x – x – | x – u – || x – x – | x – – |

The character of this metre is different from the iambic senarius or trochaic septenarius. In Plautus there almost always a break (diaeresis) in the middle of the line. Unless the diaeresis (central break) is omitted, then by Meyer's law there is always a short syllable in the penultimate place before the break.&lt;ref name=Mount684 /&gt; At the end of the line there is always a stress on the penultimate element.

Although not so frequent as the senarius, the iambic septenarius (ia7) is also reasonably common in Roman comedy. Certain characters and plays use this metre more than others; in Plautus' ''Pseudolus'', for example, there are only ten lines of iambic septenarius, occurring in sections of one or two lines; but in ''Rudens'' there are 204 lines, in ''Miles Gloriosus'' 211, and in ''Asinaria'' 322. In ''Amphitruo'' this metre does not occur at all.

The iambic septenarius is sometimes known as the "laughing metre".&lt;ref name=Mount684&gt;J.F. Mountford, article "Metre, Latin", ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 2nd edition, p. 684.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical use is the light-hearted banter of the two cunning slaves, Leonida and Libanus, in Plautus's ''Aulularia'', when ribbing each other. Here Leonida speaks:&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Asinaria'', 556-565&lt;/ref&gt;

:Edepól virtútes quí tuás / non póssis cónlaudáre 
:sic út ego póssim, quáe domí / duellíque mále fecísti. 
:n(e) ill(a) édepol pró meritó tuó / memorári múlta póssunt
:ubi fídentém fraudáverís, / ub(i) er(o) ínfidélis fúerīs,

:ubi párietés perfóderís, / in fúrt(o) ubi sís prehénsus, 
:ubi sáepe cáusam díxerís / pendéns advérsus ócto 
:artútos, áudacís virós, / valéntis vírgatóres!

:"By [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]], you could not praise your own virtues
:as well as I could, all those things which at home or in war you've done wrong!
:Indeed, by Pollux, there are a lot of things that can be mentioned to your credit:
:when you defrauded those who trusted you, when you were unfaithful to your master,
:when you deliberately perjured yourself with invented words,
:when you made holes in walls, when you were caught stealing,
:and all the times you pleaded your case when hanging in front of eight
:burly bold men, sturdy whippers!"

In Terence this metre is often used by love-struck young men, as in the following exchange (''Heautontimorumenos'' 679-89) between the young man Clinia and the cunning slave, Syrus:

In Plautus, there is usually a clean break between the two halves of the line, and this is often true of Terence too. However, sometimes Terence smooths over the break with an elision, or even omits the break altogether.&lt;ref name=Moore184&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
The iambic octonarius has two kinds, one with a break in the middle of the line, as the first pattern above. But often, instead of a mid-line break, there is a caesura or word-break 7 elements before the end of the line, so that apart from the extra syllable at the beginning, this kind somewhat resembles a trochaic septenarius.

When the break is in the middle of the line, there may be ''brevis in longo'' (a short syllable standing for a long element) at that point, as in the word ''ingerĕ'' in the first of the two lines below:

:tu qu(i) úrn(am) habés, aqu(am) íngeré; / face plén(um) ahénum sít coquó;
:te cúm secúri, cáudicáli práefició provínciáe.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Pseudolus'', 157-8; cf Moore, ''Music'', p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

| – – u – | u – u – || uu – u  – | – – u – | ia8

&lt;/pre&gt;

:"You who have the jar, bring in some water; make sure the pot is full for the cook;
:you with the axe I'm putting in charge of the wood-cutting province."

Often the iambic octonarius and the trochaic septenarius are mixed in the same passage, although the trochaic septenarius, being shorter, is a faster metre and is often associated with onward movement of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', pp. 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iambic octonarius is used more often by Terence (885 lines) than by Plautus (382 lines). In Terence's ''Eunuchus'', this metre is particularly associated with one of the two brothers, Chaerea, who has 88 lines in this metre.&lt;ref name=Moore184 /&gt; The following passage from Terence's ''Adelphoe'' ("The Brothers") is sung by another of two brothers, Ctesipho, as he enters the stage:&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Adelphoe'' 254ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Abs quívis hómine, cúm (e)st opús, / benefíci(um) accípere gáudeás:

:"From any man, when there's a need, you would be glad to receive a favour,
:but in truth what is really nice is if someone does one who ought to do it.
:O brother, brother, how can I praise you enough? One thing I know for sure,
:I shall never be able to speak highly enough of your virtue.
:And so I think I have this one thing above all more than anyone else,
:that no man has a brother more endowed with the highest qualities!"

The iambic octonarius apparently was often used in Roman tragedy for messenger speeches,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; and in Plautus it is often used by slave messengers, as in this account of the aftermath of a battle in Plautus's ''Amphitruo'' (256-261) sung by the slave Sosia. In this style the lines run smoothly on, without any central dieresis:

==Trochaic metres==
===Trochaic septenarius===
:| – x – x | – x – x || – x – x | – u – |

The second most common metre in Roman comedy in terms of lines (or the commonest, in terms of the number of words) is the trochaic septenarius (tr7). Like the other long iambic and trochaic lines, it is believed to have been chanted to the music of the tibiae (double pipes). There is usually a diaeresis in the centre of the line, and there may sometimes also be a hiatus (lack of elision) or [[brevis in longo]] (a short syllable made long by position) at this point. Trochaic lines generally start with a word which is stressed on the first syllable, making it clear that the line has a trochaic not an iambic rhythm.

According to an ancient metrical theory, the Greek version of this metre (trochaic tetrameter catalectic) was composed of an iambic trimeter with a cretic foot (– u –) added at the beginning. This seems to be true of the Latin trochaic septenarius too: the word break (dieresis or caesura) is in the same place seven elements before the end of the line, and Meyer's law and the locus Jacobsohnianus apply in the same way to both lines.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro (eds), p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following passage the god Mercury, disguised as the slave Sosia, is preventing the real Sosia from entering his own house:
:M. Híc homo sánus nón est. S. Quód mihi / práedĭcás viti(um), íd tibí (e)st. 
:quíd, malúm, non súm ego sérvos / Ámphitruónis Sósiá? 
:nónn(e) hac nóctu nóstra návis / húc ex pórtu Pérsicó 
:vénit, quáe m(e) advéxit? nónne | m(e) húc erús misít meús?
:nónn(e) ego núnc st(o) ant(e) áedes nóstras? / nón m(i) est lántern(a) ín manú? 
:nón loquŏr, nón vigiló? nonn(e) híc homo / módo me púgnis cóntudít? 
:fécit hércle, n(am) étiam mísero / núnc mihí māláe dolént. 
:quíd igitúr ego dúbit(o), aut cúr non / íntr(o) e(o) ín nostrám domúm?

&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;

| –  –  –  u | uu – uu – || –  u  – – | – u – |
| uu u  uu u | uu – –  – || –  u  – – | – u – |
&lt;/pre&gt;
:MER. This man isn't sane! SOS. The fault that you are preaching about me is yours!
:What, dammit, aren't I Amphitruo's slave Sosia?
:Didn't our ship come here last night from the Persian port,
:which brought me? Didn't my master send me here?
:Am I not standing in front of our house? Isn't there a lantern in my hand?
:Am I not talking? Am I not awake? Didn't this man just punch me with his fists?
:He did, by Hercules! Since my wretched jaw is still aching!
:So what am I waiting for? Why don't I go into our house?

In the centre of the trochaic septenarius line (corresponding to the caesura in the iambic senarius) there is usually a word-break, and in Plautus (though not in Terence) there is sometimes a hiatus (lack of elision) at this point, as in the second line below:&lt;ref name="Gratwick, Menaechmi, p. 54"/&gt;
:Fáciam quód iubés; secúrim / cápi(am) ancípit(em), atqu(e) húnc seném 
:ósse fíni dédolábo / ássulátim víscerá.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Menaechmi'', 858-59&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;
| uu – – u | – u – – || uu – uu – | – u – |
| –  u – – | – u – – || –  u –  – | – u – |
&lt;/pre&gt;
:I'll do what you order; I'll get a two-bladed axe and I'll hack off
:this old man's meat as far as his bones and chop his guts to pieces.

However, there is frequently an elision at this point, and just as in the Greek equivalent of this metre, (the [[Prosody (Greek)|trochaic tetrameter catalectic]]), some lines have no word-break at the centre point, for example the first and third below:&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Amphitruo'' 267-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

:décĕt et fácta móresqu(e) húi(u)s habére mé similés itém. 
:ítaque mé mal(um) éss(e) opórtet, cállid(um), ástut(um) ádmodúm 
:átqu(e) hunc, télo súo sibí, / malíti(a) a fóribus pélleré.
&lt;pre style="border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em"&gt;
:| uu – – u | –  – – u |  – u  –  uu | – u – | 
:| uu u – u | –  u – – || – u  –  –  | – u – |
:| –  – – – | uu u – u |  uu – uu –  | – u – |
&lt;/pre&gt;
:It is fitting that I should have actions and character similar to this man's,
:and so I ought to be wicked, cunning, very astute,
:and drive him from the doors with his own weapon, malice!

The same tendencies which apply to the alternating ''anceps'' syllables in an iambic senarius also apply in a similar way to a trochaic septenarius, namely that those elements that are always short in Greek (the 1st, 3rd, and 5th ''anceps'' syllables) are long in about 60% of lines; while those which are ''anceps'' in Greek (namely the 2nd, 4th and 6th ''anceps'' in the trochaic septenarius) are long in about 80% to 90% of lines.&lt;ref name=Grat56 /&gt; Meyer's Law and Luchs' Law also operate in the same places, counting from the end of the line backwards, as in the senarius.

===Trochaic octonarius===
:| – x – x | – x – x || – x – x | – x – – |

Much less frequent is the trochaic octonarius (tr8), which is found in both poets. It is mostly very sporadically used with just a line or two here or there in the midst of other metres. The following four-line stretch comes from Plautus' ''Pseudolus'' (161-164), where a pimp is giving instructions to three slave-girls:
:tíb(i) hŏc praecípi(o) ut níteant áedes. / hábĕs quod fácias: próper(a), ab(i) íntro.
:t(ú) esto léctistérniátōr. / t(ú) argent(um) éluit(o), íd(em) exstrúito.
:háec, qu(om) eg(o) á foró revórtar, / fácit(e) ut óffendám paráta,
:vórsa spársa, térsa stráta, / láutaqu(e) únctaqu(e) ómni(a) út sint!

:| uu – uu – | uu – – – || uu – uu – | uu u – – |
:| – – – – | – u – – || – – – uu | – – uu – |
:| – u – u | – u – – || uu u – – | – u – – |
:| – u – u | – u – u || – u – u | – u – – |

:"You, I'm instructing that the house should be sparkling clean. You've been told what to do; hurry up, go inside.
:You, be couch-strewer. You, clean the silver and also set it out.
:When I come back from the forum, make sure I find everything ready,
:and that everything is turned, sprinkled, dusted, strewn, washed, and polished!"

In the above quotation there is a contrast between the anapaestic first two lines, where the double short syllables suggest bustle and hurry, and the last two lines, where the repeated trochaic rhythm emphasises how everything has got to be when it is ready.

Sometimes both in this metre and in the trochaic septenarius the verses split into four equal parts (the so-called "square" verse), as in the last line above.&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick ''Menaechmi'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Terence lines of trochaic octonarii (interspersed with trochaic septenarii) tend to occur in clusters at moments of great emotional intensity, such as at ''Hecyra'' 516-34.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', pp. 179-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common pattern in both poets, but especially in Terence, is for trochaic octonarii to be followed first by one or two lines of trochaic septenarii, then by one or more iambic octonarii. This tr8-tr7-ia8 pattern occurs 48 times in Terence, and 6 times in Plautus.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed iambo-trochaic lines==
In the examples seen so far the same metre is used for several lines at a time; but a glance at Moore’s database shows that iambic and trochaic lines are often mixed together, as in the passage below from Terence’s ''Phormio'' (485-492), which Moore discusses in an article.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2012b), pp. 221-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In these lines the young man Phaedria pleads with the slave-owner Dorio for more time to raise the money to buy his girlfriend; Phaedria’s cousin Antipho and the slave Geta secretly listen in on the conversation.

Here the iambic octonarius and iambic senarius are used when Dorio is denying Phaedria’s request. When he seems willing to listen and the plot seems to be moving forward, the trochaic septenarius is used. The aside by the eavesdropping Antipho and his slave Geta (in italics below) is in the distinctive iambic septenarius. It is possible that in the line with ia6 the music stopped altogether for a few moments:

:PH. Dorio,
:aud(i) óbsecró . . DO. non áudió! / PH. parúmper . . DO. quín omítte mé!
:PH. áudi quód dic(am). DO. át enim táedet / i(am) áudir(e) éadem míliéns.
:PH. át nunc dícam quód lubénter / áudiás. DO. loquer(e), áudió.
:PH. nón queo t(e) éxorár(e) ut máneas / trídu(om) hóc? quo núnc abís?
:DO. mirábar sí tu míhi quicqu(am) ádferrés nov(i). ''AN. éi!''
:''metuó lenónem néquid . . GE. suó / suát capit(i)? íd(em) ego véreor!''
:PH. nondúm mihi crédis? DO. hárioláre. PH. sín fidém do? DO. fábuláe!

==Anapaestic metres==
Anapaestic metres are used frequently by Plautus (about 4.5% of all his lines), but are not found in Terence. They are based on the foot | u u – |; two feet make a metron or "dipody". The frequent substitution of dactyls (– u u)  or spondees (– –) for anapaests (u u –), and the frequent use of ''brevis brevians'' and ''synizesis'' are typical of anapaestic metres.&lt;ref name=Mount684 /&gt;

Anapaestic lines are usually based on the dimeter or quaternarius, that is a length of two metra, or four feet. According to the ancient grammarian [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Marius Victorinus]], it is characteristic of anapaestic poetry that there is usually a word-break at the end of every metron or dipody; in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s plays this is always the case.&lt;ref&gt;Danckaert, p. 2, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In Plautus it is mostly true, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Danckaert, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek anapaestic poetry it is generally assumed that the verse-ictus was heard on the second half of the foot. However, in Plautus, except in the second half of the anapaestic septenarius, the word-stress generally comes on the first half of each foot. For those scholars who believe there was no ictus in ancient poetry, this presents no problem; the fact that each metron usually ends with a word-break automatically means that the stress will be heard on the early part of the feet. But for those that support the idea of ictus, it does present a problem. As [[Wallace Lindsay|Lindsay]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, ''Captivi'', 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, "It seems difficult to believe that the same poet, who in other metres so successfully reconciles accent with ictus, should tolerate lines like: 
:Trin. 239: blandiloquentulus, harpago, mendax, 
:Bacch. 1088: stulti, stolidi, fatui, fungi, | bardi, blenni, buccones, 
:Pers. 753: hostibus victis, civibus salvis, etc."

Other Roman writers who wrote anapaests, such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Boethius]], also regularly placed the word-accent on the beginning of each foot.&lt;ref&gt;Examples in Danckaert (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Roman poets wrote anapaests without regard for ictus, or whether the Roman anapaest differed from the Greek in that the ictus came on the beginning of each foot, as in the trochaic metre, is unclear. For this reason, the ictus has not been marked in the samples below. Certainly, some half lines (such as | u u – u u – | u u – – – |) are identical in the trochaic and the anapaestic metres; and the tendency to form "square" verses is another point in common with the trochaic metre.

===Anapaestic septenarius===
This metre is used only by Plautus. It is a [[catalectic]] metre in which the last foot is shortened to a single long element. The basic scheme is theoretically:
:| u u – u u – | u u – u u – || u u – u u – | u u – – |

The anapaestic foot | u u – | is frequently replaced by a spondee | – – | or a dactyl | – u u |. In the first half of the line, as in the anapaestic octonarius, the word-accent generally comes on the beginning of each foot. However, in the second half the stress tends to swing the other way, with the accent on the second half of each foot.

Apart from a long stretch of 82 lines in ''Miles Gloriosus'', this metre is usually used sparingly, often with just a line or two mixed with other anapaestic metres. Frequently those who speak in this metre are old men or women. Here is a passage from the ''Bacchides'' (1160–65) where two old men, Nicobulus and Philoxenus, are talking:

:NIC. sed quid ĭstuc est? etsi i(am) eg(o) ĭpsus / quid sit probĕ scire puto me;
:ver(um) audir(e) eti(am) ex te studeo. / PHIL. Vidĕn hanc? NIC. Vide(o). PHIL. Haud mală (e)st mulier. 
:NIC. Pol ver(o) ista mal(a) et tu nihili. / PHIL. Quid mult(a)? eg(o) am(o). NIC. An amas? PHIL. ''Nai gar.'' (Ναὶ γάρ)
:NIC. Tun, homŏ pūtid(e), amātōr istac / fier(i) aetat(e) audes? PHIL. Qui non? 
:NIC. Quia flāgitium (e)st. PHIL. Quid opust verbis? / meo filio non s(um) iratus, 
:neque te tuŏst aequ(om) ess(e) iratum: / sĭ amant, sapienter faciunt.

:| – u u – – | – – u u – || – – u u – | u u – – |
:| – – – u u | – – u u – || u u – u u – | u u u u – |
:| – – – u u | – – u u – || – – u u u u | – – – |

:| u u – u u – | u u – – – || u u – u u – | – – – |
:| u u – u u – | – – – – || u u – u u – | – u u – |

:NIC. "But what's the problem? Even though I myself think I already know full well what it is,
:all the same I'm keen to hear it from you. PHIL. D'you see this girl? NIC. I do. PHIL. She's not a bad woman.
:NIC. By Pollux, she ''is'' a bad one, and you're worthless! PHIL. In short, I'm in love. NIC. You're in love? PHIL. I am indeed.
:NIC. You disgusting man, how dare you become a lover at your age! PHIL. Why not?
:NIC. Because it's a scandal! PHIL. What need for words? I'm not angry with my son,
:and it's not fair that you should be angry with yours. If they're in love, they are doing wisely."

Concerning the longest passage of anapaestic septenarii (''Miles Gloriosus'' 1011-93), Moore notes the close resemblance between the metre in this passage and trochaic septenarii.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'' p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The German classicist Marcus Deufert notes that the style of writing in these lines is different from the usual anapaests, in that it is more regular and there are more long syllables. He draws the conclusion that the lines from ''Miles Gloriosus'' were recited in the same way as trochaic septenarii, while other anapaestic passages (which usually contain an admixture of other metres) were sung.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro (eds), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anapaestic octonarius===
:| u u – u u – | u u – u u – || u u – u u – | u u – u u – |

Again, substitution of dactyl | – u u | or spondee | – – | for anapaest | u u – | is very common. As in a trochaic line, the word-accent comes regularly on the first syllable of each foot, and unlike in the septenarius, this is true of both halves of the line.

In the following extract from Plautus's ''Pseudolus'' (133-7), the pimp Ballio summons his slaves outside to give them instructions to prepare the house for his birthday:
:Éxit(e), ágit(e) exít(e), ignávi, / mále habit(i) ét male cónciliáti,
:quórum númquam quícquam quoíquam / vénit in mént(em) ut récte fáciant, 
:quíbus, nis(i) ad hóc exémplum expérior, / nón potest úsur(a) úsurpári. 
:néqu(e) eg(o) hominés magis ásinos númquam / víd(i), ita plágis cóstae cállent: 
:quós quom férias, tíbi plus nóceas; / é(o) en(im) ingéni(o) hi súnt flagritríbae.

:| – – uu – | – – – – || uu uu – uu | – uu – – |
:| – – – – | – – – – || uu – – – | – – uu – |
:| uu uu – – | – – uu – || – uu – – | – – – – |
:| uu uu – uu | uu – – – || – uu – – | – – – – |
:| – – uu – | uu – uu – || uu – uu – | – uu – – |

:"Come out, come on, come out, you lazy ones, worthless to own and a waste of money to buy,
:To none of whom does it ever come into their mind to do the right thing;
:and whom, unless I try this example (''uses whip''), it's impossible to get any work from them.
:I've never seen any men more like donkeys, their ribs are so calloused with blows!
:If you hit them you do yourself more harm than them, they're such whip-wearers-out by nature!"

After these five lines of anapaests, Ballio reverts to a mixture of trochaic and iambic lines for the rest of his speech.

The ictus marks above are placed in accordance with the word-accents, rather than on the second half of each foot as is sometimes done.

===Anapaestic systems===
Anapaestic metra are often used in a long series or "system" where the division into lines is not always clear and may sometimes differ in different manuscript copies.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, ''Captivi'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, however, the metra come in pairs, and in Plautus there is usually a word break at the end of the pair, but not always in the middle.

An example is the following from the ''Bacchides'', where the old man Philobulus comes on stage and sings as follows (the first two lines are anapaestic septenarii):&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Bacchides'' 1087ff&lt;/ref&gt;
:Quicumqu(e) ub(i) ubī sunt, qui fuerunt / quique futuri sunt posthac 
:stulti, stolidi, fatui, fungi, / bardi, blenni, buccones, 
:solus eg(o) omnīs long(e) antideo 
:stultiti(a) et moribus indoctis. 
:perii, pudĕt: hoc(c)ine m(e) aetatis
:ludos bis fact(um) ess(e) indigne? 
:magi(s) qu(am) id reputo, tam magis uror 
:quae meu(s) filiu(s) turbavit. 
:perditu(s) s(um) atqu(e) eradicatus s(um), 
:omnibus exemplis excrucior. 
:omnia me mala consectantur, 
:omnibus exitiis interii.

:I've died by every kind of death!

Since the short lines above come in couplets, some editors such as Lindsay (Oxford Classical Text) write them as single long lines of octonarii or septenarii.

==Bacchiac and cretic metres==
The bacchiac (x – –) and cretic (– x –) metres (together with anapaests) are used in polymetric ''cantica'' (songs).&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly found in Plautus and are rare in Terence, who has only 4 lines of bacchiacs (''Andria'' 481-84) and 15 of cretics (''Andria'' 625-38, ''Adelphi'' 610-17).&lt;ref&gt;Moore in ''Terentius Poeta'', p. 93-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eduard Fraenkel these two metres are "incomparably suited to the Latin language".&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, E. ''Plautine Elements in Plautus'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from anapaests in that popular pronunciations such as ''brevis brevians'' and ''synizesis'' are avoided.&lt;ref name=Mount684 /&gt;

A law called Spengel and Meyer's law (similar to Meyer's law in the iambic senarius) applies to bacchiacs and cretics, namely that a polysyllabic word may not end on the 5th or 11th element of a bacchiac or on the 3rd or 9th element of a cretic unless the preceding ''anceps'' is short.&lt;ref name=Melo /&gt; To put it more simply, the elements marked '''x''' in bold in the patterns below cannot be both long and stressed:
:| x – – | '''x''' – – | x – – | '''x''' – – | (bacchiac)
:| – '''x''' – | – u – || – '''x''' – | – u – | (cretic)

In bacchiacs the word-accent quite often comes after the short syllable (''ecástor sin' ómni'': u – – u – –), rather than before it, as it tends to with cretics (''máximā cópiā'': – u – – u –); some editors, therefore, mark these elements as an ictus.

===Bacchiac quaternarius===
:| x – – | x – – | x – – | x – – |

The bacchiac quaternarius (ba4) is the commonest bacchiac metre. The usual form of the foot is | u – – | or | – – – |, but variations such as | u – uu | and | uu – – | are also found. Sometimes other similar metres are mixed in. There is generally no word break (diaeresis) in the middle of the line.

The bacchiac is used both for humorous songs and for tragic. In the following passage from the ''Bacchides'' the prostitute Bacchis and her sister mock the two old men Philoxenus and Nicobulus who have knocked on their door, calling them "sheep":&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Bacchides'', 1130-1141&lt;/ref&gt;
:SOR. Ecástor sin(e) ómn(i) arbitrór maliti(a) ésse. 
:PHIL. Merit(o) hóc nobis fít, qui quid(em) húc venerímus!
:BACCH. Cogántur quid(em) íntr(o). SOR. Haud sció quid e(o) opús sit, 
:quae néc lac nec lán(am) ull(am) habént. sic sin(e) ástent.

:stult(ae) átqu(e) haud maláe / vidéntur! 
:SOR. Revórtamur íntro, sorór. NIC. Ílic(o) ámbae 
:manét(e): haec ovés / volúnt vos.

:SISTER. By [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], I think they're perfectly harmless.
:PHIL. (''aside'') We deserve this, since we have come here!
:BACCHIS. Let them be driven inside. SIS. I don't know what use ''that'' would be,
:since they have neither milk nor wool. Let them stand outside.
:They've paid all they were worth. All their fruit
:has already fallen from them. Don't you see how, they're straggling
:and walking about freely
:on their own? No, I think they're silent because of their age;
:they don't even bleat, even though they're away from the rest of the flock!
:They seem stupid and not bad!
:SIS. Let's go back inside, sister. – NIC. Wait right there,
:both of you! These sheep want you!

The tenth and twelfth lines above illustrate the "syncopated" bacchiac rhythm, where one syllable is omitted from the foot. When this happens, there is generally a word-break after the syncopated foot.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine &amp; Scafuro, p. 488 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacchiac senarius===
Bacchiac rhythms can also be used for serious, contemplative songs, such as Alcumena's lament on the sudden departure of her husband in Plautus's ''Amphitruo'' 633ff, which begins:
:Satín parva rés est / volúptat(um) in vít(a) atqu(e) / in áetat(e) agúnda 
:praequám quod moléstum (e)st? / ita quoíqu' comparátum (e)st / in áetate hóminum; 
:ita dívis est plácitum, / volúptat(em) ut máeror / comés consequátur:
:quin íncommodí plus / malíqu(e) ilic(o) ádsit, / boní s(i) optigít quid.

:| u – – u – – | u – – – – – | u – – u – – |
:| – – – u – – | uu – – u – – | u – – (u) uu – |
:| uu – – – uu – | u – – – – – | u – – u – – |
:| – – – u – – | u – – u – – | u – – u – – |

:Is it not the case that the amount of pleasure in life and in leading our existence is small
:in comparison to what is disagreeable? So it has been allotted in each person's life.
:So it has pleased the gods, that sadness should follow pleasure as her companion;
:On the contrary, that more unpleasantness and evil should immediately follow, if anything nice happens.

It will be noted that in the above quotation there is always a word-break at the end of each metron, so that there is usually a word-stress on the penultimate element of each metron.

This particular metre (the senarius) is very rare, occurring only in this passage. Note that the words ''in aetat(e) hominum'' are analysed by Questa as a ''colon reizianum'', rather than a bacchiac with a hiatus after ''aetate''.

===Cretic quaternarius===
:| – x – | – u – || – x – | – u – |

The cretic metre consists of feet usually of the form | – x – |, although occasionally | uu u – | or | – u uu | can be found.&lt;ref name=Mount684 /&gt; Occasionally, as in lines 5 and 6 of the extract below, feet of other metres are mixed in, such as trochaic. In the quaternarius, there is usually a diaeresis (break) in the middle of the line, although elision may also be found at this point.

The cretic metre seems to have a more epic or tragic quality than the bacchiac. In the following passage, after a long description of preparations for a battle in stately iambic octonarii, the slave Sosia suddenly breaks into cretic quaternarii to describe the excitement of the battle itself (''Amphitruo'' 219-247). The cretic passage begins as follows (note that the fourth and fifth lines contain trochaic elements):
:póstqu(am) utrimqu(e) éxitum (e)st / máximā cópiā,
:díspertití viri, / díspertit(i) órdines,
:nós nostras móre nostr(o) / ét mod(o) instrúximus 
:légionés, it(em) hóstes cóntra / légionés suăs ínstruónt. (tr7)
:déind(e) utriqu(e) ímperatóres ín medi(um) éxeúnt, (cr2+tr2)
:éxtrā turb(am) órdinum / cólloquontúr simul.

:| – u – | – u – || – u – | – u – | 
:| – – – | – u – || – – – | – u – |
:| – – – | – u – || – u – | – u – |
:| uu – – u | – – – – || uu – – uu | – u – | (tr7)
:| – u – | – u – | – – – uu | – u – | (cr2 + tr2)
:| – – – | – u – || – u – | – u – |

A line with both resolutions (uu u – and – u uu) is ''Amphitruo'' 235:
:déniqu(e), ut vóluimus, // nóstra superát manus
:| – u – | uu u – || – u uu | – u – |
:"Finally, as we wanted, our army is winning."

The same metre was also used in Roman tragedies, as in the following quotation from [[Ennius]]'s ''Andromacha'', cited more than once by Cicero:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc. Disp.'' 3.44&lt;/ref&gt;
:quíd petam práesid(i) aut / éxequar? quóve nunc
:áuxilio éxili / áut fugae fréta sim?
:árc(e) et urb(e) órba sum. / Qu(o) áccidam? qu(o) ápplicem?

:| – u – | – u – || – u – | – u – |
:| – uu – | – u – || – u – | – u – |
:| – u – | – u – || – u – | – u – |

:"What protection am I to seek or request? What help
:may I depend on now in my exile or flight?
:I am deprived of citadel and city. Who am I to approach? To whom may have recourse?"&lt;ref&gt;Translation from E. Fraenkel, ''Plautine Elements in Plautus'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above tragic aria was presumably sung at a slow tempo. At other times, however, the cretic metre indicates a faster tempo than the iambics it follows, as with the battle description above, or the scene discussed by Moore (p.&amp;nbsp;332) from Plautus's ''Pseudolus'' 920ff, where Pseudolus tries to get Simia to speed up his walking, by changing from iambics to cretics:
:PS. ámbul(a) ergó cit(o). SI. imm(o) / ótiosé volo!
:| – u – | – u – || – u – | – u – |
:PS. Walk quickly therefore. SI. No, I want to go at a leisurely pace!

Two lines later Simio changes the metre back into iambics to slow the pace:
:SI. quid próperas? plácide, né timé!
:| – uu – uu | – – u – |
:SI. Why are you hurrying? Slowly, don't be afraid!

===Thymelicus===
Sometimes a cretic dimeter is followed by a rhythm | – u u u – |, known as a thymelicus, almost always to "comic effect",&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Music'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; as with the following line from Plautus's ''Mostellaria'':&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Mostellaria'' 693; cf. 696, 702, 706.&lt;/ref&gt;
:nunc dormītum iubet / m(e) ire: minime!
:| – – – | – u – | – u u u – |
:Now she wants me to go to bed with her – no way!

==Other metres==
The following metres used mainly by Plautus may also be mentioned.

===Colon reizianum===
The ''colon reizianum'', named after the 18th-century classicist Friedrich Reiz /{{IPA|raɪts}}/ (1733–90) of Leipzig University, is a short piece of iambic metre of the following form:
:| x – x – – |

The first ''anceps'' is almost always long; any of the first four elements (especially the first and third) can be replaced by two short syllables. Sometimes the colon reizianum is used on its own (e.g. ''Casina'' 721-28), but more often as the second half of a line in another metre, especially the ''versus reizianus'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', pp. 203-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versus reizianus===
The versus reizianus (reiz) consists of an iambic quaternarius followed by a colon reizianum.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Music'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; But the iambic dimeter is unusual in that it often begins with a double short syllable, which gives it a certain vigour:
:| &lt;u&gt;uu&lt;/u&gt; – x – | x – u – || – – x – – |

Usually the versus reizianus is used singly or as a couplet in the midst of other metres, but there is one long stretch of 32 lines in ''Aulularia'' (415-446) entirely in this metre. In the following extract, the miserly old man Euclio has just chased the hired cook Congrio out of his house:
:EVC. Redi. quó fugís nunc? ténĕ, tené. / CON. Quid, stólide, clámas?
:EVC. Qui(a) ad trís virós i(am) ego déferám / nomén tuom. CON. Qu(am) ób rem? 
:EVC. Quia cúltr(um) habés. CON. Cocúm decét. / EVC. Quid cómminátu's 
:mihi? CON. Ístud mále fact(um) árbitrór, / quia nón latus fódi. 
:EVC. Homo núllust té sceléstiór / qui vívat hódie, 
:neque qu(oi) égo d(e) indústri(a) ámpliús / male plús libĕns fáxim.
:CON. Pol étsi táceas, pál(am) ĭd quidém (e)st: / res ípsa téstist: 
:ita fústibús sum mólliór / magi(s) qu(am) úllu(s) cináedus!

:| uu –  u –  | –  uu u – || –  uu u  –  – | 
:| uu –  u –  | uu –  u – || –  –  uu –  – |
:| uu –  u –  | u  –  u – || –  –  u  –  – |
:| uu –  – uu | –  –  u – || uu –  uu –  – |
:| uu –  – –  | u  –  u – || –  –  –  uu – |
:| uu uu – –  | u  –  u – || uu –  uu –  – |
:| u  –  – uu | –  uu u – || –  –  u  –  – |
:| uu –  u –  | –  –  u – || uu –  uu –  – |

:EUC. Come back! Where are you running away to? CON. Why are you shouting, you idiot?
:EUC. Because I'm going now to report your name to the magistrates! CON. What for?
:EUC. Because you have a knife! CON. That's normal for a cook! EUC. Why did you threaten
:me? CON. I think it's a pity I didn't go further and run you through!
:EUC. No man alive today is more criminal than you,
:nor is there any that I'd rather do harm to on purpose!
:CON. By Pollux, even if you were to say nothing, it's evident. The thing itself is witness!
:I've been so beaten by your sticks that I'm softer than a poofter!

===Wilamowitzianus===
The wilamowitzianus (wil), named after the German classicist [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf]], is a short line of the following shape, ending in a choriamb (note that the two anceps syllables are never both short):
:| – x x – | – uu – |

It is used in about 51 lines of Plautus and 5 of Terence, as in the following exchange from ''Bacchides'' between the two young men Pistoclerus and Mnesilochus:&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Bacchides'', 625-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
:PIS. Mnesiloche, quid fit? MN. Perii!
:PIS. Di melius faciant. MN. Perii!
:PIS. Non tacĕs, insipiens? MN. Taceam? 
:PIS. Sanu(s) satis non es. MN. Perii!
:multa mala m(i) in pectore nunc / acr(ia) atqu(e) acerb(a) eveniunt. 
:criminin m(e) habuisse fidem? / immerito tib(i) ĭratu(s) fui.

:| – uu u – | – uu – |
:| – uu – uu | – uu – |
:| – uu – uu | – uu – |
:| – uu – – | – uu – |
:| – u uu – | – uu – || – – u – | – uu – |
:| – u – uu | – uu – || – uu – uu | – uu – |

:PIS. Mnesilochus, what's the matter? MN. I'm done for!
:PIS. May the gods make it better. MN I'm done for!
:PIS. Won't you be quiet, you fool? MN. Be quiet?
:PIS. You're not right in the head. MN. I'm done for!
:There are so many harsh and bitter evils now arising in my heart!
:That I could have trusted that accusation! I was angry with you for no reason!

Sometimes a wilamowitzianus is followed by a colon (part line) in cretic metre, as the following exchange between the fisherman Gripus and the slave Trachalio in Plautus's ''Rudens'':&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Rudens'' 951-2; cf. Moore, ''Music'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;
:GRI. si fidem modo das mihi te / non for(e) infidum
:TRA. do fidem tibi, fidus ero / quisquis es. GRI. audi

:| – u – uu | – uu – || – u – | – – |
:| – u – uu | – uu – || – u – | – – |

:GRI. If you give a pledge to me that you will not be unfaithful.
:TRA. I give you my pledge, I will be faithful, whoever you are. GRI. Listen...

&lt;/ref&gt; The article later formed the basis for his originally [[self-published]] book ''[[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s Scandals: How the [[Haganah]] and the [[Mossad]] Eliminated Jews''.

==Biography==

===Early life in Iraq===
Giladi was born in 18 March 1926 to an [[Iraqi Jews|Iraqi Jewish]] family and later lived in [[Israel]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naeim Giladi|publisher=Palestine:Information With Provenance (PIWP) Database|accessdate=28 October 2006|url=http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/authors.php?auid=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Giladi describes his family as, "a large and important" family named "Haroon" who had settled in Iraq after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]]. According to Giladi, his family had owned 50,000 acres (200&amp;nbsp;km²) devoted to rice, dates and [[Arabian horse|Arabian horses]]. They were later involved in gold purchase and purification, and were therefore given the name, 'Khalaschi', meaning 'Makers of Pure' by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks who occupied Iraq at the time.&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

He states that he joined the underground [[Zionist]] movement at age 14, without his parents' knowledge and was involved in underground activities. He was arrested and jailed by the Iraqi government in 1947, when he was 17 years old.&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt; During his two years in [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] prison, he expected to be sentenced to death for smuggling Iraqi Jews out of the country to [[Iran]], where they were then taken to [[Israel]]. He managed to escape from prison and travel to Israel, arriving in May 1950.

===Experiences in Israel===
Giladi reports that upon entering Israel in 1950, he was "asked where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do," and that he volunteered to go to [[Dafna]], a farming [[kibbutz]] in the Galilee. He relates that he lasted only a few weeks because, "the new immigrants were given the worst of everything…the food was the same, but that was the only thing everyone had in common. For the immigrants, bad cigarettes, even bad toothpaste. Everything. I left."&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

After leaving Dafna, Giladi went to the [[Jewish Agency]] to seek reassignment. He says he was told to go to [[Al-Majdal, Askalan|al-Mejdil]], an Arab town about nine miles from [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and now a part of [[Ashkelon]], that was to be transformed into a farming community. When the officials at the Labor Office there discovered that he was fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], he relates that they encouraged him to seek employment with the Military Governor's office. He says he was assigned the task of procuring the signatures of the Palestinian inhabitants of al-Mejdil on a set of government forms that stated that they were willingly giving up their lands to go to [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], at the time under [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian occupation]]. He relates how he realised in short time that those Palestinians signing such documents were doing so under duress. He argues that they were denied the right to access their agricultural lands and penned up in a small area and so some signed simply to end their agony. He wrote, "Those Palestinians who didn't sign up for transfers were taken by force – just put in trucks and dumped in Gaza."&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt; He left the job disgusted and attempted to procure government work elsewhere.

Giladi states he subsequently had difficulty finding employment because of discrimination against Arab Jews. He recalls that when he arrived in Israel, in May 1950, his Iraqi passport had his name as written in Arabic and [[transliterated]] using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Giladi states that because, "the English couldn't capture the "kh" sound…it was rendered simply as Klaski." At the border, Israeli immigration officials applied what he calls the "English" version of his name, which had an Eastern European, [[Ashkenazi]] sound to it. Giladi writes that "in one way, this 'mistake' was my key to discovering very soon just how the Israeli caste system worked.&lt;ref name = "Giladi's article" /&gt; After leaving al-Mejdil, he reports that he wrote letters trying to get a government job elsewhere and got many interviews, but when it was discovered that his face didn't match his Polish/Ashkenazi name, he was rebuffed, advised time and again that "we'll give you a call." Eventually, he changed his name to "Giladi", which he writes was "close to the code name, Gilad, that he had in the Zionist underground."&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

While living in Israel, his views of Zionism changed. He writes that, he "was disillusioned personally, disillusioned at the institutionalized racism, disillusioned at what I was beginning to learn about Zionism's cruelties. The principal interest Israel had in Jews from Islamic countries was as a supply of cheap labor, especially for the farm work that was beneath the urbanized Eastern European Jews. [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]] needed the "Oriental" Jews to farm the thousands of acres of land left by Palestinians who were driven out by Israeli forces in 1948".&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

Giladi relates that he became politicized after an experience at the Socialist/Zionist Party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and when he showed up at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the "Department for Jews from Islamic Countries" by many people who had not even looked at his letter to see why he had been invited. He says that he "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out."&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

After serving in the Israeli Army between 1967 and 1970, Giladi was active in the [[Israeli Black Panthers]] movement.

===Life in the United States===
In the 1980s, he left Israel for New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rupture And Return: A Mizrahi Perspective On The Zionist Discourse|author=Ella Shohat|publisher=The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|date=May 2001|url=http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/topics/palestin/doc07/en/shohat.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003001340/http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/topics/palestin/doc07/en/shohat.htm|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., he wrote about an autobiographical account and historical analysis of Zionist misdeeds in Iraq, Palestine, and later Israel in an article titled "The Jews of Iraq"&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt; The article later formed the basis for his originally [[self-published]] book ''Ben-Gurion's Scandal: How the Haganah and the Mossad Eliminated Jews''.

He died on 6 March 2010, in a rehabilitation center in New York City after battling a lengthy illness, and was buried in the Jewish tradition by the [[Hebrew Free Burial Association]].&lt;ref name=Zwire/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Anti-Zionism===
Giladi has strong views on Zionism and its negative effects and his article begins with the following passage: "I write this article for the same reason I wrote my book: to tell the American people, and especially [[American Jews]], that Jews from [[Islamic]] lands did not [[emigrate]] willingly to Israel; that, to force them to leave, Jews killed Jews; and that, to buy time to confiscate ever more Arab lands, Jews on numerous occasions rejected genuine peace initiatives from their Arab neighbors. I write about what the first prime minister of Israel called 'cruel Zionism'. I write about it because I was part of it."

Giladi's position that the [[1950–1951 Baghdad bombings]] were "perpetrated by Zionist agents in order to cause fear amongst the Jews, and so promote their exodus to Israel" is shared by a number of anti-Zionist authors, including the [[Israeli Black Panthers]] (1975), [[David Hirst (journalist)|David Hirst]] (1977), [[Wilbur Crane Eveland]] (1980), [[Uri Avnery]] (1988), [[Ella Shohat]] (1986), Abbas Shiblak (1986), Marion Wolfsohn (1980), and Rafael Shapiro (1984).&lt;ref name="Philip Mendes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Forgotten Refugees: The Causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries|author=Philip Mendes|publisher=Presented at the 14th Jewish Studies Conference in Melbourne. Reprinted on palestineremembered.com|date=March 2002|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Articles/General/Story2127.html#The%20Bombings%20and%20the%20Jewish%20Exodus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, Giladi notes that this was also the conclusion of Wilbur Crane Eveland, a former senior officer in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) who outlined that allegation in his book "Ropes of Sand".&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

Alternatively, historian Moshe Gat argues that there was little direct connection between the bombings and the exodus of Jewish refugees. Gat questions the guilt of the alleged Jewish bombthrowers who were found guilty in an Iraqi court of having perpetrated one of the bombings. He cites a rumour that a Christian Iraqi army officer "known for his anti-Jewish views", was initially arrested for the crime, but was evidently not charged despite the large number of explosive materials matching those used in an earlier synagogue bombing that were allegedly found in his home. He further cites a long history of anti-Jewish bomb-throwing incidents in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Philip Mendes" /&gt;

Contemporary Israeli officials and mainly [[Mordechai Ben Porat]] and [[Shlomo Hillel]], prominent figures at the Iraqi Zionist underground, vehemently deny the charges. An internal investigation conducted in Israel in 1960 found no proof of an order to execute such an attack. More possible responsible parties have been suggested, such as the Iraqi CID and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].

There is however, little in the way of completely definitive evidence either way. Jewish studies scholar, Philip Mendes suggests that, "It therefore remains an open question as to who was responsible for the bombings," claiming that "memories and interpretations of the events have further been influenced and distorted by the unfortunate discrimination which many Iraqi Jews experienced on their arrival in Israel (Black Panthers 1975:132–133; Shohat 1988; Swirski 1989; Massad 1996)." He does say, however, that Gat argues "convincingly" that there was "little direct connection between the bombings and exodus.".&lt;ref name="Philip Mendes" /&gt;

Historian Dr. Yosef Meir, a noted Iraqi Zionist underground operative, argues in a rebuttal article that while there is a direct connection, the culprits are the Iraqi government or Arab nationalists. He points to the fact that the bombings in question occurred after the Citizenship relinquishment act of 1950 had already expired and therefore no Jews could register for exit. He also notes that the two zionist operatives hanged were never charged with the masouda shem-tov bombing, but rather three unrelated bombings which occurred later. On the other hand, he lists the motives of the government and the pressure it exerted on "Near-East" (the company performing the airlifts). Yosef Meir's criticism points to circumstantial evidence that the Zionist movement had no motive while the Iraqi government and Arab nationalists did, and accuses Giladi of withholding this information on purpose, calling it "an obvious attempt to mislead readers."&lt;ref name="Meir"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Giladi also mentions [[Mordechai Ben Porat]], a former Israeli Member of the Knesset, and a Cabinet minister, who was a key figure in the Zionist underground, as having been cited as one the figures responsible for the bombings by one of the Iraqi investigators into the bombings, in a book titled ''Venom of the Zionist Viper''. Ben-Porat was one of several Israeli undercover [[Mossad]] agents arrested in Baghdad after the explosion; he was able to skip bail and flee to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;The Iraqi Jews and Their Coming to Israel, from ''The Black Panther'' 9 November 1972, cited in Uri Davis and Norton Mezvinsky, ''Documents From Israel 1967–1973: Readings for a critique of Zionism'', Ithaca Press 1975, {{ISBN|0-903729-09-1}}, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Mordechai Ben-Porat has vigorously denied this allegation, which he characterizes as akin to "blood libel", and which prompted him to write his 1998 book, "To Baghdad and Back".&lt;ref name = "BBB"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Mordechai contends that the false charge against him was conceived at Iraq police headquarters.&lt;ref name = "BBB" /&gt; The affair has also been the subject of an anti-libel lawsuit by Ben Porat against a journalist who published Giladi's accusations. The lawsuit has been settled out of court with the journalist publishing an apology.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951'' by Moshe Gat, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

For his 2006 book ''Occupied Minds'', British journalist [[Arthur Neslen]] interviewed Yehuda Tajar, a Mossad agent who spent ten years of a 25-year prison sentence in Iraq, after being convicted for the explosions. Tajar insists that, although his undercover cell was prepared to carry out such acts, they did not in fact do so. The actual explosions, he claims, were the work of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. After several members of the cell were arrested, however, those still at liberty carried out other grenade attacks, in an attempt to show the innocence of those arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Neslen, ''Occupied Minds: A Journey through the Israeli Psyche'', Pluto Press 2006, {{ISBN|0-7453-2365-0}}, pp. 58–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giladi's article is regularly cited by anti-Zionists, including Jewish anti-Zionists, who claim that Zionism has a negative effect for Jews.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Giladi also maintains a controversial stance regarding the [[Farhud]], alleging that the British bear the bulk of responsibility as they instigated the event to blacken the image of the [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani|Rashid Ali]] government.&lt;ref name="Giladi's article" /&gt;

===Cover Banner: "This book banned in Israel and United States"===
[[File:naeim giladi book.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of Giladi's book.]]
In 2003, Dandelion Books published a second edition of Gilad's book. The book is marked with a banner that reads, "Banned in Israel and the United States". The press release accompanying the book reads, "Banned in Israel and the United States…Dandelion Books, rapidly becoming known for its 'uncensored books and unfettered fiction' has just released a revised edition of this highly controversial book.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; The details of a direct ban enacted by either the American or Israeli governments are not supplied by the author or publisher.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In the foreword of the book, Giladi writes that he did not submit a manuscript in Israel for fear of retribution. "Before," he wrote, "one can publish a book in Israel, permission had to be granted by the censors.... When I was contemplating writing and publishing this book, two of my colleagues and well known Israeli journalists ([[Maxim Ghilan|Maxim Gilan]] and Samuel Mour) were arrested and put in jail for exposing the involvement of the Israeli secret police ... in the kidnapping in Paris of [[Mehdi Ben Barka]] ..., charged with crimes against national security and ... locked up for six months. Moreover, the Israeli media were gagged and not even allowed to mention that the two journalists had been arrested. If the authorities had wished, the two men would have been kept in jail for the rest of their lives."&lt;ref name = "Giladi book"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the foreword, Giladi writes that upon emigrating to the United States in 1980, he found several publishers interested in publishing his work. He says he declined to publish because all interested publishers wanted to reserve the right of editorial control over the finished manuscript and he did not want to agree to this. Twelve years after his arrival in the US, he self-published at a cost of $60,000, which he reports was almost all of the proceeds of the sale of his Israeli property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The historic "Tacita de Oro" of the Atlantic Coasts. The Old Quarters of Colon are under renovation and reconstruction.

== History ==
The city was founded by Americans in 1850 as the Atlantic terminal of the Panama Railroad, then under construction to meet the gold rush demand for a fast route to California. For a number of years early in its history, the sizable United States émigré community called the town '''''Aspinwall''''' after Panama Railroad promoter William Henry Aspinwall, while the city's Hispanic community called it Colon in honor of Christopher Columbus. The city was founded on the western end of a treacherously marshy islet known as Manzanillo Island. As part of the construction of the Panama Railroad, the island was connected to the Panamanian mainland by a causeway and part of the island was drained to allow the erection of permanent buildings.

'''Otto Lenel''' (13 December 1849 – 7 February 1935) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Jewish]] [[jurist]] and legal historian. His most important achievements are in the field of [[Roman law]].

==Life and career==
Otto Lenel was born in Mannheim, Germany on 13 December 1849. He was the son of Moritz Lenel and Caroline Scheuer. He fought in the [[Franco-Prussian War|war against France in 1870/71]].

Lenel studied law at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Frederick William University|Berlin]]. In 1872, he received the degree of Dr. jur., four years later, he obtained the [[habilitation]] at the University of Leipzig. In 1882, Lenel became famous, when he won a prize which had been offered by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences with his reconstruction of the edict of the praetors (see below).

In the same year of 1882, Lenel became a professor at the [[University of Kiel]]. Two years later, he moved on to the [[University of Marburg]]. In 1885 he became a professor taught at  the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]], which had become a German institution after the war of 1870/71 in which Lenel himself had fought. In 1895, he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Strassburg. 1907 he was called to [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]].

He soon became one of the most important German legal historians of his time. At the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of his Dr. jur. degree, he was presented with a [[Festschrift]].&lt;ref&gt;Festschrift für Otto Lenel zum fünfzigjährigen Doctorjubiläum am 16. Dezember 1921 überreicht von der Rechts- und Staatswissenschaftlichen Fakultät der Universität Freiburg i. Br., Leipzig, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, Lenel was  given a second Festschrift.&lt;ref&gt;Symbolae Friburgenses in honorem Ottonis Lenel.Otto Lenel zu seinem sechzigjährigen Doktorjubiläum am 16. Dezember 1931 von Freiburger Mitarbeitern und Schülern, Leipzig 1931&lt;/ref&gt; On his 80th birthday, Lenel received a gratulatory letter, which was signed by academics representing 20 countries of various continents and 100 universities. He was also made an honorary citizen of the city of Freiburg.

After 1933, however, Lenel—in spite of his international fame, his status as a veteran and his old age—became a victim of Nazi racism. His daughter was forced out of her job as a nurse. The prosecutions by the Nazis broke his spirit. For the last 18 months of his life he was unable to continue his scholarly work. He died on 7 February 1935.

According to his wish, only his closest relatives attended his burial. Due to the political circumstances, no obituary was published in Germany. After Lenel's death, the members of his family met a cruel fate in Nazi Germany: His widow of more than 80 years of age, Luise, née Eberstadt (born 25 February 1857 in Frankfurt) and his daughter Bertha Lenel (born 7 March 1882 in Freiburg) were sent on 22 October 1940 to an [[Gurs internment camp|internment camp in Gurs]], France. The widow died there on 7 November 1940, Bertha Lenel survived.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Otto Lenel's death, a sign was affixed to his last residence at Holbeinstrasse 5 in Freiburg, Germany.

==Work==
Lenel is best known for his reconstruction of the fundamental text of the Roman legal system, the so-called ''edictum perpetuum'' of the Roman [[praetor]]s. The praetors were the government officials responsible for the administration of justice during the [[Roman republic]] and the [[principate]]. The edictum (or edict) was the text in which the newly elected praetor announced how he would handle his responsibilities. More precisely, the edict announced, under what circumstances it would succeed and when it would fail. Originally, every praetor drafted his own edict, but over time, a standard text was established, which was regularly re-enacted by the new praetor. Even later, Emperor [[Hadrian]] commissioned a final redaction of the text and prohibited any further changes. The edict had thus changed its nature from being an announcement by the praetor himself to being a legal rule binding on the praetor himself, which made known to all citizens under what circumstances they could bring a successful action in the Roman courts. This text is called the ''edictum perpetuum'' (the eternal edict).

In later times, the edict lost its legal importance due to changes in procedural law. For that reason, the edict of the edict was no longer copied and no complete text has come down to us. Similarly, most of the writings of the Roman jurists have only been conserved in fragments in Justinian's digest.

Lenel reconstructed both the text of the edict and tried to establish the order in which the surviving fragments of legal writings had originally been presented before they were cut out and rearranged in the digest. The reconstruction of the edict is the subject of his book ''Das edictum perpetuum''. The results of his research on the writings of the Roman jurists are contained in the two volumes entitled ''Palingenesia juris civilis''. The subjects of the two books are linked, because many books by Roman jurists were commentaries on the edict or at least they followed the structure of the edict. By studying the structure of the scholarly writings of the jurists Lenel found out how the edict was structured and what provisions it contained.

Lenel's work is extremely important for the history of Roman law. It enables modern scholars to consider the original context of the source texts and it helps us understand the technicalities of Rome's legal system.

In addition to his famous works on Roman law Lenel also published some influential papers on modern German civil law.

Despite this dramatic paradigm shift among professional historians, the decline thesis continues to maintain a strong presence in [[popular history]], as well as academic history written by scholars who are not specialists on the Ottoman Empire.

== Origins of the Decline Thesis ==
[[File:Semailname 47b.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman I]], whose reign was seen as constituting a golden age.]]

=== In the Ottoman Empire ===
The idea of decline first emerged among the Ottomans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning much earlier, but greatly expanding during the seventeenth century, was the literary genre of [[Nasîhat|nasihatname]], or "Advice for Kings."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, "Genre and Myth," pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt; This genre had a long history, appearing in earlier Muslim empires such as those of the [[Seljuks]] and [[Abbasids]]. Nasihatname literature was primarily concerned with order and disorder in state and society; it conceptualized the ruler as the embodiment of justice, whose duty it was to ensure that his subjects would receive that justice. This was often expressed through the concept of the Circle of Justice ({{lang-ota|dāʾire-i ʿadlīye|script=Latn}}). In this conception, the provision of justice by the ruler to his subjects would allow those subjects to prosper, strengthening the ruler in turn.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 283–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Should this break down, society would cease to properly function. Thus many Ottomans writing in this genre, such as [[Mustafa Âlî]],&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Fleischer. ''Bureaucrat and Intellectual in the Ottoman Empire: The Historian Mustafa Âli, 1541–1600'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; described the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] as the most perfect manifestation of this system of justice, and put forth the idea that the empire had since declined from that golden standard. These writers viewed the changes which the empire had undergone as an inherently negative corruption of an idealized Suleimanic past. However, it is now recognized that rather than simply describing objective reality, they were often utilizing the genre of decline to voice their own personal complaints. For instance, Mustafa Âli's belief that the empire was declining was in large part motivated by frustration at his own failure to achieve promotions and court patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, ''Bureaucrat and Intellectual'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the nasihatname writers, then, may have simply been to protect their own personal or class status in a rapidly changing world.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Howard, "Ottoman Historiography and the Literature of 'Decline' of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century," ''Journal of Asian History'' 22 (1988), pp. 52–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abou-El-Haj, ''Formation of the Modern State'', pp. 20–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Western Europe ===
The notion of an all-encompassing Ottoman decline did not enter Western historiography until the early nineteenth century, with the works of historians such as [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, ''Geschichte des Osmanisches Reiches'', (in German) 10 vols. (Budapest: Ca. H. Hartleben, 1827–35).&lt;/ref&gt; who knew [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and adopted the idea directly from Ottoman nasihatname writers. Internal decline was thus thought of as an appropriate means of explaining the Ottomans' external military defeats, and acted also as a justification for European [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a declining Ottoman/Islamic civilization was thus used as a foil for [[Western Civilization]], in which the "decadent" Ottomans were contrasted with the "dynamic" West. Islam (as an all-encompassing civilizational category) often came to be portrayed as the polar opposite of the West, whereby Western societies valued freedom, rationality, and progress while Islam valued servility, superstition, and stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=62-3 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions were perpetuated in the mid-twentieth century above all by the works of [[H.A.R. Gibb]] and Harold Bowen, and [[Bernard Lewis]], who adhered to a civilizational conception of Islamic decline while modifying it with the new sociological paradigm of [[Modernization Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=104-12, 130-3 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views came under increasing criticism as historians began to reexamine their own fundamental assumptions about Ottoman and Islamic history, particularly after the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, "Ottoman Advice for Kings," pp. 143–44; Edward Said, ''Orientalism'', (New York: Pantheon, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The thesis' tenets ==
[[File:Bernard Lewis in 2012 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Bernard Lewis]], one of the decline thesis' most famous proponents.]]

The most prominent writer on Ottoman decline was the historian [[Bernard Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that the Ottoman Empire experienced all-encompassing decline affecting government, society and civilization. He laid out his views in the 1958 article, "Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, "Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire," ''Studia Islamica'' 1 (1958) 111–127.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed into the mainstream opinion of [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] scholars of the mid-twentieth century. However, the article is now highly criticized and no longer considered accurate by modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', 242n.
* Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization."
* Darling, "Another Look at Periodization."
* Quataert, "Ottoman History Writing."
* Suraiya Faroqhi, ''Approaching Ottoman History: An Introduction to the Sources'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis' views were as follows:

The first ten sultans of the Ottoman Empire (from [[Osman I]] to [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]) were of excellent personal quality, while those who came after Suleiman were without exception "incompetents, degenerates, and misfits," a result of the [[Kafes]] system of succession, whereby dynastic princes no longer gained experience in provincial government before coming to the throne. Faulty leadership at the top led to decay in all branches of government: the bureaucracy ceased to function effectively, and the quality of their records worsened. The Ottoman military lost its strength and began to experience defeats on the battlefield. They ceased to keep up with the advances of European military science, and consequently suffered territorial losses. As the Ottoman state and society was geared towards constant expansion, their sudden failure to achieve new conquests left the empire unable to adapt to its new relationship with Europe.

Economically, the empire was undermined by the discovery of the [[New World]] and the subsequent shift in the economic balance between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe, as well as the voyages of discovery which brought Europeans to India, and led to a decline in the volume of trade passing through Ottoman ports. In addition, the [[Price Revolution]] led to the destabilization of Ottoman coinage and a severe fiscal crisis, which proved disastrous when paired with the rapidly rising costs of warfare. As the cavalry army of the Ottomans became obsolete, the [[Timar]] System of land tenure which had sustained it fell into obsolescence, while the corrupt bureaucracy was unable to replace it with a functional alternative. Instead, tax-farming was introduced, leading to corruption and oppression of the peasantry, and agricultural decline. Ottoman economic and military backwardness was extenuated by their closed-mindedness and unwillingness to adopt European innovations, as well as an increasing disdain for practical science. Ultimately, the Ottoman Empire "reverted to a medieval state, with a medieval mentality and a medieval economy – but with the added burden of a bureaucracy and a standing army which no medieval state had ever had to bear."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Some Reflections," pp. 112–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, explanations of Ottoman decline were not limited to the empire's geopolitical position among world empires or to its military strength. The decline thesis was rooted in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century conception of distinct "civilizations" as units of historical analysis, and thus explained Ottoman weakness with reference not only to its geopolitics but also defined it in social, economic, cultural, and moral terms. This all-encompassing notion of the decline of Ottoman (and more widely, Islamic) civilization became the framework within which Ottoman history from the sixteenth century onward was understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Decline Thesis ==
===Conceptual issues===
Dana Sajdi, in an article summarizing the critiques of the decline thesis written since the 1970s, identifies the following as the main points that scholars have demonstrated: "1. The changing nature and adaptability of Ottoman state and society; 2. indigenous or internal social, economic, and/or intellectual processes displaying signs of modernity prior to the advent of the West; 3. the comparability of Ottoman state and society with their counterparts in the world in the same period; and 4. a logic, or a framework, alternative to decline and the Eurocentrism implied therein, that takes into account the phenomena of the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two points pertain to the decline thesis' depiction of Ottoman state and society as being backward-looking, static, and essentially incapable of innovation prior to the 'impact of the West'; the third concerns the degree to which the Ottoman Empire was taken to be totally unique, operating according to its own rules and internal logic, rather than being integrated into a wider comparative framework of world history; while the fourth addresses the degree to which the decline thesis overlooked the local processes actually occurring in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in favor of emphasis on the grand narrative of Ottoman decay and European superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with these points, a common criticism of the decline thesis is that it is teleological: that is to say that it presents all of Ottoman history as the story of the rise and fall of the empire, causing earlier historians to over-emphasize the empire's troubles and under-emphasize its strengths. According to Linda Darling, "because we know that eventually the Ottomans became a weaker power and finally disappeared, every earlier difficulty they experienced becomes a "seed of decline," and Ottoman successes and sources of strength vanish from the record."&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The corollary of decline is the notion that the empire had earlier reached a peak, and this too has been problematized. The reign of Suleiman the Magnificent had been seen as a golden age to which all of the rest of the empire's history was to be compared. Such comparisons caused earlier researchers to see transformation and change as inherently negative, as the empire shifted away from the established norms of Suleiman's romanticized and idealized age. According to Jane Hathaway, this focus on the "golden age" had a distorting effect on its history: "a massive empire that lasted for over six centuries cannot have had an ideal moment and an ideal permutation by which the entire chronological and geographical span of the empire can be judged."&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization," 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, modern scholars take change to be a natural result of the empire's adaptation to the world around it, a sign of innovativeness and flexibility rather than decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=457 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
In reexamining the notion of political decline in the Ottoman Empire, historians first examined the [[Nasîhat|nasihatname]] texts which had formed the backbone of the decline thesis. Many scholars, among them most notably Douglas Howard&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Howard, "Ottoman Historiography," pp. 52–77.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rifa'at Ali Abou-El-Haj,&lt;ref&gt;Abou-El-Haj, ''Formation of the Modern State'', pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that these Ottoman writers' critiques of contemporary society were not uninfluenced by their own biases, and criticized earlier historians for taking them at face value without any critical analysis. Furthermore, "complaint about the times" was in fact a literary trope in Ottoman society, and also existed during the period of the so-called "golden age" of Suleiman the Magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar, "The Myth of the Golden Age: Ottoman Historical Consciousness in the post-Süleymanic Era," in ''Süleyman the Second [sic] and His Time'', eds. Halil İnalcık and Cemal Kafadar (Istanbul: ISIS Press, 1993), pp. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; For Ottoman writers, "decline" was a trope which allowed them to pass judgement on the contemporary state and society, rather than a description of objective reality. Thus, these works should not be taken as evidence of actual Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads Murphey, "The Veliyüddin Telhis: Notes on the Sources and Interrelations between Koçu Bey and Contemporary Writers of Advice to Kings," ''Belleten'' 43 (1979), pp. 547–571.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pál Fodor, "State and Society, Crisis and Reform, in a 15th–17th Century Ottoman Mirror for Princes," ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 40 (1986), pp. 217–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tropes of political decline, such as the notion that the sultans ruling after the time of Suleiman I were less competent rulers, have also been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kunt, "Introduction to Part I," 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigns of such figures as [[Ahmed I]],&lt;ref&gt;Börekçi, "Factions and Favorites."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osman II]],&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mehmed IV]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Baer, ''Honored by the Glory of Islam: Conversion and Conquest in Ottoman Europe'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (among others) have been re-examined in the context of the conditions of their own respective eras, rather than by inappropriately comparing them with a mythical Suleimanic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization," 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the very notion of whether Suleiman's reign constituted a golden age in the first place has come into question.&lt;ref name=mythgoldenage&gt;Kafadar, "The Myth of the Golden Age", 37–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaya Şahin, ''Empire and Power in the Reign of Süleyman: Narrating the Sixteenth-Century Ottoman World'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that sultans no longer personally accompanied the army on military campaigns is no longer criticized, but seen as a positive and necessary change resulting from the empire's transformation into a sedentary imperial polity.&lt;ref&gt;Hakan T. Karateke, "On the Tranquility and Repose of the Sultan," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011), 116.
* Leslie Peirce, ''The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire'', (Oxford University Press: 1993), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Peirce's research on the political role of women in the Ottoman dynasty has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the assumption that the so-called [[Sultanate of Women]], in which female members of the dynasty exercised an unusually high degree of power, was in some way either a cause or a symptom of imperial weakness. On the contrary, Ottoman [[Valide Sultan]]s, princesses, and concubines were successfully able to fortify dynastic rule during periods of instability, and played an important role in dynastic legitimization.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''The Imperial Harem'', pp. 267–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the importance of the rapidly expanding bureaucracy is now particularly emphasized as a source of stability and strength for the empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, drawing particularly upon the work of Linda Darling.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 200–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, ''The Arab Lands'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Based largely on the work of Ariel Salzmann, the empowerment of regional notables in the eighteenth century has been reinterpreted as an effective form of government, rather than a sign of decline.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Quataert, "Ottoman History Writing", 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salzmann |first=Ariel |title=An Ancien Régime Revisited: "Privatization" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Politics &amp; Society |date=1993 |volume=21 |pages=393–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
One of the most enduring claims of the decline thesis was that of the weakness of the Ottoman military in the post-Suleimanic period. Supposedly, the once-feared [[Janissary]] Corps became corrupted as they increasingly earned privileges for themselves, gaining the right to marry, sire children, and enroll those children into the corps. Rather than maintaining strict military discipline, they began to take up professions as merchants and shopkeepers in order to supplement their income, thus losing their military edge. However, it is now understood that janissary participation in the economy was not limited to the post-Suleimanic period. Janissaries were engaging in commerce as early as the fifteenth century, without any apparent impact on their military discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar, "On the Purity and Corruption of the Janissaries," ''Turkish Studies Association Bulletin'' 15 (1991): 273–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, far from becoming militarily ineffective, the Janissaries continued to remain one of the most innovative forces in Europe, introducing the tactic of [[volley fire]] alongside and perhaps even earlier than most European armies.&lt;ref&gt;Günhan Börekçi, "A Contribution to the Military Revolution Debate: The Janissaries' Use of Volley Fire During the Long Ottoman-Habsburg War of 1593–1606 and the Problem of Origins." ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 59 (2006): 407–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even greater attention has been given to the changes experienced by the [[Timar]] System during this era. The breakdown of the Timar System is now seen not as a result of incompetent administration, but as a conscious policy meant to help the empire adapt to the increasingly monetized economy of the late sixteenth century. Thus, far from being a symptom of decline, this was part of a process of military and fiscal modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kunt, ''The Sultan's Servants: The Transformation of Ottoman Provincial Government, 1550–1650'', (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Salzmann, "The Old Regime and the Ottoman Middle East," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011), 412.&lt;/ref&gt; The army of cavalry which the Timar System had produced was becoming increasingly obsolete by the seventeenth century, and this transformation allowed the Ottomans to instead raise large armies of musket-wielding infantry, thereby maintaining their military competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Halil İnalcık, "Military and Fiscal Transformation in the Ottoman Empire, 1600–1700," ''Archivum Ottomanicum'' 6 (1980): 283–337.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1690s, the proportion of infantry in the Ottoman army had increased to 50–60 percent, equivalent to their Habsburg rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, "Firearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the European Military Revolution, 1450–1800". ''Journal of World History.' 25 (2014): 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of armament production and weapons technology, the Ottomans remained roughly equivalent with their European rivals throughout most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Grant, "Rethinking the Ottoman "Decline": Military Technology Diffusion in the Ottoman Empire, Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries." ''Journal of World History'' 10 (1999): 179–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, "Ottoman Artillery and European Military Technology in the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 47/1–2 (1994): 15–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that Ottoman cannon foundries neglected mobile field guns by producing oversized siege cannon at a disproportionate rate has been debunked by the military historian Gábor Ágoston.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) pp. 195–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[Orientalism|Orientalistic]] claim that an inherent conservatism in [[Islam]] prevented the Ottomans from adopting European military innovations, it is now known that the Ottomans were receptive to foreign techniques and inventions, and continued to employ European renegades and technical experts throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, "Military Transformation," pp. 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 192–195.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of productive capacity, the Ottomans were even able to surpass their European rivals during the seventeenth century. They maintained full self-sufficiency in [[gunpowder]] production until the late eighteenth century, and with rare and brief exceptions were continually able to produce enough [[cannon]] and [[muskets]] to supply their whole armed forces as well as surplus stockpiles.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gábor Ágoston and Rhoads Murphey, Ottoman defeats in the [[Great Turkish War|1683–99]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|1768–74]] wars with the [[Habsburg Austria|Habsburgs]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] are best explained by the strain on logistics and communications caused by multi-front warfare rather than Ottoman inferiority in technology and armaments, as such inferiority, insofar as it existed at all, was far less significant than had formerly been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads Murphey, ''Ottoman Warfare: 1500–1700'', (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1999), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now believed that the Ottoman military was able to maintain rough parity with its rivals until the 1760s, falling behind as a consequence of a long period of peace on its western front between 1740 and 1768, when the Ottomans missed out on the advances associated with the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aksan |first=Virginia |title=Ottoman Wars, 1700–1860: An Empire Besieged |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd. |date=2007 |pages=130–5 |isbn=978-0-582-30807-7}}

=== Economic and fiscal ===
Early critiques of the decline thesis from an economic standpoint were heavily influenced by new sociological perspectives of [[dependency theory]] and [[world-systems analysis]] as articulated by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] in the 1960s and 1970s. These theories provided an influential critique of the prevailing theory of [[modernization theory|modernization]] which was then popular among economists and political analysts, and had been the framework within which Ottoman economic history had been understood, exemplified above all by [[Bernard Lewis]]' 1961 ''The Emergence of Modern Turkey''. Modernization theory held that the underdeveloped world was impoverished because its failure to follow Europe in advancing along a series of distinct stages of development (based on the model provided above all by France and Britain), which were assumed to be uniformly applicable to all societies. Historians seeking to identify the factors which prevented the Ottomans from achieving "modernization" turned to the stereotypes which formed the basis of the decline thesis: an Ottoman penchant for despotism and lethargy which inhibited their entry into the modern world and brought about economic stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory, in contrast, viewed modern-day underdevelopment as the product of the unequal global economic system gradually established by Europeans beginning in the early modern period, and thus saw it as the outcome of a historical process rather than a simple inability to adapt on the part of the non-Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=155-9, 169-70 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory, introduced into Ottoman history by Huri İslamoğlu-İnan and Çağlar Keyder, thus allowed historians to move beyond the concepts which had previously dominated Ottoman economic history, above all the notion of an "Oriental despotism"{{refn|group=n|"Oriental despotism" was a term deployed in [[Marxist]] historical analyses. It was postulated on a vision of Middle Eastern state and society as one in which all power was concentrated in the hands of an absolute ruler, who by controlling all of the land in the empire, prevented the independent emergence of a native bourgeoisie, and thus made capitalism impossible. This concept, or others like it, long served as a foundational principle in the study of the economic history of the Ottoman Empire and of Asian societies more generally, though it was, as noted by Zachary Lockman, "in reality based on crude generalizations and a very faulty understanding of their [Asian societies'] (quite diverse) histories and social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=83-5 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which supposedly inhibited economic development, and instead to examine the empire in terms of its gradual integration into the periphery of a newly emerging Europe-centered world system. Subsequent provincial studies highlighted the degree to which the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire was undergoing its own capitalist transformation independent of European economic penetration, which in turn facilitated the empire's integration into the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even following the empire's peripheralization, Ottoman manufacturing, long assumed to have collapsed in the face of European competition, is now understood to have grown and even flourished during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, benefiting from the strength of the Ottoman domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier periods, Ottoman economic and fiscal downturn was associated above all with the catastrophic effects of the [[price revolution]] of the late sixteenth century. However, this economic downturn was not unique to the Ottomans, but was shared by European states as all struggled with the diverse pressures of inflation, demographic shifts, and the escalating costs of warfare. By placing the Ottomans in comparative context with their neighbors, scholars have demonstrated that the multiple crises experienced by the Ottomans in the late sixteenth and early-to-mid seventeenth centuries can be seen as part of a wider European context characterized as the '[[The General Crisis|general crisis of the seventeenth century]]', rather than a sign of uniquely Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that the Ottoman economy was unable to recover from these crises was rooted both in the poor state of the field's knowledge of the Ottoman economy in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and also in how easily it seemed to fit with pre-existing ideas about Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research demonstrated that, in the words of Şevket Pamuk, the eighteenth century "was in fact a period of recovery for the Ottoman monetary system," indicating that "the old thesis of continuous decline cannot be sustained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pamuk |first=Şevket |title=A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from declining, the first half of the eighteenth century was a period of significant expansion and growth for the Ottoman economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salzmann |first=Ariel |title=An Ancien Régime Revisited: "Privatization" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Politics &amp; Society |date=1993 |volume=21 |pages=402 }}

Other supposed manifestations of Ottoman economic decline have also been challenged. The establishment by European merchants of new maritime trade routes to India around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], bypassing Ottoman territories, had a far less significant impact on the Ottoman economy than had once been assumed. While earlier scholarship depicted the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] as having established a near-monopoly on the movement of luxury goods, particularly spices, to Europe, in fact the Portuguese were only one of many actors competing in the Indian Ocean commercial arena. Even in the late sixteenth century, Asian merchants utilizing the traditional Red Sea trade routes through Ottoman territory transported four times as many spices as those of Portuguese merchants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Levi |author-first= Scott C. |chapter=Objects in Motion |page=331 |title=A Companion to World History |editor=Douglas Northrop |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until the early eighteenth century more silver specie continued to be imported into India via the traditional Middle Eastern routes than through the European-dominated Cape route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Prakash |author-first=Om |chapter=Precious-metal Flows into India in the Early Modern Period |editors=Dennis O.

Historians such as the above-mentioned [[Bernard Lewis]] once referred to the supposed fall in the quality of the empire's bureaucratic records as an indication of stagnation in the Ottoman administrative apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Some Reflections," 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians now recognize that no such decline ever occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 299–306.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in record-keeping was attributable not to loss in quality, but to a change in the nature of land assessment, as the empire adjusted to the increasingly monetized economy characteristic of the seventeenth century. The assessment methods in use under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman]] were well-suited to ensuring proper distribution of revenues to the army of [[timariots|feudal cavalry]] that then made up the bulk of Ottoman forces. However, by the turn of the century, the need for cash to raise armies of [[musketeers|musket-wielding infantry]] led the central government to reform its system of land tenure, and to expand the practice of [[tax farming]], which was also a common method of revenue-raising in contemporary Europe. In fact, the seventeenth century was a period of significant expansion in the Ottoman bureaucracy, not contraction or decline.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 81–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ursinus, "The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime, c. 1600–1850," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011) 423–434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', pp. 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, contrary to the claims of earlier historians, do not seem to have led to widespread corruption or oppression to a degree greater than that observable among the Ottoman Empire's European contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 246–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans, like other European states, struggled throughout the seventeenth century to meet rapidly rising expenses, but by its end were able to institute reforms which allowed them to enter the eighteenth century with a budget surplus. In the words of Linda Darling, "Ascribing seventeenth-century Ottoman budgetary deficits to the decline of the empire leaves unexplained the cessation of these deficits in the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st-century scholarly consensus ==
{{main|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire}}
Having dispensed with the notion of decline, today's historians of the Ottoman Empire most commonly refer to the post-Suleimanic Period, or more widely the period from 1550 to 1700, as one of transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, ''Crisis and Change'', 553.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, "Political culture and the great households", in Suraiya Faroqhi eds., ''The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603–1839'', volume 3 of ''The Cambridge History of Turkey''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of economic and political crises in defining this period is crucial, but so too is their temporary nature, as the Ottoman state was ultimately able to survive and adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, ''Arab Lands'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, "Crisis and Change," 411–414.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of increasing emphasis is the place of the Ottoman Empire in comparative perspective, particularly with the states of Europe. While the Ottomans struggled with a severe economic and fiscal downturn, so too did their European contemporaries. This period is frequently referred to as that of [[the General Crisis|The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century]],&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''Global Crisis: War, Climate Change &amp; Catastrophe in the Seventeenth Century'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the difficulties faced by the Ottoman Empire have been reframed not as unique to them, but as part of a general trend impacting the entire European and Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ursinus, "The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime," 423.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Ehud R. Toledano|Ehud Toledano]], "In both Europe and the Ottoman empire, these changes transformed states and the ways in which military-administrative elites waged and funded wars. Coping with these enormous challenges and finding the appropriate responses through a sea of socio-economic and political changes is, in fact, the story of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Ottoman history. A remarkable adaptation to new realities, rather than decline and disintegration, was its main feature; it reflects the resourcefulness, pragmatism and flexibility in thought and action of the Ottoman military-administrative elite, rather than their ineptitude or incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=459 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, per Dana Sajdi: "Regardless of what one may think of an individual revisionist work, or a particular method or framework, the cumulative effect of the scholarship has demonstrated the empirical and theoretical invalidity of the decline thesis, and offered a portrayal of an internally dynamic Ottoman state and society. It has also established the comparability of the Ottoman empire to other - mainly European - societies and polities, and concomitantly revised the existing scheme of periodization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st-century scholarly consensus on the post-Suleimanic period can thus be summarized as follows:

{{Quote|text=Historians of the Ottoman Empire have rejected the narrative of decline in favor of one of crisis and adaptation: after weathering a wretched economic and demographic crisis in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Ottoman Empire adjusted its character from that of a military conquest state to that of a territorially more stable, bureaucratic state whose chief concern was no longer conquering new territories but extracting revenue from the territories it already controlled while shoring up its image as the bastion of Sunni Islam. |author=Jane Hathaway, with contributions by Karl K.

'''Owen Davies''' is a reader in Social History at the [[University of Hertfordshire]]. His main field of research is on the history of modern and contemporary [[witchcraft]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Owen Davies's top 10 grimoires  |publisher=[[The Guardian]]  |date=4 April 2008 |last=Davies |first=Owen |authorlink= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/history |accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in the history of witchcraft and magic developed out of a childhood interest in folklore and mythology, which was spawned in part from reading the books of [[Alan Garner]]. From around the age of sixteen, he also became interested in archaeology and began to get involved with field-walking and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] surveying. He then went on to study archaeology and history at [[Cardiff University]] and he spent many weeks over the next six years helping excavate Bronze Age and Neolithic sites in France and England, mostly in the area around [[Avebury]]. He developed a strong interest in archaeology in general, and the ritual monuments and practices of the Neolithic and [[Bronze Age]].

From Cardiff, he went on to write a doctorate at [[Lancaster University]], working on a thesis looking at the continuation and decline of popular belief in witchcraft and magic from the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]] to the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]] (1991–1994).

'''Roger O'Connor''' (1762-1834) was an Irish nationalist and writer, known for the controversies surrounding his life and writings, notably his fanciful history of the Irish people, the ''[[Chronicles of Eri]]''. He was the brother of [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]] and the father of [[Feargus O'Connor]] and [[Francisco Burdett O'Connor]].

==Early life==
O'Connor was born in Connorville, County Cork, into an Irish Protestant family.&lt;ref name = "jim"&gt;James Dunkerley, ''Americana: The Americas in the World Around 1850'', Verso, 2000, pp.449-50.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law and was [[called to the bar]] in 1784. He married Louisa Anna Strachan, who died after giving birth to two children, Louise and Roderic.&lt;ref name = "kim2"&gt;James Dunkerley, "The Third Man: Francisco Burdett O'Connor and the Emancipation of the Americas", ''University of London Institute of Latin American Studies Occasional Papers'', No. 20, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He remarried in 1788, to Wilhamena Bowen, who bore him four sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt;

Roger's younger brother [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]] was one of the [[United Irishmen]]. Roger was himself associated with the movement, editing the nationalist journal ''Harp of Erin''. His two other brothers, Daniel and Robert, were pro-British loyalists. After his oldest brother Daniel got into debt, Roger bought out his inheritance for £5.000.&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt; These political and financial conflicts were deepened by a family dispute following the suicide of his sister Anne, who had not been allowed by the family to marry a Catholic man she was in love with. This led to a long feud between Roger and his brother Robert.&lt;ref name = "kim2"/&gt; According to historian [[James Dunkerley]] Robert, who was the local sheriff, "even tried to have Roger executed" for treason because of his involvement with ''Harp of Erin''.&lt;ref name = "kim2"/&gt;

Roger and Arthur engaged in nationalist activities in London, building a network of contacts. He went into hiding in the run up to the abortive [[Expédition d'Irlande|1796 rebellion]]. He subsequently surrendered to the authorities and was released. In July 1797 he assisted in the defence of other accused persons. According to Roger, this act led to further plots against him led by his loyalist brother Robert. He and Arthur were arrested and held in various locations over a period of several years before being finally released. Though an avowed Irish nationalist, O'Connor denied that he had ever been party to treasonable conspiracies. In 1799 he published ''To the People of Great Britain and Ireland'', a booklet that detailed what he considered to be his mistreatment.&lt;ref name = "DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger O'Connor, ''To the People of Great Britain and Ireland'', Dublin, 1799.&lt;/ref&gt; The O'Connors received considerable support from Whig politicians in Britain. MP and playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] wrote that "the usage of Roger O'Connor, who is one of the finest fellows I ever saw, has been merciless beyond example".&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt; O'Connor was held in [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]] near Inverness until 1801, when he was moved to London, but was barred from travelling to Ireland.

In 1803 O'Connor was finally allowed to return to Ireland. Following these troubles, O'Connor moved to [[Dangan Castle]], [[Summerhill, County Meath|Summerhill]], [[County Meath]] having acquired the property on a permanently renewable lease from Thomas Burrowes of the [[East India Company]]. The castle had been the childhood home of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], who later became the Duke of Wellington. O'Connor asserted that he had acquired it as "a suitable residence in which to entertain Napoleon" after the anticipated defeat of the British.&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Read &amp; Eric Glasgow, ''Feargus O'Connor: Irishman and Chartist'', Edward Arnold, 1961, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he began his career as a writer, preparing commentaries on the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=jpp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prendergast|first1=John P.|authorlink1=John Patrick Prendergast|title=Dangan and Roger O'Connor|journal=The Irish Monthly|date=January 1884|volume=12|issue=127|pages=35–47|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.230/20497088?sid=21105504556213&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=3738232&amp;uid=2134|accessdate=24 December 2014|doi=10.2307/20497088}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did so from a position of scepticism towards religion; he once said Voltaire was his God.&lt;ref name = "DNB"/&gt;

His wife Wilhamina died in 1806. After her death O'Connor's behaviour apparently became increasingly eccentric and extravagant. In 1809 a large part of the Castle was destroyed by fire. O'Connor was suspected of insurance fraud, as he had recently taken out a policy on the house. Many years later his son Francis (then known as Francisco) wrote in his autobiography that he had accidentally started the fire himself when melting lead to make bullets.&lt;ref name=kim2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Burdett O'Connor, ''Independencia Americana: Recuerdos de Francisco Burdett O'Connor'', 1895,  reprint, La Paz, 1972, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817 O'Connor and his son Arthur were arrested on a charge of having organised a mail robbery five years earlier, during which a guard was shot and killed. Two of the robbers had been apprehended after attempting to pass some of the stolen property, and had implicated O'Connor. The robbers were labourers employed on O'Connor's estate.&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt; It was alleged that O'Connor's steward Martin McKeon had conspired with him to organise the robbery, with McKeon recruiting the robbers. O'Connor was allegedly motivated by debt. Both men were put on trial. Arthur was also arrested, but later released. O'Connor stated that his only connection to the robbery was that his son had found the abandoned mailbags on his land. An endorsement of O'Connor's moral character was given by O'Connor's close friend the MP [[Francis Burdett|Sir Francis Burdett]], who stated that he was happy to lend any sum of money to O'Connor. O'Connor and McKeon were both acquitted, as the accusers' evidence was not considered credible.&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt; O'Connor and his supporters pointed out that the robbers had been spared the death penalty for testifying against him. O'Connor published his version of events, in which he argued that there had been a conspiracy to have him convicted. He claimed this was only the most recent of ten conspiracies to kill him, "being the first against my character—the tenth against my life in the past twenty-four years". Its real purpose was to destroy his reputation among the local people who "adored" him:

{{quote|Charged with a highway robbery, in custody of a single constable, I ride through my own country thronged with a population that adored me — this is my crime,— this is the genuine source of all the plots and conspiracies formed against my life and character.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Patriot!!'', London, Fairburn, 1817, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

O'Connor's later attempt to sue one of the accusers for perjury brought out details of events on the night of the robbery that led to continued suspicion against him. Local support was also undermined when he was cross-examined about his religious views, and asserted that the Bible was not a divine revelation. [[John Patrick Prendergast|John P. Prendergast]], in an article on O'Connor, says that "thenceforth Roger O'Connor stood condemned in public opinion of the robbery for the Galway mail".&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt; Shortly after these events O'Connor's landlord attempted to get him evicted from Dangan, but the attempt failed. Nevertheless, O'Connor left the property and moved to Paris.&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt; It was later alleged by McKeon's son that the robbery was a cover for the interception of compromising letters written by Burdett to a married lover. This was supposed to explain Burdett's support of O'Connor.&lt;ref name = "DNB"&gt;[[s:O'Connor, Roger (DNB00)|O'Connor, Roger, Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While these events were unfolding, O'Connor's teenage sons Feargus and Francis fled the family home, travelled to London and asked to be looked after by Francis Burdett. Burdett took them in.&lt;ref name = "kim2"/&gt; O'Connor's oldest son Roderic moved to Australia.

==Chronicles of Eri==
[[File:Roger OConnor via the NPG.png|thumb|O'Connor depicted by [[Abraham Wivell]], holding a crown signifying his claim to be the rightful king of Ireland]]
While in Paris, O'Connor prepared his best-known work, the ''[[Chronicles of Eri]]'' (1822), a book purporting to be a translation of ancient manuscripts detailing the early history of the Irish people. It was dedicated to his friend and supporter Sir Francis Burdett. The book was prefaced by a portrait of O'Connor holding a crown, the caption to which proclaimed that he was the "Head of his Race" and "Chief of the prostrated people of his nation", a position he claimed as the supposed lineal descendent of the 12th-century king [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]].

According to O'Connor, he had attempted to write this book three times before, but had been frustrated by the machinations of his enemies, who stole his manuscripts. Another version of the book had been destroyed in the disastrous fire at Dangan in 1809.&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt;

The book gives a history of the Gaels from supposed records written by "Eolus", who is said to have lived fifty years after Moses. It claims a continuous existence of the Gaelic people, originating among the ancient Phoenicians, migrating to Scythia, Spain and then Ireland. O'Connor interpreted Biblical stories and medieval Irish lore to support this narrative. [[William John Fitzpatrick]] in the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] stated that the book is "mainly, if not entirely, the fruit of O'Connor's imagination".&lt;ref name = "DNB"/&gt;

==Last years==
O'Connor returned to county Cork, but had by this time had lost much of his money. He lived for the rest of his life in a fisherman's cottage in [[Ballincollig]], cohabiting with a local young woman he called the "princess of Kerry".&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt; According to [[Richard Robert Madden]], O'Connor genuinely believed that this "young girl of humble origin" was  really a princess: "The enthusiasm with which he is said to have been wont to speak of the exalted claims of this princess of Kerry to an ancient Irish regal origin, left no doubt on the minds of many who heard him expatiate on this subject, that he had worked himself up into a firm belief in his fondly-imagined discovery."&lt;ref name = "mas"&gt;Richard Madden, ''The United Irishmen: Their Lives and Times'', Dublin, 1858, p.595-9.&lt;/ref&gt; She inherited "a considerable sum of money" from him on his death."&lt;ref name = "mas"/&gt;

His oldest son [[Roderic O'Connor (land commissioner)|Roderic O'Connor]] emigrated to Australia with his two sons, where he became a significant landowner and public official in Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Eldershaw, O'Connor, Roderic, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Volume 2, (MUP), 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Roger's sons were brought up by Burdett. One of these was [[Feargus O'Connor]], one of the main leaders of the Chartists.&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt; The other was [[Francisco Burdett O'Connor]], a commander in [[Simón Bolívar]]'s army and, later, a Bolivian politician.

==Assessment==
Prendergast concludes that O'Connor showed great courage in his patriotic statements during his arrest and imprisonment for alleged sedition, but that his eccentric personality and Irish nationalism "rendered him so odious [in the eyes of his enemies] that the grossest charges would be willingly believed".&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt; [[James Dunkerley]] says that several authors have described O'Connor as "a little mad", adding that the ''Chronicles of Eri'' is a "colourful concoction - a more 'imagined community' it would be hard to locate outside of Atlantis".&lt;ref name = "jim"/&gt; Madden considered him to be possessed of considerable "cleverness, cunning, astuteness and plausibility", but argued that the personal charm and persuasiveness that made his conversation and speech-making so powerful, was never translated into print. His writings were bombastic: "he wrote in the genuine Boanerges Bombastes-Furioso style, wherein the [[Ancient Pistol|swaggering Pistol]] talked in the true Ercles vein. His various political pamphlets are couched in terms of extravagant hyperbole".&lt;ref name = "mas"/&gt;

'''Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz''' (born {{Birth date|1939|9|10|mf=yes}}) is an American historian, writer and [[Feminism|feminist]].

== Personal life ==
Born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], in 1939 to an [[Oklahoma]] family, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz grew up in [[Central Oklahoma]], daughter of a [[sharecropper]] and a mother that Dunbar believes to have been partially [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. Dunbar's paternal grandfather, a settler of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry, was a landed farmer, veterinarian, a labor activist and a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] member in Oklahoma and also a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], "Wobblies." Her father was named after the leaders of the Industrial Workers of the World—Moyer Haywood Pettibone Scarberry Dunbar. Her father's stories of her grandfather inspired her to lifelong social justice activism.&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, ''Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie'', University of Oklahoma Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Married at 18, she and her husband moved to San Francisco three years later, where she has lived most of the years since, although the marriage ended. Her account of life up to leaving Oklahoma is recorded in ''Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie''. She has a daughter Michelle. She later married writer [[Simon J. Ortiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2008/05/01/a-revolutionary-identity/|title=A Revolutionary Identity|last=Hylton|first=Forrest|date=May 2008|work=Monthly Review|pages=Volume 60, Issue 01|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Dunbar-Ortiz graduated from [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] in 1963, majoring in History. She began graduate study in the Department of History at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] but transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] completing her doctorate in History in 1974. In addition to the doctorate, she completed the Diplôme of the [[International Law of Human Rights]] at the [[International Institute of Human Rights]], [[Strasbourg]], France in 1983 and an MFA in Creative Writing at [[Mills College]] in 1993.

== Activism ==
From 1967 to 1974, she was a full-time activist living in various parts of the United States, traveling to Europe, [[Mexico]], and [[Cuba]]. She is also a veteran of the [[women's liberation movement]]. ''Outlaw Woman: Memoir of the War Years'' outlines this time of her life, chronicling the years 1960–1975.&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, ''Outlaw Woman: Memoir of the War Years'', City Lights, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; She contributed the piece "Female liberation as the basis for social revolution" to the 1970 anthology ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sisterhood-is-powerful-an-anthology-of-writings-from-the-womens-liberation-movement/oclc/96157 |title=Sisterhood is powerful : an anthology of writings from the women's liberation movement (Book, 1970) |publisher=[WorldCat.org] |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, she accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the newly established [[Native American Studies]] program at [[California State University at Hayward]], near San Francisco, and helped develop the Department of [[Ethnic Studies]], as well as [[Women's Studies]]. In the wake of the [[Wounded Knee Siege]] of 1973, she became active in the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) and the [[International Indian Treaty Council]], beginning a lifelong commitment to [[indigenous peoples]]' right to [[self-determination]] and to [[international human rights]].

Her first book, ''The Great Sioux Nation: An Oral History of the Sioux Nation and its Struggle for Sovereignty'', was published in 1977 and presented as the fundamental document at the first international conference on Indians of the Americas, held at United Nations' headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The book was issued in a new edition by University of Nebraska Press in 2013. It was followed by two other books: ''Roots of Resistance: A History of Land Tenure in New Mexico'' (1980) and ''Indians of the Americas: Human Rights and Self-Determination'' (1984). She also edited two anthologies on Native American economic development, while heading the [[Institute for Native American Development]] at the [[University of New Mexico]].

In her work ''An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States'', Dunbar-Ortiz condemns the [[Discovery doctrine|Discovery Doctrine]] and the colonialism that devastated Native American populations in the United States. She compares this form of religious bigotry to the modern-day conquests of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States|last = Dunbar-Ortiz|first = Roxanne|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 2014|isbn =|location = Boston|pages = 197–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that with much of the current land within the United States was taken by aggression and oppression, "Native peoples have vast claims to reparations and restitution," yet "[n]o monetary amount can compensate for lands illegally seized, particularly those sacred lands necessary for Indigenous peoples to regain social coherence."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1981, Dunbar-Ortiz was asked to visit [[Sandinista]] [[Nicaragua]] to appraise the [[land tenure]] situation of the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] Indians in the northeastern region of the country. Her two trips there that year coincided with the beginning of United States government's sponsorship of a [[proxy war]] to overthrow the Sandinistas, with the northeastern region on the border with [[Honduras]] becoming a war zone and the basis for extensive propaganda carried out by the Reagan administration against the Sandinistas. In over a hundred trips to Nicaragua and Honduras from 1981 to 1989, she monitored what was called the [[Contra War]]. She tells of these years in ''Caught in the Crossfire: The Miskitu Indians of Nicaragua'' (1985) and ''Blood on the Border: A Memoir of the Contra War'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, ''Blood on the Border: A Memoir of the Contra War'', South End Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She is featured in the feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/women/|title=The Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/the-film/ |title=The Film — She's Beautiful When She's Angry |publisher=Shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is Professor [[Emeritus|Emerita]] of Ethnic Studies at [[California State University, Hayward]]. Since retiring from university teaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ANALYZING THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENTS WITH ROBERTO LOVATO AND ROXANNE DUNBAR-ORTIZ |date=November 29, 2011 |accessdate=2018-04-28 |url=https://www.csueastbay.edu/news/2011/11/Dunbar-OrtizUprising-101411.html |publisher=CSU East Bay |quote=Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz is a long-time activist and author ... professor emeritus in the Department of Ethnic Studies at California State University East Bay in Hayward, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has been lecturing widely and writes.

== Awards ==
The [[Lannan Literary Awards|Lannan Foundation]] awarded Dunbar-Ortiz the 2017 Cultural Freedom Award, "for the achievements of her lifetime of tireless work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lannan.org/cultural-freedom/detail/2017-lannan-cultural-freedom-prize-awarded-to-roxanne-dunbar-ortiz|title=2017 Lannan Cultural Freedom Prize awarded to Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz|website=Lannan Foundation|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22006">'''Strategic reset''' was a policy framework designed to stop counterproductive U.S. engagement in a fragmenting [[Iraq]] and to strengthen the [[United States]]' stance throughout the [[Middle East]]. In [[military]] terms, "reset" refers to "a series of actions to restore units to a desired level of combat capability commensurate with future mission requirements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/joint013107/multi%20testimony013107.pdf "Readiness Committee Written Statement." Brigadier General Charles A. Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The proposal advocates harnessing U.S. military, economic, and diplomatic power to protect critical [[national security]] interests rather than expending this power in efforts to accommodate political progress amid multiple [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–08)|internal]] and [[Iraq War|external]] conflicts in [[Iraq]]. The plan for strategic reset entails four key measures: 
*acknowledging Iraq's [[politics of Iraq|political]] and [[demography|demographic]] fragmentation
*implementing prompt [[phased redeployment|phased military redeployment]]
*establishing local and regional methods for improving security and [[diplomacy]] in the Middle East
*developing a functional strategy to resolve the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].
The framework was set forth in a 2007 report by the [[Center for American Progress]], a [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[think tank]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/strategic_reset.html Center for American Progress: "Strategic Reset"] retrieved 27 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Center for American Progress]] developed the framework for strategic reset on the premise that "with the [[Iraq War]] well into its fifth year, the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush administration]] still lacks a realistic plan for the Middle East and Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/strategic_reset.html   www.americanprogress.org] retrieved 27 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Senior Fellows Brian Katulis and [[Lawrence Korb|Lawrence J. Korb]], together with Peter Juul, laid out the plan in the form of a 64-page report released [[June 25, 2007]].

In 2007, when retired [[U.S. Marine Corps]] Gen. [[John J. Sheehan]] published a newspaper [[editorial]] explaining his decision not to accept the position of "War Czar" or [[War Czar|White House implementation manager]] for the conflicts in Iraq and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], he wrote:
* "What I found in discussions with current and former members of this administration is that there is no agreed-upon strategic view of the Iraq problem or the region. ... &lt;nowiki&gt;[A]&lt;/nowiki&gt;fter thoughtful discussions with people both in and outside of this administration, I concluded that the current Washington decision-making process lacks a linkage to a broader view of the region and how the parts fit together strategically."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/15/AR2007041500564.html "Why I Declined to Serve.” ''Washington Post'', 16 Apr 2007] qtd. in CAP&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing Gen. Sheehan, the report gives examples from what are described as seven years of relative progress in the Middle East (1994–2000) followed by seven years of setbacks (2001–2007), such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the bipartisan [[Iraq Study Group]] released a [[Iraq Study Group Report|report]] stressing the need for troop withdrawal and for redoubled diplomatic efforts, including efforts to address the Arab–Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/iraq_study_group_report.pdf Iraq Study Group Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601191410/http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/iraq_study_group_report.pdf |date=2009-06-01}} pp 6–7, retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The report also said that the Iraqi government "should accelerate assuming responsibility for Iraqi security," and that the "primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of supporting the [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi army]], which would take over primary responsibility for combat operations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/iraq_study_group_report.pdf Iraq Study Group Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601191410/http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/iraq_study_group_report.pdf |date=2009-06-01}} p 7, retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the strategic reset framework disagree with the latter terms, claiming that "the ISG was examining an Iraq that simply does not exist anymore," and that embedding U.S. forces to support Iraqi ones "would create unmanageable force protection problems for U.S. troops."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP "Strategic Reset"] p 6 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic reset emphasizes making [[counterterrorism]] the primary role of U.S. troops, rather than engaging them in [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)|sectarian]] conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP "Strategic Reset"] p 30 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It also emphasizes the necessity of recognizing Iraq's failed national reconciliation and adapting U.S. [[American intervention in the Middle East|policy]] to the inevitable decentralization of Iraqi politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP "Strategic Reset"] p 10 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described as "strategic reset" a proposal by U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] that took the form of "an unusually detailed public explanation of the new American effort to create a de facto alliance between Israel and moderate Arab states against Iranian extremism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501555.html "Rice's Strategic Reset." ''Washington Post'' 26 Jan 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of the strategic reset framework==
Advocates of strategic reset maintain that the current administration's misjudgments regarding Iraq policy have jeopardized the United States' [[national security]] interests and that it must act now in order to prevent further [[attrition warfare|attrition]] of its military and to effectively confront a growing global terrorist threat. The strategy requires that U.S. troops rapidly be withdrawn from Iraq and enlisted in efforts to counter this threat, while available political resources are deployed throughout the Middle East in order to minimize conflict in Iraq and to ensure stability in the region at large. It also requires the U.S. to take action on several fronts, especially the Arab–Israeli conflict, in order to build international support and promote regional commitment to this stability. A further requirement is that the international community cooperate to promote [[rule of law]] and to encourage legitimate, non-aggressive governments in the Middle East, preventing the formation of "[[power vacuum|security vacuums]]" exploited by [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/strategic_reset.html CAP] retrieved 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adapting to Iraq's fragmentation===
Since 2005, Iraq's major sectarian conflicts have continued to generate violence at high levels, and Iraq has failed to engineer a political solution to the problems that fuel them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/ohanlon/20070610.htm Brookings Institution] retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Iraq, [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]], [[Kurds]], and [[Arab]]s are fighting over the jurisdiction of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]], and [[Turkey]] is conducting raids on the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=115251 ''Today's Zaman''] retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In the south and west, respectively, there is intra-[[Shi'a]] violence and violence between [[Iraq]]i [[Sunni]]s and Sunnis linked to [[Al-Qaeda]];  [[Baghdad]] and surrounding areas host the deadliest violence in the form of [[Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)|civil war]] between Sunni and Shi'a.&lt;ref name="CAP report"&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf  CAP report] p 5 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of strategic reset point out that no significant progress has been made on "benchmarks" established by U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] such as constitutional reform or laws regulating provincial [[election]]s, distribution of [[petroleum|oil]] revenue, or treatment of citizens subject to [[de-Baathification]]; they argue that no realistic policy can predicate the resolution of Iraq's sectarian conflicts on the rule of a unified Iraqi governing authority.  On June 26, 2007, for example, Iraqi [[commando]]s raided the house of Culture Minister Asad Kamal al-Hashimi, who is believed to have ordered an assassination attempt fatal to both sons of Mithal al-Alusi, a member of Iraq's [[Council of Representatives (Iraq)|parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/4921926.html "Sunni Leaders Angry Over Arrest Warrant." ''Houston Chronicle'' 26  June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the CAP, "Iraq's leaders fundamentally disagree on what kind of country Iraq is and should be, and Iraq's political transition has not succeeded in bridging these divides. This lack of political consensus among Iraq's leaders has resulted in a violent struggle for power."&lt;ref name="CAP report"/&gt;

====Stopping unconditional arming of security forces====
[[File:Iraqi Police.jpg|thumb|right|Iraqi police on patrol in [[Karabilah]] after an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] was found in a girls school]]
Under the strategic reset framework, one immediate response to the  political [[stalemate]] is cessation of the ongoing provision of weapons to [[Iraqi Security Forces|Iraqi security forces]], whose number now exceeds 500,000. According to the CAP, these security forces—who continue to receive considerable U.S. support—exhibit divided loyalties that stem directly from divisions in the political structure; they have been implicated in corruption, militia membership, death squads, and killing American troops sent to train them. "The fundamental problem with Iraq's security forces is that they lack the allegiance and in many cases the motivation to defend their country. The United States has poured more than [[$US|$]]20 billion into building a national army and police force that does not have the unity and support of its own leaders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf  CAP report] pp 16–18 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters of the strategic reset see two dangers in allowing the current policy of arming and training these security forces to continue: the first danger is that the U.S. is providing weaponry to opposing sides of a [[Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)|civil war]]. For example, [[Matthew Yglesias]], writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', has said,
*"&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]&lt;/nowiki&gt;his business of arming and training Iraqi security forces in the absence of a political solution is not just a waste of time and money, but directly counterproductive. Our weapons and funding are fueling civil conflict in the face of deep political fragmentation and there are absolutely no guarantees as to who these arms will be turned against next year or the year after that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/strategic_reset.php "Strategic Reset," ''The Atlantic'' Online, 25 Jun 2007] retrieved  29 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The second danger arises from the fact that the majority of Iraq's security forces are Shi'a who constitute "some of the closest allies of America's greatest rival in the Middle East—[[Iran]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf  CAP report] pp 13–14 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decentralization====
A second response to fragmentation in Iraqi politics is decentralization of U.S. policy and power structure in Iraq. The strategic reset framework calls for reassignment of personnel from the [[Embassy of the United States in Baghdad|U.S. Embassy in Baghdad]] into "provincial outposts" established throughout Iraq. It also calls for the U.S. to forgo building a new Baghdad embassy, one projected to be the world's largest. According to the report, the adoption of this pragmatic, localized approach to placing diplomats and intelligence employees would represent progress on three fronts: It would provide bases for intelligence operations to counter [[terrorism]], allow U.S. officials to give [[consulate|consular]] support to Iraq's estimated 2 million internally [[displaced persons]], and bring U.S. personnel into closer working relationships with local Iraqi institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report] p 22 retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phased military redeployment===
[[Phased redeployment]] is the strategic reset framework's second mainstay. The plan calls for the U.S. immediately to announce "that it does not intend to maintain permanent military bases or forces in Iraq" and to initiate a new deployment structure allowing forces currently serving in Iraq to rotate home, while incoming troops conduct counterterrorism missions from locations such as [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Kuwait]]. A temporary force of 8,000–10,000 should remain in northern Iraq until 2009, but virtually all other troops are to leave Iraq by September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report] pp 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; Redeployment is crucial to the reset strategy chiefly because of its potential to undermine terrorism: proponents argue that U.S. military presence in Iraq gives Al-Qaeda a powerful recruiting tool, as well as ideological justification for continued violence. The most damaging blow the U.S. can deal to such organizations in Iraq, they argue, is to withdraw. [[Ayman al-Zawahiri|Ayman al-Zawahri]] said on May 5, 2007, that a proposed U.S. redeployment would "deprive us of the opportunity to destroy the American forces which we have caught in a historic trap."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=3143623 ABC News 5 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reset would remove U.S. troops from Iraq while preserving the ability to strike terrorist targets there and elsewhere. The "post-redeployment U.S. force structure in the Middle East would include: an [[United States Army|Army]] [[brigade]] and a tactical air [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] stationed in Kuwait; two light, mobile Army brigades stationed in the northern Kurdish areas [of Iraq]; a Marine Expeditionary unit afloat in the Persian Gulf; and four to five Army combat brigades stationed in Afghanistan to complete the unaccomplished mission of eradicating [[Al Qaeda]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report] p 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and diplomacy===
The plan combines [[redeployment]] with initiatives to promote security and diplomacy in the [[Middle East]]. These include: 
*Increased efforts to enlist Iraq's neighboring countries in regional progress toward stabilization. The strategy proposes to involve these neighbors by alerting them to the potential local costs of further destabilization; it also suggests that the presence of redeployed U.S. forces will act as a deterrent to those who might otherwise be tempted to exploit Iraq's current weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report p 33]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Specific measures to prevent escalation of conflict among [[Kurds]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]]s, and [[Arab]]s near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]]. Kirkuk, rich in oil and populated by a Kurdish majority, is the subject of a scheduled [[referendum]] that is expected to result in the city becoming part of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]—a prospect frightening to Kirkuk's [[minority group|minorities]] as well as to its neighbors [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118290539957349396?mod=googlenews_wsj "Why Iraq's Kirkuk Is Vital," ''Wall Street Journal'' 27 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Security initiatives aimed at [[jihadists]] returning to find targets for violence in their home countries once the United States has left Iraq. The strategic reset capitalizes on connections forged between intelligence networks and local authorities by increased diplomatic efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report p 36]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Humanitarian aid to Iraq's refugees. Some 4 million Iraqis have been displaced by the conflict, fleeing either to [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and countries in the [[Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf region]]; or to locations mostly within southern and central Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22786&amp;Cr=Iraq&amp;Cr1= United Nations press release]&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy aims to build international support for these [[displaced persons]]. It also suggests that, for [[morality|moral]] as well as for political reasons, the U.S. should sharply increase the number of Iraqi refugees it annually accepts, from the current 7,000 up to 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report p 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
[[File:Mauer-betlehem.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Israeli West Bank barrier]]]]
Strategic reset requires that U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] be significantly upgraded. The first major reason for this requirement is that the conflict is considered to have deep destabilizing effects on the entire region; the second is that, since the conflict is seen as a driving force behind [[anti-American sentiment]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2003/issue4/jv7n4a6.html "Causes of Anti-Americanism in the Arab World"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907051421/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2003/issue4/jv7n4a6.html |date=2006-09-07 }} ''Middle East Review of International Affairs''&lt;/ref&gt; enhanced American participation in the [[List of Middle East peace proposals#Arab–Israeli peace diplomacy and treaties|peace process]] would leave the U.S. in a stronger political position regionally. The strategy calls for [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] to appoint a Middle East envoy and two senior [[ambassador]]s as an initial step in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report p 42]&lt;/ref&gt; Further key steps would include:
*Strategies to manage crises such as the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]]
*Provision of a diplomatic framework to coordinate regional and international peace proposals
*Diplomatic outreach to [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] similar to U.S. [[Cold War]] diplomatic strategy with [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]]
*"Smartly targeted" [[rule of law]] support to alleviate [[power vacuum|security vacuums]] caused by political instability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/iraq_report.pdf CAP report p 44]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
David Gooden, writing for the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', has criticized the proposal as "imperial liberalism," claiming that "[F]oreign military occupations are the root cause of Islamic terrorism" and that "[t]he Center for American Progress' plan for a 'strategic reset' will not achieve a lasting or a just peace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.dmregister.com/?p=6625 "Imperial liberalism on display: 'progressive' think-tank calls for 'redeployment'"] ''Des Moines Register'', 26 Jun 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Ancient times||Typical skeletal abnormalities of tuberculosis, including characteristic [[Pott disease|Pott's deformities]], are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]] and are depicted in early Egyptian art. Tuberculosis is also noted in the [[Bible|Biblical]] books of [[Deuteronomy]] and [[Leviticus]]. Written texts describe tuberculosis in India as early as 3300 years ago and in China 2300 years ago. Tuberculosis is well known in [[classical Greece]], where it is called ''phthisis''.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=M. Daniel|title=The history of tuberculosis|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2006.08.006|url=http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111%2806%2900401-X/fulltext#back-bib19|volume=100|journal=Respiratory Medicine|pages=1862–1870|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="resmedjournal.com" /&gt;
|-
|Middle Ages and Renaissance||The incidence of tuberculosis grows progressively in these times, displacing [[leprosy]], peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers move to the cities looking for work.&lt;ref&gt;Aufderheide 1998:129&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Europe, tuberculosis is known as the “king’s evil” and is widely believed that the kings of England and France can cure ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]]'' simply by touching those affected.&lt;ref name="news-medical.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Tuberculosis.aspx|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1700s–1800s||Description of tuberculosis is developed in medical literature. Toward 1800s [[sanatoria]] start to open for treating patients, with often successful outcomes. Understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of tuberculosis begins with the works of [[René Laennec|Laennec]], [[Jean Antoine Villemin|Villemin]] and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent by [[Robert Koch]].
|-
|1920s–1930s||The [[International Union Against Tuberculosis]] (IUAT) is founded. [[BCG vaccine]] against tuberculosis is developed. Several international conferences are held, focusing on the fundamental, biological, clinical and social aspects of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="theunion"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.theunion.org/who-we-are/history|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1940s onward||During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis - little knowing or caring that by that time, a cure was nearly achieved. The isolation of [[streptomycin]] is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis. The revolution continues with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastens recovery times, and significantly reduces the number of tuberculosis cases in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box 1: History of tuberculosis drug development|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/box/nrd4001_BX1.html|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raviglione|first1=Mario C.|title=Tuberculosis: The Essentials, Fourth Edition|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlvvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22isoniazid%22+%22revolution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzn--kHu5t&amp;sig=cC-jsmrusNmsyZb43k_mNlBPGD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCgOe33PnOAhVMIZAKHcNWBQsQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isoniazid%22%20%22revolution%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1980s onward||Tuberculosis [[antibiotic resistance|drug-resistant]] strains appear, provoking a rise in incidence in countries like [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Also, the association with [[AIDS]] has contributed to the rise of tuberculosis in some sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuberculosis (TB) and other mycobacterial diseases: diagnosis, screening, management and data|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-other-mycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Present||Today, tuberculosis continues to be a top infectious disease killer worldwide. However, the death rate has dropped 47% since 1990. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries, with the most severe burden in Africa.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; At least 1 million children fall ill with tuberculosis each year, represent about 11% of all cases.&lt;ref name="ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN|url=http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/childhood_tb_informationsheet.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|1816||Development||French physician [[René Laennec]], working at the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital]], develops the [[stethoscope]], which proves to be a breakthrough. The stethoscope marks a major step in the redefinition of disease from being a bundle of symptoms, to the current sense of a disease as a problem with an anatomical system even if there are no noticeable symptoms. The work of Laennec is considered to have clearly elucidated the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and unified the concept of the disease, whether pulmonary or extrapulmonary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=Big Ideas: Jacalyn Duffin on the History of the Stethoscope|url=http://ww3.tvo.org/video/182217/jacalyn-duffin-history-stethoscope|publisher=TVO|accessdate=9 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927173037/http://ww3.tvo.org/video/182217/jacalyn-duffin-history-stethoscope|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The history of tuberculosis"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The history of tuberculosis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461110600401X|accessdate=9 September 2016 | doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2006.08.006|volume=100|journal=Respiratory Medicine|pages=1862–1870|year=2006 | last1 = Daniel | first1 = Thomas M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;||[[Paris]], France

|1882||Discovery|| German physician [[Robert Koch]], a founder of modern [[bacteriology]], identifies the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent that causes tuberculosis. Some years later, Koch develops what today is known as [[Koch's postulates]], which he applies to describe the [[etiology]] of [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Koch is also attributed for having created and improved laboratory technologies and techniques in the field of [[microbiology]], and making key discoveries in [[public health]].

== Biography ==

Merkys graduated from Vilnius University's department of history and [[philology]] in 1951. In 1952 he began working at the [[Lithuanian Institute of History|Lithuanian SSR Institute of History]], but for ideological reasons he was soon fired, along with [[Mečislovas Jučas]]. He returned to the Institute in 1953 as a [[fellow]].

He initiated his candidacy for a [[doctorate of philosophy]] degree in 1957 with the thesis ''Revoliucinis Vilniaus miesto darbininkų judėjimas 1895–1904 m.'' (''The Revolutionary Movement of Vilnius City Workers from 1895 to 1904''), and in 1969 he was awarded a doctorate (the Soviet equivalent of [[habilitation]]) for his [[dissertation]] ''Lietuvos pramonės augimas ir proletariato formavimasis XIX amžiuje'' (''The Growth of Lithuanian Industry and the Formation of the Proletariat in the 19th Century'').

In 1986 he left the Institute and was designated head of the Department of Economic History at the Lithuanian SSR Academy of Sciences. He returned to the Institute of History in 1987 and became its director. Between 1992 and 2000 he was a senior fellow there. Merkys has been a professor at Vilnius University since 1991, and was a professor at [[Vytautas Magnus University]] from 1993 to 2000. In 1990 he was elected to the [[Lithuanian Academy of Sciences]], and since 2001 he has been a member of the [[Lithuanian Catholic Academy of Sciences]].

Vytautas Merkys received the Lithuanian presidential award, [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]], third class, in 1995.

== Awards and recognition ==
* [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]], Third Class, 1995
* [[Lithuanian science award]], 1997, for fundamental work on [[knygnešiai|the Lithuanian book smuggling movement between 1864-1904]]

== Important works ==

Vytautas Merkys' principal works focus on Lithuanian 19th-century and early 20th century history, especially the [[Lithuanian national revival]], [[knygnešiai|the Lithuanian book smuggling movement]] during the [[ban on the Lithuanian press]], the work of the 19th-century historian [[Simonas Daukantas]], and the life of the 19th-century bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]].
