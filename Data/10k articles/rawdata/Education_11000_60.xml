The '''Accrediterungs-, Certifizierungs- und Qualitätssicherungs-Institut''' (Accreditation, Certification and Quality Assurance Institute) ('''ACQUIN''') is a school accreditation system founded in the year 2001 as a consequence of the European [[Bologna process]] and the upcoming need for assuring the quality of newly introduced undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in [[Germany]]. ACQUIN is a member-based, [[non-profit organisation]] located in Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany. The Institute operates under the licence of the German Accreditation Council and is thus empowered to award its quality seal to study programs which have successfully undergone accreditation. ACQUIN was reaccredited by the German Accreditation Council until 30 September 2011. ACQUIN operates internationally in several key regions, including the German-speaking European region, Middle and Eastern Europe and North Africa - Near and Middle East.&lt;ref name="acquin1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acquin.org/en/issuesprojects.php |title=ACQUIN Akkreditierungsagentur |publisher=Acquin.org |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eqar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eqar.eu/register/detailpage.html?tx_pxdeqar_pi1[cid]=21&amp;tx_pxdeqar_pi1[back][pid]=6|title=ACQUIN Akkreditierungsagentur |publisher=eqar.eu|date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays ACQUIN is an association of over 100 higher education institutions from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and the United States of America. ACQUIN operates as a non-profit organisation which is financed through membership fees as well as through Higher Education Institutions for accreditation services provided.

The agency is member in various international networks: [http://www.enqa.eu/ The European Network for Quality Assurance] (ENQA), the [[European University Association]] (EUA), the [http://www.ceenetwork.hu/ Central Eastern European Network for Quality Assurance] (CEEN), the [http://www.inqaahe.org/ International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education] (INQAAHE) and the [[Arab Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education]] (ARQAANE).&lt;ref name="acquin1"/&gt;

== History ==
In May 2000, the Bavaria Rectors’ Conference passed a resolution to establish an [[accreditation]] agency that performs accreditation for all types of higher education institutions taking into account all types of programs and disciplines. As a result, the Accreditation, Certification and Quality assurance Institute (ACQUIN) was founded on January 26, 2001 and accredited by the German Accreditation Council on March 22, 2001. The German Accreditation Council reaccredited ACQUIN in 2006 until 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mba-studium.de/faqs/acquin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective of the accreditation ==
ACQUIN’s aim is to support the maintenance and enhancement of quality standards for teaching and learning in higher education and to contribute to the internationalization of German higher education by performing accreditation for all different types of higher education institutions and taking into account all different types of programs and subjects. A main objective is to provide guidance and information for students, employers and higher education institutions and to contribute to more transparency in the market of study programs. Within the accreditation process, the institutional membership of the applicant does not have any decisive influence, neither on the content of the evaluation procedure nor on the accreditation decision-making process.

The main characteristics of ACQUIN are independence, objectivity and high quality. Academic freedom and academic autonomy are respected: Higher education institutions may regulate their own quality and standards, but at the same time they must guarantee transparency of process and public accountability in discharging this self-regulation.

Degree programs are evaluated by reason of their characteristic purpose as well as on the basis of the quality criteria developed and applied by the agency, regardless of their institutional membership. The make-up of the decision-making bodies does not allow biased persons to intervene in the current procedure. Not only professors and higher education experts, but also students and independent representatives of professional practice participate actively in the accreditation procedures, while members of the state can observe the activities of the agency.

== Accredited Institutions ==
Currently, ACQUIN has accredited more than 100 higher education institutions from countries including Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Lebanon and the United States, among them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acquin.org/en/accredited.php |title=ACQUIN Akkreditierungsagentur |publisher=Acquin.org |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.uni-freiburg.de/germanistik/studium/studiengang/acquin/view&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Bernhard van Raalte''' (21 May 1890, [[Amsterdam]] – 23 November 1952) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[conducting|conductor]], the son of Izak van Raalte and Carolina van Engel.  He began music studies at age 7, from such teachers as Herman Meerlo and Arnold Drilsma (both violin), and J.W. Kersbergen (piano).

From 1906 to 1909, van Raalte studied at the [[Hochschule für Musik Köln]], where his teachers included [[Fritz Steinbach]] (conducting), Bram Eldering ([[violin]]), Lazzaro Uzielli (piano), and Waldemar von Baussern ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]).  He later pursued further studies in [[music theory]] with [[Max Reger]] and in conducting with [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Camille Saint-Saëns]].  His conducting career began with a 1909 concert at the ''Musikalische Gesellschaft'' in Cologne.  In 1911-1912, he was a [[répétiteur]] at [[La Monnaie]] ([[Brussels]]).  He worked as an [[opera]] conductor in Germany and the Netherlands from 1912 until the outbreak of World War II.

From 1928 to 1940, van Raalte conducted concerts on Dutch radio ([[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=919210 | last=Antcliffe | first=Herbert | title=Musical Notes from Abroad: Holland | journal=The Musical Times | volume=75 | issue=1096 | pages=556 | date=June 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his dismissal during [[World War II]].  After the war, from 1945 to 1949, he served as the first principal conductor of the [[Radio Filharmonisch Orkest]]. He also undertook guest conducting opportunities, such as with the Scottish [National] Orchestra.

Van Raalte married Helena Wilhelmina Sophia Horneman on 23 July 1918.  The couple had one son.

The '''Belgian American Educational Foundation''' ('''BAEF''') is an independent philanthropy. It supports the exchange of university students, scientists and scholars between the [[United States]] and [[Belgium]]. The foundation fosters the higher education of deserving Belgians and Americans through its exchange-fellowship program. Since 1977, Dr. [[Emile Boulpaep]] is the president of the BAEF.

==History==
During [[World War I]], from October 1914, [[Herbert Hoover]] organized the [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] (USA) and the ''Commission for Relief in Belgium'' (Belgium). After the war, the [[University Foundation]], and on 9 January 1920, the B.A.E.F., were founded with the budget remaining in the hands of the Commission after five years of relief work. The ''Belgian American Educational Foundation'' became the heir of the Commission for Relief in Belgium.

After World War I, the BAEF invested in land and buildings for the [[Universite Libre de Bruxelles]] (Solbosch campus) and also for rebuilding the library of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]]. In 1925, the BAEF founded the ''Hoover Foundation for the Development of the University of Brussels'' and the ''Hoover Foundation for the Development of the University of Leuven''. The BAEF started providing scholarships for students study abroad.

See was also a book critic for the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] for 27 years.

==Early life==
See was born in [[Pasadena, California]] to Kate Louise Sullivan Daly and George Laws in 1934 .&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lives Our Mothers Leave Us: Prominent Women Discuss the Complex, Humorous, and Ultimately Loving Relationships They Have with Their Mothers|last=Davis|first=Patti|publisher=Hay House, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=9781401921620|location=United States of America|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; See's father was a would-be novelist and sometimes journalist who told her to read the Horatio Hornblower books when she was eight so that she wouldn't later get stuck in the nautical details of ''Moby Dick''.&lt;ref name=ContInt&gt;{{cite journal |last1=See |first1=Carolyn |title=Carolyn See |journal=Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series |date=1995 |volume=22 |url=http://www.carolynsee.com/Interviews/contemporary1.pdf |accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her early years in Eagle Rock, California.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her father left when she was eleven and she was raised by her mother whom See described as a mean alcoholic.&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Carolyn had a younger sister Maureen who was 15 years younger who struggled with addiction and eventually died from the use of heroin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the age of 16, Carolyn went to live with her father and his new wife in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
See earned her associate degree from [[Los Angeles City College]]. During her second year at City college she married Richard See and moved with him to Newfoundland where he was mustered for the Korean War.&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt; When they returned to L.A., See attended and earned her M.A. from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and gave birth to her first daughter, [[Lisa See]].&lt;ref name="biography.jrank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; See won the Samuel Goldwyn Creative Writing Contest in 1958 for her unpublished novel ''The Waiting Game'' and used the two hundred and fifty dollar prize money to pay for her divorce from Richard See.&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt; After her divorce, See married Tom Sturak and had her second daughter Clara Sturak.&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt; See later finished her doctorate at UCLA and her dissertation was on the Hollywood novel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the late 1960s See began writing articles for the [[Los Angeles Times]] and celebrity profiles for [[TV Guide]].&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt; At this time See worked out her writing habit—one thousand words a day on white unlined paper in felt pens.&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt; While writing non-fiction articles and reviews, See was approached by [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] editor Harry Sions who encouraged her to write a novel which became ''The Rest is Done with Mirrors''.&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt;

See's first teaching job was as a professor of English at [[Loyola Marymount University]] from 1970 until 1985.&lt;ref name="biography.jrank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ContInt /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was followed by a period as a visiting professor of English at her alma mater, [[UCLA]], from 1986 to 1989, where she would later become an adjunct professor.&lt;ref name="biography.jrank.org"/&gt; See also earned money by testifying for the defense in pornography trials, leading to the successful book ''Blue Money: Pornography and the Pornographers''.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn See, [http://therumpus.net/2009/10/the-scholars-and-the-pornographer The Scholars and the Pornographer]," The Rumpus October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides writing, See also contributed to the literary world through reviews, and sat on review boards for awards.  See was a frequent book reviewer for ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; having previously been a book reviewer for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[Newsday]]''.&lt;ref name="biography.jrank.org"/&gt;  See retired from the Washington Post in 2014 after 27 years.&lt;ref name=retire&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Ron|title=Carolyn See retires from Book World|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style-blog/wp/2014/08/05/carolyn-see-retires-from-book-world/|accessdate=8 October 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; See has been on the boards of the [[National Book Critics Circle]] and PENWest International.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She lived in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], [[California]].

See also wrote books under the pen name '''Monica Highland''', a name she shared with two others, her daughter [[Lisa See]] and her longtime companion, [[John Espey]], who died in 2000.

See was known for writing novels set in Los Angeles and co-edited books that revolved around the city, including a book of short stories, ''LA Shorts'', and the pictorial books ''Santa Monica Bay: Paradise by the Sea : A Pictorial History of Santa Monica, Venice, Marina Del Rey, Ocean Park, Pacific Palisades, Topanga &amp; Malibu'', and ''The California Pop-Up Book'', which celebrates the city's unique architecture.

== Writing life ==
See described her ideal day is to "write two hours, work in the yard for two hours, and write ten pieces of mail, that's all I want to do. It never works out that--or not often."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inter/View: Talks with America's Writing Women|last=Pearlman|first=Mickey|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1990|isbn=9780813159683|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Carolyn See was married twice—first to Richard See and then Tom Sturak.&lt;ref name="ContInt" /&gt; She was then with long-time companion John Espey from 1974 until his death in 2000. See had two daughters, novelist [[Lisa See]] and Clara Sturak.

== Philosophical and/or political views ==
See was a [[feminist]], and said of [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', "I was one of the persons whose lives that book changed."&lt;ref name="ContInt" /&gt; After the publication of Rhine Maidens See announced that she wasn't interested in writing women's novel anymore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; See was vocal that Blue Money was the only book of hers that men ever read.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Soprano]] '''Christine Brewer''' (born October 26, 1955) is an [[United States|American]] [[opera]] singer.

==Biography==
Brewer grew up in the [[Mississippi River]] town of [[Grand Tower, Illinois]]. She attended [[McKendree University]] in [[Lebanon, Illinois]] and concentrated on music education. She was a music teacher for several years before embarking on a professional music performing career.

She began her career in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] with the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra|Saint Louis Symphony]] Chorus. She auditioned in 1981 for the chorus of [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] (OTSL),&lt;ref name="Schweitzer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://vivienschweitzer.com/profiles/brewerblurb.html | title=I Remind Myself That Nothing is as Hard as Teaching a School Choir | work=Financial Times | author=Vivien Schweitzer | date=2004-08-16 | accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the start of her career in opera.  Her first OTSL work was in the chorus of "[[The Beggars Opera]]" in 1982. Her first major role with OTSL was as Ellen Orford in ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' in 1990.

In 1989, she participated in a masterclass with [[Birgit Nilsson]], and was one of the 10 winners of the National Council auditions sponsored by the Metropolitan Opera. While her daughter Elisabeth was in school during the academic year, Brewer deliberately limited her work in staged opera productions.&lt;ref name="Schweitzer"/&gt; She returned more actively to the opera stage after her daughter's high school graduation. She began to accept roles including a debut in the title role of [[Richard Strauss]]' [[Ariadne auf Naxos]] at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 2003, which has become a signature role for Brewer.

Brewer is most famous for her interpretations of roles by [[Wagner]], [[Strauss]] and [[Britten]] including [[Isolde]], [[Ariadne]], Färberin (''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]''), Ellen Orford (''[[Peter Grimes]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/arts/music/30grim.html | title=Gentle Desert Breeze for Troubled Fisherman | work=New York Times | author=Bernard Holland | date=2005-07-30 | accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (''[[Gloriana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/20/arts/music/20oper.html | title=Long Live a Beleaguered Tribute to Britannia | work=New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=2005-06-20 | accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She made her debut at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in 2006 singing the title role in [[Beethoven]]'s [[Fidelio]] and returned the following season singing the role of [[Isolde]] in [[Tristan und Isolde]].

Brewer is a regular featured singer at [[The Proms]] and the [[Wigmore Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/09/classicalmusicandopera5 | title=Wagner/Wolf/Britten/Carter: Songs, Brewer/Vignoles (Wigmore Hall Live) | work=The Guardian | author=Tim Ashley | date=2008-05-09 | accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2009, Brewer had to withdraw from the complete Ring Cycle at the Metropolitan Opera because of a knee injury.

In August 2012, Ms Brewer sang the same program that her mentor [[Birgit Nilsson]] sang at the opening of the Concert Hall at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in [[Sydney, Australia]] 40 years before. It was an all-Wagner program, three performances with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra playing and conducted by [[Simone Young]].

In January 2013, Brewer created the role of Sister Aloysius in the world premiere of [[Douglas Cuomo]]'s opera ''Doubt'' at the [[Minnesota Opera]].

''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' in April 2007 named her one of the top 20 sopranos of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/mar/14/arethesethe20bestsopranos1 |title=Are these the 20 best sopranos of the recorded era? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |author=Martin Kettle |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She continues to work with young students in the sixth grade classroom at [[Marissa, Illinois]] where she had formerly taught music, in an outreach program in conjunction with the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]]. She currently lives in [[Lebanon, Illinois]], with her husband Ross Brewer, a retired social studies teacher.

The '''Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California''' ('''CENIC''') is a nonprofit corporation formed in 1997 to provide high-performance, high-bandwidth networking services to [[California]] universities and research institutions.  Through this corporation, representatives from all of California's K-20 public education combine their networking resources toward the operation, deployment, and maintenance of the California Research and Education Network, or '''CalREN'''.  Today, CalREN operates over 8,000 miles of fiber optic cable and serves more than 20 million users.

== History ==
Beginning in the mid 1980s, research universities were served by a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded network, NSFNet. This funding ended, however, in 1995, as the NSF believed that the newly established commercial Internet could meet the needs of these institutions.

A model for wide-area networking began to emerge in the early 1990s, separating regional network infrastructure from national or international “backbone” infrastructure. Regional networks would connect to one or more “Internet exchange points” where traffic would be sent to or received from one or more backbone networks. When NSFNet ceased operation, this new network structure carried both research and commercial traffic.

Researchers at major universities soon began to complain that service from the commercial Internet was inadequate. This led to discussion of a separate network, funded by and for research universities, and the ultimate establishment of [[Internet2]]. The [[Internet2]] backbone would have only two connection points in California.

At the same time, officials at the University of California, USC, Caltech, Stanford, and the California State University system (CSU) began discussing how to connect their institutions to the proposed new [[Internet2]] network. They recognized that the key to a comprehensive information technology strategy was the development of a cohesive and seamless statewide, high-speed, advanced service network. In 1996, the University of California Office of the President, on behalf of these universities, applied for NSF funding to establish, with matching funds, a California network to provide this capacity.

When the consortium learned it would receive a grant award, its members created a not-for-profit organization independent of the founding institutions to build and manage the network. The Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California (CENIC) was created in 1997. CENIC’s California Research and Education Network (CalREN) first became operational in 1998, providing connections to Internet2 for the [[University of California]] campuses, Stanford, Caltech, USC, and CSU campuses. Initially, the CSU sites linked to CENIC’s network through interconnection between CalREN and 4CNet, the CSU network that already provided Internet services to all CSU campuses and the California Community Colleges.

In 2000, the State of California provided funding to the University of California for the Digital California Project, which allowed K-12 schools to connect to CalREN. The University of California contracted with CENIC to develop and implement the project, with county offices of education as the primary connection points.

Next, CENIC began to design a network architecture to support all educational institutions. In 2002, the CENIC board of directors decided to obtain fiber leases for the major north-south portion of the CalREN network, putting in place an architecture that continues to the present day. CENIC has continued to add more leased fiber to its network, and today CalREN operates over 8,000 miles of fiber.

Between 2003 and 2005, CSU campuses and California Community Colleges were migrated from 4CNet to CalREN. In 2004, the Legislature shifted funding for K-12 connectivity from the University of California to the California Department of Education. This legislation also created the California K-12 High Speed Network (K12HSN) program to coordinate K-12’s participation in CENIC. Network and Internet services are currently provided to the 86 K-12 connection locations, most of which serve as aggregation node sites. These connections provide network access for 79% (7,946) of schools, 87% (861) of school districts, and 100% (58) of county offices of education in California. It is estimated that CalREN serves nearly 4.8 million K-12 public school students. In 2005, the California Community Colleges joined CENIC separately from CSU, with membership equal to that of the University of California, CSU, and the K-12 system.

In 2013, Governor Brown and the California State Legislature funded an initiative to help California’s nearly 1,200 public libraries receive high-speed broadband service. The California State Library joined CENIC on behalf of the public libraries and contracted with Califa, a non-profit library membership consortium representing library jurisdictions in California, to administer the program. That work is well underway, with almost 80% of library jurisdictions now connecting to CalREN.

Over the years, affiliated educational, governmental, medical research, and cultural institutions throughout the state have been brought into the fold, creating the country's largest statewide research and education network, which now serves more than 20 million users.

==The California Research and Education Network==
CalREN is a three-tiered network consisting of a statewide optical backbone to which schools and other institutions in California connect at Gigabit speeds via leased circuits obtained from telecom carriers or fiber-optic cable.  These tiers include:

* CalREN-DC (Digital California): This tier includes services for all K-20 California research and education users.  Backbone speed for this tier is 100 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100-Gigabit Upgrade for CENIC’s California Research &amp; Education Network|url=http://cenic.org/news/item/100-gigabit-upgrade-for-cenics-california-research-education-network|website=CENIC.org|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CalREN-HPR (High-Performance Research): This tier includes leading-edge services for large application users.  Backbone speed for this tier is 100 Gbit/s.
* CalREN-XD (Experimental and Developmental): This tier consists of a set of network resources that can be built to order to facilitate bleeding-edge services for network and other researchers.  This tier has no set maximum bandwidth.

All three network tiers operate independently.  This enables network and other researchers on the XD and HPR tiers to push the boundaries of network research and performance without impacting performance for the other tiers.

==Network peering==
CENIC also engages in networking peering relationships, in particular [[Pacific Wave]] (a joint project between CENIC and the Pacific Northwest Gigapop, the [[University of southern california|University of Southern California]], and the [[University of Washington]]), which provides peering facilities along the Pacific coast of the United States.  [[Pacific Wave]] participants include networks in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Qatar]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], and the United States.

CENIC engaged in peering via the TransitRail national-level peering structure. TransitRail has been merged with [[Internet2]]'s Commodity Peering Service.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==CENIC and other networks==
CalREN also connects to the California Telehealth Network, [[ESnet]] (Energy Sciences Network), [[Internet2]], [[CUDI]] (the Corporación Universitaria para el Desarrollo de Internet), the Mexican high-bandwidth research and education network, [[redCLARA]] (the Cooperación Latino-Americana de Redes Avanzadas), and [[CAnet]]4 (the Canadian optical research and education network, managed by [[CANARIE]]).

CENIC is also a member of the Global Lambda Integrated Facility, which promotes optical networking to support [[grid computing]].

== K12 High Speed Network ==
CalREN was expanded by funding through the state of California and its Digital California Project to include [[K-12]] public education. When funding sources changed, the K-12 portion became the K-12 High Speed Network (K12HSN), which is managed by the Imperial County Office of Education.

A '''crisis actor''' (aka '''actor-patient''' or '''actor victim''') is a trained [[actor]], role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during [[safety drill|emergency drills]] to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMT personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services organizations to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises.&lt;ref name="CrisisActors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Actors.

== Disaster training simulations ==
Actors take on the role of mock victims and simulate specific injuries from a disaster to add life-like realism to an emergency exercise. Theatrical [[makeup]] and cosmetics, plus rubber and latex appliances, are often used to simulate a variety of wounds or medical conditions that realistically portray victim's injuries, a practice known as [[Moulage|medical moulage]].&lt;ref name="Merica2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bobbie J Merica|title=Medical Moulage: How to Make Your Simulations Come Alive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR32|date=22 November 2011|publisher=F.A.

Actors who portray news reporters, relatives of victims, and concerned citizens are also used during drills to train [[emergency operations center]] personnel to cope with a variety of emotionally-charged demands and requests.&lt;ref name="Hiatt2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte J.

== Conspiracy theories and defamation ==
The term has been used by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] who claimed that some [[mass shootings]] and other disasters were staged, and victims and their families were being played by crisis actors. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist [[James Tracy (communication scholar)|James Tracy]] suggested that the government could have hired an [[Talent agent|acting agency]] named [[Visionbox]], which supplied crisis actors who were "trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places" to help stage the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]].

Tracy also promoted a crisis actor conspiracy theory of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pammy8/what-is-a-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theory-explanation-parkland-shooting-sandy-hook|title=Where the 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theory Comes From|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|date=22 February 2018|work=Motherboard|accessdate=22 February 2018|agency=[[Vice Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/22/17036018/parkland-conspiracy-theories|title=The Parkland conspiracy theories, explained Crisis actors?

Crisis actors are claimed in this context to play the part of bystanders or witnesses, emergency response personnel, and (with the aid of stage makeup) wounded victims of the attack.

Popularizers of the conspiracy theory include commentators such as [[Alex Jones]] and outlets such as ''True Pundit''.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/after-orlando-shooting-false-flag-and-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theories-surface.html|title=After Orlando Shooting, 'False Flag' and 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theories Surface|last1=Mele|first1=Christopher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/crisis-actors-deep-state-false-flag-the-rise-of-conspiracy-theory-code-words |title=Crisis actors, deep state, false flag: the rise of conspiracy theory code words|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/same-girl-crying-now-oregon/|title=Crisis Actors Uncovered?|publisher=Snopes |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Alex Jones for defamation "accusing him and his website [[InfoWars]] of engaging in a campaign of 'false, cruel, and dangerous assertions'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lawsuit-alexjones/sandy-hook-parents-sue-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-for-defamation-idUSKBN1HO2FU|title=Sandy Hook parents sue conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation|author=Editorial |publisher=Reuters |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural studies''' is a field of theoretically, politically, and empirically engaged cultural analysis that concentrates upon the political dynamics of contemporary culture, its historical foundations, defining traits, conflicts, and contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies researchers generally investigate how cultural practices relate to wider systems of [[power (social and political)|power]] associated with or operating through social phenomena, such as [[ideology]], [[class structure]]s, [[nationality|national formations]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], and generation.  Cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural studies" is not synonymous with either "[[area studies]]" or "[[ethnic studies]]," although there are many cultural studies practitioners working in both area studies and ethnic studies programs and professional associations (e.g. [[American studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies|Latina/o Studies]], [[European studies]], [[Latin American studies]], etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; The field of cultural studies encompasses a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. Although distinct from the discipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and the interdisciplinary field of [[ethnic studies]], cultural studies draws upon and has contributed to each of these fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultural-studies|title=cultural studies {{!}} interdisciplinary field|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural studies was initially developed by British academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world.  Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as antidisciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Pain, R. and Smith, S. eds., 2008. Fear: Critical geopolitics and everyday life. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cultural Studies as a field of research is not concerned with the linguistically uncategorized experiences of individuals, or, in a more radical approach, holds that individual experiences do not exist, being always the result of a particular social-political context.

Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches drawn including [[semiotics]], [[Marxism]], [[feminist theory]], [[ethnography]], [[critical race theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[social theory]], [[political theory]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film studies|film/video studies]], [[communication studies]], [[political economy]], [[translation studies]], [[museum studies]] and [[art history|art history/criticism]] to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. Important theories of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[Structure or agency|agency]] have both influenced and been developed by the cultural studies movement, as have many recent major communication theories and agendas, such as those that attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related to processes of [[globalization]].

During the rise of [[neo-liberalism]] in Britain and the US, cultural studies both became a global movement, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons.  Some left-wing critics associated particularly with Marxist forms of political economy also attacked cultural studies for allegedly overstating the importance of cultural phenomena.  While cultural studies continues to have its detractors, the field has become a kind of a worldwide movement that is to this day associated with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences, publications and students and practitioners from [[Taiwan]] to [[Amsterdam]] and from [[Bangalore]] to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, Michael (2009), [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-the-Matter-With/48334 "What's the Matter with Cultural Studies?"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultstud.org/index.php?s=resources "Cultural Studies Associations, Networks and Programs"], extensive, but incomplete, list of associations, networks and programs as found on the website for the Association of Cultural Studies, Tampere, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat distinct approaches to cultural studies have  emerged in different national and regional contexts such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Italy.

==Characteristics==
In his 1994 book, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'', [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lists the following five main characteristics of cultural studies:&lt;ref&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin and Van Loon, Borin (1994). ''Introducing Cultural Studies.'' New York: Totem Books&lt;/ref&gt;

*The aim of cultural studies is to examine cultural practices and their relation to [[power (sociology)|power]]. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working class youth in London).
*The objective of cultural studies includes understanding culture in all its complex forms and analyzing the social and political context in which culture manifests itself.
*Cultural studies is a site of both study/analysis and political criticism/action. (For example, not only would a cultural studies scholar study an object, but s/he would connect this study to a larger, progressive political project.)
*Cultural studies attempts to expose and reconcile constructed divisions of [[knowledge]] that purport to be grounded in nature.
*Cultural studies has a commitment to an ethical evaluation of modern [[society]] and to a [[Radicalization|radical]] line of political action.

==History==
As Dennis Dworkin writes,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Dennis. ''Cultural Marxism in Post-War Britain: History, the New Left, and the Origins of Cultural Studies'' (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1997), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; "a critical moment" in the beginning of cultural studies as a field was when [[Richard Hoggart]] used the term in 1964 in founding the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] (CCCS) at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK, which was to become home for the development of the intellectual orientation that has become known internationally as the "Birmingham School" of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;see also Corner, John (1991), "Postscript: Studying Culture—Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart." ''Media, Culture and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 2, April.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at the university thus became the world's first institutional home of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/about.aspx|title=About the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggart appointed [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] as his assistant, and Hall was effectively directing [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Davies, "British Cultural Marxism," ''International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society'' 4(3) (1991): 323-344, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall formally assumed the directorship of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in 1971, when Hoggart left Birmingham to become Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, An Idea and Its Servants: UNESCO from Within.  Newark, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the field of cultural studies became closely associated with Hall's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morley &amp; Chen (eds.)|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilroy, Grossberg and McRobbie (eds.)|title=Without Guarantees: In Honour of Stuart Hall|date=2000|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Hall left Birmingham to accept a prestigious chair in Sociology at the Open University in the UK, and Richard Johnson took over the directorship of the Centre.

In the late 1990s, "restructuring" at the [[University of Birmingham]] led to the elimination of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999.  Then, in 2002, the University of Birmingham's senior administration abruptly announced the disestablishment of CSS, provoking a substantial international outcry.  The immediate reason for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of 2001, though a dean from the university attributed the decision to "inexperienced ‘macho management.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RAE, a holdover initiative of the [[Margaret Thatcher]]-led UK government of 1986,  determines research funding for university programs.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Polly (2002), [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/socialsciences/story/0,,745058,00.html "Birmingham's cultural studies department given the chop"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous published accounts of the history of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Graeme|title=British Cultural Studies: An Introduction|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John|title=A Short History of Cultural Studies|date=2003|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Hall's directorship of CCCS at Birmingham===
Beginning in 1964, after the initial appearance of the founding works of British Cultural Studies in the late 1950s, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s pioneering work at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]], along with that of his colleagues and postgraduate students including [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, John Clarke, [[Richard Dyer]], Judith Williamson, Richard Johnson, Iain Chambers, Dorothy Hobson, Chris Weedon, Tony Jefferson, Michael Green and [[Angela McRobbie]], gave shape and substance to the field of cultural studies.  Many cultural studies scholars employed [[Marxist]] methods of analysis, exploring the relationships between cultural forms ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the superstructure]]) and that of the political economy ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the base]]).  By the 1970s, the work of [[Louis Althusser]] radically rethought the Marxist account of "base" and "superstructure" in ways that had a significant influence on the "Birmingham School."  Much of the work done at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] studied youth subcultural expressions of antagonism toward "respectable" middle-class British culture in the post-WWII period.  Also during the 70s, the politically formidable British working classes were in decline.  Britain's manufacturing industries were fading and union rolls were shrinking.  Yet millions of working class Britons backed the rise of [[Margaret Thatcher]].  For Stuart Hall and his colleagues, this shift in loyalty from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had to be explained in terms of cultural politics, which they had been tracking even before Thatcher's victory.  Some of this work was presented in the cultural studies classic, ''Policing the Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke &amp; Roberts|title=Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State, and Law and Order|date=1978|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other later texts such as Hall's ''The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left|date=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall &amp; Jacques (eds.)|title=New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s|date=1991|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To trace the development of British Cultural Studies, see, for example, the work of [[Richard Hoggart]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Paul Gilroy]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, [[Richard Dyer]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/john_storey_what_is_cultural_studies_a_readerbookzz-org.pdf|title=What is Cultural Studies?|last=Storey|first=John|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural studies in the late-1970s and beyond===
By the late 1970s, scholars associated with [[The Birmingham School]] had firmly placed questions of gender and race on the cultural studies agenda, where they have remained ever since.  Also by the late 1970s, cultural studies had begun to attract a great deal of international attention.  It spread globally throughout the 1980s and 90s.  As it did so, it both encountered new conditions of knowledge production, and engaged with other major international intellectual currents such as poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas &amp; Erni (eds.)|title=Internationalizing Cultural Studies: An Anthology|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide range of cultural studies journals now located throughout the world, as shown below, is one indication of the globalization of the field.

==Developments outside the UK==
In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when British Cultural Studies began to spread internationally in the late 1970s, and to engage with feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism and race in the late 70s and 1980s, critical cultural studies (i.e., Marxist, feminist, poststructuralist, etc.) expanded tremendously in US universities in fields such as communication studies, education, sociology and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|Nelson|Treichler|1992|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren &amp; Vavrus (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley &amp; Pearson (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cultural Studies (journal)|Cultural Studies]]'', the flagship journal of the field, has been based in the US since its founding editor, [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]], brought it there from Australia in 1987.

A thriving cultural studies scene has existed in [[Australia]] since the late 1970s, when several key CS practitioners emigrated there from the UK, taking British Cultural Studies with them, after [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.  A school of cultural studies known as "cultural policy studies" is one of the distinctive Australian contributions to the field, though it is not the only one.  Australia also gave birth to the world's first professional cultural studies association (now known as the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frow &amp; Morris (eds.)|title=Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner (ed.)|first1=Graeme|title=Nation, Culture, Text: Australian Cultural and Media Studies|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Australia include ''[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', ''[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]]'' and ''Cultural Studies Review''.

In [[Canada]], cultural studies has sometimes focused on issues of [[technology and society]], continuing the emphasis in the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], and others.  Cultural studies journals based in Canada include ''Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies''.

In Africa, [[human rights]] and [[Third World]] issues are among the central topics treated.  Cultural Studies journals based in Africa include the ''[[Journal of African Cultural Studies]]''.

In [[Latin America]], cultural studies has drawn on thinkers such as [[José Martí]], [[Ángel Rama]] and other Latin American figures, in addition to the Western theoretical sources associated with cultural studies in other parts of the world.  Leading Latin American cultural studies scholars include [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Jésus Martín-Barbero]], and [[Beatriz Sarlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarto, Ríos &amp; Trigo (eds.)|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin &amp; Szurmuck (eds.)|title=Dictionary of Latin American Cultural Studies|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the key issues addressed by Latin American cultural studies scholars are [[decoloniality]], [[urban culture]]s, and [[postdevelopment theory]].  Latin American cultural studies journals include the ''Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies''.

Even though cultural studies developed much more rapidly in the UK than in continental Europe, there is a significant cultural studies presence in countries such as France, Spain and Portugal.  The field is relatively undeveloped in Germany, probably due to the continued influence of the [[Frankfurt School]], which is now often said to be in its third generation, which includes notable figures such as [[Axel Honneth]].  Cultural studies journals based in continental Europe include the ''[[European Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', the ''Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies'', ''[[French Cultural Studies]]'', and ''Portuguese Cultural Studies''.

In Germany, the term ''cultural studies'' specifically refers to the field in the Anglo-sphere especially British Cultural Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GEkqO--HndgC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=cultural+studies+in+deutschen+Kontext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGHZhanE3M&amp;sig=QHeWMp6GMLv_WNbX3evkxYhTGcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2756p493QAhUGtRQKHRQSDxgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20studies%20in%20deutschen%20Kontext&amp;f=false|title=Normativität: Über die Hintergründe sozialwissenschaftlicher Theoriebildung|last=Ahrens|first=Johannes|last2=Beer|first2=Raphael|last3=Bittlingmayer|first3=Uwe H.|last4=Gerdes|first4=Jürgen|date=2011-02-10|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9783531930107|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from the German [[:de:Kulturwissenschaft|Kulturwissenschaft]] which developed along different lines and is characterized by its distance from political science. However, Kulturwissenschaft and cultural studies are often used interchangeably, particularly by lay persons.

Throughout Asia, cultural studies has boomed and thrived since at least the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen &amp; Huat (eds.)|title=The Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Reader|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Asia include ''[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]''. In India the Centre for Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore and the Department of Cultural Studies at The English and Foreign Languages University Hyderabad at two major institutional spaces for Cultural Studies.

==Issues, concepts and approaches==

===Marxism, feminism, race and culture===
As noted above, Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies. Those associated with [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] initially engaged deeply with the [[structuralism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and later in the 1970s turned decisively toward [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in the late 1970s and early 80s, including ''Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination'' (1978), and ''The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain'' (1982).

===Gramsci and hegemony===
To understand the changing political circumstances of class, politics and culture in the United Kingdom, scholars at [[The Birmingham School]] turned to the work of [[Antonio Gramsci]], an Italian thinker, writer and communist party leader of the 1910s, 20s and '30s.  Gramsci had been concerned with similar issues: why would Italian laborers and peasants vote for fascists?  What strategic approach is necessary to mobilize popular support in more progressive directions?  Gramsci modified [[classical Marxism]], and argued that culture must be understood as a key site of political and social struggle.  In his view, capitalists used not only brute force (police, prisons, repression, military) to maintain control, but also penetrated the everyday culture of working people in a variety of ways in their efforts to win popular "consent."  It is important to recognize that for Gramsci, historical leadership, or "hegemony," involves the formation of alliances between class factions, and struggles within the cultural realm of everyday common sense.  Hegemony was always, for Gramsci, an interminable, unstable and contested process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|author-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|title=Gramsci's Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|date=June 1986|volume=10|issue=2 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/019685998601000202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lash]] writes:
{{quote|text=In the work of Hall, Hebdige and McRobbie, popular culture came to the fore... What Gramsci gave to this was the importance of consent and culture.  If the fundamental Marxists saw power in terms of class-versus-class, then Gramsci gave to us a question of ''class alliance''. The rise of cultural studies itself was based on the decline of the prominence of fundamental class-versus-class politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lash|2007|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Edgar and Sedgwick write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of [[hegemony]] was of central importance to the development of British cultural studies [particularly [[The Birmingham School]]. It facilitated analysis of the ways subordinate groups actively resist and respond to political and economic domination.  The subordinate groups needed not to be seen merely as the passive dupes of the dominant class and its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar &amp; Sedgewick, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structure and agency===
The development of hegemony theory in cultural studies was in some ways consonant with work in other fields exploring [[Structure and agency|agency]], a theoretical concept that insists on the active, critical capacities of subordinated peoples (e.g. the working classes, colonized peoples, women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration|date=1984|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Stuart Hall famously argued in his 1981 essay, "Notes on Deconstructing 'the Popular'," "ordinary people are not cultural dopes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guins &amp; Cruz (eds.)|title=Popular Culture: A Reader|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insistence on accounting for the agency of subordinated peoples runs counter to the work of traditional structuralists.  Some analysts have however been critical of some work in cultural studies that they feel overstates the significance of or even romanticizes some forms of popular cultural agency.

Cultural studies often concerns itself with agency at the level of the practices of everyday life, and approaches such research from a standpoint of radical contextualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=Cultural Studies in the Future Tense|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural studies rejects universal accounts of cultural practices,  meanings, and identities.

Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the move from a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure. It has marked a shift from a form of [[Althusser]]ian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Further Reflections on Conversations of Our Time|journal=Diacritics|date=1997|volume=27|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globalization===
In recent decades, as capitalist culture has spread throughout the world via contemporary forms of [[globalization]], cultural studies has generated important analyses of local sites and practices of negotiation with and resistance to Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consumption===
Cultural Studies criticizes the traditional view of the passive consumer, particularly by underlining the different ways people ''read,'' receive and interpret cultural texts, or appropriate other kinds of cultural products, or otherwise participate in the production and circulation of meanings. On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts. In some of its variants, then, cultural studies has thus shifted the analytical focus from (traditional understandings of) production to consumption, which is nevertheless understood as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], and others have been influential in these developments.

A special 2008 issue of the field's flagship journal, ''Cultural Studies'', examined "Anti-Consumerism" from a variety of cultural studies angles.  As Jeremy Gilbert noted in his contribution to this issue, cultural studies must grapple with the fact that “we now live in an era when, throughout the capitalist world, the overriding aim of government economic policy is to maintain consumer spending levels. This is an era when ‘consumer confidence’ is treated as the key indicator and cause of economic effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Jeremy|title=Against the Commodification of Everything|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2008|volume=22|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of "text"===
Cultural studies, drawing upon and developing [[semiotics]], uses the concept of ''[[wikt:text|text]]'' to designate not only written language, but also [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[photography|photograph]]s, [[fashion]], [[hairstyle]]s, and so forth; the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. This conception of textuality derives especially from the work of the pioneering and influential semiotician, [[Roland Barthes]], but also owes debts to other sources, such as [[Juri Lotman]] and his colleagues from [[Tartu–Moscow School]]. Similarly, the field widens the concept of "culture." "Culture," for a cultural studies researcher, includes not only  traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail 1981. ''The Dialogic Imagination.'' Austin, TX: UT Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but also everyday meanings and practices, which have, as noted above, become a central focus of cultural studies.  Cultural studies even approaches sites and spaces of everyday life, such as pubs, living rooms, gardens and beaches, as "texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiske, Hodge and Turner|title=Myths of Oz: Reading Australian Popular Culture|date=1987|publisher=Boston|location=Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] summarized much of the work on textuality and textual analysis in his cultural studies textbook and a post-9/11 monograph on media and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis (2008) Cultural Studies, Sage, London; Jeff Lewis, (2005) Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence, Pluto, London.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lewis, 'textual studies' use complex and difficult heuristic methods and require both powerful interpretive skills and a subtle conception of politics and contexts. The task of the cultural analyst, for Lewis, is to engage with both knowledge systems and texts, and observe and analyse the ways the two interact with one another.  This engagement represents the critical dimensions of the analysis, its capacity to illuminate the hierarchies within and surrounding the given text and its discourses.

==Academic reception==
Cultural studies has evolved through the confluence of various disciplines—anthropology, media and communication studies, literary studies, education, geography, philosophy, sociology, politics and others. While some have accused certain areas of cultural studies of meandering into political relativism and a kind of empty version of "postmodern" analysis, others hold that at its core, cultural studies provides a significant conceptual and methodological framework for cultural, social and economic critique.  This critique is designed to "deconstruct" the meanings and assumptions that are inscribed in the institutions, texts and practices that work with and through, and produce and re-present, culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Thus, while some scholars and disciplines like to dismiss cultural studies for its methodological openness and rejection of disciplinarity, its core strategies of critique and analysis have had a profound influence throughout the more progressive and critical areas of the social sciences and humanities. Cultural studies work on forms of social differentiation, control and inequality, identity, community-building, media, and knowledge production, for example, has had a substantial impact. Moreover, the influence of cultural studies has become increasingly evident in areas as diverse as [[translation studies]], health studies, international relations, development studies, computer studies, economics, archaeology, and neurobiology, as well as across the range of disciplines that initially shaped the emergence of cultural studies, including literature, sociology, communication studies, and anthropology.

Cultural studies has also diversified its own interests and methodologies, incorporating a range of studies on media policy, democracy, design, leisure, tourism, warfare and development. While certain key concepts such as ideology or discourse, class, hegemony, identity and gender remain significant, cultural studies has long engaged with and integrated new concepts and approaches such as deconstruction and postmodernism. The field thus continues to pursue political critique through its engagements with the forces of culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|During|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

The Blackwell ''Companion to Cultural Studies'', edited by leading cultural studies scholar Toby Miller, contains essays that analyze the development of cultural studies approaches within each of a wide range of disciplines across the contemporary social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2006|p=index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary scholars===
Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or Comparative Literature.  Nevertheless, some traditional literary scholars such as Yale professor [[Harold Bloom]] have been outspoken critics of cultural studies. On the level of methodology, these scholars dispute the theoretical underpinning of the movement's critical framework.

Bloom stated his position during the September 3, 2000 episode of [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Booknotes]]'', while discussing his book ''How to Read and Why'':

{{quote|text=[T]here are two enemies of reading now in the world, not just in the English-speaking world. One [is] the lunatic destruction of literary studies...and its replacement by what is called cultural studies in all of the universities and colleges in the English-speaking world, and everyone knows what that phenomenon is. I mean, the...now-weary phrase 'political correctness' remains a perfectly good descriptive phrase for what has gone on and is, alas, still going on almost everywhere and which dominates, I would say, rather more than three-fifths of the tenured faculties in the English-speaking world, who really do represent a treason of the intellectuals, I think, a 'betrayal of the clerks'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Why|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?157968-1/read|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=April 19, 2017|date=September 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] is not wholly opposed to cultural studies, but has criticised aspects of it and highlighted what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses in books such as ''After Theory'' (2003). For Eagleton, literary and cultural theory have the potential to say important things about the "fundamental questions" in life, but theorists have rarely realized this potential.

===Sociologists===
Cultural studies has also had a substantial impact on sociology.  For example, when Stuart Hall left [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain.  The subfield of cultural sociology, in particular, is disciplinary home to many cultural studies practitioners.  Nevertheless, there are some differences between sociology as a discipline and the field of cultural studies as a whole.  While sociology was founded upon various historic works purposefully distinguishing the subject from [[philosophy]] or [[psychology]], cultural studies has explicitly interrogated and criticized traditional understandings and practices of disciplinarity.  Most CS practitioners think it is best that cultural studies neither emulate disciplines nor aspire to disciplinarity for cultural studies. Rather, they promote a kind of radical interdisciplinarity as the basis for cultural studies.

One sociologist whose work has had a major influence upon cultural studies is [[Pierre Bourdieu]].  Bourdieu's work makes innovative use of statistics and in-depth interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harker, Cheleen Mahar, Chris Wilkes (eds), ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: The Theory of Practice''. Houndmills: Macmillan, 1990, pp. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourdieu|first1=Pierre|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Bourdieu's work has been highly influential within cultural studies, and although Bourdieu regarded his work as a form of science, cultural studies has never embraced the idea that it should aspire toward "scientificity," and has marshalled a wide range of theoretical and methodological arguments against the fetishization of "scientificity" as a basis for cultural studies.

Two sociologists who have been critical of cultural studies, [[Chris Rojek]] and [[Bryan S. Turner]], argue in their article, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn", that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus. Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies has always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity.  Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above.  Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is "a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated" in cultural studies&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." ''The Sociological Review'' 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicist Alan Sokal===
{{Main article|Sokal affair}}
In 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] expressed his opposition to cultural studies by [[Sokal affair|submitting a hoax article]] to a cultural studies journal, ''[[Social Text]]''. The article, which was crafted as a parody of what Sokal referred to as the "fashionable nonsense" of [[postmodernism]], was accepted by the editors of the journal, which did not at the time practice peer review. When the paper appeared in print, Sokal published a second article in a self-described "academic gossip" magazine, ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', revealing his hoax on ''[[Social Text]]''. Sokal stated that his motivation stemmed from his rejection of contemporary critiques of scientific rationalism:

{{quote|text="Politically, I'm angered because most (though not all) of this silliness is emanating from the self-proclaimed Left. We're witnessing here a profound historical ''volte-face''. For most of the past two centuries, the Left has been identified with science and against obscurantism; we have believed that rational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful -- not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. The recent turn of many "progressive" or "leftist" academic humanists and social scientists toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique. Theorizing about "the social construction of reality" won't help us find an effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming. Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies"], [[Alan Sokal]], English translation of article from ''Lingua Franca'', 1996. Physics.nyu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Founding works==
Hall and others have identified some core originating texts, or the original "curriculum", of the field of cultural studies:
* [[Richard Hoggart]]'s ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]''
* [[Raymond Williams]]' ''[[Culture and Society]]'' and ''[[The Long Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[E. P. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''.

'''Documentary research''' is the use of outside sources, [[documents]], to support the viewpoint or argument of an [[academic]] work. The process of documentary research often involves some or all of conceptualising, using and assessing documents. The analysis of the documents in documentary research would be either quantitative or qualitative analysis (or both).&lt;ref&gt;Balihar, Sanghera, Qualitative research methods: documentary research. From the internet, October 1st, 2007 http://uk.geocities.com/balihar_sanghera/qrmdocumentaryresearch.html  [https://web.archive.org/web/20071113125309/http://uk.geocities.com/balihar_sanghera/qrmdocumentaryresearch.html Wayback Machine Nov 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The key issues surrounding types of documents and our ability to use them as reliable sources of evidence on the social world must be considered by all who use documents in their research.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J. 2006, "Documentary Research" London, Sage Publications Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-0817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">'''Eclectic approach''' is a method of [[language education]] that combines various approaches and methodologies to teach language depending on the aims of the lesson and the abilities of the learners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/eclectic-approach https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Different teaching methods are borrowed and adapted to suit the requirement of the learners. It breaks the monotony of the class.
In addition, It is a conceptual approach that does not merely include one paradigm or a set of assumptions. Instead, eclecticism adheres to or is constituted from several theories, styles, and ideas in order to gain a thorough insight about the subject, and draws upon different theories in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Eclecticism in Drama|date=2016|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eclecticism-Drama-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1522899103/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469894779&amp;sr=1-2}} 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511156 &amp; 10.5281/zenodo.59378.svg&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Eclecticism’ is common in many fields of study such as psychology, martial arts, philosophy,teaching,religion and drama &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Eclecticism In Drama|date=2016|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eclecticism-Drama-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1522899103/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469894779&amp;sr=1-2}} 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511156 &amp; 10.5281/zenodo.59378.svg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches Methods ==

There are varied approaches and methods used for language teaching. In eclectic approach, the teacher can choose from these different methods and approaches:
* '''[[Grammar-translation method|Grammar-translation Method]]:''' It is a method of teaching languages by which students learn grammatical rules and then apply those rules by translating between the target language and the native language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/theteachersetofinstruments/methods-and-approaches-in-elt/grammar-translation-method https://theteachersetofinstruments]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Direct method (education)|Direct Method]]:''' In this method the teacher refrains from using the students' native language. The target language is directly used for teaching all the four skills—listening, speaking, reading and writing.
* '''Structural-situational Approach:''' In this approach, the teacher teaches language through a careful selection, gradation and presentation of vocabulary items and structures through situation based activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aslam|first1=Mohammad|title=Teaching of English|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9788175965911|page=61|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Audio-lingual method|Audio-lingual/Audio-visual Method]]:''' In this style of teaching students are taught through a system of reinforcement. Here new words and grammar are directly taught without using the students' native language. However, unlike [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], [[audio-lingual method]] does not focus on vocabulary. Instead, the teacher focuses on grammar through drill and practice.
* '''[[Bilingual method|Bilingual Method]]:''' The word 'bilingual' means the ability to speak two languages fluently. In bilingual method, the teacher teaches the language by giving mother tongue equivalents of the words or sentences. This method was developed by C.J. Dodson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dash|first1=Neena|last2=Dash|first2=M|title=Teaching English As An Additional Language|date=2007|publisher=Atlantic|isbn=9788126907793|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Communicative language teaching |Communicative Language Teaching]]:''' This approach lays emphasis on oral method of teaching. It aims to develop communicative competence in students.
* '''Total-Physical Response:''' It is based on the theory that memory is enhanced through association with physical response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onestopenglish.com/support/methodology/teaching-approaches/teaching-approaches-total-physical-response/146503.article http://www.onestopenglish.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Silent Way:''' In this method the teacher uses a combination of silence and gestures to focus students' attention. It was developed by [[Caleb Gattegno]].

==Advantages==
* The teacher has more flexibility.
* No aspect of language skill is ignored.
* There is variety in the classroom.
* Classroom atmosphere is dynamic.
*These types of programs not only negotiate teacher skill-development within an improved recognition of and respect for cross-cultural and multi-linguistic classroom settings, but also encourages student pride in their heritage, language, communication preferences and self-identity &lt;ref&gt;Crandall, J. (2003). They do speak English: World Englishes in the U.S. schools. Eric Clearing House on Languages and Linguistics, 26(3). &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7747">'''Enrique Leff''' (born [[Mexico]], 1946) is a Mexican economist, who defines himself today as an [[environmental sociologist]] and [[environmentalist]]. He has written 25 books and 180 articles on [[political ecology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[environmental economics]], [[environmental epistemology]] and [[environmental education]]. He is regarded as one of the key environmental thinkers in Latin America.

==Background==
After a degree in chemical engineering from UNAM ([[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]) in 1968. Leff graduated with a Doctorat de Troisième Cycle in development economics from the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]], Paris, in 1975.

Leff lectured at [[UNAM]] (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) full-time from 1973-1986 before becoming coordinator of the Environmental Training Network for Latin America and the Caribbean (1986-2008) and coordinator of the Mexico City office of the Regional Office of Latin America and the Caribbean of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (2007-2008).

In 2008 he returned full-time as professor of political ecology and environmental politics at UNAM. He is also senior researcher at the Institute of Social Research (Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales) at the same university.

Leff works in Spanish, Portuguese, English and French. In addition to academic work he is an accomplished opera, Lieder and bolero singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablemusic.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/sustainability-unbound-5-political.html|title=Sustainable Music: Sustainability Unbound (5): Political Ecology|first=Jeff Todd|last=Titon|date=23 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a Masters in Voice from the Manhattan School of Music (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musica.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=522:recital-de-enrique-leff-y-tonatiuh-de-la-sierra-en-el-ciclo-de-ma-de-cra&amp;Itemid=180|title=INICIO|first=DAR -|last=LabCitrico|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Leff works in the academic fields of epistemology, environmental economics, environmental sociology, [[political ecology]], and [[environmental education]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cep.unt.edu/papers/leff-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for arguing that environmental problems result from a crisis of Western civilization's ways of knowing, understanding and transforming the world (Eschenhagen 2012). This masks other legitimate ways of thinking and acting in the world, namely forms of 'eco-development' and environmental rationality. His work is largely theoretical but his major books cite positive examples of the [[ethnobotanic]] practices of [[Pre-Columbian era|Prehispanic cultures]] in Latin America, sustainable agricultural practices in tropical ecosystems, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxCGZhGUEbk TED talk, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feeling Yes, Feeling No''''' (French: '''''Mon corps, c'est mon corps''''')&lt;ref&gt;Lerner (1997), p. 1527.&lt;/ref&gt; is a film series produced and distributed by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] to teach children between the ages of six and twelve to avoid being [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] by people they trust, family members, and strangers.&lt;ref&gt;McCalpin &amp; Hunter (1988), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The films consist of recordings of a play that began development in 1980 in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia by [[Green Thumb Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;De Chesnay (2005), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Foon]], Wendy Van Reisen, and Fran Gebhard finished writing the play in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Selman &amp; Heather (2015), p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially performed in workshops with children, the play was very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg &amp; Solorzano (2014), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The filmed version of the play consists of four films directed by Moira Simpson and released in 1984 along with accompanying [[printed matter]] intended to be used together as a sexual assault prevention program.&lt;ref&gt;Evans (1991), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is six hours long and explains the difference between good and bad [[physical intimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1997), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The series uses the terms 'yes' feelings and 'no' feelings and focuses on [[role-playing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedard-Bidwell (2001), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was first implemented in primary schools in British Columbia and later spread to other Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall (1993), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1991 study, 286 children in grades three and four went through the program and another 113 children were used as a [[Treatment and control groups|control group]]. The study found that the children who went through the program had greater knowledge about sexual assault than the control children, and that the children who went through the program were slightly better than the control children at distinguishing between safe and unsafe situations.&lt;ref&gt;Wurtele &amp; Miller-Perrin (1993), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school provides education to [[Educational stages|grades]] [[ninth grade|9]]-[[twelfth grade|12]]. 

Forrest County AHS is one of two independently functioning agricultural high schools in the state of Mississippi.&lt;!--There were three in 2010, but now one has closed--&gt; 

An independent school board operates FCAHS, which has its own farm and ranch.&lt;ref name=Boardrec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2012/12/state_education_board_recommen.html|title=State education board recommends closing one agriculture school, converting one and keeping one|publisher=[[Associated Press]] at [[gulflive.com]]|date=2012-12-20|accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affiliated with the school are known as "Aggies."

==History==
Its academic performance, as of 2012, was at the Mississippi average. In a seven-year period from 2005 to 2012 the enrollment increased.A 2012 report by [[Augenblick, Palaich and Associates]] suggested that FCAHS should continue operation as is.&lt;ref name=Boardrec/&gt;

In 2006, the Aggies went undefeated in the regular season, losing to Terry in the third round, and completing the season with a 12–1 record. Among the final eight teams remaining in those 2006 4A state playoffs, F.C.A.H.S. is the only school to maintain its 4-A classification upon Mississippi's shift to a 6-A class system. The other seven teams now hold a 5-A or 6-A classification. As of 2012, the Aggies produced their first "straight from high school" Division 1-A prospect in Adarius Perkins, who signed with Mississippi State University in February of that year. In the 2013 season, the Aggies reached the South State Championship for the first time, defeating Quitman at home. Following South State, the Aggies overcame the Lafayette Commodores to become the 2013 4-A State Champions. Shortly after the season ended, Forrest County had three signees on February 5th. The most notable among these signees was Dontavian Lee, who signed a scholarship to play Running Back at Mississippi State University.

'''''Hysteria Hospital: Emergency Ward''''' is a [[casual game|casual video game]] published by [[O-Games]] on June 16, 2009 in North America. The game is a simulation/strategy that bears a striking resemblance to the popular [[Diner Dash]] franchise.

==Gameplay==
Hysteria Hospital tasks users with coordinating the management of a hospital. The goal of the game is to accumulate money over time by serving patients. Users can purchase new equipment such as X-Ray machines to meet the demands of their patients. Main gameplay elements involve diagnosing patients, and moving them to the applicable local facilities if available (or the ambulance to get sent elsewhere). Patients are moved by dragging them to different areas. A nurse is controllable by clicking on objects, and performs chores such as fetching prescriptions, making beds and cleaning waste.

== Influence ==

Khan Lab School allows educators, administrators, and [[educational technology]] leaders to tour the school and participate in conversations about the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educator Inquiries|url=https://khanlabschool.org/contact/educator-inquiries|website=Khan Lab School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford Day Academy, a [[charter school]] in [[East Palo Alto, California]], has publicly credited Khan Lab School with being the inspiration for key components of its model. Oxford Day Academy founder Mallory Dwinal conducted pilot work with students at Khan Lab School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Palo Alto: Oxford Day School to employ new model for education|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/06/east-palo-alto-oxford-day-school-to-employ-new-model-for-education|website=The Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charla Harris, founder of Learning by Design Charter School in [[Los Angeles]], has purportedly stated that she will use the Khan Lab School learning space as a model for how she will design the learning space of her elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the Right School So Hard To Find?|url=http://speakupparents.org/blog/2016/10/4/why-is-the-right-school-so-hard-to-find|website=Speak Up Parents}}&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting Khan Lab School in 2016, she stated that her school would offer personalized and project-based learning because “there’s not only an achievement gap, but also an innovation gap.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Want Better Education Tools?

At the [[Arizona State University]] Global Silicon Valley Summit in May 2017, Colleen Broderick of [[startup company]] [[AltSchool]] drew comparisons between AltSchool and Khan Lab School, referencing the changing role of the educator and the absence of grades and grade bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU GSV Summit: Thinking Outside the Box: New K12 Learning Models|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD5Cr1krqsU|website=YouTube|publisher=Global Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning Environment ==

In 2017, Khan Lab School worked with architect Danish Kurani to design and build a high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.educationdive.com/news/the-school-that-khan-built/510819/|title=The school that Khan built|work=Education Dive|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of traditional classrooms, the school has architecturally diverse spaces where faculty test different approaches to learning. Physical and digital displays enable faculty to share their educational experiments with colleagues and visiting educators. A wide range of tools and settings allows students to work according to their preference and learning style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/khan-lab-school-tour-inside-sal-khans-newest-school-2017-10#kuranis-founder-danish-kurani-told-business-insider-that-khan-lab-school-is-meant-to-combine-experimentation-and-education-in-a-joint-school-and-laboratory-1|title=The founder of Khan Academy built the ultimate school for kids to work and play together — take a look inside|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leo Funtek''' (August 21, 1885 — January 13, 1965) was a Slovenian [[violin]]ist, [[conducting|conductor]] and arranger. He is best known for work as a music professor and for his 1922 arrangement of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s piano suite ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''.

Funtek was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name=Hillila&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the music and musicians of Finland |last=Hillila |first=Ruth-Esther |author2=Barbara Blanchard Hong  |year=1997|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn= 978-0-313-27728-3|oclc=36407803|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUQDFlj1ykkC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory (now the [[Felix Mendelssohn College of Music and Theatre]]) and [[Leipzig University]].&lt;ref name=Hillila/&gt;

Funtek spent most of his working life in [[Finland]], where he was conductor of the [[Finnish Opera]].&lt;ref name=Russ&gt;{{cite book |title=Musorgsky, Pictures at an exhibition |last=Russ |first=Michael |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-38607-4 |oclc=24379604 |page=77  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Co0gxvU3D8C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was concertmaster with the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] from 1906 to 1909, and then was orchestra director of the [[Viipuri Province|Viipuri]] orchestra from 1909 to 1910.&lt;ref name=Hillila/&gt;  His most prominent role as a practicing musician was as conductor of the [[Finnish Opera]] from 1915 to 1959.&lt;ref name=Hillila/&gt;  He also served as assistant concertmaster for the [[Stockholm]] court orchestra from 1916 to 1919.&lt;ref name=Hillila/&gt;

In addition to his work as a practicing musician, Funtek was an academician. His first such post was from 1911 to 1939, at the Helsinki Institute of Music (now the [[Sibelius Academy]]), where he taught violin, ensemble and orchestration.&lt;ref name=Hillila/&gt;  He later taught at the [[Sibelius Academy]] in [[Helsinki]], where he was a professor of violin at from 1939 to 1955,&lt;ref name=Hillila/&gt;  and where he also taught the conducting class from 1950 to 1955.&lt;ref name=FMQ&gt;Anu Konttinen.

As an arranger, Funtek is best known for his orchestral arrangement of ''Pictures at an Exhibition'', which he published in July 1922, just months before an orchestration by the French composer [[Maurice Ravel]], of whose project Funtek was seemingly unaware.&lt;ref name=Russ/&gt;  Ravel's orchestration premiered in October 1922,&lt;ref name=Russ/&gt; and is now by far the most-performed of the several orchestrations of the suite.

{{italic title}}
'''''Literae humaniores''''', nicknamed '''greats''', is an [[undergraduate]] course focused on [[classics]] (Ancient Rome, Ancient Greece, Latin, ancient Greek, and philosophy) at the [[University of Oxford]] and some other universities. The Latin name means literally "more human literature" and was in contrast to the other main field of study when the university began, i.e. ''res divinae'', also known as theology. Lit. hum. is concerned with human learning, and lit. div. with learning that came from God. In its early days, it encompassed mathematics and natural sciences as well. It is an archetypal [[humanities]] course.

==''Lit. hum.'' at Oxford==
The [[University of Oxford]]'s classics course, also known as ''greats'', is divided into two parts, lasting five terms and seven terms respectively, the whole lasting four years in total, which is one year more than most arts degrees at Oxford and other English universities.

The course of studies leads to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on first hand study of primary sources in the original Greek or Latin.

In the first part (''[[honour moderations]]'' or ''mods'') students concentrate on [[Latin]] and/or [[Greek language]]; in the second part students choose eight papers from the disciplines of [[classical literature]], [[History of Greece|Greek]] and [[History of Rome|Roman history]], [[Philosophy]], [[Archaeology]], and [[Linguistics]].  The teaching style is very traditional and consists of weekly [[tutorial]]s in each of the two main subjects chosen, supplemented by a wide variety of [[lecture]]s. The main teaching mechanism remains the weekly essay, one on each of the two main chosen subjects, typically written to be read out at a one-to-one [[tutorial]]; this affords all students plenty of practice at writing short, clear, and well-researched papers.

Changed in the late 20th century, a strong emphasis remains on study of original texts in Latin and Greek, assessed by ''prepared translation'' and by ''gobbet'' (a short commentary on an assigned primary source).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Standen |first1=Naomi |title=HIS 1023 Encounters: What is a gobbet? |url=http://www.artsweb.bham.ac.uk/NStanden/encounters/gobbetshints.htm |website=www.artsweb.bham.ac.uk |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical "text" paper candidates will be expected first to translate into English three or four long passages selected by the examiners from the set books; and secondly to comment on each of an extended set of short paragraphs or sentences from the same set texts; marks are awarded for recognising the context and the significance of each excerpt.

===Mods===

The mods (moderations – exams conducted by moderators) course runs for the first five terms of the course.  The traditional aim was for students to develop their ability to read fluently in Latin (especially the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]]) and Greek (concentrating on the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''); this remains the case today, but the course has changed to reflect the continuing decline in the numbers of applicants who have had the opportunity to study Greek and Latin at school.

Since the early 1970s, it has been possible to begin learning Greek during the preparation for mods (an option originally called mods-B, the brainchild of [[John G. Griffiths]] of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus]]). More recently, due to the omission of Latin and Greek from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] since 1988, options have been added for those without Latin either.

There are now five alternative paths through mods.

* Students with both Latin and Greek at [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] or equivalent take the traditional route, Mods IA.
* Those with one such language do mods IB (Latin plus beginners' Greek) or mods IC (Greek plus beginners' Latin).
* Students with a strong aptitude for languages who have not learned Latin or Greek can take either mods IIA (beginners' Latin only) or mods IIB (beginners' Greek only).

Language tuition is now organized centrally within the university by the Faculty of Classics; this leaves the [[Oxford colleges|colleges]] free to concentrate on teaching classical literature/rhetoric, history and philosophy.

The mods examination has a reputation as something of an ordeal: it evolved in the 21st century from 11 or 12 three-hour papers across seven consecutive days into 10 or 11 three-hour papers across seven or eight days. Candidates for classical mods thus still face a much larger number of exams than undergraduates reading for most other degrees at Oxford sit for their mods, prelims or even, in many cases, finals.

Students who successfully pass mods may then go on to study the full greats course in their remaining seven terms. Those choosing the 'Course II' version are expected to read as many of their finals texts in the original of their chosen language as those on Course I; there is, moreover, the option of studying the second classical language as two papers at finals.

===Greats===
The traditional greats course consisted of detailed study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] history and [[philosophy]], contrasting ancient philosophers ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with modern philosophers.  In 1968 an elective '[[Latin literature|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] Literature' was added; students chose two of the three.

Since then, various combined courses have also been developed including:
*Classics and modern languages;
*Ancient and modern history; and
*Classical archaeology and ancient history.

In 2004 the full ''lit. hum.'' course was revised; students examined since 2008 now choose eight papers from a wide range of subject areas:

* Ancient history — "period" papers ranging from the [[Greek Dark Ages|pre-history of Greece]] to the first [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian emperors]] in Rome; or "topic" papers, on such subjects as [[History of human sexuality|Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World]] or [[Athenian democracy]].
* Philosophy — from Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] and Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] to more modern philosophers, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Wittgenstein]]
* Ancient literature — including "core" papers on mainstream Greek and Latin texts, plus various individual authors and other topics
* Philology (classical linguistics) — including such papers as 'Greek from [[Linear B]] to the [[Koine]]', '[[Oscan language|Oscan &amp; Umbrian]]' and '[[General Linguistics]] and [[Comparative linguistics|Comparative Philology]]'
* Classical [[Ancient art|art]] and [[archaeology]] from [[Red-figure pottery|vases]] to [[Parthenon|buildings]]
* Second classical language — for those who only offered one language at mods
* Optional special thesis as a ninth paper; theses can be offered within each of the first five options

The regulations governing the combinations of papers are moderately simple: students must take at least four papers based on the study of ancient texts in the original Latin or Greek; otherwise they can choose what they want, provided only that if they offer literature papers, they must offer the appropriate "core" papers too, and if they choose to offer "period" papers in history then they must offer one of the approved combinations.

In the past it was compulsory also to offer papers in unprepared translation from Latin and Greek into English; these papers counted "below the line"&amp;nbsp;— candidates were required to pass them, but they did not otherwise affect the overall class of the degree. This requirement has now been dropped, and it is possible to pass greats without offering any unprepared translation papers. The formerly optional prose and verse composition papers (English into Latin and Greek) have been removed from the greats syllabus entirely.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

She also operated her own dance company, the '''Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers''', and in 1980 staged her version of "Soaring," for [[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens]] in Montreal. [[Marion Rice Denishawn]] performed at the [[Jacob's Pillow]] Dance Festival in 1972, the Marymount Manhattan Theater (New York) in 1976 and City College (New York) in 1986 at the "Roots: Foundations of American Modern Dance Festival".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

Marion Rice Denishawn or Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers is a dance company devoted to preserving [[Denishawn]] dance, the choreography of modern dance pioneers [[Ruth St. Denis]] and [[Ted Shawn]], taught and staged by Marion Rice. Marion Rice dedicated her creative life to teaching, preserving, protecting and performing the fifty or so dance works taught to her by Ruth St. Denis, Ted Shawn, Miriam Winslow and other modern dance luminaries while she was a student and performer at the Boston Braggiotti School in [[Boston]] in the early 1900s.  Along with members of her family, daughter [[Carolyn Brown (choreographer)|Carolyn Brown]], daughter-in-law Mona Irvine Rice, granddaughters Robin Rice and [[Rebecca Rice (choreographer)|Rebecca Rice]], these Denishawn dances have been performed by Marion Rice and her students for over 75 years.

Marion Rice Denishawn performed in Fitchburg, Massachusetts as well as at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1972, the Marymount Manhattan Theater (New York) in 1976 and City College (New York) in 1986 at the 'Roots: Foundations of American Modern Dance Festival'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |first=Anna |last=Kisselgoff|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5D81F3DF932A15753C1A960948260 |title=Dance: Roots Of A Modern American Art Form |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=  October 21, 1986|accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ''Marion Rice Denishawn'' performed at the "Dance in Millennium" Festival in Washington.  The company presented  "Boston Braggiotti and Denishawn", a lecture demonstration illuminating a select number of the early [[Denishawn]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_n12_v69/ai_17770816 |title=CBSi |website=FindArticles.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Village Voice]] critic [[Deborah Jowitt]] wrote about the performance in the following review:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://66.70.64.59/dance/0031,160718,17086,14.html] {{dead link|date=November 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Ruth St. Denis]], American mystic, and [[Ted Shawn]], entrepreneur, were a great team. During the glory days of their Denishawn company—roughly 1916 to 1931—a gifted disciple could obtain a franchise and open a [[Denishawn]] school. For a price, a young dancer could learn a colorful routine and secure its sheet music and costume design. Last month, two companies—the Marion Rice Denishawn dancers at the "Dancing in the Millennium" conference in Washington, D.C., and Dansarté, at [[Jacob's Pillow]]—presented programs of dances by St. Denis, Shawn, and their pupils.

What's intriguing about these dances—learned by Robin and Rebecca Rice at their grandmother's studio, and from Shawn at Jacob's Pillow in 1942 and 1943 by Dansarté's director, Sharry Underwood—is the way they combine the notion of art dance with a vaudeville structure. They tend to be about three minutes long, with reassuring amounts of repetition, structured in A-B-A form. Shawn and St. Denis captured the look and ambience of "exotic" styles, if not their steps. Dansarté's beautiful Maris Wolff, gorgeously costumed, performs an orientalist's dream of an Indian "nautch" dance—all rippling midriff, swaying steps, and flirtatious glances. Rice dancer Laurie Cameron appears for the circa 1930 fantasy La Peri (by either St. Denis or Miriam Winslow, who took over the Boston Denishawn school of the Braggiotti sisters), wafting swags of material that depend from her cap. The heelwork that Dansarté's Jean-Marie Mellichamp beats out in Viva Faroan has the air of flamenco without its now familiar complexities. In the early 20th century, what did American audiences know or care about authenticity?

On these fine programs, you can see the influence of [[Isadora Duncan]] in Chopin dances performed with lovely sincerity by the Rices, or get a whiff of German modernism in [[Marmein Dancers|Miriam Marmein]]'s circa 1932 mime, Argument des Boulevardiers, in which Valerie Farias Newton and Rebecca Rice wear mannish attire and gesticulate with rhythmic fury. Jess Meeker's music for Shawn's Gypsy-Rondo-Bout-Town nudges Dansarté's Genevieve Pellman and Neth Urkiel-Taylor from Haydn to swing. In all these early pieces, theatrical traditions, fashion, and experiment tiptoe toward modern dance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Current events==
In 2000, [[Marion Rice Denishawn]] performed in the "Dance in Millennium" Festival in Washington, DC.  The company presented "Boston Braggiotti and Denishawn", a lecture demonstration illuminating a select number of the early Denishawn works.

Anna Kisselgoff wrote in the ''New York Times'': &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Marion Rice's stagings of Denishawn works are always fresh and beautiful – the perfect example was the St. Denis ''Valse No. 14'' in which Robin Rice and [[Rebecca Rice (choreographer)|Rebecca Rice]] were also swathed in swirling fabric – but much more actively so than in theFuller solo. The amount of basic ballet taught in the Denishawn schools was evident in Robin Rice's luminous performance of Shawn's ''Red Radiance.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

'''Mathilda-Marie Feliksovna Kschessinskaya''' ({{lang-pl|Matylda Maria Krzesińska}}, {{lang-ru|Матильда Феликсовна Кшесинская}}; {{OldStyleDate|31 August|1872|19 August}}{{spaced ndash}}6&amp;nbsp;December 1971; also known as '''Princess Romanovskaya-Krasinskaya''' after her marriage) was a Russian [[ballerina]] from a family of Polish origin. Her father Feliks Krzesiński and her brother both danced in [[St. Petersburg]]. She was a mistress of the future Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] prior to his marriage, and later the wife of his cousin [[Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kshessinska 1960. ''Dancing in Petersburg''. London, transl Haskell.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was known in the West as ''Mathilde Kschessinska'' or ''Matilda Kshesinskaya''.&lt;ref&gt;The latter is Beaumont's version, ''The Diaghilev Ballet in London'', 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
Kschessinska was born at Ligovo, near [[Petergof|Peterhof]].  Like all her [[Poles|Polish family]], to whom she was known as '''Matylda Krzesińska''', Mathilde performed at the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] with the renowned [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]. Kschessinskaya made her début in a ''[[pas de deux]]'' from ''[[La Fille Mal Gardée]]'' during a graduation performance in 1890 attended by [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]] and the rest of the Imperial family, including the future Nicholas II. At the post-performance supper, the emperor sought out the young Kschessinskaya and told her to ''"...be the glory and adornment of our ballet.''"

==Prima ballerina==
In 1896, she obtained the rank of ''[[Prima ballerina]]'' of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The old [[maestro]] [[Marius Petipa]] did not consent to Kschessinskaya receiving such a title and although she possessed an extraordinary gift as a dancer, she obtained it primarily via her influence at the Imperial Russian Court.

==Relationship with Petipa==
Petipa allowed Kschessinskaya to create only a small number of new roles, as he considered the Italian [[Pierina Legnani]] to be the superior ballerina. Although she was able to command top billing in theatre programmes or on posters, her efforts to obtain more new roles were thwarted by Petipa, whose authority over the artistic direction of the Imperial Ballet was not challenged even by the Emperor himself. Among the few roles Kschessinskaya created were Flora in ''[[The Awakening of Flora or Le Réveil de Flore|Le Réveil de Flore]]'' (1894) and Columbine in ''[[Les Millions d'Arlequin|Harlequinade]]'' (1900). She also became the first Russian [[Ballerina|danseuse]] to master the 32 ''[[Turn (dance and gymnastics)#Fouetté|fouettés en tournant]]'' of Legnani.

Although Petipa had a great respect for Kschessinskaya as a dancer, he thoroughly despised her as a person, referring to her in his diaries as ''" ... that nasty little swine."'' Even so, he chose her for the lead roles in many of the final revivals of his older masterworks, often devising intricate choreography for her to execute—the shade of Mlada in ''[[Mlada (ballet)|Mlada]]'' (1896), Queen Nisia in ''[[Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule|Le Roi Candaule]]'' (1897), the Goddess Thetis in ''[[Les Aventures de Pélée]]'' (1897), Aspicia in ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' (1898), the title role in ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'' (1899), and Nikiya in ''[[La Bayadère]]'' (1900). Such roles became notoriously difficult once Petipa revised them for Kschessinskaya.

In 1899, Prince [[Serge Wolkonsky]] became Director of the Imperial Theaters. Although he held the position only until 1902, he achieved a great deal. [[Sergei Diaghilev]] was his immediate assistant, and Wolkonsky entrusted him with the publication of the Annual of the Imperial Theaters in 1900. During this period, new names appeared in the theaters, such as painters [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Konstantin Somov]], and [[Léon Bakst]]. However, Wolkonsky was forced to send in his resignation after clashing with Kschessinskaya when she refused to wear the panniers of an 18th-century costume in the ballet ''[[Camargo (ballet)|La Camargo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Marius Petipa| title=Russian Ballet Master: The Memoirs of Marius Petipa| publisher=Dance Books Ltd| year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals and rumours==

===The future tsar===
Kschessinskaya had been involved with the future [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], from 1890, when he was a [[grand duke]] and she was just seventeen, having met him in the presence of his family after her graduation performance. The relationship continued for three years, until Nicholas married Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt—the future [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna]]—in 1894, shortly after the death of his father, Tsar Alexander.

===Two grand dukes===
Scandals and rumours around her name developed and persisted as she engaged in a sexual relationship with two Grand Dukes of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov family]]: [[Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia|Sergei Mikhailovich]] and his cousin [[Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia|Andrei Vladimirovich]]. In 1902, she gave birth to a son, Vladimir (known as "Vova"; 30 June 1902 – 23 April 1974); he was later titled H.S.H. Prince Romanovsky-Krasinsky, but said that he never knew for sure who his father was.&lt;ref&gt;Though Andrei acknowledged Vova as his son, it is possible that Vova's biological father was Grand Duke Sergei, whose patronymic he was given. It has also been suggested that [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Romanov]] was the father. Another rumor, with [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] as father, was assumed by Adrienne Sharp in her fictional account of Kschessinska, ''The True Memoirs of Little K'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010), {{ISBN|0-374-20730-5}} [reviewed by {{cite news| first      = Benjamin Franklin| last       = Martin| date       = 2010-11-28| newspaper  = Advocate| place      = Baton Rouge| page       = 3E| title      = Tsar Nikolai II's lover's memoir is only partly fiction}}].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Having had a friendly relationship with Prince Wladimir Andreievich for the last seventeen years of his life, I have never heard him issuing any doubt as to the identity of his father. In his memoirs published under the title "Dancing in Petersburg" his mother writes on page 89: “.... Serge knew for certain that he was not the father of the child....We decided to call our son Wladimir, in honour of the Grand Duke Wladimir, André's father.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaching of Pavlova===
While Kschessinska could be charming and kind to colleagues, such as the young [[Tamara Karsavina]], she was not afraid to use her connections with the Tsar to strengthen her position in the Imperial Theatres. She was known to sew valuable jewels into her costumes and came on stage as the Princess Aspicia in ''The Pharaoh's Daughter'' wearing her diamond encrusted tiaras and chokers. She could also be ruthless with rivals. One of her most famous miscalculations occurred when, while pregnant in 1902, she coached [[Anna Pavlova]] in the role of Nikya in ''La Bayadère''. She considered Pavlova to be technically weak and believed that the other ballerina could not upstage her. Instead, audiences became enthralled with the frail, long-limbed, ethereal-looking Pavlova, and a star was born.

===Chickens on stage===
Another notorious incident occurred in 1906 when Kschessinskaya's coveted role of Lise in the Petipa/Ivanov production of ''La Fille Mal Gardée'' was given to [[Olga Preobrajenska]]. One feature of this production was the use of live chickens on stage. Before Preobrajenska's variation in the ''Pas de ruban'' of the first act, Kschessinskaya opened the doors to the chickens' coops and, at the first note of the music, the chickens went flying about the stage. Nevertheless, Preobrajenska continued her variation to the end and received a storm of applause, much to Kschessinskaya's chagrin.

==Finances==
Through her aristocratic connections, she managed to amass much valuable property in the Russian capital. It was from the balcony of her elegant house that [[Vladimir Lenin]] addressed the revolutionary crowd when he [[Finlyandsky Rail Terminal|returned from Switzerland]] in 1917.

==Move to France==
After the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], Kschessinska moved first to the [[French Riviera]] and then to [[Paris]], where she married, in 1921, one of the tsar's cousins, [[Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia]], the possible father of her son Vova. Although Kschessinska's life in Paris was modest compared with the lavish life she had enjoyed in Russia, she lived on happily for over 50 years. In 1925 Mathilde converted from Catholicism to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Maria. In 1929, she opened her own ballet school, where she taught such students as Dame [[Margot Fonteyn]], Dame [[Alicia Markova]], [[André Eglevsky]], [[Tatiana Riabouchinska]], [[Tamara Toumanova]] and [[Maurice Béjart]]. She performed for the last time at the age of 64, for a charity event with [[The Royal Ballet]] at [[Covent Garden]].

In 1960, she published an [[autobiography]] entitled ''Souvenirs de la Kschessinska'' (published in English as ''Dancing in St. Petersburg: The Memoirs of Kschessinska''). In later years, she suffered financial difficulties but remained indomitable. She died in [[Paris]], eight months short of her 100th birthday. She is buried at the [[Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]].

This file drawer houses the philosopher's letters to individuals with surnames from N through Z.]] 
'''Nachlass''' ({{IPA-de|ˈnaːxlas}}, older spelling '''Nachlaß''') is a [[German language|German]] word, used in [[academia]] to describe the collection of manuscripts, notes, correspondence, and so on left behind when a scholar dies. The word is a [[compound word|compound]] in German:  ''nach'' means "after", and the verb ''lassen'' means "to leave".  The plural can be either ''Nachlasse'' or (with [[Trema (diacritic)|Umlaut]]) ''Nachlässe''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/Nachlass&lt;/ref&gt; The word is not commonly used in English; and when it is, it is often italicized or printed in capitalized form to indicate its foreign provenance.

==Editing and preserving a Nachlass==

The Nachlass of an important scholar is often placed in a [[research library]] or scholarly [[archive]].  Other workers in the scholar's area of specialization may obtain permission to comb through the Nachlass, seeking important unpublished scholarly contributions or biographical material.  The content of a Nachlass can be catalogued, edited, and in some cases published in book form.

Such publication is more difficult for a Nachlass that contains a great deal of material, such as that of [[Gottfried Leibniz#Writings and edition|Gottfried Leibniz]].  In such cases, it may not be financially possible to publish its entire contents.  The Nachlass of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], kept at the [[University of Bergen]], has been digitized and published in [[compact disc]] format.&lt;ref&gt;For a description see [http://www.nlx.com/collections/124].&lt;/ref&gt;

Klagge and Nordmann note a conflict that faces an editor choosing what to publish draft material from a Nachlass:  to understand a scholar (in this case Wittgenstein) "as he would want to be understood, we should focus on the works that came closest to passing muster with him."  Yet publication of draft material may perhaps assist in a deeper understanding of the published versions, and also help understand the process whereby the scholar created his or her works.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Klagge and Nordmann (1993, ix&amp;ndash;x)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The author's viewpoint==

Sometimes it is known what the original scholar's view was concerning what should be done with his or her Nachlass, and these views differ greatly.  Near the end of his life [[Gottlob Frege]] wrote to his adopted son:

{{quote|Kleinen, 12 January 1925

Dear Alfred,

Do not scorn my handwritten material. Even if all is not gold, there is gold in it nevertheless. I believe that some of it will one day be held in much greater esteem than now. See to it that nothing gets lost.

With love, your father

It is a large part of myself that I here bequeath to you.}}

Frege's wishes probably went unfulfilled:  his Nachlass, although duly archived in the library of the [[University of Münster]], is believed to have been destroyed in 1945 by an Allied bombing raid during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;The matter is discussed in detail by Wehmeier and Schmidt am Busch (2002), translated and web-posted by Kai F. Wehmeier ([https://sites.google.com/site/kfwehmeier/nachlassquestfinal.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]] developed a strong commitment to his Nachlass (which included about 40,000 pages of sketches) during the last years of his life, allowing his colleagues to sort and classify it.   Bernet, Kern, and Marbach suggest that because Husserl had difficulty in putting his thoughts into a definitive, publishable form, he accordingly attached great importance to the survival of his notes.  In fact, because Husserl was of Jewish ethnicity and died in Germany in the year 1938, his Nachlass only narrowly escaped destruction under the [[Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph:  Bernet, Kern, and Marbach (1993, 245&amp;ndash;246)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred North Whitehead]], in contrast, asked that his Nachlass be destroyed, a wish that his widow carried out.  According to Lowe (1982), Whitehead "idealized youth and wanted young thinkers to develop their own ideas, not spend their best years on a Nachlass."  [[Gilbert Ryle]] likewise disapproved of scholars spending their time editing a Nachlass.  According to Anthony Palmer, he "hated the Nachlass industry and thought that he had destroyed everything of his that he had not chosen to publish himself so that there would be no Ryle ''Nachlass''."  ("One or two" papers (Palmer) did survive, however, and were published.)&lt;ref&gt;Source for Ryle:  Palmer (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Bergson]]'s Nachlass was destroyed by his widow at his request.  Lawlor and Moulard suggest that the destruction of Bergson's papers, by depriving later scholars of the stimulation of examining a Nachlass, actually affected his posthumous standing:  "The lack of archival material is one reason why Bergson went out of favor during the second half of the Twentieth Century."&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor and Moulard (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Nachlasse==
[[File:Notizbücher-Notizzettel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Small notebooks in the [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] archive.]]

*[[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716) left a Nachlass which contains over 200,000 pages of works in philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, science, politics, and physics in seven languages and remains largely unpublished today.
*[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) left a Nachlass that surprised other mathematicians, as it revealed that "he had gone quite a way to discovering [[non-Euclidean geometry]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, 128&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866) left notable mathematical problems, which remain unsolved, within his Nachlass. Marcus Du Sautoy writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Most mathematicians passing through [[Göttingen]] take the time to visit the library to examine Riemann's famous unpublished scribblings, his ''Nachlass''.  Not only is it a moving experience to feel a bond with such an important figure in the history of mathematics, but the ''Nachlass'' still contains many unsolved mysteries, locked inside Riemann's illegible scribbles. It has become the [[Rosetta stone]] of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;du Sautoy (2004, 286)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) left a large Nachlass. From it, the text for his final book, ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', was found, compiled, and drafted.
*[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) left a Nachlass which played an important role as the basis for [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson]]'s 1984 book ''[[The Assault on Truth|The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory]]'', which led to a huge scholarly contretemps, including a lawsuit.
*[[Robert Musil]] (1880–1942) has within his unfinished novel ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'' a second volume, subtitled "Aus dem Nachlass", consisting primarily of miscellaneous notes and sketches, left incomplete at the time of Musil's death. This Nachlass, published posthumously by Musil's widow, is included in both the German and in translated English publications of the work.
*[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889–1951) only published one book during his life. All others have been compiled from his Nachlass, which has been published by the University of Bergen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wab.aksis.uib.no/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In German==
Use of the word in German is not limited to academic contexts. It is frequently used to refer to the entirety of a person's [[Estate (law)|estate]] after they died, usually in the context of inheritance.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''National Center on Education and the Economy''' ('''NCEE''') is a [[not-for-profit]], [[policy]] analysis and development organization based in [[Washington, DC]]. It was formed by its current president, [[Marc Tucker]], with the stated mission: “To analyze the implications of changes in the international economy for American education, formulate an agenda for American education based on that analysis and seek wherever possible to accomplish that agenda through policy change and development of the resources educators would need to carry it out.” [http://www.ncee.org [1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

NCEE has three programs: The Center on International Education Benchmarking, The National Institute for School Leadership and a consulting service for states and large school districts.

==Center on International Education Benchmarking==
NCEE's Center on International Education Benchmarking (CIEB) funds and conducts research around the world on the most successful education systems to identify the strategies those countries have used to produce their superior performance. Through its books, reports, website, monthly newsletter, and a weekly update of education news around the world, CIEB provides up-to-date information and analysis on those countries whose students regularly top the PISA league tables. CIEB's global research is conducted in consultation with some of the foremost global education researchers and leaders and CIEB's international benchmarking reports have been used by policymakers across the political spectrum. Over the years, CIEB has benchmarked the education systems of Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Since its inception, CIEB has undertaken, funded and published groundbreaking research from some of the world's foremost education researchers and leaders including:
* An international comparative study of teaching quality in top-performing systems lead by Linda Darling-Hammond of Stanford University;
* An international comparative study of early childhood education by Sharon Lynn Kagan of Columbia University's Teachers College;
* International studies on school leadership, effective professional development and developing subject matter expertise in elementary school teachers by noted Australian researcher Ben Jensen;
* A report on Shanghai's vaunted teacher development system by system architect, former Shanghai Normal University President and former Shanghai Education Commission Deputy Director Minxuan Zhang;
* A comparative study of vocational education and training systems in Singapore, China and Switzerland; and
* An international comparative study of instructional systems by Tina Isaacs of the Institute of Education at the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncee.org/what-we-do/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/|title=NCEE {{!}}   Center on International Education Benchmarking|website=ncee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Institute for School Leadership==
The National Institute for School Leadership (NISL)  partners with state and district education leaders around the United States to deliver training for school and education system leaders intended to help them implement the world's most successful education practices. NISL offers a uniquely comprehensive curriculum using the latest research on adult learning. It is perhaps the only rigorously researched, proven leadership program that districts can deliver themselves, allowing for a wider and deeper impact. NISL is the culmination of an $11 million R&amp;D investment, five years of research and field-testing, and ongoing updates that leverage leading researchers and practitioners from education and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nisl.org/research-base/|title=Research Base|date=2013-03-06|work=NISL|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive Development Program===
NISL's Executive Development Program emphasizes the role of principals as strategic thinkers, instructional leaders and creators of a just, fair and caring culture in which all students meet high standards. It ensures that school leaders have the knowledge, skills, and tools to effectively set direction for teachers, support their staff in improving instructional practices, and design a high-performing school organization that is rooted in professional learning. The program combines best practices in teaching and learning, subject-area content knowledge, and leadership knowledge and practices using an approach with [http://www.nisl.org/proven-results/summary-of-key-results/ proven] results in preparing top-flight instructional leaders. NISL's Executive Development Program (EDP) is now the most widely used, rigorous school leadership development program in the country with more than 12,000 school leaders trained across 27 states. Multiple research studies have shown that students in schools led by NISL-trained leaders outperformed their peers on state tests in both math and reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nisl.org/executive-development-program/our-approach/|title=Our Approach|date=2013-03-08|work=NISL|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Department of Education Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) Grant===
NISL is implementing a national advanced credentialing system that aims to revolutionize the principalship in America. The project's goal is more than to simply identify and credential high-performing principals but also to create large numbers of them. The initiative is being piloted in partnership with state departments of education in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Mississippi under a three-year, $10.9 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education through its highly competitive [https://www2.ed.gov/programs/edseed/index.html Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grant program]. NISL is building the advanced credentialing system based on two major research findings. First, numerous studies have pointed to the importance of a strong principal in accelerating student learning, particularly in low-performing schools. Second, based in large part on international benchmarking research conducted by its parent organization, the National Center on Education and the Economy, several of the highest-performing education systems in the world use a similar strategy to leverage school principal leadership development as a foundation of their improvement approach. NISL's advanced credentialing system will give principals a transparent, codified and respected leadership development system that supports and rewards them as they progress through their careers—as it does in the world's top-performing education systems. The advanced credentialing system will empower principals, building their capacity as instructional leaders to improve teacher effectiveness and increase student achievement—across whole schools and whole districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nisl.org/seed/|title=NISL’s Advanced Credentialing System for Principals|date=2016-06-09|work=NISL|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Department of Education Investing in Innovation (i3) Grant===
In 2015, NISL was awarded a $12 million [https://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/index.html U.S. Department of Education Validation-level Investing in Innovation (i3) grant] to study a large-scale implementation of its Executive Development Program (EDP). The study encompasses delivery across three states—California, Florida and Mississippi. The Validation-level i3 grants are highly competitive awards “aimed at validating and spreading promising programs on a state or regional scale.” NISL's proposal was selected on the basis of the initiative's significance—including its ability to address “a challenge for which there is a national need for solutions that are better than the solutions currently available”— its ability to scale, the quality of the project design and management plan, and the quality of the project evaluation. The i3 grant to NISL, with backing from the Wallace Foundation, now supports principals in 88 districts that serve nearly 1.7 million students, many from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Training began in September 2015 and will provide rigorous and comprehensive leadership support to 750 principals throughout the duration of the grant. In doing so, the NISL initiative will directly impact the learning of 375,000 students, roughly equaling the total students to be served by all other 2014 i3 grants combined. District-designated staff in all three states will be trained and certified to deliver the NISL program to future cohorts, ensuring sustainability and scalability beyond the life of the grant. In addition to the wide-scale impact of the support provided by the grant, the initiative will also produce a “gold standard” study of NISL's EDP and coaching. This study, conducted by a team of external evaluators from the RAND Corporation, will use a rigorous randomized control trial design. The researchers will assess the impact of the three-state effort on principals, teachers and students. The external evaluators have calculated that 93,334 students have been impacted during the first year of the grant period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nisl.org/investing-in-innovation-i3-grant/|title=Investing in Innovation (i3) Grant|date=2016-09-28|work=NISL|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy Solutions for Public Schools: Consulting for States and Districts==
NCEE's consulting services provide the research, analysis and strategic planning support states and districts need to design education systems for high performance, equity and efficiency. NCEE's consulting services bring to bear the lessons learned from three decades of benchmarking top-performing systems around the world and enlist the expertise of top researchers, analysts, policymakers, and practitioners from the U.S. and abroad. The process involves comparing the state or district to the top nations, states, and provinces in the world on each of the [http://ncee.org/what-we-do/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/9-building-blocks/ 9 Building Blocks], so that state and district leaders can see where they are doing well and where they have a distance to go. It involves pulling together a group of state leaders to actually go and visit two or three of the leading countries, talk to many people there at all levels of the system, and see for themselves what can happen if a concerted effort is made and sustained over a long enough period of time to make a difference, and then helping that group help others understand what they have observed and work with a broad group of stakeholders to come up with a long-range plan to build a comprehensive system of the kind that they have seen. To assist in this consulting service, NCEE enlists top researchers, analysts, policymakers, and practitioners all over the world who are prepared to help NCEE help states and districts that are interested in building world-class systems of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncee.org/what-we-do/policy-solutions/|title=NCEE {{!}}   Policy Solutions|website=ncee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1989, NCEE created the National Alliance for Restructuring Education (NARE), which was aimed at promoting student performance in large urban districts and progressive states through [[standards-based education reform]]. That same year, NCEE created the [[bi-partisan]] Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce and a year later the organization produced the report ''America’s Choice: high skills or low wages!'' [http://www.americaschoice.org/ourhistory [2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

In 1992 NCEE, in conjunction with 23 states and 6 cities, created the New Standards Project. The goal of New Standards was to develop standards for the core subjects in the curriculum and applied learning standards coupled with new [[Educational assessment|assessment]] instruments designed to measure those standards using new, complex performance tasks that more closely resemble real world problems, thereby providing a rich context in which students could demonstrate their knowledge and skills [http://www.nctm.org/news/release.aspx?id=770 [3&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

Six years later, in 1998 NCEE created the America's Choice School Design Program based on the work of NARE and New Standards.[http://www.americaschoice.org/ourhistory%20America’s%20Choice%20History [2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] The program provides research-based school instructional intervention solutions and programs for states, districts, and schools. In 2010, [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] acquired America's Choice from NCEE, with the vision of bringing the America's Choice model to a worldwide market [http://www.americaschoice.org/pearsonacquisition [4&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

In 1999, NCEE launched the National Institute for School Leadership, a program designed to train [[principal (school)|principal]]s for high performing schools. The Institute has since served more than 3,800 principals in 14 states, and was adopted as the primary statewide [[professional development]] program in both [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]].[http://www.nisl.net [5&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] NISL now offers other professional development programs focused on specific issues such as [[early childhood]], [[English Language Learners]], excellence in [[science]] and [[Special education|students with disabilities]].

In 2006, NCEE released ''Tough Choices or Tough Times'' closely examining the strategies that had been used by one nation after another to surpass the achievement of American Students offering, for the first time, a comprehensive education reform agenda based on NCEE's education benchmarking work over almost 20 years. 

In 2011, NCEE launched the Excellence for All program, a network of 21 high schools committed to piloting these proposals in the United States.  These schools became the focus of a multi-year research program to examine what happened when certain fundamental changes in the structure of American high schools intended to greatly reduce dropouts, increase the proportion of high school students ready to succeed in college and reduce or even eliminate the need for college students to take remedial courses before they can qualify to take credit-bearing college courses were implemented. The results of that research have been a very important contributor to the design of NCEE's greatly expanded design for its signature leadership training program, the National Institute for School Leadership.

In November, 2011 NCEE established the Center on International Education Benchmarking. The Center expanded NCEE's continuing program of comparative research on effective education systems and developed a comprehensive web portal designed to enable people all over the world to more easily access information, analysis and opinion about the strategies used by the countries with the world's most successful education systems.

In 2014, the Center on International Education Benchmarking partnered with the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to support a bipartisan study group of state legislators from across the country investigating top-performing education jurisdictions around the world. CIEB supported the study group as it worked over two years to understand what has led to high student performance in those countries, provinces and states. And CIEB helped the study group members think about how what they learn could be adapted to improve the quality and effectiveness of education in US states for all young people. This work resulted in the groundbreaking report'' No Time to Lose: How to Build a World-Class Education System State by State.''

With a PhD in Human Bio mechanics and [[Alternative Medicine]], Neeraj Mehta,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiatimes.com/author/neeraj-mehta/&lt;/ref&gt; in the course of his career, he developed a  technique named as BMXStrength &lt;ref&gt;{{|http://neerajmehtabmx.com/bmx.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Biomechanics Exercise Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sardeshpande|first1=Dhananjay|title=An alternative form of exercise|url=http://www.bodylifeindia.com/article35.html|accessdate=30 March 2015|agency=Body Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique emphasises exercising according to individual [[biomechanics]], so as to produce results in less time with little strain on the [[joints]]. As the targeted muscle groups are used, supporting muscles are less taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaur|first1=Usmeet|title=Fit as a fiddle|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fit-as-a-fiddle/article1-1085647.aspx|accessdate=30 March 2013|agency=Hindustan Times|publisher=HT Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sardeshpande|first1=Dhananjay|title=An alternative form of exercise|url=http://www.bodylifeindia.com/article35.html|agency=Body Life|publisher=Body Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; While emphasising safety, he has marketed the technique to people who find difficulty followed by frequent injuries, sports persons and older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hassan M|first1=Kamal|title=Here's how Sean Penn got his lean and muscled look for 'The Gunman|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/heres-how-sean-penn-got-his-lean-and-muscled-look-for-the-gunman/16103175|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=Mid-Day|publisher=Mid-Day Infomedia Ltd|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BODY ENGINEERING AND LIFESTYLE WORKSHOP BY NEERAJ MEHTA, CELEBRITY FITNESS THERAPIS|url=http://www.wellnessgospel.com/2015/02/20/body-engineering-lifestyle-workshop-by-neeraj-mehta-celebrity-fitness-therapist|accessdate=20 February 2015|website=wellness-gospel|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Idea of fitness revolves around following correct [[biomechanics]], right postures and movements and [[flexibility]]. "For most people, fitness is all about lifting weights and using supplements. But fitness is all about being flexible and fit: being suitable to fulfill a particular role or task. A person with more muscle should be more flexible than one who is having less muscle mass. The human body muscle can stretch up to 30% of their length, but the connective tissues that can stretch up to just 4-5%. While lifting weights, and doing repetitions, one usually applies a lot of pressure on the connective tissues and the joints, leading to stiffness or strains causing injury. Exercise should keep in mind proper alignment of muscles and joints, and the availability of oxygen for the right effect, like four wheels of a car that need to be aligned well for a smooth, accident-free run", He said in a conversation with [[Mid Day]] during one of his regular workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamal M|first1=Hasan|title=Fitness trainer Neeraj Mehta on the importance of biomechanics|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/fitness-trainer-neeraj-mehta-on-the-importance-of-biomechanics/15686192|accessdate=23 April 2015|agency=Mid Day infomedia Ltd.|publisher=Mid Day infomedia Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoting the idea of senior fitness, he collaborated with [[HelpAge India]] and conducted a fitness workshop for seniors named as "fit@fifty".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/fitness/fitness-workshop-for-senior-citizens/article7516562.ece|title = Don’t give up!|date = 9 August 2015|accessdate = 4 December 2015|website = www.thehindu.com|publisher = The Hindu|last = Jain|first = Shreya}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends [[strength training]] for seniors, explaining the same to [[The Hindu]] he said "it is internationally proven that a person who is becoming older is most lacking in his or her muscle strength because they are losing their hormones and body balance. So, if they train themselves in strength training, they can strengthen their upper and lower body parts and also increases their [[Metabolism|metabolic]] process."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later, he became notable as the primary proponent of Iron Yoga in [[India]], a technique designed primarily to improve [[flexibility]] and maintain muscle strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Kalpana|title=Things you want to know about Iron Yoga|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/Things-you-want-to-know-about-Iron-Yoga/articleshow/46230038.cms|accessdate=30 March 2015|agency=Times Of India|publisher=Times Of India|date=13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shah|first1=Sonali|title=Flexible Fitness: Transform Your Body with Iron Yoga|url=http://idiva.com/news-health/iron-yoga-can-help-you-be-more-flexible/34850|agency=Idiva|publisher=Idiva|date=10 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Sanjana|title=Iron Yoga: Yoga with Weights!|url=http://healthmeup.com/news-diet-fitness/iron-yoga/35860|website=www.healthmeup.com|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8066">'''ORPHEUS''', the '''Organisation for PhD Education in Biomedicine and Health Sciences in the European System''', is an association of biomedical and health science faculties and institutions. ORPHEUS is dedicated to the development of standards for the PhD.

==History==
ORPHEUS was established in April 2004 with a European Conference on Harmonisation of PhD Programmes in Biomedicine and Health Sciences held in [[Zagreb]]. It became clear that despite many similarities PhD programmes there are also important differences in content and the standard expected. Thus a PhD title (also known as [[Doctor of Philosophy]]) may have different meanings in different parts of Europe. While some countries did not have any clinical PhD programmes, others had even two. Thus, the delegates coming from 25 universities and from 16 European countries agreed that there was a need for European [[Harmonisation of law|harmonisation]] and they accepted 'The Declaration of the European Conference on Harmonisation of PhD Programmes in Medicine and Health Sciences' ('Zagreb Declaration'), which contain the first European consensus statement what a PhD programme should consist of and aim for. Many of the ideas of the 'Zagreb Declaration' are also seen in the '10 Salzburg Principles'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eua.be/eua/jsp/en/upload/Salzburg_Conclusions.1108990538850.pdf Bologna Seminar], Salzburg, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the subsequent [http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publications_homepage_list/Salzburg_II_Recommendations.sflb.ashx Salzburg II] paper from the EUA-CDE.

The Second European Conference held in Zagreb in 2005, included delegates from 33 universities, from 21 European countries, issued a document ‘Guidelines for Organisation of PhD Programmes in Biomedicine and Health Sciences’ and launched the idea for the necessity to establish a European association of PHD programmes, for which the name ORPHEUS was accepted.

Third ORPHEUS 2007 conference was held in [[Helsinki]]. Participants from 43 universities from 26 European countries issued a document: ‘Helsinki Consensus Statement on PhD Training in Clinical Research’ (‘Helsinki Consensus Statement’) emphasizing the importance of PhD research in clinical medicine

Fourth ORPHEUS 2009 conference was held in [[Aarhus]] with 165 participants from 33 European countries the main topic: Maintaining the quality of the PhD degree. A major outcome of the conference was the production of a position paper, "Towards standards for PhD education in biomedicine and health sciences".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orpheus2009.org/upload/orpheus/final%20version%20(3)%20(3).doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth ORPHEUS 2010 conference was held in [[Vienna]] with 196 participants from 39 European countries with the main topic  “The Advancement of European Biomedical and Health Science PhD Education by Cooperative Networking”.

Sixth ORPHEUS 2011 conference was held in [[Izmir]] with 305 participants from 39 European countries with the main topic "PhD Quality Indicators for Biomedicine and Health Sciences”.

Seventh ORPHEUS 2012 conference in [[Bergen]] with 200 participants from 30 European countries with the main topic "Establishing evaluation of PhD Training".

==Aims==
The aims of ORPHEUS are:
* To safeguard the reputation of the PhD as a research degree and to strengthen career opportunities for PhD graduates.
* To give active support and guidance to members of ORPHEUS in enhancing their contributions to medicine and society in general.
* To provide information to members of ORPHEUS and all PhD candidates all over Europe.
* To represent higher education and research in biomedicine and health sciences and to influence policy making at national, European and international level.
* To encourage cooperation among members of the Association and the development of effective bilateral and multilateral networks.
* To promote cooperation in research and development of joint PhD programmes.
* To promote harmonisation of PhD programmes in biomedicine and health sciences
* To encourage mobility of PhD candidates and academic staff through all regions of Europe.
* To stimulate quality assurance of PhD research and education, and in particular to develop an accreditation process of PhD programmes in biomedicine and health sciences.
* To cooperate with other associations with similar goals.

A '''Pell Grant''' is a [[subsidy]] the [[U.S. federal government]] provides for students who need it to pay for college. Federal Pell Grants are limited to students with financial need, who have not earned their first [[bachelor's degree]], or who are enrolled in certain post-baccalaureate programs, through participating institutions.&lt;ref name="PELL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Pell Grants are usually awarded only to undergraduate students. |url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HowCalculated"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wondering how the amount of your federal student aid is determined? |url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/how-calculated |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pell Grant is named after [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] U.S. Senator [[Claiborne Pell]] of [[Rhode Island]], and was originally known as the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant. A Pell Grant is generally considered the foundation of a student's financial aid package, to which other forms of aid are added.&lt;ref name="USDOE 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Pell Grants|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget11/justifications/p-pell.pdf|publisher=Department of Education|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Pell Grant program is administered by the [[United States Department of Education]], which determines the student's financial need and through it, the student's Pell eligibility. The U.S. Department of Education uses a standard formula to evaluate financial information reported on the [[Free Application for Federal Student Aid]] (FAFSA) for determining the student's [[Expected Family Contribution|expected family contribution]] (EFC).&lt;ref name="College Board"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Pell Grant?|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/scholarships-and-aid/36318.html|publisher=[[College Board]]|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pell Grants were created by the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]]. These federal funded grants are not like loans, and need not be repaid. Students may use their grants at any one of approximately 5,400 participating postsecondary institutions. These federally funded grants help about 5.4 million full-time and part-time college and vocational school students nationally.&lt;ref name="MOHE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Pell Grant|url=http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm?pageID=139&amp;1534-D83A_1933715A=f07538b484e4efd0ba6d933da0d63412d7e48b3c|publisher=Minnesota Office of Higher Education|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, six of the top ten colleges (by total Pell Grant money awarded) were for-profit (proprietary) institutions.&lt;ref name="Pell Grants 2015-2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/data/pell-institution.html|title=Distribution of Federal Pell Grant Program Funds by Institution and Award Year|date=2017-08-31|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Update|date=March 2016}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}
Today, the Pell Grant program assists undergraduates of low-income families, who are actively attending universities and or other secondary institutions. However, before the Pell Grant became what it is today, it went through numerous changes.

In 1965, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]] (HEA). President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] implemented the HEA as a part of his administration's agenda to assist and improve higher education in the United States. It was the initial legislation to benefit lower- and middle-income students. The HEA program included not only grants but also low interest loans to students who did not qualify for grants. Universities and other institutions, such as vocational schools, benefited as well from the HEA program, by receiving federal aid to improve the quality of the education process. Student aid programs administered by the US Department of Education are contained in Title IV of the HEA and so are called "Title IV Programs."

In 1972, [[Title IX]] Higher Education Amendments were a response to the distribution of aid in the current grant. Senator Claiborne Pell set forth the initial movements to reform the HEA. Opportunity Grant Program (Basic Grant) were intended to serve as the "floor" or "foundation" of an undergraduate student's financial aid package. Other financial aid, to the extent that it was available, would be added to the Basic Grant up to the limit of a student's financial need. Most changes to the federal student aid program result from a process called ''[[reauthorization]]''. Through the process of reauthorization, Congress examines the status of each program and decides whether to continue that program and whether a continued program requires changes in structure or purpose. Congress has reauthorized campus-based programs every five or six years, beginning in 1972.

In 1994, Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (VCCLEA), a provision of which revoked Pell Grant funding "to any individual who is incarcerated in any federal or state penal institution." &lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;SpearIt, Keeping It REAL: Why Congress Must Act to Restore Pell Grant Funding for Prisoners (January 6, 2016). University of Massachusetts Law Review, Vol. 11, 2016. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2711979&lt;/ref&gt; A provision of this Act overturned a section of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which created the Pell Grant for postsecondary education. The provision reads, "No basic grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution." &lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; Prisoners first became eligible for basic grant funding in 1972. As the principal design of the Pell Grant was to help low-income individuals attain post-secondary education, including prisoners was consistent with the goal. The grant aimed to reach those who might not otherwise have an opportunity to enroll in college study or vocational training programs. Including prisoners for funding was based on the notion that higher education improved inmates, reduced recidivism, and contributed to a more orderly institution.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt, Restoring Pell Grants for Prisoners- Growing Momentum for Reform http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814358&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing advocacy for reinstating Pell Grant funding for all prisoners who would qualify, despite their incarceration status by members of the House of Representatives who introduced the Restoring Education and Learning Act (REAL Act) in the spring of 2015.

===Higher Education Amendments of 1972===
[[File:Claiborne Pell.jpg|thumb|alt=Claiborne Pell|[[Claiborne Pell]]]]

The Higher [[Education Amendments of 1972]] reauthorized the three campus-based programs, leaving the [[Economic Opportunity Grant Program]] with the same name, but renaming the two others: the National Defense Student Loan Program became the National Direct Student Loan or [[Federal Direct Student Loan Program]] and the [[Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant]] Program ([[SEOG]]). In addition, Proprietary (profit-making) schools became eligible to use Title IV Funds. Also, the Educational Opportunity Grant Program would no longer function as a stand-alone program of gift aid but instead would be linked with the Basic Grant Program.

In 1978, the Middle Income Student Assistance Act of 1978 ([[MISAA]]) was signed into act by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. This bill provides more generous Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, Pell Grants to low-income students, and makes students from families with incomes up to about $250,000 eligible. An additional 1.5 million students from middle-income families became eligible for the Basic Grants program.&lt;ref name="APP"&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Presidency Project|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=30087#axzz1HsOkGXHW|publisher=Gerhard Peters|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the alterations to the HEA were made to honor Claiborne Pell with his hard work and dedication to improving the higher education of the students in the United States.

===Education Amendments of 1978===
Families were now able to borrow $300 a year for each dependent child in school regardless of income.

===Recent legislation===
Several changes to the program occurred in 2011. The maximum award amount for the 2011–2012 award year is $5,500.&lt;ref name="USDOE 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Pell Grant Program|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a shortened application process, fewer funds for the 2011–2012 program could lead to financial problems for many students. The government funded the program at $17.1 billion from 2008–2010, as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. However, the additional funding does not match the needs of increasing numbers of students who enroll in college and qualify for aid through the recession.&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins|first=Katy|title=Potential Cuts to Pell Grant Could Affect Students in 2011|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2011/03/02/potential-cuts-to-pell-grant-could-affect-students-in-2011|publisher=U.S. News|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pell Grant program was subject to a $5.7 billion decrease in funding as part of a [[continuing resolution]] (H.R. 1), which cleared the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] in February 2011 and cut about $60 billion from the federal budget.&lt;ref name=Hopkins /&gt; The changes would take effect for the 2011–2012 school year, decreasing the maximum amount of aid for the most needy students from $5,550 to $4,705 a year; in addition, about 1.7 million students who receive smaller Pell Grants would become ineligible for the program. Approval for the cuts is not certain because of  long-standing bipartisan support from the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name=Hopkins /&gt; As of April 6, 2011, funds have not been approved, as the Senate has not voted to pass this legislation.

==Application==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
The application process requires the student and the student's family complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid ([[FAFSA]]) form. The applicant should complete the FAFSA form for the first time prior to starting the [[freshman]] undergraduate year and then update the form each year as the applicant progresses through the college undergraduate term. The first step in applying for the Pell Grant is to complete or update the FAFSA form on or after March 1 of each year. If an applicant must correct a completed FAFSA form, it can be done in step 3 of the application, in the "Make corrections to a processed FAFSA" section. When the student completes or updates the FAFSA application, answers to questions determine eligibility for the Pell Grant, among other government grants and funding.

After the initial FAFSA application is submitted, the student is notified by email or regular postal delivery if funding is awarded. Copies of the confirmation sheet should be made for personal records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc02l.htm|title=What happens after I submit the application?|website=fafsa.ed.gov|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eligibility===
The Department of Education has a standard formula that it uses to evaluate the information that each person supplies when applying for the Pell Grant. The formula used was created by Congress from criteria submitted through the FAFSA form. The formula produces a number that is called the [[Expected Family Contribution]] (EFC), which determines the student's eligibility.&lt;ref name=DofEd-PELL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifap.ed.gov/efcformulaguide/attachments/082511EFCFormulaGuide1213.pdf|title=THE EFC FORMULA, 2012-2013|work=[http://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/byTopic.jsp?program=4 iLibrary - Federal Pell Grant (Pell Grant) Program], [http://ifap.ed.gov Information for Financial Aid Professionals (IFAP)]|publisher=[http://www.ed.gov/ U.S. Department of Education]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This grant requires each applicant to be an undergraduate student who has not yet earned a bachelor's degree, and a United States citizen or an eligible non-citizen (usually, a permanent resident). In addition, the applicant must have a high school diploma or a [[General Educational Development|GED]] or be able to demonstrate the [[ability to benefit]] from the program.&lt;ref name="College Board" /&gt; Applicants must also sign a statement certifying that they will use the aid only for education-related purposes, that they are not currently in default for any federal student loans, and that they owe no refund for any federal education grants.

The Pell Grant also requires that students maintain satisfactory academic progress in a degree-oriented program as defined by the school they attend. Males between the ages of 18 and 25 must register with the [[Selective Service]]. A person may be eligible if previously incarcerated but with limited eligibility, depending on the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility/criminal-convictions |title=Students with Criminal Convictions |publisher=Federal Student Aid Information Center |date=2014-12-01 |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may be ineligible if they have been convicted of a drug-related offense, but it depends on the actual charge, when it happened, and if they attended a drug rehabilitation program. They must not have an outstanding Pell overpayment on record. Students who received a full scholarship of any kind are ineligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pellgranteligibility.org/ |title=Pell Grant Eligibility |publisher=Pell Grant Eligibility |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An applicant may not receive Pell Grant funds from more than one college at a time.&lt;ref name="College Board" /&gt;

===Award amount===
As with all grants, there is a maximum amount that the government funds for each applicant. For the 2010–2011, 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013-2014 award years, the maximum amount was $5,645.&lt;ref name="College Board" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hopkins /&gt; The maximum amount has increased for the 2014-2015 award year to $5,730. The maximum amount of the grant usually depends on the EFC and several other factors, including cost of attendance, the amount of time the student plans to attend college, whether it is a full academic year, and whether one is a full-time or part-time student&lt;ref name="College Board" /&gt; Once one has been considered eligible, the money can be obtained a couple of ways: the student's school can apply Pell Grant funds to school costs, pay the student directly, usually by check, or combine these methods.

The school must tell the student in writing how much the award will be and how and when it will be paid, and it must disburse Pell Grant funds once a semester/term or twice during the academic year.&lt;ref name="College Board" /&gt; Under certain circumstances, Pell funds can also be used to fund [[Career Pathways]] programs and support services.&lt;ref name=CLASP&gt;{{cite web

Advocacy efforts are growing to reinstate prisoner eligibility for the Pell Grant. There  is  growing  focus on education as a preventative to re-incarceration. An increasing number of  studies underscore education as a critical factor. In 1997, one study on 3,200 prisoners in three states showed that simply attending school behind bars  reduced  the  likelihood  of   re-incarceration  by  29 percent.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt, The Return of Pell Grants for Prisoners? http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of grant==
Typically, the college first applies the grant or loan money toward a student's tuition, fees, and (if the student lives on campus) room and board. Any money left over is paid to the student for other expenses: books, living expenses if the student does not live on campus, and transportation.&lt;ref name=PELL/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowCalculated/&gt;

==Impact==
Students coming from low-income families already face increased challenges that hinder their ability to receive a higher education. The Pell Grant addresses one of the issues by making college accessible to students that may need the financial assistance. It has been shown to increase the college enrollment of students coming from lower and moderate-income families. It can also reduce the chances of them dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;Boteach, Melissa, Erik Stegman, Sarah Baron, Tracey Ross, and Katie Wright. "The War on

==Federal Pell Grant lifetime eligibility calculator==

The scheduled award is the maximum amount of Federal Pell Grant funding a student can receive is calculated for an award year. An award year is a period from July 1 of one calendar year to June 30 of the next year.

The scheduled award is partially determined using the student's expected family contribution (EFC), which the program calculates from the information the student and family provided in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The result is the maximum amount the student can receive for the award year if enrolled full-time for the full school year. It represents 100% of the Pell Grant eligibility for that award year.

To determine how much of the maximum six years (600%) of Pell Grant the student uses each year, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) compares the actual amount awarded for the award year with the scheduled award amount for that award year. A student who uses 100% receives the full award. A student might not receive the entire scheduled award for an award year, most commonly if the student did not enroll for the full year, did not enroll full-time, or both. If the student does not receive the full award, ED calculates the percentage of the scheduled award they received. Before the 2011-2012 Aid Year, the FAFSA limit was 18 semesters, but it was cut to 12 semesters by Congress.

ED tracks the Lifetime Eligibility Used by adding the percentages of the Pell Grant scheduled awards a student receives each award year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/grants-scholarships/pell/calculate-eligibility |title=Calculating Pell Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.ed.gov |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17656">'''Personal boundaries''' are guidelines, rules or limits that a person creates to identify reasonable, safe and permissible ways for other people to behave towards them and how they will respond when someone passes those limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidetopsychology.com/boundaries.htm|title=Boundaries : Psychological Boundaries - Healthy Boundaries|author=|date=|website=www.guidetopsychology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are built out of a mix of conclusions, [[beliefs]], opinions, attitudes, past experiences and [[Observational learning|social learning]].&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|ISBN=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Rogers, ''Working with Young Men'' (2010) pp. 80, 161&lt;/ref&gt; This concept or [[life skill]] has been widely referenced in self-help books and used in the counseling profession since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=R. Skip|title=Setting Boundaries and Setting Limits|publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]]|url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/setting-boundaries|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some counselors, personal boundaries help to define an individual by outlining likes and dislikes, and setting the distances one allows others to approach.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. and J. S. Lundberg, ''I Don't Have to Make Everything All Better'' (2000) p. 13.  {{ISBN|978-0-670-88485-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include physical, mental, psychological and spiritual boundaries, involving beliefs, emotions, intuitions and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Porter-O'Grady, Kathy Malloch, ''Quantum Leadership'' (2003) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] considered such boundaries to be layered in a hierarchy, reflecting "all the successive envelopes of the biological and social status of the person".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (1997) pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Personal boundaries operate in two directions, affecting both the incoming and outgoing interactions between people.&lt;ref name=anne&gt;Katherine, Anne Where to Draw the Line: How to Set Healthy Boundaries Every Day (2000), pp. 16–25&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes referred to as the "protection" and "containment" functions.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;

==Scope==
The three most commonly mentioned categories of values and boundaries are:
* '''Physical''' – [[Personal space]] and [[Haptic communication|touch]] considerations&lt;ref name=Whitfield&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Charles Whitfield|Charles L. Whitfield, M.D]]|title=Boundaries and Relationships: Knowing, Protecting and Enjoying the Self|date=2010|publisher=HCI Books|isbn=978-1558742598|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kath&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katherine|first1=Anne|title=Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin|date=1994|publisher=Hazelden|isbn=978-1568380308|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cloud&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[John Townsend (author)|John Townsend, PhD]]|last2=[[Henry Cloud|Henry Cloud PhD]]|title=Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life|pages=245|date=1 November 1992|publisher=HarperCollins Christian Publishing|location=Nashville|isbn=9780310585909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mental''' –  Thoughts and opinions&lt;ref name=Whitfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=kath/&gt;&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt;
* '''Emotional''' – Feelings

Some authors have expanded this list with additional or specialized categories such as "spirituality",&lt;ref name=Whitfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt; "truth",&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt; and "time/punctuality".&lt;ref name=anne/&gt;

==Types==
Nina Brown proposed four boundary types:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nina W., ''Coping With Infuriating, Mean, Critical People – The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern''  (2006). {{ISBN|978-0-275-98984-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Soft''' – A person with soft boundaries merges with other people's boundaries. Someone with a soft boundary is easily a victim of [[psychological manipulation]].
* '''Spongy''' – A person with spongy boundaries is like a combination of having soft and rigid boundaries. They permit less [[emotional contagion]] than soft boundaries but more than those with rigid. People with spongy boundaries are unsure of what to let in and what to keep out.
* '''Rigid''' – A person with rigid boundaries is closed or walled off so nobody can get close either physically or emotionally. This is often the case if someone has been the victim of [[physical abuse|physical]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], or [[sexual abuse]]. Rigid boundaries can be '''selective''' which depend on time, place or circumstances and are usually based on a bad previous experience in a similar situation.
* '''Flexible''' – Similar to spongy rigid boundaries but the person exercises more control. The person decides what to let in and what to keep out, is resistant to [[emotional contagion]] and [[psychological manipulation]], and is difficult to exploit.

==Application==
The personal boundaries concept is particularly pertinent in environments with controlling people or people not taking responsibility for their own life.&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt;

[[Co-Dependents Anonymous]] recommends setting limits on what members will do to and for people and on what members will allow people to do to and for them, as part of their efforts to establish autonomy from being controlled by other people’s thoughts, feelings and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Setting Boundaries: Meditations for Codependents (Moment to Reflect)|date=August 1995|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=9780062554017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] tells its members that establishing and maintaining values and boundaries will improve the sense of security, stability, predictability and order, in a family even when some members of the family resist. NAMI contends that boundaries encourage a more relaxed, nonjudgmental atmosphere and that the presence of boundaries need not conflict with the need for maintaining an understanding atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bayes|first1=Kathy|title=Setting Boundaries In A Marriage Complicated By Mental Illness|url=http://www2.nami.org/Content/Microsites138/NAMI_Fort_Wayne_Indiana/Home128/Information_for_Spouses_and_Partners1/Boundaries.doc|website=National Alliance on Mental Illness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of reestablishing==
In ''[[Families and How to Survive Them]]'', [[Robin Skynner]] MD explains methods for how family therapists can effectively help family members to develop clearer values and boundaries by when treating them, drawing lines, and treating different generations in different compartments&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''[[Families and How to Survive Them]]'' (London 1993) pp. 93, 213&lt;/ref&gt; – something especially pertinent in families where unhealthy [[enmeshment]] overrides normal personal values.&lt;ref name=Weinhold&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinhold|first1=Barry|last2=Weinhold|first2=Janae|title=Breaking Free of the Co-Dependency Trap|date=28 January 2008|publisher=[[New World Library]]|location=Novato|isbn=978-1577316145|pages=192, 198|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of personal values and boundaries in such instances may produce a negative fall-out,&lt;ref name=Weinhold/&gt; if the pathological state of enmeshment had been a central attraction or element of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Abell, ''Own Your Own Life'' (1977) pp. 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true if the establishment of healthy boundaries results in unilateral limit setting which did not occur previously. It is important to distinguish between unilateral limits and collaborative solutions in these settings.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;

==Anger==
[[Anger]] is a normal [[emotion]] that involves a strong uncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation. Often, it indicates when one's personal boundaries are violated. Anger may be utilized effectively by setting boundaries or escaping from dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing|edition=3rd|last=Videbeck|first=Sheila L.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complicating factors==

===Addictions===
Addicts often believe that being in control of others is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Fenley, Jr., James L. ''Finding a Purpose in the Pain'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness===
People with certain mental conditions are predisposed to [[controlling behavior]] including those with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[paranoid personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goldberg, MD|first=Joseph|title=Paranoid Personality Disorder |url=http://webmd.com/mental-health/paranoid-personality-disorder|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?

* '''Borderline personality disorder (BPD):''' There is a tendency for loved ones of people with BPD to slip into caretaker roles, giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives. Too often in these relationships, the codependent will gain a sense of worth by being "the sane one" or "the responsible one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danielle|first1=Alicia|title=Codependency and Borderline Personality Disorder: How to Spot It|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/codependency-and-borderline-personality-disorder-how-to-spot-it.html|publisher=Clearview Women's Center|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;Often, this shows up prominently in families with strong Asian cultures because of beliefs tied to the cultures. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Soo Jung|date=2017-05-25|title=Gendered Cultural Identities: The Influences of Family and Privacy Boundaries, Subjective Norms, and Stigma Beliefs on Family Health History Communication|url=http://dx.doi.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1080/10410236.2017.1322480|journal=Health Communication|volume=33|issue=8|pages=927–938|doi=10.1080/10410236.2017.1322480|issn=1041-0236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD):''' For those involved with a person with NPD, values and boundaries are often challenged as narcissists have a poor sense of [[self]] and often do not recognize that others are fully separate and not extensions of themselves. Those who meet their needs and those who provide gratification may be treated as if they are part of the narcissist and expected to live up to their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hotchkiss, LCSW|first1=Sandra|title=Why Is It Always About You? (Chapter 7)|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=9780743214285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codependency===
[[Codependency]] often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns and Characteristics of Codependence|url=http://coda.org/index.cfm/meeting-materials1/patterns-and-characteristics-2011/|website=coda.org|publisher=Co-Dependents Anonymous|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a healthy relationship depends on the emotional space provided by personal boundaries,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; codependent personalities have difficulties in setting such limits, so that defining and protecting boundaries efficiently may be for them a vital part of regaining mental health.&lt;ref name=Weinhold/&gt;

In a codependent relationship, the codependent's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs. Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy clinginess, where one person doesn't have self-sufficiency or autonomy. One or both parties depend on the other for fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wetzler, PhD|first1=Scott|title=Psychology division chief at Albert Einstein College of Medicine|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/signs-of-a-codependent-relationship|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is usually an unconscious reason for continuing to put another person's life first, often for the mistaken notion that self-worth comes from other people.

===Dysfunctional family===
* '''Demanding parent:''' In the [[dysfunctional family]] the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lancer|first1=Darlene|title=Conquering Shame and Codependency: 8 Steps to Freeing the True You|date=2014|publisher=Hazelden|location=Minnesota|isbn=978-1-61649-533-6|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Demanding child:''' Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority. A parent can, nevertheless, be codependent towards a child if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075736/http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm |date=2013-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal influences===
[[Freud]] described the loss of conscious boundaries that may occur when an individual is in a unified, fast-moving crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, 'Le Bon's Description of the Group Mind', in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) pp. 98–109&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a century later, [[Steven Pinker]] took up the theme of the loss of personal boundaries in a communal experience, noting that such occurrences could be triggered by intense shared ordeals like hunger, fear or pain, and that such methods were traditionally used to create [[Liminality|liminal]] conditions in [[initiation rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Stuff of Thought'' (2007) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jung]] had described this as the absorption of identity into the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jung|first1=Carl Gustav|title=Man and His Symbols|date=15 August 1968|publisher=Dell|isbn=978-0440351832|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rave culture]] has also been said to involve a dissolution of personal boundaries, and a merger into a binding sense of communality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Carole|title=Disappearing Men: Gender Disorientation in Scottish Fiction 1979-1999 (Scroll: Scottish Cultural Review of Language and Literature) (Book 12)|date=10 September 2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-9042026988|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unequal power relations===
Also unequal relations of [[Power (social and political)|political and social power]] influence the possibilities for marking cultural boundaries and more generally the quality of life of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin P.T. Baillie|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/totem/vol20/iss1/12/|title=Power Relations and its Influence in the Sphere of Globalization since World War II|journal=Journal of Anthropology|publisher=The University of Western Ontario|volume=20|issue=1|date=2012|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal power in personal relationships, including [[Abusive power and control|abusive relationships]], can make it difficult for individuals to mark boundaries.

[[Image:20050523 012 bristol bbc picket.jpg|thumb|Employees of the [[BBC]] form a picket line during a strike in May 2005.]]
'''Picketing''' is a form of [[protest]] in which people (called picketers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=picketer |title=Picketer &amp;#124; Define Picketer at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; congregate outside a [[place of work]] or location where an event is taking place. Often, this is done in an attempt to dissuade others from going in ("[[Strikebreaker|crossing the picket line]]"), but it can also be done to draw public attention to a cause. Picketers normally endeavor to be [[non-violent resistance|non-violent]].  It can have a number of aims, but is generally to put pressure on the party targeted to meet particular demands or cease operations. This pressure is achieved by harming the business through loss of customers and negative publicity, or by discouraging or preventing workers or customers from entering the site and thereby preventing the business from operating normally.

Picketing is a common tactic used by [[trade union]]s during [[Strike action|strikes]], who will try to prevent dissident members of the union, members of other unions and non-unionised workers from working. Those who cross the picket line and work despite the strike are known pejoratively as [[Strikebreaker|scabs]].

==Types of picket==
[[Image:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A rally of the trade union [[UNISON]] in [[Oxford]] during a strike on March 28, 2006, with members carrying picket signs.]]

'''Informational picketing''' is the legal name given to the type of picketing described above. Informational picketing, as described by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, entails picketing by a group, typically a labour or trade union, which inform the public about a matter of concern important to the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/informational%20picketing?db=legal|title=informational picketing - Reference.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular picketing technique for nurses to use outside of healthcare facilities. For example, on April 5, 2006 [[nurse]]s of the UMass Memorial Medical Center ([[UMMHC]]) participated in two separate informational picketing events to protect the quality of their nursing program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Twarog,J: "Informational pickets, rallies, vigils and leafleting at health care facilities" Massachusetts Nurse; Apr2006, Vol. 77 Issue 3, p9-9, 2/3p&lt;/ref&gt; Informational picketing was used to gain public support and promote further bargaining with management.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;

A '''mass picket''' is an attempt to bring as many people as possible to a picket line to demonstrate support for the cause. It is primarily used when only one workplace is being picketed or for a symbolically or practically important workplace. Due to the numbers involved, a mass picket may turn into a potentially unlawful [[blockade]].

'''Secondary picketing''' is the picketing of locations that are directly connected to the issue of protest. That would include component suppliers on which the picketed business relies, retail stores that sell products by the company against which is being picketed, sister companies of the company involved in  the dispute and the private homes of the company's management. In many jurisdictions, secondary pickets do not have the same civil law protection as primary pickets.

An example of this is the [[Battle of Saltley Gate]] in 1972 in Britain, when striking miners picketed a coke works in [[Birmingham]] and were later joined by thousands of workers from other industries in the local area. The tactic of secondary picketing was outlawed in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the mid-1980s, but the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] opposition led by [[Neil Kinnock]] was pushing for it to be legalised in the before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]]. However, such plans had been dropped by the time Labour returned to power under [[Tony Blair]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/92063414/Hulton-Archive|title=Posters From The Conservative Party Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|flyingpickets}}Another tactic is to organise highly mobile pickets, who can turn up at any of a company's locations on short notice. These '''flying pickets''' are particularly effective against multi-facility businesses that could otherwise pursue legal [[prior restraint]] and shift operations among facilities if the location of the picket were known with certainty ahead of time. The first recorded use of flying pickets was during the [[UK miners' strike (1969)|1969 miners' strike in Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckett|first=Andy |title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies |location=London |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |year=2009 |page=70 |isbn=9780571252268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picketing is also used by [[pressure group]]s across the political spectrum. In particular, picketing has been employed by religious groups such as the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] that picket a variety of stores or events they consider to be sinful.

==Disruptive picketing==

'''Disruptive picketing''' is where pickets illegally use force, or the threat of force, or physical obstruction, to injure or intimidate or otherwise interfere with either staff, service users, or customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1372177 Leedom v. Kyne and the Implementation of a National Labor Policy], James F. Wyatt III, Duke Law Journal, Vol. 1981, No. 5 (Nov., 1981), pp. 853–877&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]], strikebreakers were pelted by pickets with stones, paint and brake fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=264 |isbn=0-340-38445-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, with the introduction of the [[Internet]] and [[digital photography]], picketers have placed cameras at the entrances of their targets, often accompanied with written notices warning those who cross the picket line that their photographs (and, where known, their names and addresses) will be posted on the picketers' website. Their legality has been challenged in some jurisdictions on the grounds that such tactics violate [[privacy rights]] or are intended to incite later [[reprisal]]s against such individuals. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Legality==
[[Image:NLRB picketing 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Trade union|Union members]] picketing [[National Labor Relations Board]] rulings outside the agency's [[Washington, D.C.]], headquarters in November 2007.]]

Picketing, as long as it does not cause obstruction to a highway or intimidation, is legal in many countries and in line with [[freedom of assembly]] laws, but many countries have restrictions on the use of picketing.

Legally defined, recognitional picketing is a method of picketing that applies economic pressure to an employer with the specific goal to force the employer to recognise the issues facing employees and address them by bargaining with a union.&lt;ref&gt;52 Geo. L. J. 248 (1963-1964)Federal Regulation of Recognition Picketing ; Shawe, Earle K.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, this type of picketing, under Section 8(b) (7) (A) of the Labor Act, is typically illegal if representation is not relevant or is unquestionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title="Stale" Contract No Bar to Recognitional Picketing |work=Labor Law Journal |date=June 1066 |volume= 17| issue = 6|page=384 1/2p |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=2&amp;hid=104&amp;sid=c104b213-f36a-45be-a48e-143c888ef5bd%40sessionmgr112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK mass picketing was made illegal under the [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] after the [[1926 General Strike]]. The [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] gives protection, under civil law, for pickets who are acting in connection with an industrial dispute at or near their workplace who are using their picketing peacefully to obtain or communicate information or persuading any person to work or abstain from working. However, many employers have recently taken to gaining [[injunctions]] to limit the effect of picketing outside their work place. The granting of injunctions tends to be based on the accusation of intimidation or, in general, on non-peaceful behaviour and the claim that numbers of the picketers are not from the affected workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/your-rights/chapters/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/picketing/picketing.shtml|title=Picketing, The Liberty guide to human rights|date=11 January 2005|publisher=[[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]]|access-date=9 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060725125237/http://www.yourrights.org.uk/your-rights/chapters/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/picketing/picketing.shtml|archive-date=25 July 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, picketing was banned by a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government in the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871]] but then decriminalised by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government with the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/1850_1880.php|title= Timeline:1850–1880 |publisher= TUC history online, Professor Mary Davis, Centre for Trade Union Studies, London Metropolitan University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, any strike activity was hard to organise in the early 1900s, but picketing became more common after the [[Norris-LaGuardia Act]] of 1932, which limited the ability of employers to gain injunctions to stop strikes, and further legislation to support the right to organise for the unions. Mass picketing and secondary picketing was however outlawed by the 1947 [[Taft-Hartley Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/search/search.php?word=PICKETING&amp;enc=37490 |title=PICKETING |work=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311023441/http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/search/search.php?word=PICKETING&amp;enc=37490 |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some kinds of pickets are [[freedom of speech in the United States|constitutionally]] protected.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'' and other cases cited at [[Free speech zone#Notable incidents and court proceedings]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing laws against [[stalking]] as potentially inconsistent with labour rights of picketing, the first anti-stalking law of the industrial world, made by [[California]]'s lawmakers, inserted provisions that disapply the law from "normal labor picketing", which has survived subsequent amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code s. 646.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Public sociology''' is a subfield of the wider [[Sociology|sociological discipline]] that emphasizes expanding the disciplinary boundaries of sociology in order to engage with non-academic audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a ''style'' of sociology rather than a particular [[Scientific method|method]], [[theory]], or set of [[politics|political]] values. Since the twenty-first century, the term has been widely associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], who delivered an impassioned call for a disciplinary embrace of public sociology in his 2004 [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) presidential address.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his address, Burawoy contrasts public sociology with what he terms "professional sociology", a form of sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other academic sociologists.

Burawoy and other advocates of public sociology encourage the discipline to engage with issues that are of significant public and political concern. These include debates over public policy, political [[activism]], the purposes of [[social movements]], and the institutions of [[civil society]]. If public sociology is considered to be a "movement" within the discipline, it is one that aims to revitalize the discipline of sociology by leveraging its [[empirical]] methods and theoretical insights to contribute to debates not just about ''what is'' or ''what has been'' in society, but about what society ''might yet be''. Thus, many versions of public sociology have had an undeniably [[Norm (sociology)|normative]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanemaayer, A., &amp; Schneider, C.J. (eds) (2014).

==History==
The term "public sociology" was first introduced by [[Herbert Gans]] in his 1988 ASA presidential address, "Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|date=1989-01-01|title=Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public American Sociological Association, 1988 Presidential Address|jstor=2095658|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.2307/2095658}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Gans, primary examples of public sociologists included [[David Riesman]], author of ''The Lonely Crowd'' (one of the best-selling books of sociology ever to be written), and [[Robert Bellah]], the lead author of another best-selling work, ''Habits of the Heart''. In 2000 (four years before Burawoy's ASA address), sociologist [[Ben Agger]] wrote the book ''Public Sociology: From Social Facts to Literary Acts,'' which called for a sociology that addressed major public issues.

However, the [[Northwestern University]] race scholar [[Aldon Morris]] argues in his book ''The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology'' (2015) that [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W. E .B. Du Bois]] was practicing public sociology long before the term was incorporated into the mainstream disciplinary vocabulary, and that [[scientific racism]] prevented Du Bois' contributions from being recognized by the discipline for nearly a century.

Morris argues that Du Bois built the first actual scientific department of sociology during his tenure at [[Atlanta University]], a historically black college, predating the "scientific revolution" of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] (who are often credited with turning sociology into a rigorous, empirical social science).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology|last=Morris|first=Aldon|publisher=University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~lutters/pubs/1996_SWLNote96-1_Lutters,Ackerman.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Chicago School of Sociology|last=Lutters|first=Wayne G.|last2=Ackerman|first2=Mark S.|date=1996|website=|publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore County|access-date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Du Bois, robust empirical sociological research was necessary in order to emancipate American blacks from the tyrannies and oppressions built into the racist fabric of American society. Through thorough [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] research, Du Bois sought to dismantle and delegitimize [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]], biological, and cultural deficiency explanations for racial inequality, which were ''not'' grounded in empirical evidence, but relied on grand [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] narratives that had no basis in scientific analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Du Bois and his colleagues made use of the scientific method and robust empirical inquiry with the dual goal of turning sociology into a ''real'' social science committed to empirical investigation, and using their findings to liberate, empower, and emancipate American blacks from the violence of racist oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, long before Gans or Burawoy began emphasizing the virtues of public sociology, Du Bois had been serving a marginalized public through his scholarly research, failing to receive credit where credit was due.

Debates over public sociology have rekindled questions concerning the extra-academic ''purpose'' of [[sociology]]. Public sociology raises questions about what sociology is and what its goals ought to (or even could) be. Such debates (over science and political advocacy, scholarship and public commitment) have a long history in American sociology and in American social science more generally. Historian Mark C. Smith, for instance, has investigated earlier debates over the purpose of social science in his book ''Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose,1918-1941'' (1994), while Stephen P. Turner and Jonathan H. Turner argue in their book, ''The Impossible Science: An Institutional Analysis of American Sociology'' (1990), that sociology's search for purpose, through dependence on external publics, has limited the discipline's potential.

==Today==
While there is no one definition of public sociology, the term has come to be widely associated with Burawoy's particular perspective of sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An excerpt from Burawoy's 2004 ASA presidential address provides a succinct summary of his understanding of the term: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As mirror and conscience of society, sociology must define, promote and inform public debate about deepening [[Social class|class]] and racial inequalities, new gender regimes, [[environmental degradation]], [[market fundamentalism]], state and non-state violence. I believe that the world needs public sociology - a sociology that transcends the academy - more than ever. Our potential publics are multiple, ranging from [[Mass media|media]] audiences to policy makers, from silenced minorities to social movements. They are local, global, and national. As public sociology stimulates debate in all these contexts, it inspires and revitalizes our discipline. In return, theory and research give legitimacy, direction, and substance to public sociology. Teaching is equally central to public sociology: students are our first public for they carry sociology into all walks of life. Finally, the critical imagination, exposing the gap between what is and what could be, infuses values into public sociology to remind us that the world could be different."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, M. 2004 American Sociological Association Presidential address: For public sociology. ''American Sociological Review'', 2005, Vol. 70, Issue 1, 4-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Elsewhere, Burawoy has articulated a vision of public sociology that is consonant with the pursuit of [[democratic socialism]]. In ''Critical Sociology'', Burawoy writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We might say that critical engagement with real [[utopias]] is today an integral part of the project of sociological socialism. It is a vision of socialism that places human society, or social humanity at its organizing center, a vision that was central to [[Karl Marx|Marx]] but that was too often lost before it was again picked up by Gramsci and Polanyi. If public sociology is to have a progressive impact it will have to hold itself continuously accountable to some such vision of democratic socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: "The Critical Turn to Public Sociology", ''Critical Sociology'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As [[Mark D. Jacobs]] and [[Amy Best]] write, "The mission of public sociology, in Michael Burawoy’s formulation, is to strengthen the institutions of civil society against the encroachments of both state and market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Burawoy maintains that, since the last half of the twentieth century and into the twenty first, the political stance of sociology has drifted more [[Left-wing politics|leftward]], while the all encompassing influence of [[neoliberalism]] has dragged the rest of world more [[Right-wing politics|rightward]]. In the aftermath of [[Reaganomics]], the state and market have begun to work in collusion to propagate the ideals of market fundamentalism, replacing the state's role in redistributing resources and providing social welfare services, to one of creating economic opportunities for enterprise. In his view, this will have devastating consequences for civil society, the very subject of sociology itself, unless the discipline embraces his call to unashamedly engage with the world's diverse (and at-risk) publics to achieve some greater good, thus resisting the perverse allure of neoliberalism. One example of this can be seen in the vast increase in adjunct professors in universities and the impact that has had on the inability of professors to publish articles that would give them credence in the eyes of not only publics but also within the discipline itself.

Even in the face of such adversity, many sociologists remain optimistic about the potential latent within sociology to develop an alternative paradigm to the market fundamentalism at the heart of Burawoy's critique. The sociological discipline is dynamic and ever changing, and has a long history of incorporating new theoretical and empirical insights into its analyses, often with the goal of empowering marginalized publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Daniel|title=Understanding Society|journal=Sociology as a Social Science Discipline|date=November 9, 2007|pages=1|url=http://understandingsociety.blogspot.ca/2007/11/sociology-as-social-science-discipline.html|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the sociology of work has evolved from processes of adaptation to the study of domination and [[Labour movement|labor movements]]; the concepts of [[Social stratification|stratification theory]] have shifted from the study of mobility within a hierarchy of occupational prestige, to the examination of changing structures of social and economic inequality along the axes of class, race and gender; the sociology of race has moved from theories of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], to those of [[political economy]], to the study of [[Racial formation theory|racial formations]]; and social theory has allowed, and introduced, more radical interpretations of canonical figures such as [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], and [[Karl Marx]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and has incorporated "[[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]]" subfields, such as [[feminism]] and [[ethnic studies]], which have had a significant impact on the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sociology: Fifteen Eminent Sociologists Debate Politics and the Profession in the Twenty-first Century|last=Glenn|first=Evelyn Nakano|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=213–230|chapter=Whose Public Sociology?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists have not been alone in debating the public role of social science. Similar debates have occurred recently in the disciplines of [[economics]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]] and [[history]], and various sub-disciplines, including [[political ecology]]. In an effort to move these various disciplines "toward a more public social science", [[Craig Calhoun]], the President of the [[Social Science Research Council]], has encouraged sociologists and other social scientists to "ask better social science questions about what encourages [[scientific]] innovation, what makes [[knowledge]] useful, and how to pursue both these agendas, with attention to both immediate needs and long-term capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ ssrc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416003140/http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calhoun has also entered the debate about public sociology, critically evaluating the project of public sociology while acknowledging its specific "promise", and arguing that "how sociology matters in the public sphere is vital to the future of the field".&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, C. 2004 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00065.x/full "The promise of public sociology"]. ''The British Journal of Sociology'', 2005, Vol. 56, Issue 3, 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Following the 2004 annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), at which Michael Burawoy's vision of public sociology was introduced during his presidential address,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burawoy|first=Michael|date=2005|title=For Public Sociology|url=http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/Public%20Sociology,%20Live/Burawoy.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=70|pages=4–28|doi=10.1177/000312240507000102|pmid=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been continued interest in the topic. In recent years, numerous books and special issues have addressed public sociology, including:

Building on the conversation sparked by Burawoy in 2004, the 2007 ASA meeting in New York City contained many facets of public sociology. Many of the presentations engaged directly with the public sociology debate, such as: "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Paul. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p185050_index.html "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Paul Johnston; "A New Public Sociology of Punishment"&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Heather.

Lambros Fatsis' doctoral thesis on public sociology, [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/51588/ "Making Sociology Public: A Critical Analysis of an Old Idea and a Recent Debate"], can also be recommended as a critical review of the contemporary disciplinary debate about public sociology, incorporating such developments as "e-public sociology" into the scholarly discussion. E-public sociology is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C.J. (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and [[Christopher J. Schneider]], editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over public sociology is having far reaching consequences for how many sociology departments teach and ''do'' sociology, with several reorienting their programs to encompass elements of public sociology. For example, the sociology department at the [[University of Minnesota]] has begun advocating for sociology to claim a larger role in public life, providing "useful, accurate, and scientifically rigorous information to policy makers and community leaders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/nov04/fn14.html "The Engaged Department: Public Sociology in the Twin Cities"] by Ronald Aminzade, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Footnotes nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[George Mason University]] began offering a doctoral degree in sociology in the fall of 2008, grounding its two specializations in Institutions and Inequalities and the Sociology of Globalization within a context of public sociological praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], too, most institutions that provide undergraduate sociology degrees now advertise the public or "applied" nature of the curriculum (or various key modules that form part of the curriculum). Some examples here would include: [[Birmingham City University]]; [[Queen Margaret University|Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh]]; [[Nottingham Trent University]]; the [[University of Exeter]]; [[Cardiff University]]; and [[Bishop Grosseteste University]]'s newly established [https://web.archive.org/web/20160113173152/http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology program].

Indeed, with so many programs incorporating the ideals of public sociology into their curriculums, this will have significant consequences for how future sociologists are trained to ''do'' sociology.

==Criticism==
A significant number of those who practice sociology either as public intellectuals or as academic professionals do not subscribe to the specific version of "public sociology" defended by Michael Burawoy or to any version of "public sociology" at all. And in the wake of Burawoy's 2004 Presidency of the American Sociological Association, which put the theme of public sociology in the limelight, the project of public sociology has been vigorously debated on the web, in conversations among sociologists, and in a variety of academic journals.

Specifically, Burawoy's vision of public sociology has been critiqued both by "[[Critical theory|critical]]" sociologists and by representatives of academic sociology. These various discussions of public sociology have been included in forums devoted to the subject in [[academic journal]]s such as ''Social Problems'', ''Social Forces'', ''Critical Sociology'', and the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051125044631/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/BURAWOY/workingpapers.htm].

Public sociology faces fierce criticism on the grounds of both of its logic and its goals.  Its critics claim that it is based on a [[false premise]] of consensus in the sociological community, arguing that "it greatly overestimates the uniformity of the moral and political agenda of sociologists".&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;Francois Nielsen. 2004. "The Vacant 'We': Remarks on Public Sociology."  Social Forces, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1619-1627&lt;/ref&gt;  They question the possibility and the desirability of such moral agreement, pointing out that "almost every social issue involves moral dilemmas, not moral clarity. What is or is not 'just' is almost never unambiguous".&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;  Others argue that public sociology is based on an uncritical and overly idealistic perception of the public sphere.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;Brady, David. 2004. "Why Public Sociology May Fail."  ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1629-1638&lt;/ref&gt; Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3). P. 183-190. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2015.1102666&lt;/ref&gt; argues that public sociology relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologist assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

Even stronger critiques come from academics who believe that the program of public sociology will unduly politicize the discipline and thus endanger the legitimacy sociology has in the public dialogue.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. [http://cooley.ad.wsu.edu/schwartj/pdf/PublicSoc.pdf "The Arrogance of Public Sociology"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  These critics argue that the project of building a reliable body of knowledge about society is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of public sociology: "To the extent that we orient our work around moral principles, we are less likely to attend to theoretical issues. The greater the extent to which we favor particular outcomes, the less able are we to design our work to actually access such outcomes. And the more ideologically oriented our objectives, the less the chance that we can recognize or assimilate contrary evidence. In other words, rather than good professional sociology being mutually interactive with public sociology, I believe that public sociology gets in the way of good professional sociology."&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;

One outspoken critic of public sociology was sociologist [[Mathieu Deflem]] of the [[University of South Carolina]], who wrote various papers against public sociology and argued that public sociology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"is neither public nor sociology. Public sociology is not a plea to make sociology more relevant to the many publics in society nor to connect sociology democratically to political activity. Of course sociologists should be public intellectuals. But they should be and can only be public intellectuals as practitioners of the science they practice, not as activists left or right. Yet public sociology instead is a quest to subsume sociology under politics, a politics of a specific kind, not in order to foster sociological activism but to narrow down the sociological discipline to activist sociology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/letter-to-editor-proper-role-of.html Deflem, Mathieu. 2004. "The Proper Role of Sociology in the World at Large" (letter to the editor), ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', October 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In opposition to public sociology, Deflem used to maintain the website, [http://www.savesociology.org/ SaveSociology.org].

==Applied sociology==

"Applied sociology" and "sociological practice" (also referred to as [[policy sociology]]) has come to refer to [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] using sociological knowledge in an applied setting. Applied sociologists work in a wide variety of settings including universities, government, and private practice, using sociological methods to help communities solve everyday problems, such as improving community policing and crime prevention, evaluating and improving drug courts, assessing the needs of [[inner city]] neighborhoods, developing the capacity of an educational system, or promoting the development of housing and related resources for aging populations.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Preface'' in Price, Jammie, Straus, Roger and Breese, Jeffrey, editors, ''In Doing Sociology. Case Studies in Sociological Practice'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7391-3395-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological practice is different from pure academic sociology in which sociologists work in an academic setting such as a university with a teaching and pure research orientation. Although there are some common origins, sociological practice is entirely distinct from [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Using Sociology: An Introduction From The Applied and Clinical Perspectives'' Third Edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2002), {{ISBN|0-7425-1662-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of universities are attempting to gear curricula toward practical sociology in this way. Clinical sociology courses give students the skills to be able to work effectively with clients, teach basic [[counseling]] skills, give knowledge that is useful for careers such as victims assisting and drug rehabilitation, and teach the student how to integrate sociological knowledge with other fields they may go into such as marriage and family therapy, and clinical social work.

As defined by the Applied Social Sciences Forum (ASSF), applied Social Science (ASS) seeks to highlight the processes of social and political transformation taking place in a particular society. It is characterized by the operational aspect of the knowledge it produces. Unlike pure academic knowledge, applied social sciences try to steer the debate towards scientific priorities of social and political reform and accompanying social transformations. From this point of view, the applied social sciences can be seen as complementary knowledge that enrich both the action and the academic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assforum.org The Applied Social Science Forum website - assforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of ASS are to deepen reflection on practical issues related to their objective, to support the major decision making in society and enable researchers to support their knowledge and enrich the range of possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelwahab Ben Hafaiedh: The Applied Social Science today - Tunisian Association of Sociology - Tunis 2001 p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The "action research" is the framework of choice for applied social sciences. Action research can be defined here as a process that involves further intervention by the researcher beyond the return of a single diagnostic assay type, or inventory.

The researcher may, in this way, have several hats within the same search:
* A role of developer issues, logical actions and issues of different actors,
* An expert who accompanies the action from his methodology and science role
* A facilitator role pilot working groups and aims, as and when the progress of its work, its analyzes to confront the realities of stakeholders power feed, 
* A mediator who brings out back and speak different stakeholders of an action system
* A role of facilitator who can help build collective courses of action relevant while remaining outside issues discussed.

The methodological tools of the SSA are:
* Qualitative approaches (different types of interviews and / or collective)
* Quantitative methods using questionnaires and / or literature searches, data processing statistics
* The analysis of practices
* Action research
* Participatory methods

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6372">'''Qualifications Frameworks in the European Higher Education Area''' ('''QF-EHEA''') are frameworks describing the higher education qualifications of countries participating in the [[Bologna Process]]. [[National Qualifications Framework]]s (NQFs) provide a mapping between higher education qualifications and an overarching framework, allowing the cross-comparison of qualifications from different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehea.info/article-details.aspx?ArticleId=65|title=Qualifications Frameworks in the EHEA|publisher=EHEA|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overarching framework was adopted in May 2005 at a meeting of education ministers of the 48 participating countries. It consists of three cycles, approximately equivalent to [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]] and [[PhD|research doctorates]] (PhD-equivalent) degrees in the Anglophone world (note that US  first professional degrees such as MD and JD are not PhD-equivalent, even though they are titled "doctorates"). A "short cycle" is also recognised within the first cycle, equivalent to British [[foundation degree]]s (US [[associate degree]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/ects/users-guide/programme-context_en.htm|title=ECTS Users' Guide|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehea.info/article-details.aspx?ArticleId=67|title=Overarching framework of qualifications of the EHEA|publisher=EHEA|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-structure-us.html|title=Structure of U.S. Education|publisher=US Department of Education|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/education/ihe/what-we-do/bologna-process-and-european-higher-education-area|title=European Higher Education Area and Bologna Process|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==QF-EHEA in Spain==
The NQF in Spain is the ''[[:es:Marco Español de Cualificaciones para la Educación Superior|Marco Español de Cualificaciones para la Educación Superior]]'' (MECES) (Spanish Framework for Higher Education Qualification).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2011-13317 Normativa oficial del estado español sobre el MECES]&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the earlier system of ''diplomado'', ''licenciado'' and ''doctor'' from 2005, with a transitional period lasting until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/links/documents/HE_in_Spain.pdf|title=HE in Spain|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapping to the EHEA framework is:

==QF-EHEA in the United Kingdom==
The NQFs linked to the QF-EHEA are the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutions in Scotland (FQHEIS). The FQHEIS was certified as being aligned with the QF-EHEA in 2006 and the FHEQ in 2008.&lt;ref name=FHEQ&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|date=November 2014|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond Clevie Carver Jr.''' (May 25, 1938 – August 2, 1988) was an American [[short-story]] writer and [[poet]]. He was in the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] 1963-64. Carver was an alcoholic, stopped drinking in 1977 with the help of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and remained sober until he died from lung cancer 11 years later. He contributed to the revitalization of the American short story during the 1980s.

==Early life, 1938 - 1958==
Carver was born in [[Clatskanie, Oregon]], a mill town on the [[Columbia River]], and grew up in [[Yakima, Washington]], the son of Ella Beatrice (née Casey) and Clevie Raymond Carver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/03/obituaries/raymond-carver-writer-and-poet-of-the-working-poor-dies-at-50.html|title=Raymond Carver, Writer and Poet Of the Working Poor, Dies at 50|last=Kellerman|first=Stewart|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a sawmill worker from [[Arkansas]], was a fisherman and heavy drinker. Carver's mother worked on and off as a waitress and a retail clerk. His brother, James Franklin Carver, was born in 1943.

Carver was educated at local schools in [[Yakima, Washington]]. In his spare time, he read mostly novels by [[Mickey Spillane]] or publications such as ''[[Sports Afield]]'' and ''[[Outdoor Life]]'', and hunted and fished with friends and family.

After graduating from [[Davis High School (Washington)|Yakima High School]] in 1956, Carver worked with his father at a sawmill in California. In June 1957, at age 19, he married 16-year-old Maryann Burk, who had just graduated from a private [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] school for girls. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December 1957. Their second child, a boy named Vance Lindsay, was born a year later. He supported the family by working as a delivery man, janitor, library assistant, and sawmill laborer, while Maryann supported the family as administrative assistant and high school English teacher, salesperson, and waitress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sklenicka, Carol|title=Raymond Carver: A Writer's Life|location= New York|publisher= Scribner|date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}

==Writing career==
Carver moved to [[Paradise, California]] with his family to be close to his mother-in-law.{{when|date=August 2018}} He became interested in writing while attending [[California State University, Chico|Chico State College]], and enrolled in a [[creative writing]] course taught by the novelist [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], then a recent doctoral graduate of the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], who became a mentor and had a major influence on Carver's life and career. In 1961, Carver's first published story, "The Furious Seasons", appeared. More florid than his later work, the story strongly bore the influence of [[William Faulkner]]. "Furious Seasons" was later used as a title for a collection of stories published by Capra Press, and is part of the collection, ''No Heroics, Please''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|title=''A Dirty Realist : NO HEROICS, PLEASE'': Uncollected Writings By Raymond Carver, (Vintage Books: $10; 239 pp.)|date=July 19, 1992|author=Reid, David | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-19/books/bk-4367_1_raymond-carver}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Call If You Need Me''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Kirkus Reviews| url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/raymond-carver/call-if-you-need-me/|title= ''CALL IF YOU NEED ME'': The Uncollected Fiction and Other Prose by Raymond Carver|editor= William L. Stull| date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carver continued his studies {{when|date=August 2018}} under the short-story writer Richard Cortez Day, like Gardner, a then recent [[Ph.D.]] alumnus of the Iowa program, at [[Humboldt State University|Humboldt State College]] in [[Arcata, California]]. He chose not to take the foreign language courses required by the English program, and received his B.A. in [[Bachelor of General Studies|general studies]] in 1963. During this period he was first published and served as editor for ''Toyon,'' the university's literary magazine, in which he published several of his own pieces under his own name as well as the pseudonym John Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toyon|date = Spring 1963|journal = Toyon|issue = volume 9 no. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his B- average, exacerbated by his penchant to forsake coursework for literary endeavors, ballasted by a sterling recommendation from Day, Carver was accepted into the Iowa Writers' Workshop on a $1,000 fellowship for the 1963–1964 academic year. Homesick for California and unable to fully acclimate to the program's [[upper middle class]] milieu, he only completed 12 credits out of the 30 required for a M.A. degree or 60 for the M.F.A. degree. Although program director [[Paul Engle]] awarded him a fellowship for a second year of study after Maryann Carver personally interceded and compared her husband's plight to [[Tennessee Williams]]' deleterious experience in the program three decades earlier, Carver decided to leave the [[University of Iowa]] at the end of the semester. According to biographer [[Carol Sklenicka]], Carver falsely claimed to have received an M.F.A. from Iowa in 1966 on later [[curricula vitae]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Maryann, who postponed completing her education to support her husband's educational and literary endeavors, eventually graduated from [[San Jose State College]] in 1970 and taught English at Los Altos High School until 1977. After completing graduate work at Stanford, she briefly enrolled in the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]'s English doctoral program when Carver taught at the institution as a visiting lecturer in 1974.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In the mid-1960s, Carver and his family resided in [[Sacramento, California]], where he briefly worked at a bookstore before taking a position as a night custodian at Mercy Hospital.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He did all of the janitorial work in the first hour and then wrote through the rest of his shift. He audited classes at what was then [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State College]], including workshops with poet [[Dennis Schmitz]]. Carver and Schmitz soon became friends, and Carver wrote and published his first book of poems, ''Near Klamath'', under Schmitz's guidance.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

1967 was a landmark year for Carver with the appearance of "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" in [[Martha Foley]]'s annual ''[[Best American Short Stories]]'' anthology and the impending publication of ''Near Klamath'' by the English Club of Sacramento State College. He briefly enrolled in the [[library science]] graduate program at the University of Iowa that summer but returned to California following the death of his father. Shortly thereafter, the Carvers relocated to [[Palo Alto, California]], so he could take his first [[white-collar job]] at [[Science Research Associates]] (a subsidiary of [[IBM]] in nearby [[Menlo Park, California]]), where he worked intermittently as a textbook editor and public relations director through 1970.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Following a 1968 sojourn to [[Israel]], the Carvers relocated to [[San Jose, California]]; as Maryann finished her undergraduate degree, he continued his graduate studies in library science at San Jose State through the end of 1969 before failing once again to take a degree. Nevertheless, he established vital literary connections with [[Gordon Lish]] who worked across the street from Carver as director of linguistic research at Behavioral Research Laboratories and the poet/publisher [[George Hitchcock (poet)|George Hitchcock]] during this period.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

After the publication of "Neighbors" in the June 1971 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' at the instigation of Lish by now ensconced as the magazine's fiction editor, Carver began to teach at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] at the behest of provost James B. Hall, an Iowa alumnus and early mentor to [[Ken Kesey]] at the [[University of Oregon]], commuting from his new home in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. Following a succession of failed applications, he received a $4,000 [[Stegner Fellowship]] to study in the prestigious non-degree graduate creative writing program at [[Stanford University]] during the 1972–1973 term, where he cultivated friendships with Kesey-era luminaries [[Ed McClanahan]] and [[Gurney Norman]] in addition to contemporaneous fellows [[Chuck Kinder]], Max Crawford, and [[William Kittredge]]. The fellowship enabled the Carvers to buy a house in [[Cupertino, California]]. He took on another teaching job at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] that year and briefly rented a pied-à-terre in the city precipitated by his initiation of an extramarital affair with Diane Cecily, a [[University of Montana]] administrator and mutual friend of Kittredge, who would subsequently marry Kinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During his years of working at miscellaneous jobs, rearing children, and trying to write, Carver started [[alcohol abuse|abusing alcohol]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By his own admission, he gave up writing and took to full-time drinking. In the fall semester of 1973, Carver was a visiting lecturer in the Iowa Writers' Workshop with [[John Cheever]], but Carver stated that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing. With the assistance of Kinder and Kittredge, he attempted to simultaneously commute to Berkeley and maintain his lectureship at Santa Cruz; after missing all but a handful of classes due to the inherent logistical hurdles of this arrangement and various alcohol-related illnesses, Hall gently enjoined Carver to resign his position. The next year, after leaving Iowa City, Carver went to a treatment center to attempt to overcome his [[alcoholism]], but continued drinking for another three years.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

His first short story collection, ''[[Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?]]'', was published in 1976. The collection itself was shortlisted for the [[National Book Award]], though it sold fewer than 5,000 copies that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nbafictionfinalists.squarespace.com/blog/2012/6/9/1977.html|title=1977 - All Exhibition Pages - National Book Award Fiction Finalists|website=nbafictionfinalists.squarespace.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==

===Decline of first marriage===
The following excerpt from Scott Driscoll's review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Seattle pi|title=A life spent in love with Raymond Carver is captured in memoir's intimate moments|author= SCOTT DRISCOLL, SPECIAL TO THE P-I|date= July 20, 2006|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/books/article/A-life-spent-in-love-with-Raymond-Carver-is-1209433.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Maryann Burk Carver's 2006 memoir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Carver | first =Maryann Burk| title =What It Used to Be Like; A Portrait of My Marriage to Raymond Carver | publisher =St. Martin's Press | year =2006 | isbn = 0-312-33258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the decline of Maryann's and Raymond's marriage.

{{quote|The fall began with Ray's trip to Missoula, Mont., in '72 to fish with friend and literary helpmate Bill Kittredge. That summer Ray fell in love with Diane Cecily, an editor at the University of Montana, whom he met at Kittredge's birthday party. "That's when the serious drinking began. It broke my heart and hurt the children. It changed everything."

"By fall of '74", writes Carver, "he was more dead than alive. I had to drop out of the Ph.D. program so I could get him cleaned up and drive him to his classes". Over the next several years, Maryann's husband physically abused her. Friends urged her to leave Raymond.

"But I couldn't. I really wanted to hang in there for the long haul. I thought I could outlast the drinking. I'd do anything it took. I loved Ray, first, last and always."

Carver describes, without a trace of rancor, what finally put her over the edge. In the fall of '78, with a new teaching position at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]], Ray started seeing Tess Gallagher, a writer from [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], who would become his muse and wife near the end of his life. "It was like a contretemps. He tried to call me to talk about where we were. I missed the calls. He knew he was about to invite Tess to Thanksgiving." So he wrote a letter instead.

"I thought, I've gone through all those years fighting to keep it all balanced. Here it was, coming at me again, the same thing. I had to get on with my own life. But I never fell out of love with him."}}

After being hospitalized three times between June 1976 and February or March 1977, Carver began his "second life" and stopped drinking on June 2, 1977, with the help of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While he continued to regularly smoke [[marijuana]] and later experimented with [[cocaine]] at the behest of [[Jay McInerney]] during a 1980 visit to [[New York City]], Carver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 had he not overcome his drinking.&lt;ref name= "ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = ''Short Cuts'' | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = October 22, 1993 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/classifieds?category=REVIEWS01&amp;TITLESearch=Short%20Cuts&amp;ToDate=20101231 | accessdate = 2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage===
In November 1977 Carver met the poet [[Tess Gallagher]] at a writers' conference in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Beginning in January 1979, Carver and Gallagher lived together in [[El Paso, Texas]], in a borrowed cabin near [[Port Angeles, Washington]], and in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. 
In 1980, the two moved to [[Syracuse, New York]], where Gallagher had been appointed the coordinator of the creative writing program at [[Syracuse University]]; Carver taught as a professor in the English department. He and Gallagher jointly purchased a house in Syracuse, at 832 Maryland Avenue. In ensuing years, the house became so popular that the couple had to hang a sign outside that read "Writers At Work" in order to be left alone. 
In 1982, he and his first wife, Maryann, were divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What It Used To Be Like: A Portrait of My Marriage to Raymond Carver|publisher=St. Martin's Press |date=July 11, 2006|author=Carver, Maryann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, six weeks prior to his death, Carver and Gallagher married in [[Reno, Nevada]].

===Death===
On August 2, 1988, Carver died in [[Port Angeles, Washington]], from [[lung cancer]] at the age of 50. In the same year, he was inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
He is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Port Angeles, Washington. The inscription on his tombstone reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
LATE FRAGMENT
And did you get what
you wanted from this life, even so?
I did.
And what did you want?
To call myself beloved, to feel myself
beloved on the earth.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His poem "Gravy" is also inscribed.

As Carver's will directed, Tess Gallagher assumed the management of his [[literary estate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Awards and memorials==
[[File:Carvermemorial.jpg|thumb|Raymond Carver Memorial in Clatskanie, Oregon]]
Carver was nominated for the National Book Award and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] for his third major-press collection, ''Cathedral'' (1984), the volume generally perceived as his best. Included in the collection are the award-winning stories "A Small, Good Thing", and "Where I'm Calling From". [[John Updike]] selected the latter for inclusion in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' For his part, Carver perceived ''Cathedral'' as a watershed in his career for its shift toward a more optimistic and confidently poetic style amid the diminution of Lish's literary influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sun.iwu.edu/~jplath/carver.html |title=Prose as Architecture: Two Interviews with Raymond Carver |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carver won five O. Henry Awards with "Are These Actual Miles" (originally titled "What Is It?") (1972), "Put Yourself in My Shoes" (1974), "Are You A Doctor?" (1975), "A Small, Good Thing" (1983), and "Errand" (1988).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Carver's birth town of Clatskanie, Oregon, a memorial park and statue are at the corner of Lillich and Nehalem Streets, across from the library. A block away is the building where Carver was born.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Legacy and posthumous publications==
In December 2006, Gallagher published an essay in ''[[The Sun (magazine)|The Sun magazine]]'', titled "Instead of Dying", about alcoholism and Carver's having maintained his sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Sun Magazine|author=Tess Gallagher|issue=372|title=Instead of Dying|date=December 2006|url=http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is an adaptation of a talk she initially delivered at the Welsh Academy's Academi Intoxication Conference in 2006. The first lines read: "Instead of dying from alcohol, Raymond Carver chose to live. I would meet him five months after this choice, so I never knew the Ray who drank, except by report and through the characters and actions of his stories and poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.literaturewales.org/lectures/i/124022/|publisher=Academi Intoxication Conference|title=Instead of Dying|author=Tess Gallagher by Tim Crosby|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222233213/http://www.literaturewales.org/lectures/i/124022/|archivedate=2014-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck Kinder's ''Honeymooners: A Cautionary Tale'' (2001) is a [[roman à clef]] about his friendship with Carver in the 1970s. Carver's high school sweetheart&lt;ref name="Wiegand, David Wiegand"&gt;{{cite news|author=Wiegand, David| title=Serendipitous stay led writer to Raymond Carver| work=San Francisco Chronicle| date= December 19, 2009| url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Serendipitous-stay-led-writer-to-Raymond-Carver-3278150.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first wife, Maryann Burk Carver, wrote a memoir of her years with Carver, ''What it Used to be Like: A Portrait of My Marriage to Raymond Carver'' (2006).

In 2009, ''The New York Times Book Review'' and ''San Francisco Chronicle'' named Carol Sklenicka's unauthorized biography, ''Raymond Carver: A Writer's Life'' (2009), published by Scribner, one of the Best Ten Books of that year;&lt;ref name="Wiegand, David Wiegand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=King, Steven| title=Raymond Carver's Life and Stories| work=The New York Times|date= Nov 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' deemed it: "exhaustively researched and definitive biography". Carver's widow, Tess Gallagher, refused to engage with Sklenicka.&lt;ref name="Wiegand, David"&gt;{{cite news|author=Wiegand, David | title=Serendipitous stay led writer to Raymond Carver| work=San Francisco Chronicle| date= December 19, 2009| url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Serendipitous-stay-led-writer-to-Raymond-Carver-3278150.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His final (incomplete) collection of seven stories, titled ''Elephant'' in Britain (included in "Where I'm Calling From") was composed in the five years before his death. The nature of these stories, especially "Errand", have led to some speculation that Carver was preparing to write a novel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Only one piece of this work has survived – the fragment "The Augustine Notebooks", first printed in ''No Heroics, Please''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Tess Gallagher fought with Knopf for permission to republish the stories in ''[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]'' as they were originally written by Carver, as opposed to the heavily edited and altered versions that appeared in 1981 under the editorship of Gordon Lish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/books/17carver.html?ex=1193198400&amp;en=ef2288f85b950c2d&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1| title= The Real Carver: Expansive or Minimal?| work=New York Times | date=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For further details of the extent of the original editing, see Blake Morrison, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/raymond-carver-beginners-blake-morrison raymond-carver-beginners-blake-morrison] The Guardian 2009/oct/17 and  James Ley, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/carved-up-or-kindly-cut/story-e6frg8nf-1225835733233 'Carved up, or kindly cut?'] The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2009 the book, entitled ''[[Beginners (Raymond Carver)|Beginners]]'',&lt;ref&gt;and re-edited by William Stull and Maureen Carroll&lt;/ref&gt; was released in hardback in Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carver, James|title=Beginners|location= London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by its publication in the [[Library of America]] edition which collected all of Carver's short fiction in a single volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=307|title=Raymond Carver: Collected Stories (The Library of America)|work=loa.org|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary characteristics==
Carver's career was dedicated to short stories and poetry. He described himself as "inclined toward brevity and intensity" and "hooked on writing short stories" (in the foreword of ''[[Where I'm Calling From]]'', a collection published in 1988 and a recipient of an honorable mention in the 2006 ''[[New York Times]]'' article citing the best works of fiction of the previous 25 years). Another stated reason for his brevity was "that the story [or poem] can be written and read in one sitting." This was not simply a preference but, particularly at the beginning of his career, a practical consideration as he juggled writing with work. His subject matter was often focused on [[blue-collar]] experience, and was clearly reflective of his own life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Characteristics of [[Minimalism#Literary minimalism|minimalism]] are generally seen as one of the hallmarks of Carver's work, although, as reviewer [[David Wiegand]] notes:&lt;ref name="Wiegand, David"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Carver never thought of himself as a minimalist or in any category, for that matter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He rejected categories generally," Sklenicka says. "I don't think he had an abstract mind at all. He just wasn't built that way, which is why he's so good at picking the right details that will stand for many things."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carver's editor at ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', [[Gordon Lish]], was instrumental in shaping his prose in this direction – where his earlier tutor John Gardner had advised Carver to use fifteen words instead of twenty-five, Lish instructed Carver to use five in place of fifteen. Objecting to the "surgical amputation and transplantation" of Lish's heavy editing, Carver eventually broke with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donswaim.com/nytimes.carverchronicles.html The Carver Chronicles] For more on Lish's editing of Carver at ''Esquire'', see Carol Polsgrove, ''It Wasn't Pretty, Folks, But Didn't We Have Fun? Esquire in the Sixties (1995), pp. 241–243.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Carver also submitted poetry to [[James Dickey]], then poetry editor of ''Esquire''.

Carver's style has also been described as [[dirty realism]], which connected him with a group of writers in the 1970s and 1980s that included [[Richard Ford]] and [[Tobias Wolff]] with both of whom Carver was closely acquainted, as well as others such as [[Ann Beattie]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], and [[Jayne Anne Phillips]]. With the exception of Beattie, who wrote about upper-middle-class people, these were writers who focused on sadness and loss in the everyday lives of ordinary people—often lower-middle class or isolated and marginalized people.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In his essay "On Influence", Carver states that, while he was an admirer of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s fiction, he never saw him as an influence, citing instead the work of [[Lawrence Durrell]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''Socioscientific Issues (SSI)''' are controversial social issues which relate to science.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt; They are ill-structured, open-ended problems which have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D. (2004). Informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: A critical review of research. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 513-536&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI are utilized in [[science education]] in order to promote [[scientific literacy]], which emphasizes the ability to apply scientific and moral reasoning to real-world situations.  Some examples of SSI include issues such as [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], [[animal testing]] for medical purposes, oil drilling in national parks, and "fat taxes" on "unhealthy" foods, among many others.  Research studies have shown SSI to be effective at increasing students' understanding of science in various contexts, [[Argumentation theory|argumentation skills]], [[empathy]], and [[Moral philosophy|moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., &amp; Sadler, T. D. (2008). The role of moral reasoning in argumentation: Conscience, character and care. In S. Erduran &amp; M. Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre (Eds.), Argumentation in science education: Perspectives from classroom-based research (pp. 201-216). The Netherlands: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals of SSI ==
Supporters of SSI argue that it can:
* 1) Cultivate a scientifically literate citizens who are able to apply evidence-based scientific content knowledge to real-world socioscientific scenarios;
* 2) Foster a collective [[social conscience]] whereby students consistently reflect upon the formation and implications of their own reasoning;
* 3) Encourage [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] skills that are essential for thinking and reasoning processes and mirror the types of discourse utilized in real-world scientific deliberations;
* 4) Promote [[critical thinking]] skills, such as analysis, inference, explanation,
evaluation, interpretation, and self-regulation&lt;ref&gt;Facione, P. A. (2007). Critical thinking: What it is and why it counts (2007 update). Millbrae, CA: Insight Assessment/California Academic Press LLC. Retrieved April 28, 2009, from www.insightassessment.com/pdf_files/what&amp;why2006. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Science educators often refer to all of these aspects together as,"functional scientific literacy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of SSI ==

=== Scientific Literacy - Vision I and II ===
Scientific literacy has been defined by two competing visions. A Vision I approach to scientific literacy is characterized by content-driven, decontextualized science knowledge.  A Vision II approach to scientific literacy is a context-driven, student-centered approach which seeks to prepare students for informed [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.A. (2007). Scientific literacy / science literacy. In S.K. Abell &amp; N.G. Lederman (Eds.), Handbook of research on science education (pp. 729-780). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSI framework follows a Vision II approach as it is believed to provide an opportunity for contextualized learning of science content as well as an opportunity for moral development.

=== SSI Distinguished from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) ===
SSI is conceptually related to [[Science, technology and society|Science, Technology, and Society]] (STS) education.  However, while both approaches connect science to societal issues, SSI is distinguished from STS because of its emphasis on the development of character and virtue as well as content knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidler|first=D.|author2=Sadler, T.D. |author3=Simmons, M.L. |author4=Howes, E.V. |title=Beyond STS: A Research-Based|journal=Science Education|year=2005|volume=89|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1002/sce.20048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSI and Moral Reasoning ==
Research suggests that SSI creates [[cognitive dissonance]] by compelling students to consider claims that may be at odds with their own beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Nichols, B.H. (2009). Socioscientific Issues: Theory and Practice. Journal of Elementary Science Education, 21, 2, 49-58&lt;/ref&gt; Dissonance of this nature is believed by some to advance [[moral reasoning]] by ‘empowering students to consider how science based issues and the decisions made concerning them reflect, in part, the moral principles and qualities of [[virtue]] that encompass their own lives, as well as the physical and social world around them.'&lt;ref&gt;
Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Supporting SSI ==
SSI education has been [[empirically]] investigated and linked to particular outcomes including:
• Promoting developmental changes in reflective judgment;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D., Sadler, T., Applebaum, S., &amp; Callahan, B. (2009). Advancing reflective
judgment through socioscientific issues. Journal of Research in Science Teaching,
46, 74–101.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Moving students to more informed views of the [[nature of science]];&lt;ref&gt;Kolstø, S.D. (2001). Scientific literacy for citizenship: Tools for dealing with the science
dimension of controversial socioscientific issues. Science Education, 85, 291–310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L., Walker, K.A., Ackett, W.A., &amp; Simmons, M.L. (2002). Tangled up in views:
Beliefs in the nature of science and responses to socioscientific dilemmas. Science Education, 86,
343–367.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Increasing moral sensitivity and [[empathy]];&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, S., Zeidler, D., &amp; Sadler, T. (2009). Moral sensitivity in the context of socioscientific
issues in high school science students. International Journal of Science
Education, 31, 279–296.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Increasing conceptual understanding of scientific content;&lt;ref&gt;
Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;• Increase students’ ability to transfer concepts and scaffold ideas;
• Revealing and reconstructing alternative perceptions of science;&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Facilitating [[moral reasoning]];&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt;
• Improve [[argumentation]] skills;&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Donnelly, L. A. (2006). Socioscientific argumentation: The effects of content knowledge and
morality. International Journal of Science Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Promote understanding of eco-justice and [[environmental awareness]];&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, M.P. &amp; Zeidler, D.L. (2010). Moral-ethical character and science education:
Ecojustice ethics through socioscientific issues (SSI). In D. Tippins, M., Mueller,
M., van Eijck &amp; Adams, J. (Eds), Cultural studies and environmentalism: The
confluence of ecojustice, place-based (science) education, and indigenous
knowledge systems (pp 105-128). New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and
• Engage students’ interest in the [[Inquiry-based science|inquiry of science]].

More recently, SSI research has been focused on cross-cultural comparisons and research has reflected international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.; Chang, H., Choi, K., Kim, S., Zeidler, D.L. (2011). "Developing Character and Values for Global Citizens: Analysis of pre-service science". International Journal of Science Education: 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized by some that more advanced stages of epistemological reasoning allows individuals to apply a kind of socioscientific reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt; akin to scientific habits of mind. SSR is a theoretical construct that entails the ability to tap key traits while negotiating SSI. These include [[skepticism]], [[complexity]], [[multiple perspective]] and [[inquiry]].

== SSI in the Classroom ==

Teachers utilize SSI to foster understanding of science content and consequences involved in everyday scientific issues.  For example, in a study of [[ecology]], an elementary class might consider whether pesticides confer more benefit or harm to our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, C., &amp; Davis, E. A. (2008a). Exploring preservice elementary teachers’ critique and adaptation of science curriculum materials in respect to socioscientific issues. Science and Education, 17(8–9),829–854.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis would require students to research the interractions between organisms in food webs and food chains, as well as the human impacts of pesticides. Students could make [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based decisions]] and discuss them through various means including whole-class discussions, [[debates]], [[discussion boards|online discussion boards]], etc... Similarly, older grades might consider issues such as whether [[genetic engineering]] should be used to treat genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2004). Negotiating gene therapy controversies. The
American Biology Teacher, 66, 428–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of analysis would require extensive study of genetics and modern genetic engineering techniques, as well as the ethical issues involved in [[personal freedom]]s, religious prohibitions on intervention, and so on.  Advocates suggest that, through evidence-based [[discourse]], students learn to formulate their own informed decisions and understand those whose views differ from themselves.  An essential aspect of the implementation of SSI is that the teacher is not promoting any particular belief; rather, the teacher's role is to promote evidence-based critical thinking and argumentation.

'''Strong Women Strong Girls''' (SWSG) is a mentoring organization for girls in grades 3-5 and with the goal of helping them to develop skills for lifelong success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swsg.org/about_mission.htm Strong Women Strong Girls mission statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
College women, who are trained as mentors, engage small groups of participating girls during after school hours. Each week the girls and their mentors utilize a research-based curriculum that incorporates the study of contemporary and historic female role models, skill-building activities, and strong relationships with mentors and peers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swsg.org Strong Women Strong Girls Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Lindsay Hyde]] began Strong Women Strong Girls in Miami, Florida during her senior year of high school. In 2000 she left for college and launched the program as a student group at Harvard University. The mentoring began with six college-age women serving as mentors in two elementary schools.

The program quickly expanded throughout the greater Boston, MA area. In 2004, SWSG was incorporated as a non-profit organization and named [[Lindsay Hyde]] as the organization’s executive director. In 2006, SWSG launched programming in its first expansion community of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2009, Strong Women Strong Girls returned to where it started, launching its second expansion site in Miami, Florida. Currently Strong Women, Strong Girls is partnered with 12 universities and college and engages over 500 college mentors in mentoring almost 1,350 elementary school girls at 90 different elementary school and community center partner sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swsg.org Strong Women Strong Girls Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, SWSG announced a renewed investment focusing on their existing communities of Pittsburgh and Boston.

==Boston==
Currently, SWSG engages close to 300 mentors from six university and college partners: Boston College, Harvard University, Northeastern University, Simmons College,UMass Boston and Tufts University. They mentor almost 800 girls at 58 different sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/centers/neighborhood/opportunities/strongwomen.html Boston College and SWSG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communityservice.harvard.edu/programs/strong-women-strong-girls Harvard and SWSG]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pittsburgh==
Currently, SWSG is partnered with six universities and colleges in Pittsburgh: Carlow University, Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, Point Park University, Robert Morris University and the University of Pittsburgh. Two-hundred and twenty mentors mentor over 600 girls at 32 different elementary school and community center partner sites.

==Miami==
SWSG engaged over 30 college women from two universities and colleges, Florida International University and Miami Dade College, as mentors in Miami. They mentored 150 girls at 13 different sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swsg.org/pdfs/SWSGAnnualReport08-09.pdf Strong Women Strong Girls Year End Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jump Into Spring==
Every year, Strong Women Strong Girls hosts a fundraiser and year end celebration called Jump Into Spring. Jump into Spring brings together girls, community partners, and supports from around from all the different sites to jump rope at the same time. The events purpose is three-fold:
*Programmatic: The event will provide girls, mentors and staff a like a strong and powerful closing to the program year. Additionally, by promoting physical fitness, the day is aligned with Strong Women, Strong Girls’ work of supporting healthy development of girls.
*Awareness Raising:  The first year, the event was covered in The Boston Herald and on NECN. Boston had John Kerry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kerry.senate.gov/cfm/record.cfm?id=296057 Senator John Kerry's Office]&lt;/ref&gt; speak and the Boston Breakers appear. Pittsburgh had the Steelers up on stage jumping in pink SWSG shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io2.steelers.com/article/104625/ Pittsburgh Steelers and Jump Into Spring]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fundraising: SWSG reaches out to businesses and individuals to sponsor the entire event or individual team. All proceeds benefit Strong Women, Strong Girls as a national organization.

In 2009, Boston and Pittsburgh hosted Jump Into Spring events. Each site had over 300 girls, community members, and supporters in attendance. As a result, the events raised over $100,000 in in-kind and donation support. The next Jump Into Spring will be on April 10, 2010 in all three cities SWSG is currently in. The event will be simulated between all three cities thus having all the girls jumping rope at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swsg.org/pdfs/SWSGAnnualReport08-09.pdf Strong Women Strong Girls Year End Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swsg.org/jumpintospring.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19020">The '''[[undergraduate education]] at the [[University of Oxford]]''' in [[England]] involves weekly tutorials at the colleges and halls, supported by classes, lectures and laboratory work provided by university faculties and departments.

==Admission==
Historically, it was common for boys to become members of the university between the ages of 14 and 19.&lt;ref&gt;John Hooper Harvey, ''Mediaeval craftsmen'' (Batsford, 1975), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as at other UK universities, the majority of students commence undergraduate courses aged 18, though 17 or 19 is common. However, there are no limits on the age of those admitted (except for at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Harris Manchester College]] which caters only for students aged 21 or over). Much younger people are still occasionally given places if they are of the required standard, for example [[Ruth Lawrence]] matriculated age 12 in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Child prodigy Ruth tells why she's all tied up in knots |author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/child-prodigy-ruth-tells-why-shes-all-tied-up-in-knots-1273133.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DFgLrke4 |archivedate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Independent |date=16 March 1997 |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NB: not clear whether she was 13 when starting at Oxford, or just 13 when passing test --&gt;

In common with most British universities, prospective students apply through the [[UCAS]] application system; but, prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and [[University of Cambridge]] applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCAS Students: Important dates for your diary |quote=15 October 2009 Last date for receipt of applications to Oxford University, University of Cambridge and courses in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science or veterinary medicine. |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/importantdates |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for [[organ scholar|Organ Scholarships]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.ox.ac.uk/assets/files/Chor_Org_Downloads/OrgAwards2009.pdf |quote=It is possible for a candidate to enter the comparable competition at Cambridge which is scheduled at the same time of year. |title=Organ Awards Information for Prospective Candidates |publisher=Faculty of Music, University of Oxford |accessdate=22 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102422/http://www.music.ox.ac.uk/assets/files/Chor_Org_Downloads/OrgAwards2009.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCAS Students FAQs: Oxford or Cambridge |quote=Is it possible to apply to both Oxford University and the University of Cambridge? |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/applying/faqs/eligibility/faq1 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001013817/http://www.ucas.com/students/applying/faqs/eligibility/faq1 |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply, with "contextual data" (factors that may have influenced prior exam performance) taken into account during the admission procedure. The university believes that there are many potential students from less well-off backgrounds whom the university cannot admit simply because they do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7939230.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; More state pupils head to Oxford |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the University regardless of their college preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How do I choose a college? – Will I be interviewed only at my chosen college?|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/colleges/how_do_i_choose_a_college/index.html |publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results; school references; and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.

In 2007, the colleges, faculties and departments published a "common framework" outlining the principles and procedures they observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Common Framework for colleges and faculties and departments |url=http://www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/news/common_framework.shtml |publisher=Undergraduate Admissions Office, University of Oxford |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offers are sent out shortly before Christmas (exceptionally, in early January for the 2012-13 admissions round), with an offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receive offers from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make "open offers" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until [[A Level]] results day in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open Offer Scheme |url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=462 |publisher=Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open Offer Scheme |url=http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduates/faqs/faq-admissions |publisher=Department of Physics, University of Oxford |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
[[File:Oxford Matriculation 2003.jpg|right|thumb|The matriculation ceremony, at which new students officially become members of the university, takes place in Michaelmas Term.]]
The University states that its admissions policies avoid bias against candidates of certain socioeconomic or educational backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Working with Schools and Colleges"&gt;[http://www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/liaison/ Working with Schools and Colleges], University of Oxford Gazette, 2006. Retrieved 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fairness of Oxford admissions has attracted public controversy through episodes such as the [[Laura Spence Affair]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Is Oxbridge elitist? |publisher=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/764767.stm |date=31 May 2000 |accessdate=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining places at Oxford and Cambridge remains a central focus for many private and selective state schools — much more so than most state schools — and the fact that the social make-up of undergraduates at the university differs substantially from the social make-up of society at large remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Should Oxford discriminate in favour of state school students? |work=Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/yourview/1524922/Should-Oxford-discriminate-in-favour-of-state-school-students.html |date=27 July 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the university refined its admissions procedure to take into account the academic performance of its applicants' schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Oxford digs deeper to seek out the best students |work=Observer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/22/highereducation.accesstouniversity |date=22 July 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2007 | location=London | first=Anushka | last=Asthana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertford was one of the first colleges to encourage applicants from state schools through the Hertford Scheme.]]
Students who apply from [[state school]]s and colleges have an acceptance rate broadly comparable to those from independent schools (19% and 24% of applicants accepted respectively, 2010).&lt;ref name="Admissions Statistics 2010"&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/document.rm?id=1924 Undergraduate Admissions Statistics: 2010 entry]. Retrieved 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of applications come from the state sector,&lt;ref name="Admissions Statistics 2010"/&gt; and the University of Oxford funds many initiatives to attract applicants from this sector, including the UNIQ Summer Schools, Oxford Young Ambassadors, Target Schools, and the FE Access Initiative.&lt;ref name="Working with Schools and Colleges"/&gt; Regarding the UNIQ Summer School, of all the UNIQ students who went on to make applications in autumn 2010 to enter the university in 2011/12, 39 per cent ended up with places. The overall success rate for Oxford applicants is around 20 per cent. Most colleges also run their own access schemes and initiatives.

The Oxford Admissions Study was a research project set up to investigate access issues, in which data were collected on 2,000 students who applied to the university in 2002, including exam results from the universities they went on to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onsir.ox.ac.uk/index.php/research/55-projects/112-oxford-admissions-study.html |title=The Oxford Admissions Study |doi=10.1080/01411920903165611 |publisher=Onsir.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of reports were published based on these data. It was found that, if anything, admissions tutors treat applicants from state schools more favourably than applicants from private schools with the same attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ora.ouls.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0e9cf555-a921-4134-baf4-ce7114795f36 |title=ORA Thesis: "Challenges to meritocracy?

Contrastingly, participation in cultural activities such as visiting museums, art galleries, classical concerts, and ballet made no difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/43/4/648.abstract |title=Elite Higher Education Admissions in the Arts and Sciences: Is Cultural Capital the Key? |author=Amma Zimdars; Alice Sullivan; [[Anthony Heath]] |publisher=soc.sagepub.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veiled accusations of racism regarding the 2009 intake were dismissed on the grounds that ethnic minority applicants apply disproportionately more to the most competitive courses, and that black candidates had lower A-level scores nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wallace|first=David|work=The Guardian|title=Letters: Our education system's great shame|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/14/education-shame-oxbridge-schools-race|date=14 December 2010|accessdate=6 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further analysis of entrance figures for 2010 and 2011 by ''The Guardian'' reported what was termed an "institutional bias" in favour of white candidates; ethnic minority candidates had significantly lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white candidates. In medicine, for instance, ethnic minority applicants who went on to score three A* grades at A level were almost half as likely to gain admission as white applicants with similar grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Kurien |first1= Parel |last2= Ball |first2= James |date= 26 February 2013 |title= Oxford University accused of bias against ethnic minority applicants |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/feb/26/oxford-university-ethnic-minority-applicants |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 26 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and learning==
Undergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week’s work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). Students usually have one or two tutorials a week, and can be taught by academics at any other college—not just their own—as expertise and personnel require. These tutorials are complemented by lectures, classes and seminars, which are organised on a departmental basis. Graduate students undertaking taught degrees are usually instructed through classes and seminars, though there is more focus upon individual research.

The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a first degree. The first set of examinations, called either Honour Moderations ("Mods" and "Honour Mods") or Preliminary Examinations ("Prelims"), are usually held at the end of the first year (after two terms for those studying [[Bachelor of Laws|Law]]; [[Bachelor of Theology|Theology]]; Philosophy and Theology; Experimental Psychology; or [[Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology]] or after five terms in the case of [[Classics]]). The second set of examinations, the Final Honour School ("Finals"), is held at the end of the undergraduate course (for humanities and most social sciences) or at the end of each successive year of the course after the first (most mathematical, physical and life sciences, and some social sciences). Successful candidates receive [[First-Class Honours|first-]], [[Upper second-class honours|upper]] or [[Lower second-class honours|lower second-]], or [[Third-class honours|third-class]] honours, or simply a "pass" without honours, based on their performance in Finals. An upper second is the most usual result, and a first is often prerequisite for graduate study. A "[[double first]]" reflects first-class results in both Honour Moderations and Finals.

As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after seven years from matriculation (formal induction of students into the university) and without additional study, to purchase for a nominal fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to an "MA" or [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]]. All MAs were members of [[Convocation#University use|Convocation]]; and, until 1913, all resident members of Convocation were members of [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/enquiries/congandconvthree.html |title=Oxford University Archives: A history of Congregation and Convocation, 3. Nineteenth century reform |publisher=Oxford University Archives |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAs, as members of Convocation, elected the [[Chancellor]] and [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]], but recently Convocation has been widened to consist of all graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/enquiries/congandconvfive.html |title=Oxford University Archives: A history of Congregation and Convocation, 5.

The 2000 reforms |publisher=Oxford University Archives |date=1 October 2000 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight week [[Academic term|terms]]: [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas Term]], [[Hilary term|Hilary Term]] and [[Trinity term|Trinity Term]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Regulations on the number and length of terms | work=University of Oxford | url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/03-00_REGULATIONS_ON_THE_NUMBER_AND_LENGTH_OF_TERMS.shtml | accessdate=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (These are officially known as 'Full Term', 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as "first week", the last as "eighth week" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example "-1st week" and "0th week" precede term). Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Academic Experience of Students in English Universities (2007 report) |publisher=Higher Education Policy Institute |last=Sastry |first=Tom |last2=Bekhradnia |first2=Bahram |date=25 September 2007 |pages=footnote 14 |accessdate=4 November 2007 |quote=Even within Russell Group institutions, it is remarkable how consistently Oxford and Cambridge appear to require more effort of their students than other universities.

However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).

'''Vladimir Michaelovich Miklyukov''' ({{lang-ru|Миклюков, Владимир Михайлович}}, also spelled Miklioukov or Mikljukov) (8 January 1944 &amp;ndash; October 2013) was a [[Russia]]n educator in [[mathematics]], and head of the [[Superslow Process]] workgroup based at [[Volgograd State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uchimsya.info/announc.php Announcements of the workgroup "Superslow Processes"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- I failed to find any official evidence that there is a "laboratory", only "seminar" --&gt;

==Biography==
In 1970, as a student of [[:ru:Суворов, Георгий Дмитриевич|Georgy D. Suvorov]] at [[Donetsk National University]], he defended his [[Thesis or dissertation|Ph.D. thesis]] ''Theory of Quasiconformal Mappings in Space''.&lt;ref name="gen" /&gt; In 1981 Miklyukov and his family moved to [[Volgograd]]. He was transferred to the newly built [[Volgograd State University]] where he became chairman of the Department of [[Mathematical Analysis]] and [[Complex analysis|Theory of Functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mf.volsu.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=28|title=Faculty of Mathematics (Past And Present)...|publisher=Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Volgograd State University|language=Russian}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His scientific research focused on geometrical analysis. At the same time, he was studying zero [[mean curvature]] surfaces in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] and [[pseudo-Euclidean space]]s, nonlinear elliptic type [[partial differential equations]] and [[quasiregular map]]pings of [[Riemannian manifold]]s. The main results of that work were related to the following groups of questions:
*The external geometrical structure of zero mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean and pseudo-euclidean spaces; spacelike tubes and bands of zero mean curvature, their stability and instability with respect to small deformations, their life-time, branches, connections between branch points and [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] characteristics of surfaces;
*Phragmén-Lindelöf type theorems for differential forms; [[Lars Ahlfors|Ahlfors]] type theorems for differential forms with finite or infinite number of different asymptotic tracts; generalizations of Wiman theorem of forms, applications to quasiregular mappings on manifolds; applications of isoperimetric methods to the [[Phragmén–Lindelöf principle]] for quasiregular mappings on manifolds.

From 1998-2000 Miklyukov was a visiting professor at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=127|issue=9|date=September 1999|pages=2745–2754|title=Hardy's Inequality for W0 1,p-Functions on Riemannian Manifolds | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |first= Vladimir|last= Miklyukov|first2=Matti|last2=Vuorinen|jstor=119576|mr=1600117|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-99-04849-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he concentrated on studying of the mathematical theory of [[superslow process]]es and [[differential forms]] in micro- and nanoflows, and founded the Laboratory of Superslow Processes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In 2009 Miklyukov was named a [[Honorary titles of the Russian Federation|Distinguished Scientist of Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="decr" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13197">'''William David "Bill" Winn''' (1945–2006&lt;ref&gt;Norbert M. Seel (2012). ''Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning.'' p.&amp;nbsp;3035&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American educational psychologist, and professor at the [[University of Washington]] College of Education, known for his work on how people learn from [[diagrams]], and on how [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] theories of learning can help instructional designers select effective teaching strategies.

== Biography ==
Specializing first in [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] languages and [[comparative literature]], Winn earned a BA and MA from [[Oxford University]] and an MA from [[Indiana University]]. He earned a PhD from Indiana University (1972) in Instructional Systems Technology (minor educational psychology) for research on instructional message design. His doctoral dissertation was on the ''Similarity of Hierarchically Organized Pairs of Pictures and Words as Reported by Field-Dependent and Field-Independent High-School Seniors''.

In 1972 Winn started his academic career as assistant professor in the Department of Pedagogy, Faculty of Education, at the  [[Université de Sherbrooke]]. From 1974 to 1985, he was the academic coordinator of the Learning Technology Unit at the [[University of Calgary]]. Eventually,{{When|date=October 2015}} Winn was appointed professor at the [[University of Washington]] College of Education where he held appointments in curriculum and instruction, and cognitive studies. He was also director of the Learning Center at the [[HITLab|Human Interface Technology Lab]] (HITLab), and adjunct professor in the College of Engineering, and the Music department.

Winn was the editor of ''Educational Communication and Technology Journal'', and served on the editorial review boards of many other journals in the fields of educational psychology and [[educational technology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Work ==
Winn's areas of teaching and research included [[instructional theory]], design of [[computer-based learning]], instructional effects of [[illustrations]], theories of [[visual perception]] applied to instructional materials design, computer [[User interface|interfaces]], and the roles and effectiveness of [[Virtual reality|virtual environments]] in education and training. This work extended cognitive theories of learning into systems dynamics models of cognition and cognitive [[neuroscience]].

Winn collaborated broadly across disciplines and national boundaries, presenting papers in French, German and English. In addition to teaching, extensive graduate advising activities, and a prolific writing schedule, at the time of his death he was working on research with the Puget Sound Marine Environment Modeling Group, augmented reality and physical models of complex organic molecules, INFACT/PixelMath, and collaborating with PRISM and the Center for Environmental Visualization.

=== Computer-based learning ===
Winn was very interested in [[computer-based learning]] for being a method that allows students to obtain information in formats that cannot be presented by teachers and because it gives the students control of the information. He acknowledged that computer-based learning follows a [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning approach because students construct understandings for themselves by interacting with the material they encounter.&lt;ref name="Winn"&gt;Winn, W. (2002). "Current trends in educational technology research: The study of learning environments". ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 15(4), 331-351&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual environments ===
Winn also focused his research in constructing [[virtual reality|virtual learning environments]] which are computer created environments intended to simulate realistic experiences in order to help students understand concepts presented in those environments. For example, Winn explained “that the act of designing and creating environments that embody concepts and principles governing phenomena as diverse as wetlands ecology and medieval castles helps students master these topics with depth and clarity”.&lt;ref name="Winn"/&gt; He also found that virtual learning has greater success for students who do poorly in school. However, teaching through virtual environments also has its weaknesses. Winn declared that this method of learning often result in misconceptions due to oversimplifying the interactions that occur in the natural environments which are simulated.&lt;ref name="Winn"/&gt;  Additionally, problems in the transfer of knowledge are seen in younger students who lack the ability to think abstractly. These children have a difficulty transferring what they learn in the virtual world to other areas in the real world.&lt;ref name="Winn"/&gt;

=== Learning oceanography from a computer compared to direct experience at sea ===
This is an example of one of the studies conducted by Winn in which he evaluated the difference of learning in a computer-based environment as opposed to learning through direct experience. In this study, two groups of college students learned [[oceanography]]. One group learned using a computer simulation of the ocean which included a three-dimensional (3D) model, and the other group learned by spending a day in a research vessel and used oceanographic tools.&lt;ref name="Winn, W."&gt;Winn,W., Stahr, F., Sarason, C., Fruland, R., Oppenheimer, P., &amp; Lee, Y. (2006). Learning Oceanography from a Computer Simulation Compared with Direct Experience at Sea. ''Journal of Research in Science Teaching'', 43(1), 25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In his discussion of this study Winn makes reference to Kolb’s [[experiential learning|experiential learning theory]] because it highlights the significance of direct experience with the environment, as well as the need for abstract concepts in order to learn and apply knowledge. According to Winn, the proper use of metaphors in simulations may allow students to learn abstract concepts better than they would in real experiences.&lt;ref name="Winn, W."/&gt; This study took place in [[Seattle]] and was focused on the oceanography of the [[Puget Sound]] estuary system within [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. There were 25 students in each group and both groups received a total of three lessons. Two of the lessons were taught by the same professors and covered the same material. For the third lesson the groups were separated to their different settings.&lt;ref name="Winn, W."/&gt; One of the limitations of this study was that the students taking the “Virtual Puget Sound” (VPS) experience could only control some [[dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] but not others, like for example they could not change the [[salinity]] of the water. The results of the study showed “no difference in overall learning between students who used the VPS simulation and those who studied the same material in the field”.&lt;ref name="Winn, W."/&gt;  However, the study found that students with less experience in water learned more from direct experience, while the simulated ocean experience helped students transfer the knowledge they obtained while working in the computer, to the material presented in class.&lt;ref name="Winn, W."/&gt;

=== Response to criticism ===
After reading Winn’s article titled "Current trends in educational technology research: The study of learning environments" published in 2002, the educational psychologist [[Richard E. Mayer|Richard Mayer]] (2003) criticized Winn’s article for dismissing controlled experiments and in this way dismissing an approach that would produce substantial evidence and enable researchers to make claims on the learning development of students. In response to Mayer’s criticism, Winn confirmed that experimental research is important, and he proposed that researchers use a system that connects evidence from both experimental and non-experimental research when conducting their studies since each method produces different information. Controlled experimental research is useful for obtaining details about student learning, and non-experimental research allows the researcher to see how learning occurs in real settings.&lt;ref name=Winn,(2002)&gt;Winn, W.(2002). Research Methods and Types of Evidence for Research in Educational Technology. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 14(3), 367-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-experimental research method ===
As part of his response to Mayer’s criticism, Winn articulates that a good non-experimental method for researchers to use is the “design experiment” which was described by [[Ann Brown]] in 1992. Winn prefers this type of experiment particularly because it conveys many features of open ended research methods.&lt;ref name= Winn,(2002)/&gt; In a design experiment, the researcher tests his or her intervention in an educational setting such as a classroom, makes modifications depending on the data collected, and conducts the intervention until it produces good results. The data collected is in form of observations, results from tests, or any form of work that will show that the student has learned what is expected. Compared to a controlled experiment in which many variables are controlled, in the design experiment, modifications are made over time. Winn explained that a key difference between the two types of experiments is that “the controlled experiment adapts the setting to suit the intervention through experimental control, whereas the design experiment adapts the intervention to suit the setting through iteration”.&lt;ref name= Winn,(2002)/&gt; Although Winn is in favor of design experiments he does note one of its weaknesses. This type of non-experimental research involves more time and skill than implementing experimental research. However, it can yield crucial evidence about the success of interventions and how students learn.&lt;ref name= Winn,(2002)/&gt;

=== Implications for educational technology ===
Winn made significant contributions{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} to the field of educational technology as evident by his extensive research in this area. The following is a list of eight suggestions provided by Winn (2002) for those researchers who are also working in this field, or for future researchers.&lt;ref name=Winn/&gt; This list provides useful information{{Says who|date=October 2015}} on how practitioners can reduce factors that may disrupt research findings and thus assist in improving educational technology research.
# Instructors should not use metaphors that may confuse students or prevent them from understanding concepts.
# Computer learning environments yield greater results when conducted under a [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approach. Instructors should allow for mistakes and should not use virtual environments to teach basic facts.
# Educational technology is not a sufficient method for teaching. Educators should implement activities and other methods of communication into their lessons.
# Students must understand the task they have to accomplish and they require scaffolding to obtain their end goal.
# Educators must implement social context in the technology driven learning environment, and acknowledge sharing and collaboration amongst students.
# Educators should involve experts from the outside community in order to make their teaching effective.
# Educators should promote that the students make changes to their learning environment, as this will allow educators to obtain information about student learning.
# Educators, students, and researchers should work as a team since they all contribute to the improvement of educational technology research.

'''Wolfgang Alexander Albert Eduard Maximilian Reichsgraf Berghe von Trips''' (4 May 1928 – 10 September 1961), also known simply as '''Wolfgang von Trips''' and nicknamed 'Taffy' by friends and fellow racers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/19236.html|title=The unexplained mystery of 'Taffy' von Trips - Ask Steven|website=espn.co.uk|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[Germany|German]] [[racing driver]]. He was the son of a noble [[Rhineland]] family.&lt;ref name=Monza&gt;"Von Trips, 11 [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] Fans Killed; Hill Wins", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 11 September 1961, Page C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula One and sports car driver==

[[File:Von Trips at 1961 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|von Trips at the [[1961 Dutch Grand Prix]]]]
Von Trips was born in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].  He had [[diabetes]] during his career and he always had high sugar snacks during the races to compensate for his low blood sugar levels.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

He participated in 29 [[Formula One]] World Championship Grand Prix races, debuting on 2 September 1956. He won two races, secured one [[pole position]], achieved six podiums, and scored a total of 56 championship points.

He sustained a concussion when he spun off track at the [[Nürburgring]] during trial runs for a sports car race held in May 1957. His [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] was destroyed. It was the only one of its [[marque]] to be entered in the [[Grand tourer|Gran Turismo]] car class of more than 1600&amp;nbsp;cc.&lt;ref&gt;''German Driver Injured In Sports Car Trials'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', 26 May 1957, Page S3.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Trips was forced out of a [[Royal Automobile Club]] Grand Prix at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], in July 1958, when his Ferrari came into the pits on the 60th lap with no oil.&lt;ref&gt;''Moss Forced Out In English Race'', ''The New York Times'', 20 July 1958, Page S9.&lt;/ref&gt; The following August he was fifth at [[Porto]] in the [[1958 Portuguese Grand Prix]], which was won by [[Stirling Moss]] in a [[Vanwall]]. Von Trips completed 49 laps and was one lap behind at the finish. Moss was more than five minutes ahead of [[Mike Hawthorn]], who finished second in a Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;''Moss Wins Portugal's Grand Prix'', ''The New York Times'', 25 August 1958, Page A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1960 von Trips was victorious in a [[Formula Two]] event in a Ferrari, with a newly introduced engine in the rear. The race was in [[Stuttgart]] and was called the Solitude Formula Two Grand Prix. It was a 20-lap event with the winner averaging {{convert|102.21|mph|disp=flip|abbr=on}} over {{convert|142|mi|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Von Trips's Victory In Stuttgart", ''[[The Times]]'', 25 July 1960, Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Targa Florio]], 10-lap {{convert|448|mi|disp=flip}} race, in May 1961. Von Trips achieved an average speed of {{convert|64.26|mph|disp=flip|abbr=on}} in his Ferrari with [[Olivier Gendebien]] of Belgium
as his co-driver.&lt;ref&gt;"Von Trips Sets Up New Record", ''The Times'', 1 May 1961, Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Trips and [[Phil Hill]] traded the lead at [[Spa, Belgium]] during the [[1961 Belgian Grand Prix]], in June 1961. Hill led most of the way in front of a crowd of 100,000 people.

Ferraris captured the first four places at the race conclusion with von Trips finishing second. The Formula One World Championship driver competition at this juncture in 1961 was led by Hill with 19 points followed by von Trips with 18.&lt;ref&gt;"Hill Captures Belgium Prix; Ginther Third", ''Los Angeles Times'', 19 June 1961, Page C5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The [[1961 Italian Grand Prix]] on 10 September saw von Trips tightly locked in the battle [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One World Drivers' Championship]] that year with his teammate Phil Hill. During the race at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], his Ferrari collided with [[Jim Clark]]'s [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]. His car became airborne and crashed into a side barrier, fatally throwing von Trips from the car, and killing fifteen spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=612|title=Motorsport Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark described the accident, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Von Trips and I were racing along the straightaway and were nearing one of the banked curves, the one on the southern end. We were about 100 metres from the beginning of the curve. Von Trips was running close to the inside of the track. I was closely following him, keeping near the outside. At one point Von Trips shifted sideways so that my front wheels collided with his back wheels. It was the fatal moment. Von Trips's car spun twice and went into the guardrail along the inside of the track. Then it bounced back, struck my own car and bounced down into the crowd."&lt;ref name=Monza/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Movie footage of the crash that surfaced after the race showed that Clark's memory of the incident was inaccurate: after colliding with Clark, von Trips's car rode directly up an embankment on the outside of the track and struck a fence behind which spectators were closely packed.

At the time of his death von Trips was leading the Formula One World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research-racing.de/Trips-gb.htm |title=TAFFY The Story of Count Graf Berghe von Trips |publisher=researchracing |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previous incidents at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, where he crashed cars in the [[1956 Italian Grand Prix]] and the [[1958 Italian Grand Prix]], and was injured in both events.&lt;ref name=Monza/&gt;

In 1961 von Trips established a go-kart race track in [[Kerpen]], Germany. The track was later leased by Rolf Schumacher, whose sons, [[Michael Schumacher|Michael]] and [[Ralf Schumacher|Ralf]], made their first laps there. Coincidentally, Michael's win in the [[1992 Belgian Grand Prix]] was the first full-length Grand Prix won by a German since von Trips's [[1961 British Grand Prix|last win at Aintree]] in 1961.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27755">'''Writing across the curriculum (WAC)''' is a movement within contemporary [[composition studies]] that concerns itself with writing in classes outside of composition, literature, and other English courses. According to a comprehensive survey performed in 2006–2007, approximately half of American institutes of higher learning have something that can be identified as a WAC program.&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

This page principally concerns itself with WAC in American colleges and universities. WAC has also been important in Britain, but primarily at the [[K–12]] level.

==History of WAC==
David Russell traces the history of WAC in the United States to the 1870s, the emergence of professional disciplines, and the new need for college-level instruction in writing.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, David R. Writing in the Academic Disciplines: A Curricular History. 2nd Ed. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this era, college students were exclusively (for all practical considerations) affluent white men whose natural discourse was identical to the approved discourse of the academy; therefore, their way of speaking and writing was already considered appropriate by and for the academy and composition didn't need to be taught at the college level. Two changes happened to motivate the need for college writing instruction. Firstly, as disciplines (as divisions within academic studies) and contemporary professions specialized, they developed their own specialized discourses. Because these discourses were not merely the same as the everyday discourse of the upper classes, they had to be taught. Secondly, as college students became more diverse – first in terms of social background and, later, in terms of gender, race, and age – not all college students grew up speaking the accepted language of the academy.

Clearly, composition courses couldn't be about the content of the writing, because content was what the other disciplines taught. Composition, therefore, had to be about the form the writing took and so "writing" was reduced to mechanics and style. Because of this reduced focus and because writing was addressed by composition, other disciplines assumed no responsibility for writing instruction; most students, then, were not taught to write in the context of their specialties. As American education became increasingly skills-oriented following World War II – in part a reaction to the suffusion of universities with war veterans in need of job training, in part a result of modeling education after the efficiency of Fordian factory production – writing instruction was further reduced to a set of skills to be mastered. Once correct (that is, standard academic) grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style were mastered – preferably before reaching the post-secondary level – there was no need for additional writing instruction save as [[remedial education]].

This product-oriented, skills-focused paradigm of writing pedagogy began to change in the 1970s with the popularization of [[James N. Britton|James Britton]] and colleagues' expressivist school of composition, which said that students benefited from writing as a tool for self-expression and that focusing on technical correctness was damaging. Janet Emig's 1977 article "Writing as a Mode of Learning," grounded in [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist theories of education]], suggested that writing functioned as a unique and invaluable way for students to understand and integrate information. Simultaneously, widespread media attention around college students' apparently decreasing writing proficiency (more a product of the changing demographics of college students than an overt shift in teaching) provoked institutions of higher learning to reevaluate and increase the amount of writing required of students. [[Carleton College]] and Beaver College began what were probably the first contemporary WAC programs in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with faculty workshops and writing requirements shared across disciplines.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;

In 2010, Thaiss and Porter defined WAC as "a program or initiative used to 'assist teachers across disciplines in using student writing as an instructional tool in their teaching'".&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; WAC, then, emerged as and remains a way to bring writing back to disciplines which had become accustomed to assigning relatively little of it. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement ([[student-centred learning]]) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom.

==Major theories==
WAC efforts are usually driven principally by one of two theories: writing to learn or on learning to write in disciplinary discourses, sometimes also called writing in the disciplines. Though both may be used together, one of the two theories generally guides any given writing assignment and, often, any given WAC course.

===Writing to learn===
Writing to learn is also occasionally referred to as the expressivist or cognitive mode of WAC.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Writing to learn supports the use of mostly informal, often ungraded writing exercises to help students understand course content in non-English disciplines. Writing to learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of writing to learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common writing to learn exercises include reading responses, journals, [[free writing]], and multiple forms of collaborative writing.

===Writing in the disciplines===
Writing in the disciplines is also occasionally referred to as the transactional or rhetorical mode of WAC.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Disciplines (WID) teaches students how to write acceptably in their respective disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Sutton. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." Language and Learning Across the Disciplines. (1997): 46-57. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v2n1/sutton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Disciplines classes teach students to learn to write texts that they will apply in their scholarly and professional lives.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Susan H. "Writing Across the Curriculum: An Introduction." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 1–11. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Although WID and WAC are correlated, WID emphasizes disciplinary orientation. The students’ participation in their majors enlists the students in [[discourse communities]], which are social groups that communicate, at least in part, via written texts and share common goals, values, and writing standards. These writing standards include but are not limited to specialized vocabularies and particular genres.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Writing Program. "What is "Writing in the Disciplines?"" Faculty of Art and Science, Academic Writing Program. University of Lethbridge, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; The goal of WID is to allow students to demonstrate writing skills within the genres expected in academic and professional discourse communities.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bazerman. "Encyclopedia of English Studies "Writing in the Disciplines". Southern Illinios UP, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the discipline courses are commonly referred to as Writing Intensive courses(WI).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLeod |first1=Susan H. |last2=Soven |first2=Margot |title=Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs|publisher=WAC Clearinghouse Landmark Publications in Writing Studies |date=2000 |chapter=Chapter 6: Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change |url=https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing Intensive courses were developed for two reasons: 1) Students' writing skills would decrease if not consistently reinforced. 2) Students' writing improves significantly when they write involving their major.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The controversy surrounding WID is who holds responsibility for teaching WID courses. The different models for teaching WID classes are the following: 1) The English department faculty teaches writing courses focused on individual disciplines. 2) English departments and other discipline departments collaborate on instructing writing courses for particular majors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 3) Individual faculty of respective disciplines teach writing for their respective disciplines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonathan|first=Monroe,|date=2003-10-01|title=Writing and the Disciplines|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-592166031/writing-and-the-disciplines|journal=Peer Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|issn=1541-1389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree that each university decides which model works best for their institution. The University of San Francisco has implemented model one to teach their [https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/203-writing-psychology Writing in Psychology course(RHET 203)].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cornell University has used model two to teach their [http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&amp;coid=494579 Technical Writing course(WRIT 7100)].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The University of Missouri employs the third model to teach their [https://cwp.missouri.edu/wi/courses/spring-2018/ Process Synthesis and Design course - Writing Intensive(CH_ENG 4980W)]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==WAC structure and implementation==
WAC may exist as a formal program housed in or attached to an English department, a formal program as a free-standing unit reporting directly to a dean or vice president, a program attached to an all-campus [[writing center]], or an informal initiative in which faculty voluntarily participate. The WAC director, at most universities, is a tenure-track professor.&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; WAC programs are often administered by a WAC director, frequently with the aid of a WAC faculty committee, and are sometimes staffed by undergraduate or graduate student assistants (also referred to as tutors, consultants, or fellows.)

===WAC workshops===
Workshops at which faculty from many disciplines meet to share ideas about and strategies around writing are a primary way in which WAC is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Walvoord, Barbara E. "Getting Started." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 12–31. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaiss, Chris, and Tara Porter. "The State of WAC/WID in 2010: Methods and Results of the U.S. Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project." College Composition and Communication. 61.3 (2010): 524–70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops serve multiple functions including:
* Encouraging community amongst faculty interested in WAC&lt;ref&gt;Magnotto, Joyce Neff and Barbara R. Stout. "Faculty Workshops." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 32–46. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing WAC faculty (often, but not always from English or composition studies) to share knowledge about writing to learn, writing process, providing student feedback, and other composition scholarship
* Providing a forum for open discussion about writing and teaching
* Giving faculty themselves an opportunity to experiment with different writing strategies including collaborative writing and peer-review and to experience something of how these strategies may feel for their students&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Karen Wiley. "Starting a WAC Program: Strategies for Administrators." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 47–57. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;

A major complaint against the workshop model of WAC is that it can encourage the mindset that writing pedagogy is relatively simple and can be mastered in a few days, whereas using writing effectively (in English or non-English classes) is widely recognized as taking years of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ochsner, Robert, and Judy Fowler. "Playing Devil's Advocate: Evaluating the Literature of the WAC/WID Movement." Review of Educational Research 74.2 (2004): 117 -140. Web. 1 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAC in upper-division courses===
On a programmatic level, WAC most often manifests as some kind of writing-intensive (also called writing-enriched or writing-in-the-major) courses. Courses carrying this designation typically meet university-wide criteria including a minimum number of pages or words students write over the semester (or some other measure of writing frequency), opportunity for revision, and deriving a significant portion of the final grade from writing. Writing-intensive courses also often have relatively small enrollment limits (15–35 students depending on institution) and may require faculty to participate in WAC-related professional development activities.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Christine and Raymond Smith. "Writing-Intensive Courses: Tools for Curricular Change." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Eds. Susan H. McLeod and Margot Soven. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 71–86. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for writing-intensive coursework includes:
* ''Writing practice'' – as with any other skill, students' writing abilities will atrophy if they are left unpracticed; writing-intensive courses ensure that students continue to write after leaving [[first-year composition]]
* ''Writing to learn'' – contemporary composition theory holds that incorporating active writing promotes student engagement and, therefore, learning
* ''Professionalization'' – writing-intensive courses directed at upper-division major students provide an opportunity for students to learn the communication skills expected of professionals in their anticipated fields

===WAC in first-year composition===
While WAC is usually understood as distributing writing across the curriculum in courses outside of English departments, a WAC philosophy can also influence the structure of first-year composition courses. Because first-year composition is often the only writing course students take, the composition of the class can shape students' understanding of what writing is.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Linda H. "Writing Across the Curriculum and/in the Freshman English Program." Writing Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs. Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1992. 58–70.Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod-soven/&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating writing from diverse academic genres can therefore expand students' expectations about what constitutes "writing." WAC in first-year composition owes much to genre theory ([[genre studies]]) which asks students to think about the classification and rhetorical implications of writing within socially constructed genres.

== Writing-Enriched Curriculum ==
'''Writing-Enriched Curriculum (or WEC)''' is a movement that scholars have recently started to implement in composition programs across the U.S. With its basic premise reflecting WAC's integration of writing throughout all student's courses, WEC aims to focus on faculty involvement in devising a writing program that is effective and relevant for students in their various fields &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing-Enriched Curriculum|url=https://wec.umn.edu/|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Precursors of WEC ===
In the late 1990's, North Carolina State University developed an approach to writing across the curriculum that involved extensive consultation by writing experts with individual departments. These consultations began with a focus on the qualities and characteristics faculty felt that student majors would exhibit if they were strong communicators. Those discussions led to the articulation of learning outcomes for both writing and oral communication. The departments then developed implementation plans that could help them reach the outcomes, followed or preceded by plans for assessing student abilities in order to further refine or project plans for implementation. &lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael (2003) A Process for Establishing Outcomes-Based Assessment Plans for Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines, Language and Learning Across the Disciplines, 6:1, 4-29. Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/llad/v6n1/carter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Anson, Chris M. (2006) Assessing Writing in Cross-Curricular Programs: Determining the Locus of Activity. Assessing Writing, 11, 100-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campus Writing and Speaking Program, directed since 1999 by Distinguished Professor Chris Anson (www.ansonica.net), provided much of the support for this campus-wide approach. A few years into the program's existence, Anson and colleague Michael Carter (who is often credited with originating the departmentally-focused conversations on which WEC is founded) consulted with Pamela Flash at the University of Minnesota (where Anson had been a professor for 15 years) to help them spearhead a similar effort. Minnesota branded their program and design "WEC," although now the acronym is becoming generalized as other institutions adopt the approach.

WEC is a developing concept relating to WAC; the acronym was created by Pamela Flash and her colleagues at The University of Minnesota. Flash is the university's director of Writing Across the Curriculum, founding director of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum and co-director of the writing center. &lt;ref&gt;Heidi E. Wagner, A. Peter Hilger &amp; Pamela Flash (2014) Improving Writing Skills of Construction Management Undergraduates: Developing Tools for Empirical Analysis of Writing to Create Writing-Enriched Construction Management Curriculum,International Journal of Construction Education and Research, 10:2, 111-125, DOI: 10.1080/15578771.2013.852146&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Search Results", American Library Association, January 18, 2018.

Document ID: 019c5924-9dc0-4eaa-929a-9aeff57bd454&lt;/ref&gt; As a pioneer of the WEC writing instruction model, the University of Minnesota  has had its faculty enroll up to 5 units of WEC plans per year into the undergraduate curriculum for up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wec.umn.edu/about|title=About|last=hinte019|date=2016-10-06|work=WEC|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The WEC model ===
According to the WEC website at the University of Minnesota,&lt;Writing-Enriched Curriculum Program&gt; &lt;/https://wec.umn.edu/&gt; WEC is a faculty-driven method to ensuring the effective, intentional integration of relevant writing and writing instruction into disciplinary curricula. The WEC model created by Writing Across the Curriculum director Pamela Flash and colleagues and initially implemented by the University of Minnesota involves departmental faculty in developing a locally relevant Writing Plan. The outlining of plans is attempted through collaborative discussions between numerous departmental faculty and specialists in both writing and assessment and the consideration of previous attempts at effective writing instruction. Some of the content under consideration include writing assessments, locally collected data, stakeholder surveys and writing expectations from instructors. The outcome of this meetings is pronounced expectations and plans for relevant instructions to be implemented in the curricula. &lt;ref&gt; (Flash 2016 Fr o m A ppr i s e d to Revi s e d Faculty in the Disciplines Change What They Never Knew They Knew) https://wec.umn.edu/sites/wec.umn.edu/files/flash_chapter2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is the application of the plan into the undergraduate curriculum and assessing Undergraduate Writing Plans. Integrating the WEC model is anticipated to show improvements in writing instruction at a rate that would meet faculty expectations. Each of three writing plans is tested for 1-3 academic years through multiple outlets; internal curricular study and structural changes, material development, writing workshops, seminars, and panels, and additional research. The feasibility of each edition of these writing plans is assessed by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate; the Campus Writing Board. Contributions to writing plan assessment include triennial panel ratings of student writing against faculty expectations and criteria. The results are then used to guide future writing plans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wec.umn.edu/wec-model|title=WEC Model|last=mollyb|date=2017-03-27|work=WEC|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The principles of WAC and the WEC model ===
Because WEC closely reflects WAC, the principles that Barbara Walvoord&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walvoord|first1=Barbara|title=Getting Started. In Writing‐across‐the‐Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=9-22|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/books/landmarks/mcleod_soven}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives to devise a WAC program are similar to Anson's Campus Writing and Speaking Program at NC State and Pamela Flash's WEC model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing-Enriched Curriculum Model|url=https://wec.umn.edu/wec-model|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Minnesota. James K. Elmborg's work on information literacy and WAC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elmborg|first1=James|title=Information literacy and Writing across the Curriculum: sharing the vision|journal=Reference Services Review|volume=31|issue=1|page=68-80|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00907320310460933|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes Walvoord's characteristics of creating a WAC program as:
* Including colleagues from various disciplines, including teaching assistants and students, as they will all be affected by the WAC program the most.
* Discussing what needs and concerns need to be met with a WAC program and who will be willing to dedicate time to implementing the curriculum.
* What changes will be made to address this-- whether it be in school-wide assessments, writing centers or classroom methods 
* School administrators will then oversee and facilitate WAC but should not be seen as dictators.

Similarly, both Anson's approach at NC State and Pamela Flash's model at the University of Minnesota reflect the same idea of coming together with faculty members from various fields throughout the curriculum and implementing these changes cohesively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Plans|url=https://wec.umn.edu/writing-plans|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main point of difference between WAC and WEC, however, is that WEC requires faculty to maintain intentional support activity and assessment of how the program is affecting their students and to make changes, if necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research &amp; Assessment|url=https://wec.umn.edu/research-assessment|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By comparison, WAC does not require routinely assessment as part of its model. Like WAC, Flash's WEC model also requires ongoing implementation and incremental direct and indirect assessment, which allows the faculty-implemented plans to sustain. Anson's program at NC State revisits departments to conduct "profiles" of their efforts, resulting in a formative report for the department's use&lt;ref&gt; Anson, Chris M., &amp; Dannels, D. P. (2009). Profiling Programs: Formative Uses of Assisted Descriptions in the Assessment of Communication Across the Curriculum. Across the Disciplines, 6 Available at https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/atd/assessment/anson_dannels.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Flash, WEC differs from most WAC programming in its departmental locus and its direct focus on the ways that faculty members in diverse disciplines conceptualize writing and writing instruction. &lt;ref&gt;Flash, P. (2016) Flash, P. (2016). From apprised to revised: Faculty in the disciplines change what they never knew they knew. In Yancey, K.B. (Ed.) A Rhetoric of Reflection (pp. 227-249). Logan, UT: Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
P.A. Ramsay, in his paper Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy, found that students that participate in WAC programs become better communicators in their chosen discipline and demonstrated improved critical/analytical thinking.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ramsay, P.A. (2008). ''Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy.'' Kingston, Jamaica: School of Education, University of West Indies.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Disadvantages of WAC include fears that the teaching style will reduce the available time to teach content material, difficuties getting teachers "on board" with the style, as well as fears that the teacher is illequipped to teach writing.Ramsay also found while working in [[Jamaica]], that students who were unable to compose in their first language (either because of academic defficiencies or because the language did not have a written language) had difficulties composing in their second language using WAC practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was a sentiment echoed by Alexander Friedlander, who in his research found that students unable to write in their first language will have great difficulty writing in their second language regardless of whether their instruction has used WAC strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, A. (1990). Composing in English: Effects of a first language on writing in English as a second language. In B.Kroll(Ed.), S''econd language writing: Research insights for the classroom'' (pp. 109-125).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">In the [[Education in New Zealand | education system of New Zealand]], a '''wānanga''' is a [[state sector organisations in New Zealand|publicly owned]] [[Tertiary education |tertiary institution]] that provides education in a [[Māori people|Māori]] cultural context. Section 162 of the ''Education Act 1989'' specifies that wānanga resemble mainstream [[university |universities]] in many ways but are:
:''"...characterised by teaching and research that maintains, advances, and disseminates knowledge and develops intellectual independence, and assists the application of knowledge regarding ahuatanga Maori (Maori tradition) according to tikanga Maori (Maori custom)."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM183668.html section 162 of the ''Education Act 1989'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Wānanga educational programmes, accredited through the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] (NZQA) and through the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]], are partly governed by New Zealand's [[Education in New Zealand#Tertiary education|Tertiary Education Commission]] (TEC). Wānanga offer certificates, diplomas, and [[bachelor's degree|bachelor]]-level degrees, with some wānanga providing programmes in specialized areas up to [[doctorate]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctoral Degrees |url=https://www.wananga.ac.nz/programmes/school-of-indigenous-graduate-studies/doctoral-degrees |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Outside the formal education system, the word ''wānanga'' conveys meanings related to highly evolved knowledge, lore, occult arts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BesMaor-c4-2.html "The Whare Wananga"], Elsdon Best, via NZETC&lt;/ref&gt; and also "forum" - in the sense of a discussion to arrive at deeper understanding.
