      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3327">The '''1899-1900 season''' was the fifth competitive season in [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[football (soccer)|football]].

==Overview==
Only one official division existed at the time, split into two leagues.  It was called ''Coupe de Championnat'' (Championship Cup) and its winner was decided after a two-legged final match between the winners of each league.

At the end of the season it was decided to merge the two league in one.  Antwerp F.C. withdrew from the league after nearly every player left the club for the new [[K. Beerschot V.A.C.|Beerschot]] and [[K.V. Kortrijk|F.C. Courtraisien]] was relegated.  The clubs that replaced those two were Beerschot and [[R.C.S. Verviétois|Verviers F.C.]].

'''Alexandre-Athenase Noghès''' (15 June 1916 – 16 February 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/SSDI/individual_record.asp?recid=052322457&amp;lds=3&amp;region=-1&amp;regionfriendly=&amp;frompage=99 Death of Alexandre-Athenase Noghès]&lt;/ref&gt; was an international [[tennis]] champion, best known as the first husband of [[Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy|Princess Antoinette of Monaco]], whom he married as his second wife on 4 December 1951.

Noghès was descended from the first Spanish commander of the Monaco garrison. His grandfather Alexandre was the founder of the Monaco Automobile Club and former general treasurer of Monaco's state finances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexandra-lloyd.com/monaco/monaco-grand-prix.htm Monaco Grand Prix]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Antony Noghès|Antony]] (1890–1978), created the first Grand Prix ever raced in a city, the world-famous [[Monaco Grand Prix|Grand Prix de Monaco]]. Antony also created the renowned [[Rallye Monte Carlo]] and is credited with inventing the chequered flag.

Noghès entered into a liaison with [[Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy|Princess Antoinette of Monaco]] in the mid-1940s and three illegitimate children were born to the couple: [[Elisabeth-Anne de Massy|Elisabeth-Anne]] (born 1947), [[Christian Louis de Massy|Christian Louis]] (born 1949) and [[Christine Alix de Massy|Christine-Alix]] (1951–1989). They were married in a civil ceremony in [[Genoa]] on 4 December 1951, and divorced three years later in 1954.

Following their divorce, Noghès lived for a time on his yacht before settling in the [[United States]].

== History ==

The Asian Surfing Championships was created in 2011. They are headquartered in [[Bali]] and led by Tim Haines. ASC promotes surfing in Asian countries and helps other countries establish events. The Championship develops the skills of surfers through competition, brings media attention to formerly unfamiliar regions and aids in the advancement of surfing locally, regionally and internationally. ASC works with local, national and multinational event sponsors, maximizing the results of competitive surfing events. Every year during a multi-national surfing tour, Asian Surfing Champions are crowned in multiple divisions: Open, Women, Longboard, Junior and Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiansurfingtour.com/history.html| title=History | publisher=Asian Surfing Championships | accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bouncy ball''' or '''rubber ball''' is a spherical toy [[ball]], usually fairly small, made of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material which allows it to [[Deflection (physics)|bounce]] against hard surfaces. When thrown against a hard surface, bouncy balls retain their momentum and much of their [[kinetic energy]] (or, if dropped, convert much of their [[potential energy]] to kinetic energy). They can thus rebound with an appreciable fraction of their original force.

==Spaldeens==

{{main|Spaldeen}}
Solid rubber balls such as the Spaldeen (a corruption of [[Spalding (company)|Spalding]], the manufacturer), about the size of a [[tennis ball]] and often colored pink, have been manufactured since the 1930s and remain so into the 21st century. They were fundamental to the development of American [[street game]]s such as [[stickball]], in addition to other uses in [[play (activity)|play]]. Other manufacturers have made similar balls, such as the [[Penn Racquet Sports|Pensie]] Pinkie.

==Superballs==
[[File:Glitter Super Ball.jpg|thumb|120px|left|A superball]]
{{main|Super Ball}}
A superball or power ball is a bouncy ball of composed of a type of synthetic rubber (originally a hard elastomer Polybutadiene alloy named [[Zectron]]) invented in 1964, with has a higher [[coefficient of restitution]] (0.92) than older balls such as the Spaldeen, so that when dropped from moderate height onto a level hard surface, it wall bounce nearly all the way back up. They were first sold by the [[Wham-O]] toy company under the name Super Ball, which remains their trademark.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; Superballs are often smaller than a Spaldeen.

==Other bouncy balls==
[[Skyball]] is a brand of hollow medium-sized bouncy ball filled with a mix of helium and compressed air, claimed by the manufacturer to have particularly good bounce characteristics. [[Nerf]] balls, introduced in 1970, are also small balls that bounce, but they have a lower coefficient of restitution than a typical bouncy ball. Balls similar in size and composition to Spaldeens, but featuring a plethora of designs (such as a baseball pattern, miniature basketball and soccer ball patterns, and so forth) are offered by many companies. Due to their low cost per unit, bouncy balls with logos or other designs are sometimes used as [[promotional merchandise]]. Bouncy balls may, by means of [[fluorescence]], [[chemiluminescence]], or motion-activated [[LED]]s, emit light; such balls are called glow balls. Balls composed of many [[rubber band]]s, or bouncy balls made of [[borax]], glue, and cornstarch, are sometimes [[Handicraft|homemade]].&lt;ref name=kidspot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malia/&gt; Bouncy balls are often used in [[juggling]].&lt;ref name=oddballs/&gt;

Set in a world populated entirely by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cars and other vehicles, the film stars the voices of [[Owen Wilson]], [[Paul Newman]] (in his final acting role), [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Michael Wallis]], [[George Carlin]], [[Paul Dooley]], [[Jenifer Lewis]], [[Guido Quaroni]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Katherine Helmond]], [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Richard Petty]]. Race car drivers [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], [[Mario Andretti]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and car enthusiast [[Jay Leno]] (as "Jay Limo") voice themselves.

''Cars'' premiered on May 26, 2006 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2006 to critical and commercial success, grossing $462.2 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]]. The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006 and on [[Blu-ray]] in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short ''[[One Man Band (film)|One Man Band]]'' for its theatrical and home media releases.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In a world populated by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking [[vehicles]], the last race of the Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran [[Strip Weathers|Strip "The King" Weathers]], infamous runner-up [[Chick Hicks]] and rookie [[Lightning McQueen]]. The [[tiebreaker]] race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in [[California]]. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative [[List of Pixar film references#Dinoco|Dinoco]] team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his [[Semi-trailer truck|big rig]], [[Mack (Cars)|Mack]] to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but instead ends up lost in the run-down desert town of [[Radiator Springs]], where he inadvertently ruins the pavement of its main road by accident.

After being arrested, impounded overnight and guarded by a rusty yet friendly [[tow truck]] named [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], McQueen is ordered by the town judge [[Doc Hudson]] to leave town immediately. However, the local lawyer [[Sally Carrera]], requests that McQueen should instead be given [[community service]] to repave the road to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day but it turns out shoddy, forcing him to repave the road again. During this time, he befriends several of the cars and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old [[U.S. Route 66]] but with the construction of [[Interstate 40]] bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the "[[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]]", a three-time Piston Cup winner whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954 after which he was quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road which has invigorated the cars to improve their town and spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race while Sally chastises Doc upon discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.

At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race due to him missing Sally and his other new friends and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief along with several other cars from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute Hicks (refusing to come behind Weathers again) side swipes Weathers and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line which allows Hicks to win and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's good sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines by insisting on staying with Rust-eze as an appreciation of their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns to reunite with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters, thereby putting Radiator Springs back on the map.

==Production==
''Cars'' was the final Pixar film worked on by [[Joe Ranft]] who died in a car accident a year before the film's release, aged 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/who_framed_roger_rabbit/news/1645631/pixars_joe_ranft_falls_to_a_tragic_death |title=Pixar's Joe Ranft Falls to a Tragic Death |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |date=August 19, 2005 |author=Scott Weinberg |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028104629/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/who_framed_roger_rabbit/news/1645631/pixars_joe_ranft_falls_to_a_tragic_death |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by [[John Lasseter]] during the credits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amidi |first=Amid |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/pixar/joe-ranft-1960-2005-rip-1254.html |title=Joe Ranft (1960-2005), RIP |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=August 17, 2005 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for [[Paul Newman]] before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/27/paul.newman.dead/ |title=Paul Newman dies at 83 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |date=September 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out to be the highest-grossing film of his career.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Development===
The genesis of the film came in 1998 as Pixar began wrapping up production on ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a script called ''The Yellow Car'' which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world, inspired by ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', an idea triggered by the poor reception his fellow countrymen gave the [[CityEl|Mini-El]] car.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/disney-cars-films_b_890538.html |title=Jim Hill: The Roads Not Taken With Pixar's Cars Films |work=The Huffington Post |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original drawings and characters were developed in 1998 and the producers agreed that ''Cars'' could be the next film after ''A Bug's Life'' and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; However, the idea was scrapped in favor of ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; Later, production resumed with major script changes like giving Mater, Doc and a few other characters a bigger part.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;

[[John Lasseter]] said that inspiration for the film's story came after he took a cross-country road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000.&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted [[Michael Wallis]], a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film.&lt;ref name="ocregister-carsland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/houser-358737-caf-route.html |date=June 13, 2012|title=Life changed at her café when Pixar dropped in: Fran Houser said her Route 66 Midpoint Café in Texas was a sleepy spot – until the "Cars" movie premiered.|author=Eric Carpenter|publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.edmondoutlook.com/archives/m.blog/27/2006-august-dawn-welch-the-little-blue-porsche |title=Dawn Welch, the Little Blue Porsche|author=David Hanigar |publisher=Edmond Outlook|date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pixarclinton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pixar's research visit to Clinton recalled|author1=Gerald Green|author2=Scott Mason|publisher=Clinton Daily News|date=June 22, 2006|url=http://www.clintondailynews.com/cgi-bin/newspost/extras/search.cgi?category=2&amp;keyword=Pixar%27s+research+visit+to+Clinton+recalled|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028031336/http://www.clintondailynews.com/cgi-bin/newspost/extras/search.cgi?category=2&amp;keyword=Pixar%27s+research+visit+to+Clinton+recalled|archivedate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the film's working title was ''Route 66'' (after [[U.S. Route 66]]) but the title was changed to ''Cars'' in order to avoid confusion with the 1960s [[Route 66 (TV series)|television series of the same name]].&lt;ref name="collider1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/pixar-numbers-monsters-university/ |title=Pixar by the Numbers – From TOY STORY to MONSTERS UNIVERSITY |publisher=Collider |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lightning McQueen's number was originally going to be 57 (Lasseter's birth year) but was changed to 95 (the year ''[[Toy Story]]'' was released).&lt;ref name="collider1"/&gt;

In 2006, Lasseter spoke about the inspiration for the film, saying: "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

In 2013, Klubien said the movie was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Double Life of Jorgen Klubien|url=http://flipanimation.blogspot.jp/2013/10/the-amazing-double-life-of-jorgen.html|website=FLIP|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation===
[[File:carsanimation.png|thumb|A rendered frame from the development of the film.]]
For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company.&lt;ref name="adisney1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/cars/us/bios/CARSProdNotes.pdf |title=Cars Production Information |date=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

In 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

Unlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the [[Tonka]] Talking Trucks, the characters from [[Tex Avery]]'s ''One Cab's Family'' short and Disney's own ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]''), rather than within the headlights.&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; According to [[production designer]] Bob Pauley, "From the very beginning of this project, [[John Lasseter]] had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog [[Jalopnik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5870976/how-pixar-screwed-up-cartoon-cars-for-a-generation-of-kids |title=How Pixar screwed up cartoon cars for a generation of kids |publisher=Jalopnik.com |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, supervising animator on the film Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: "Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the ''Cars'' models, than it did to interpret something like ''[[The Incredibles]]'' models. With ''The Incredibles'', the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with ''Cars'', it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

[[File:John Lasseter 2 cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Lasseter]] co-wrote and directed the film.]]
Lasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, they need to have that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

Character shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film, saying: "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning as much as we could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for ''Cars'' we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

Rendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: "In addition to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt; Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On ''Cars'', this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

Technical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: "Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away."&lt;ref name="adisney1"/&gt;

Computers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and 1,000 times faster than those used in ''[[Toy Story]]''. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/automobiles/21AUTO.html |title=Pixar's ''Cars'' Got Its Kicks on Route 66 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |author=Phil Patton |date=May 21, 2006 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cars'' was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005 but on December 7, 2004, its release date was changed to June 9, 2006.&lt;ref name="BBCJobs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4078711.stm |title=Pixar-Disney delay Cars release |publisher=BBC News  |date=December 8, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with [[Michael Eisner]]'s situation at Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars |work=Business Week |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001731/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Pixar's chief executive [[Steve Jobs]] made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.&lt;ref name="BBCJobs" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Cars'' was met with positive reviews. Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 74% approval rating with an average rating of 6.9/10 based on 198 reviews. The site's consensus reads "''Cars'' offers visual treats that more than compensate for its somewhat thinly written story, adding up to a satisfying diversion for younger viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cars/|title=Cars (2006) on Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 73 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars|title=Metecritic: Cars|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore|publisher=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus Aurelius Canônico of ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' described ''[[The Little Cars]]'' series (''Os Carrinhos'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), a Brazilian computer graphics film series, as a derivative of ''Cars''.

It has also been noted that the plot of ''Cars'' bears a striking resemblance to that of ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', the 1991 [[romantic comedy]] which stars [[Michael J.

'''Chessa Field''' is the women's soccer field of the '''[[Ohio Bobcats]]'''. It was opened under the name of "Ohio Soccer Field" on September 6, 1997. On that day, Ohio defeated the [[Youngstown State University]] [[Youngstown State Penguins|Penguins]] 2-0 in what was also the first home varsity women's soccer game in the history of [[Ohio University]]. 
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:CHESSAFIELD1.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Chessa field features a natural grass playing surface.]] --&gt;

In 2003, several renovations took place to the field thanks to a $60,000 donation from Ohio University groundskeeper Scott Blower and his wife Crista. This allowed a new state-of-the-art, laser leveled grass playing surface to be installed at the field. The work was completed by [https://www.buckeyeandoheil.com/ Buckeye Lawn &amp; Landscaping], a subsidiary of [https://www.oheilsitesolutions.com Oheil Site Solutions]. Also, the field dimensions were expanded to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] maximum, new bleachers with a capacity of 1,000 were added, a new press box were constructed, a new digital scoreboard was added to the facility, and wrought-iron fencing was erected to surround the field. 

The stadium was named Chessa Field in honor of Scott and Crista Blower's daughter, Chessa Blower.

'''Ford Field''' is a multi-purpose domed stadium located in [[Downtown Detroit]]. It primarily serves as the home of the [[Detroit Lions]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), as well as the annual [[Quick Lane Bowl]] college football [[bowl game]], state championship football games for the [[Michigan High School Athletic Association|MHSAA]], and, as of 2018, the MHSAA State Wrestling Championships. The regular seating capacity is approximately 65,000, though it is expandable up to 70,000 for football and 80,000 for basketball. The [[naming rights]] were purchased by the [[Ford Motor Company]] at $40&amp;nbsp;million over 20&amp;nbsp;years; the Ford family holds a [[controlling interest]] in the company, and a member of the Ford family has controlled ownership of the Lions franchise since 1963.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
In 1975, the Lions moved to the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] after playing at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] from 1938–1939, 1941–1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigers Ballparks|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/history/ballparks.jsp|website=Tigers.com|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Dow|title=The Detroit Lions' Last Game at Tiger Stadium|url=https://www.detroitathletic.com/blog/2010/12/10/the-detroit-lions-last-game-at-tiger-stadium/|website=Detroit Athletic Co.|date=December 10, 2010|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1990s, they began exploring the possibility of returning to the city of Detroit in order to build a new stadium.&lt;ref name=Stadiums&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Field, Detroit Lions football stadium|url=http://www.stadiumsofprofootball.com/stadiums/ford-field/|website=Stadiums of Pro Football|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 1996, the Lions announced their intention to build a new stadium in Downtown Detroit. On November 5, 1996, voters approved a referendum for the stadium.&lt;ref name="Ford Field"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stadiums/&gt;

Groundbreaking for the stadium began on November 16, 1999.&lt;ref name="Ford Field"/&gt; It was part of a downtown revitalization plan for the city of Detroit, which included [[Comerica Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nichole M.|last=Christian|title=Detroit Sees Park as Star Player in Redevelopment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/us/detroit-sees-park-as-star-player-in-redevelopment.html|website=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2000|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The stadium's design incorporates a former [[Hudson's]] warehouse, which was constructed in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=SBJ&gt;{{cite web|first=Don|last=Muret|title=Ford Field one of NFL's most versatile stadiums|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2012/08/06/In-Depth/Ford-Field.aspx|website=SportsBusiness Daily|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the warehouse allows for a seating arrangement that's unique among professional American football stadiums. The majority of suites are located in the warehouse along the stadium's southern sideline, as are the lounges that serve the premium club seats on that side of the field.&lt;ref name="Ford Field"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SBJ/&gt; The bulk of the grandstand seats are located along the northern sideline and both end-lines, with gaps in the stadium's upper half at the southwest and southeast corners. The upper deck on the stadium's northern sideline also contains one level of suites and a smaller section of club seating. A similar design was implemented at the renovated [[Soldier Field]], albeit with the use of a new structure (as opposed to an existing building) to house four levels of suites.&lt;ref name=SBJ/&gt;

Unlike most domed stadiums, Ford Field allows a large amount of natural light to reach the field, thanks to immense skylights and large glass windows at the open corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Field &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Detroit Historical Society|url=https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/ford-field|website=Detroit Historical Society|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The windows along the ceiling are frosted to mimic the automotive factories that are prevalent in Metro Detroit. The south entrance provides the seating bowl and concourse with sunlight year-round and also offers fans a view of downtown Detroit.&lt;ref name=Stadiums/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Field|url=http://football.ballparks.com/NFL/DetroitLions/newindex.htm|website=Ballparks.com|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the stadium from becoming an overly imposing presence in the Detroit skyline, the playing field is 45 feet below street level, similar to the design at adjacent Comerica Park.&lt;ref name=Stadiums/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marty|last=Mulcahy|title=Trades establish rushing game to build Ford Field by next year|url=http://www.michiganbuildingtrades.org/newspaper/trades-establish-rushing-game-to-build-ford-field-by-next-year|website=Michigan Building Trades|date=December 8, 2000|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford Field is one of the few venues in the NFL that has end zones in the east and the west. There is no NFL rule for field construction regarding sunlight distracting players on the field.&lt;ref name="NoNFLRule"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do football fields run north to south?|url=https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/football-fields-run-north-south-82a88c5f05b0a59e|website=Reference.com|publisher=IAC Publishing, LLC|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The east–west end zone design accommodated the Hudson warehouse location. The natural light is not a distraction to the players in a day game, because the light only reaches as far as the sidelines, leaving the field still properly lit with the combination of artificial stadium lighting and sunlight.

In 2017, Ford Field underwent its first major renovation. The $100 million renovation included new video boards, a new sound system, updated suites, and the renovation of multiple restaurants, clubs, and bars on the property.&lt;ref name=Renovation/&gt;

==Major events==

===Football===
Ford Field hosted [[Super Bowl XL]] on February 5, 2006, as the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] defeated the [[Seattle Seahawks]], 21–10 to win their fifth [[Super Bowl]] championship in front of 68,206 in attendance. It also marked the final game in the 13-year career for Steelers [[running back]], and Detroit native, [[Jerome Bettis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl XL Game Recap|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/recap/sbxl|website=NFL.com|date=February 6, 2006|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Garber|title=Steelers get past Seahawks for fifth Super Bowl win in club history|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=260205023|website=ESPN.com|date=February 6, 2006|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was home to the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]] sponsored by Detroit-based [[Little Caesars]] (previously known as the Motor City Bowl and jointly sponsored by the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three]] automakers headquartered in Detroit – [[Chrysler]], Ford, and [[General Motors]]) from 2002 until 2013. It featured a top [[Mid-American Conference]] team and a [[Big Ten Conference]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Shea|title=Little Caesars Pizza Bowl at Ford Field canceled|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20140819/NEWS/140819815/little-caesars-pizza-bowl-at-ford-field-canceled|website=Crain's Detroit Business|date=August 19, 2014|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl was replaced by the [[Quick Lane Bowl]], featuring teams from the Big Ten Conference and [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], and backed by the Lions and Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Lane Bowl Announced|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/082614aaa.html|website=Big Ten Conference|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also hosted the annual [[MAC Football Championship Game]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Paul|title=Ford Field construction boots MAC football media day|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/2017/03/15/ford-field-construction-boots-mac-football-media-day/99231404/|website=The Detroit News|date=August 19, 2014|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandra Stadium''', more commonly known as '''Gresty Road''' is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Crewe]], [[Cheshire]], England. The home ground of [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], it has an all-seated capacity of 10,153.

==History==
Crewe had initially played at the [[Alexandra Recreation Ground]], also on Gresty Road and located just to the north of current site. After leaving the ground towards the end of the [[1895–96 Football League|1895–96 season]] the club played at a variety of venues, including in nearby [[Sandbach]], before moving to the original Gresty Road ground in 1897.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p13, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 the ground was demolished to make way for the construction of new railway lines, and a new Gresty Road ground was built directly to the west of the site.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; The new ground initially had a stand on each touchline, one of which had been moved from the first Gresty Road ground, and some embankments around the remainder of the pitch.&lt;ref name=UD2&gt;Smith &amp; Smith, p62&lt;/ref&gt; After a fire, a new Main Stand was built on the south side of the ground in 1932. The record attendance of 20,000 was set on 30 January 1960 for an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]].&lt;ref name=UD2/&gt;

In the 1990s Gresty Road was rebuilt, with all-seater stands constructed on all four sides of the ground.&lt;ref name=UD2/&gt;

On 31 May 2015, the ground held an international friendly match between [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Northern Ireland to play Qatar in Crewe friendly|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31906366|accessdate=21 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stands==
*'''Air Products Stand''' ''(formerly the Railtrack Stand before a change in sponsorship)'' – built prior to the 1999–2000 season at a cost of £5.2 million. It accommodates 6,809 spectators, together with the club's office accommodation.
*'''Mark Price Stand''' – also known as the ''Gresty Road End'', accommodates 982 spectators and four disabled spectators.
*'''Wulvern Housing Stand''' – also known as the ''Railway End'', accommodates 682 spectators.
*'''[[Whitby Morrison]] Ice Cream Van Stand''' – formerly ''the Pop'', originally the Popular Side, accommodates 1,680 away spectators.

'''Hans L'Orange Field''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Waipahu, Hawai'i]].  It is primarily used for [[baseball]], and is the home field of [[Hawaii Pacific University|Hawaii Pacific University's]] men's baseball team, the Sharks. It was the home field of the [[Hawaii Winter Baseball]] teams [[North Shore Honu]]  and [[West Oahu CaneFires]] before the league folded. It holds 2,200 people.

== History ==

Hans L'Orange Field began as a recreation area for Oahu Sugar Co. workers.  Originally known as Oahu Sugar Co. Field, it was later named after the manager who, in 1924, convinced the company to give up several acres of cane field, to create the recreation area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=June 12, 1997|url=http://starbulletin.com/97/06/12/news/story2.html|last1=Ohira|first1=Rod|title=Waipahu Turns 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=October 11, 1999|url=http://starbulletin.com/1999/10/11/news/story5.html|last1=Ohira|first1=Rod|title=Waipahu’s field of dreams marks 75 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7026">The '''International Gymnastics Hall of Fame''', located in [[Oklahoma City]], [[United States|USA]], is a [[hall of fame]] dedicated to honoring the achievements and contributions of the world's greatest competitors, coaches and authorities in [[artistic gymnastics]].

The early IGHOF was founded in 1972 by Frank Wells of the National Gymnastics Clinic. It had only one member, [[Olga Korbut]], and disbanded in the late 1970s. The current museum was founded in 1986 by [[Glenn Sundby]], publisher of the ''[[International Gymnast Magazine]]''. Initially located in [[Oceanside, California]], it was moved into Oklahoma City in 1997.

The museum is housed inside the [[Science Museum Oklahoma#International Gymnastics Hall of Fame|Science Museum Oklahoma]], formerly called the Omniplex.

'''Inver Park''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Larne]], [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]].  It is the home ground of [[Larne F.C.]].  The land was acquired by Larne in 1918 and has been in continuous use as a stadium ever since. In 2010 the official capacity was set for safety reasons at 1,100 with seating for 656 in the main stand. 

In 2010 the club struck an agreement with property developers GML who agreed to build a new stadium on the site that would meet the Irish League's domestic licence criteria to enable Larne to play senior football should they win the Championship One in the future in return for Larne's agreement to give up an acre of land adjacent to a development site next to the ground. The deal, however, has been delayed due to the falling value of the property market, which has led GML to halve their initial bid of £6 million for the land. An agreement is expected in 2011 that will see the project commence by 2012, but it was delayed again, so it has not started until 2016.

Born in  [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada, Bobby Robinson was a sports reporter for the ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]''. He attended the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]] as manager of the Canadian track and field team, to which he had recruited [[British Guiana]] runner [[Phil Edwards (athlete)|Phil Edwards]], whose "country" (actually a colony) had no Olympic team; like other countries' teams, this was Canada's first-ever co-ed track and field team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/sports/olympics/just-give-us-the-commonwealth-games-in-2030-canada-plans-to-tell-counterpart-countries|title='Just give us' the Commonwealth Games in 2030, Canada plans to tell counterpart countries|publisher=National Post|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amsterdam Olympics provided Robinson with a venue for the contacts he would need to sell the idea of holding British Empire Games in the "spirit of friendly competition".  The [[1930 British Empire Games|first British Empire Games]] were therefore held in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada in 1930, with Edwards competing for British Guiana.

The community-minded Robinson, who lived near Hamilton on a farm in [[Burlington, Ontario]]  [http://images.burlington.halnet.on.ca]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, (from 1920-1957) would later be appointed to the board of [[Burlington Central High School|Burlington High School]], serving from 1940 to 1963, including as its president from 1950 to 1963.  Upon his retirement, a new school, [[M. M. Robinson High School]], was named in his honour.

[[File:Hairy chest - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 25 luglio 2010a.jpg|thumb|Athletes use a combination of strength training, diet, and nutritional supplementation to induce muscle hypertrophy.]]
'''Muscle hypertrophy''' involves an increase in size of [[skeletal muscle]] through a growth in size of its component [[myocyte|cells]]. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: [[sarcoplasm]]ic hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased muscle [[glycogen]] storage; and [[myofibril]]lar hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased myofibril size.&lt;ref name="Essentials of Strength and Conditioning"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Thomas R. |editor1-last=Baechle |editor2-first=Roger W. |editor2-last=Earle |title=Essentials of strength training and conditioning |date=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, IL |isbn=978-0-7360-5803-2 |edition=3rd}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypertrophy stimulation==

A range of stimuli can increase the volume of muscle cells. These changes occur as an adaptive response that serves to increase the ability to generate force or resist fatigue in anaerobic conditions.

===Strength training===

{{Main|Strength training}}[[Strength training]], or resistance exercise, brings about neural and muscular adaptations which increase the capacity of an athlete to exert force through voluntary muscular contraction.  After an initial period, in which neuro-muscular adaptation dominates, a process of muscular hypertrophy is observed whereby the size of muscle tissue increases.  This increase in size is due to growth from adding [[sarcomere]]s (contractile elements) as well as an increase in non-contractile elements like [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic]] fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schoenfeld |first1=Brad |title=Science AND Development OF Muscle Hypertrophy |pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The precise mechanisms which induce muscular hypertrophy are not clearly understood, with currently accepted hypotheses regarding some combination of mechanical tension, metabolic fatigue, and muscular damage as relevant factors. [[Progressive overload]], a strategy of progressively increasing resistance or repetitions over successive bouts of exercise in order to maintain a high [[rating of perceived exertion|level of effort]], is one fundamental principle of training strongly associated with muscular hypertrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seynnes|first1=O. R. |last2=Boer|first2=M. de|last3=Narici|first3=M. V.|title=Early skeletal muscle hypertrophy and architectural changes in response to high-intensity resistance training|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=January 1, 2007 |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=368–373 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00789.2006|pmid=17053104|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/102/1/368.short|language=en|issn=8750-7587}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Across the research literature, a wide variety of resistance exercise training modalities have all been shown to elicit similar hypertrophic responses in muscle tissue.  Muscular hypertrophy plays an important role in competitive [[bodybuilding]] as well as strength sports like [[powerlifting]] and [[Olympic weightlifting]].

===Anaerobic training===
{{Main|Anaerobic exercise}}

The best approach to specifically achieve muscle growth remains controversial (as opposed to focusing on gaining strength, power, or endurance); it was generally considered that consistent anaerobic strength training will produce hypertrophy over the long term, in addition to its effects on muscular strength and endurance. Muscular hypertrophy can be increased through [[strength training]] and other short-duration, high-intensity [[anaerobic exercises]]. Lower-intensity, longer-duration [[aerobic exercise]] generally does not result in very effective tissue hypertrophy; instead, endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and [[Glycogen|carbohydrates]] within the muscles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Loon LJ, Goodpaster BH | title = Increased intramuscular lipid storage in the insulin-resistant and endurance-trained state | journal = Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology | volume = 451 | issue = 5 | pages = 606–16 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16155759 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-005-1509-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[neovascularization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Soares JM | title = Effects of training on muscle capillary pattern: intermittent vs continuous exercise | journal = The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1279273 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prior BM, Yang HT, Terjung RL | title = What makes vessels grow with exercise training? | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 1119–28 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15333630 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00035.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary swelling==
{{medical citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}
During a workout, increased blood flow to metabolically active areas causes muscles to temporarily increase in size, also known as being "pumped up" or getting "a pump".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://woman.thenest.com/causes-muscles-expand-work-out-6597.html |title=What Causes Your Muscles to Expand When You Work Out? | author=Joseph Eitel |accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two hours after a workout and typically for seven to eleven days, muscles swell due to an inflammation response as tissue damage is repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/75670-swell-after-workout/ |date=January 22, 2010 |title=Why Do You Swell After Workout? |author=Claire Lunardoni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer-term hypertrophy occurs due to more permanent changes in muscle structure.

==Factors affecting hypertrophy==

Biological factors (such as genetics and sex), nutrition, and training variables can affect muscle hypertrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/musclesgrowLK.html|title=How do muscles grow?|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in genetics account for a substantial portion of the variance in existing muscle mass. A classical twin study design (similar to those of behavioral genetics) estimates that about 52% of the variance in lean body mass is estimated to be heritable&lt;ref&gt;Arden, N. K. and Spector, T. D. (1997), Genetic Influences on Muscle Strength, Lean Body Mass, and Bone Mineral Density: A Twin Study. J Bone Miner Res, 12: 2076-2081. doi:10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.12.2076&lt;/ref&gt; and that about 45% of the variance in muscle fiber proportion is genetic as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchard |first1=Claude |last2=Simoneau |first2=Jean‐Aime |title=Genetic determinism of fiber type proportion in human skeletal muscle |journal=FASEB Journal |date=August 1, 1995 |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1091–1095 |doi=10.1096/fasebj.9.11.7649409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
During puberty in males, hypertrophy occurs at an increased rate. Natural hypertrophy normally stops at full growth in the late teens. As [[testosterone]] is one of the body's major growth hormones, on average, males find hypertrophy much easier (on an absolute scale) to achieve than females and on average, have about 60% more muscle mass than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00235103|title = Gender differences in strength and muscle fiber characteristics|journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 254–262|year = 1993|last1 = Miller|first1 = A. E. J|last2 = MacDougall|first2 = J. D|last3 = Tarnopolsky|first3 = M. A|last4 = Sale|first4 = D. G|hdl = 11375/22586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking additional testosterone, as in [[anabolic steroid]]s, will increase results. It is also considered a [[Doping (sport)|performance-enhancing drug]], the use of which can cause competitors to be suspended or banned from competitions. Testosterone is also a medically regulated substance in most&lt;ref name="urlSearch National Drug Schedule - NAPRA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://napra.ca/pages/Schedules/Search.aspx | title = Search National Drug Schedule - NAPRA | format = |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlControlled Substances Act"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148726.htm |title=Controlled Substances Act |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries, making it illegal to possess without a [[medical prescription]]. Anabolic steroid use can cause [[testicular atrophy]], cardiac arrest,&lt;ref name="pmid16292586"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineschi V, Riezzo I, Centini F, Silingardi E, Licata M, Beduschi G, Karch SB | title = Sudden cardiac death during anabolic steroid abuse: morphologic and toxicologic findings in two fatal cases of bodybuilders | journal = Int. J. Legal Med. | volume = 121 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–53 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16292586 | doi = 10.1007/s00414-005-0055-9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gynecomastia]].&lt;ref name="pmid20139230"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Basaria S | title = Androgen abuse in athletes: detection and consequences | journal = J.

A positive energy balance, when more calories are consumed rather than burned, is required for [[anabolism]] and therefore muscle hypertrophy. An increased requirement for protein, especially branch chained [[amino acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, is required for elevated protein synthesis that is seen in athletes training for muscle hypertrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8494999 |title=Protein requirements and supplementation in strength sports|last=Phillips|first=Stuart|date=July 2004|website=researchgate.net |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training variables, in the context of strength training, such as frequency, intensity, and total volume also directly affect the increase of muscle hypertrophy. A gradual increase in all of these training variables will yield the muscular hypertrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wernbom|first=Mathias|last2=Augustsson|first2=Jesper|last3=Thomeé|first3=Roland|date=March 1, 2007 |title=The Influence of Frequency, Intensity, Volume and Mode of Strength Training on Whole Muscle Cross-Sectional Area in Humans|journal=Sports Medicine|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=225–264|doi=10.2165/00007256-200737030-00004|issn=0112-1642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in protein synthesis and muscle cell biology associated with stimuli==

===Protein synthesis===
{{Main|Protein biosynthesis}}
The message filters down to alter the pattern of [[gene expression]]. The additional contractile proteins appear to be incorporated into existing myofibrils (the chains of [[sarcomere]]s within a muscle cell). There appears to be some limit to how large a myofibril can become: at some point, they split. These events appear to occur within each muscle fiber. That is, hypertrophy results primarily from the growth of each muscle cell, rather than an increase in the number of cells. [[Skeletal muscle]] cells are however unique in the body in that they can contain multiple nuclei, and the number of nuclei can increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruusgaard JC, Johansen IB, Egner IM, Rana ZA, Gundersen K | title = Myonuclei acquired by overload exercise precede hypertrophy and are not lost on detraining | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 34 | pages = 15111–6 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20713720 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0913935107 | pmc=2930527| bibcode = 2010PNAS..10715111B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cortisol]] decreases amino acid uptake by muscle tissue, and inhibits protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Manchester KL | title = Mammalian Protein Metabolism | page = 229 | year = 1970 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-510604-7.50011-6 | chapter = 33 – Sites of Hormonal Regulation of Protein Metabolism | publisher = Academic Press, New York |isbn=978-0-12-510604-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short-term increase in protein synthesis that occurs subsequent to resistance training returns to normal after approximately 28 hours in adequately fed male youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang JE, Perco JG, Moore DR, Wilkinson SB, Phillips SM | title = Resistance training alters the response of fed state mixed muscle protein synthesis in young men | journal = AJP: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology | volume = 294 | issue = 1 | pages = R172–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18032468 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.00636.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study determined that muscle protein synthesis was elevated even 72 hours following training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller BF, Olesen JL, Hansen M, Døssing S, Crameri RM, Welling RJ, Langberg H, Flyvbjerg A, Kjaer M, Babraj JA, Smith K, Rennie MJ | title = Coordinated collagen and muscle protein synthesis in human patella tendon and quadriceps muscle after exercise | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 567 | issue = 3 | pages = 1021–33 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16002437 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2005.093690 | pmc=1474228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small study performed on young and elderly found that ingestion of 340 grams of lean [[beef]] (90&amp;nbsp;g protein) did not increase muscle protein synthesis any more than ingestion of 113 grams of lean [[beef]] (30&amp;nbsp;g protein). In both groups, muscle protein synthesis increased by 50%. The study concluded that more than 30&amp;nbsp;g protein in a single meal did not further enhance the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in young and elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Symons TB, Sheffield-Moore M, Wolfe RR, Paddon-Jones D | title = A Moderate Serving of High-Quality Protein Maximally Stimulates Skeletal Muscle Protein Synthesis in Young and Elderly Subjects | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 109 | issue = 9 | pages = 1582–1586 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19699838 | pmc = 3197704 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2009.06.369}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study didn't check protein synthesis in relation to training; therefore conclusions from this research are controversial.

It is not uncommon for bodybuilders to advise a protein intake as high as 2–4&amp;nbsp;g per kilogram of bodyweight per day.&lt;ref name="urlwww.leehayward.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leehayward.com/protein_part2.htm |title=Bodybuilders and Protein – Part 2 | work = Leehayward.com | accessdate=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific literature has suggested this is higher than necessary, as protein intakes greater than 1.8&amp;nbsp;g per kilogram of body weight showed to have no greater effect on muscle hypertrophy.&lt;ref name="Httpjapphysiologyorgcgicontentabstract"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarnopolsky MA, Atkinson SA, MacDougall JD, Chesley A, Phillips S, Schwarcz HP | title = Evaluation of protein requirements for trained strength athletes | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 1986–95 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1474076| doi = 10.1152/jappl.1992.73.5.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study carried out by American College of Sports Medicine (2002) put the recommended daily protein intake for athletes at 1.2–1.8&amp;nbsp;g per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="Httpjapphysiologyorgcgicontentabstract" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rankin JW | title = Weight Loss and Gain in Athletes | journal = Current Sports Medicine Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 208–13 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12831697 | doi = 10.1249/00149619-200208000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lemon PW | title = Effect of exercise on protein requirements | journal = Journal of Sports Sciences | volume = 9 | pages = 53–70 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1895363 | doi = 10.1080/02640419108729866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Mauro Di Pasquale|Di Pasquale]] (2008), citing recent studies, recommends a minimum protein intake of 2.2 g/kg "for anyone involved in competitive or intense recreational sports who wants to maximize lean body mass but does not wish to gain weight. However athletes involved in strength events (..) may need even more to maximize body composition and athletic performance. In those attempting to minimize body fat and thus maximize body composition, for example in sports with weight classes and in bodybuilding, it's possible that protein may well make up over 50% of their daily caloric intake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A.

Microtrauma, which is tiny damage to the fibers, may play a significant role in muscle growth.&lt;ref name="pmid14715915"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chargé SB, Rudnicki MA | title = Cellular and molecular regulation of muscle regeneration | journal = Physiol. Rev. | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 209–38 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14715915 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00019.2003 | laysummary = http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/musclesgrowLK.html | laysource = Len Kravitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; When microtrauma occurs (from weight training or other strenuous activities), the body responds by overcompensating, replacing the damaged tissue and adding more, so that the risk of repeat damage is reduced. Damage to these fibers has been theorized as the possible cause for the symptoms of [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS), and is why progressive overload is essential to continued improvement, as the body adapts and becomes more resistant to stress. However, work examining the time course of changes in muscle protein synthesis and their relationship to hypertrophy showed that damage was unrelated to hypertrophy.&lt;ref name=pmid27219125&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damas |first1=Felipe |last2=Phillips |first2=Stuart M. |last3=Libardi |first3=Cleiton A. |last4=Vechin |first4=Felipe C. |last5=Lixandrão |first5=Manoel E. |last6=Jannig |first6=Paulo R. |last7=Costa |first7=Luiz A.

==Myofibrillar vs. sarcoplasmic hypertrophy==
{{disputed|date=May 2017}}
In the bodybuilding and fitness community and even in some academic books skeletal muscle hypertrophy is described as being in one of two types: Sarcoplasmic or myofibrillar.{{qualify evidence}} According to this hypothesis, during sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, the volume of [[sarcoplasm]]ic fluid in the muscle cell increases with no accompanying increase in muscular strength, whereas during myofibrillar hypertrophy, [[actin]] and [[myosin]] contractile proteins increase in number and add to muscular strength as well as a small increase in the size of the muscle. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is greater in the muscles of [[bodybuilder]]s because studies suggest sarcoplasmic hypertrophy shows a greater increase in muscle size while myofibrillar hypertrophy proves to increase overall muscular strength making it more dominant in [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWSn4iKgNo8C&amp;pg=PA50|title=Science and practice of strength training|author1=Kraemer, William J.|author2=Zatsiorsky, Vladimir M.|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7360-5628-1|location=Champaign, IL|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two forms of adaptations rarely occur completely independently of one another; one can experience a large increase in fluid with a slight increase in proteins, a large increase in proteins with a small increase in fluid, or a relatively balanced combination of the two.

==In sports==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}

Examples of increased muscle hypertrophy are seen in various [[professional sport]]s, mainly strength related sports such as [[boxing]], [[olympic weightlifting]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[professional wrestling]] and various forms of [[gymnastics]]. Athletes in other more skill-based sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[ice hockey]], and [[soccer]] may also train for increased muscle hypertrophy to better suit their position of play. For example, a [[center (basketball)]] may want to be bigger and more muscular to better overpower his or her opponents in the low post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slamonline.com/nba/chris-bosh-gaining-weight-to-play-center/#5LUvmeqjg2V5wykA.97|title=Chris Bosh Gaining Weight to Play Center|last=Khorshidi|first=Eldon|date=September 10, 2012|work=SLAM|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes training for these sports train extensively not only in [[strength training|strength]] but also in [[cardiovascular]] and [[muscular endurance]] training.

'''''NFL Country''''' is a compilation album released by the [[National Football League]] that featured country musicians performing songs with NFL stars. The album made it to 66 on the [[Top Country Albums]] and was released the same day as ''[[NFL Jams (1996 album)|NFL Jams]]'', an album with a similar concept but with hip hop music instead.

Among the tracks, "[[Let Somebody Else Drive]]" is a re-recording of [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1984 single. "You Never Know Just How Good You've Got It", performed here by [[Glen Campbell]], also appeared on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 1994 album ''[[No Ordinary Man]]'', and "Four Scores and Seven Beers Ago" was previously a single for [[Ray Benson]] in 1991.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] rated the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying that "It's not much more than a novelty item, but as a novelty item, it's pretty entertaining, since the music itself is fairly strong and the athletes do provide a few chuckles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r253715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''PGE Narodowy''' (official name since 2015) or '''National Stadium''' ({{lang-pl|Stadion Narodowy}} {{IPA-pl|ˈstadjɔn narɔˈdɔvɨ|}}) is a retractable roof [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. It is used mostly for football matches and it is the home stadium of [[Poland national football team]].

The stadium has a [[seating capacity]] of 58,145 which makes it the largest association football arena in Poland. Its construction started in 2008 and finished in November 2011. It is located on the site of the former [[10th-Anniversary Stadium]], on Aleja Zieleniecka in [[Praga Południe]] district, near the city center. The stadium has a retractable [[PVC]] roof which unfolds from a nest on a spire suspended above the centre of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euro 2012: Venue guide for European Championship finals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15921248.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retractable roof is inspired by the cable-supported unfolding system of [[Commerzbank-Arena]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], and is similar to the newly renovated roof of [[BC Place]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The stadium is also very similar to the [[Arena Națională]] in [[Bucharest]] in terms of age, capacity and the roof.

The National Stadium hosted the opening match (a group match), the 2 group matches, a quarterfinal, and the semifinal of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]], co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.

The stadium is equipped with a heated pitch, training pitch, façade lighting, and underground parking. It is a multipurpose venue able to host sporting events, concerts, cultural events, and conferences. The official stadium opening took place on 19 January 2012, and the first football match was played on 29 February 2012. The match between the [[Poland national football team|Polish national football team]] and the [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese team]] ended with a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/friendlies/season=2012/matches/round=2000293/match=2009346/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Poland mark Warsaw milestone with Portugal draw|date=29 February 2012|work=UEFA.com|accessdate=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League]] final.

The general contractor of the National Stadium was a German-Austrian-Polish consortium led by Alpine Bau and made up of Alpine Bau Deutschland, Alpine Construction Poland, [[PBG SA]] and Hydrobudowa Poland SA. The completion date was set for 24 months from the signing of the contract and the construction process involved approximately 1,200 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.dziennik.pl/artykuly/148406,minister-ostrzega-budowniczych-stadionu.html|title=Minister ostrzega budowniczych Stadionu|publisher= dziennik.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has a capacity of 58,145 seats for spectators during football matches and up to 72,900 during concerts and other events (including 106 sites for disabled people). The total volume of the stadium (without the roof) is more than 1,000,000 m² and the total area is 204,000 m². The retractable roof structure is 240 × 270 m and the central spire stands at a height of 124 metres above the [[River Vistula]] and 100 m above the pitch. The total length of the lower promenade is 924 meters. The stadium has the largest conference center in Warsaw with a capacity of 1600 people including 25,000 m² of commercial office space. Underground parking for 1765 cars is located beneath the pitch. The stadium contains restaurants, a fitness club, a pub, and 69 luxury skyboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/infrastruktura/stadiony/stadion-narodowy-w-warszawie.html |title=Stadion Narodowy w Warszawie - opis |publisher=2012.org.pl |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509003241/http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/infrastruktura/stadiony/stadion-narodowy-w-warszawie.html |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Warsaw National Stadium before Germany - Italy (4).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The crown of National Stadium with red and white [[façade]] resembling [[Flag of Poland|Polish national colors]]]]
The National Stadium is a multi-sports facility that allows for the organization of sporting events, concerts and cultural events. In addition, it will also serve as an office, market place, hotel, gastronomic point and have other uses. As a result, it is expected that about 2000 to 3000 people will visit the stadium every single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/aktualnosci/stadiony/warszawa-6/39206-stadiony-w-miastach-gospodarzach--nie-tylko-na-euro-2012.html|title=Stadiony w Miastach Gospodarzach – nie tylko na EURO 2012|publisher=2012.org.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043723/http://www.2012.org.pl/pl/aktualnosci/stadiony/warszawa-6/39206-stadiony-w-miastach-gospodarzach--nie-tylko-na-euro-2012.html|archivedate=2013-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facade===
The stadium's [[façade]] refers to the Polish national colors, resembling a waving [[Flag of Poland]] and it consists of silver and red colors. The same palette was used to color the stadium's seating. The facade which consists of painted mesh that was imported from [[Spain]], covers the inner aluminum and glass elevation. The stadium is an open structure, which means the lack of a closed facade, so the temperature inside is similar to the environmental temperature, despite the closed roof construction. Such a construction allows for natural ventilation of rooms placed under the stands and access to natural light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warszawa.gazeta.pl/warszawa/1,34889,9057127,Bialo_czerwona_elewacja_wkrotce_na_Stadionie_Narodowym.html |title=Biało-czerwona elewacja wkrótce na Stadionie Narodowym |publisher=warszawa.gazeta.pl |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:POL Stadion Narodowy Warszawa 12.jpg|thumb|240px|right|''[[Tip-up seat|Tip-up]]'' standard stadium seats, type: FCB in red and silver colors]]
Elevations are stretched on a powerful construction of the pipes that were manufactured in [[Italy]]. This structure is completely independent from the concrete stand construction and it is fundamental to the retractable stadium’s roof. Thanks to this, designers could freely design the space under the stands.

===The pitch===
The stadium is equipped with a heated pitch. The pitch is installed with a lawn of Dutch grass, cultivated in [[Heythuysen]], the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nederlandse bedrijven leveren grasmat voor EK Voetbal in Polen en Oekraïne|url=http://fd.nl/entrepreneur/wereldveroveraars/948045-1205/nederlandse-bedrijven-leveren-grasmat-voor-ek-voetbal-in-polen-en-oekrane|publisher=Financiele Dagblad|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hendriks Graszoden|url=http://www.stadionwelt-business.de/index.php?rubrik=ausstattung&amp;site=firmen&amp;firma=hendriks_graszoden&amp;head=Hendriks-Graszoden-BV&amp;id=130&amp;kat=rasen|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=Stadionwelt-Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the organization of events such as concerts, the pitch will be covered with special panel, which must be removed within 5 days of its installation. A second option: to install a grass field on a special floating platform, was discarded due to it being too expensive.

===The grandstands===
The National Stadium was designed by the German-Polish consortium gmp Architects von Gerkan, Marg and Partners, J.S.K Architekci Sp. z o.o. and sbp—schlaich bergermann und partner (the design by Volkwin Marg and Hubert Nienhoff with Markus Pfisterer, Zbigniew Pszczulny, Mariusz Rutz, Marcin Chruslinski).

The structure is composed of two-level stands—top and bottom—with a capacity for 58,145 spectators. All seating in the National Stadium was provided by Polish company Forum Seating (part of the [[Nowy Styl Group]] located in [[Krosno]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/regionalne/warszawa/nowa-murawa-juz-na-stadionie-narodowym,1,5130440,wiadomosc.html|title= Nowa murawa już na Stadionie Narodowym |publisher= onet.pl |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 900 seats for media and press, more than 4,600 so-called "premium seats", designed for special guests, 106 seats for disabled people and more than 800 seats in the VIP lodges.

[[File:POL Stadion Narodowy Warszawa 09.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The unique retractable roof [[membrane]] during the process of opening]]
Under the stands, there are changing rooms, conference halls and living areas with a total area of 130 000 m². The building has eight stories with varied heights. The highest point at the stands, is located 41 meters above the former 10th-Anniversary Stadium pitch, while the highest point of the steel roof structure is 70 meters above that level. The roof can cover not only the stands, but also the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stadiony.net/aktualnosci/2011/04/narodowy_krzeselka_juz_sa_a_bedzie_wiecej|title=Narodowy: Krzesełka już są, a będzie więcej|work=stadiony.net|publisher=stadiony.net|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retractable roof===
Partially transparent, the retractable roof was made of fibreglass covered with [[teflon]]. This kind of material is resistant to weather factors (rain, the heat of the sun, and can hold up to 18&amp;nbsp;cm of wet snow) and the crease tendency. The production technology comes from German company Hightex GmbH, and the textile was produced in Bangkok by the Asia Membrane Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://warszawa.gazeta.pl/warszawa/1,34889,10698125,Stadion_Narodowy_symbolem_Warszawy__Koniec_budowy.html |title=Stadion Narodowy symbolem Warszawy. Koniec budowy |publisher=gazeta.pl |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of opening or closing the roof takes about 20 minutes and it can only be performed at temperatures above 5&amp;nbsp;°C and not during rain (this was the reason for a one-day postponement of the football match against England on 16 October 2012). A drive system is used for stretching the [[membrane]] during the process of opening and for folding the material during the process of closing the roof. The total weight of the steel-cables supporting the roof structure is 1,200 tons. Under the roof there are four [[LED display]] screens, each with an area of 200 m².

==Construction history==

===Preparations===
[[File:Stadion Narodowy - Wisla.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Night view of the National Stadium and the [[Świętokrzyski Bridge]] from the left bank of the [[Vistula]]]]
On {{date|February 1, 2008}}, the consortium of JSK Architects Ltd., GMP—von Gerkan, Marg und Partner Architekten and SBP—Schleich Bergermann und Partner presented a conceptual design (visualization and scale model) of a new stadium.&lt;ref name="urbanity.pl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.urbanity.pl/wiadomosc1355/stadion-narodowy-ministerstwo-rekomenduje-trzy-projekty|title=Stadion Narodowy: ministerstwo rekomenduje trzy projekty |publisher=urbanity.pl |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pre-construction work began on {{date|May 15, 2008}} when 126 concrete piles were driven into the soil of the basin of the old stadium's grandstand. On {{date|June 18, 2008}}, the National Sports Centre Ltd submitted documents required to obtain a [[construction permit]] from the [[voivode#Poland|governor]] of [[Masovian Voivodeship|Masovia]].&lt;ref name="urbanity.pl"/&gt; This was approved on {{date|July 22, 2008}}, and on {{date|26 September 2008}}, an agreement with Pol-Aqua SA to implement the first stage of construction work was signed. A few days later, on {{date|7 October 2008}}, the construction of the stadium began.

On the construction site, close to the National Sports Centre, an outdoor webcam was installed. Broadcasting started on {{date|31 October 2008}} and people could track the progress of construction. Since the start of the second stage of construction on {{date|29 June 2009}}, the entire process was also viewable from a second camera installed on a tower at Washington Roundabout. Images from the cameras are still available on the official websites of the stadium.

===Main process===
[[File:Wał MiedzeszyńskiNationalStadium.JPG|thumb|left|310px|National Stadium as it seen from ''aleja Józefa Poniatowskiego'' in September 2012]]
The first stage of construction included the demolition of concrete structures of the 10th-Anniversary Stadium, preparation of the ground, driving about 7000 concrete piles into the soil, construction of 6700 gravel and concrete columns, and the building of approximately 900 [[Pile driver|construction piles]] that now form the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zw.com.pl/artykul/2,292388_Ruszyla_budowa_Stadionu_Narodowego.html|title=Ruszyła budowa Stadionu Narodowego|publisher=zyciewarszawy.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2009 the pile driving process was completed, and exactly one month later, opening of the offers from companies wishing to implement the second stage of the stadium construction took place. The best offer was introduced by German-Austrian-Polish consortium of companies - Alpine Bau Deutschland AG, Alpine Bau GmbH and Alpine Construction Poland Ltd., Hydrobudowa Poland SA and PBG SA and it was worth 1 252 755 008.64 [[zł]].

At the end of September, the first construction elements were visible from outside the stadium. The [[cornerstone]] (foundation stone) and a [[time capsule]] were set during the ceremony held on 7 October 2009. The time capsule contained flags of [[flag of Poland|Poland]], the [[Flag of Europe|European Union]] and the city of [[Flag of Warsaw|Warsaw]], [[newspaper]]s of the day, [[coin]]s, [[banknote]]s, and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zyciewarszawy.pl/artykul/48,408569_Fundamenty_Narodowego_wzmocnia_gazety_i_bilon.html|title=Fundamenty Narodowego wzmocnią gazety i bilon |work =Robert Biskupski |publisher=zyciewarszawy.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January the first element of the roof structure arrived at the construction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stadionnarodowy.org.pl/aktualnosci/pierwszy-element-pierscienia-dachu-juz-na-stadionie|title=Pierwszy element pierścienia dachu już na Stadionie |publisher=stadionnarodowy.org.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This element was 1 of 72 that became part of the massive steel roof structure. Each of them weighs about 48 tons and is 12.5 meters tall. The completion of installation of all [[Prefabrication|prefabricated elements]] took place by 13 August 2010, which represented the entire structure of the stadium stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stadionnarodowy.org.pl/aktualnosci/trybuny-na-narodowym-gotowe|title=Trybuny na Narodowym gotowe! |publisher=stadionnarodowy.org.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later all concrete works were finished.

On 16 December 2010 at the headquarters of the National Sports Centre a press conference took place dedicated to the so-called ‘big lift operation’ at the stadium. The conference discussed the main principles of the process, one of the most technologically
[[File:Warsaw National Stadium before Germany - Italy (6).jpg|thumb|right|290px|Interior of the National Stadium before the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] semi-final match between [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 28 June 2012]]
advanced operations in the world and the first such project in [[Europe]]. No major problems occurred during this operation and ‘big lift’ was finalized on January 4, 2011. On this occasion, in the presence of [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Donald Tusk]] and [[Mayor of Warsaw]] [[Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz]], a ceremony of symbolic topping-out was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wnp.pl/wiadomosci/129328.html|title=Na Stadionie Narodowym zawisła wiecha|work=PAP |publisher=wnp.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completion and opening===
The National Stadium was originally planned to be completed on 30 June 2011. The stadium was scheduled to be opened to the public on July 22, 2011, while its official opening was scheduled to take place on August 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://warszawa.gazeta.pl/warszawa/1,34889,8844974,Gwiazdy_i_orgia_swiatel_na_otwarcie_Stadionu_Narodowego.html|title=Gwiazdy i orgia świateł na otwarcie Stadionu Narodowego|work =Michał Wojtczuk |publisher=gazeta.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to ongoing construction the event was moved to January 2012 and only an inaugural illumination of the facade of the stadium took place in August. A match against the [[Germany national football team]] had been scheduled on 6 September 2011 but this was relocated to [[Gdańsk]], because the National Stadium wasn't ready yet.

Construction work was officially completed on 29 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stadionnarodowy.org.pl/aktualnosci/1388,wykonawca-spelnil-warunki-ostatecznego-wezwania-przekazanego-przez-ncs|title=Wykonawca spełnił warunki ostatecznego wezwania przekazanego przez NCS |publisher=stadionnarodowy.org.pl|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, Rafał Kapler - The NCS President submitted to the [[site manager]] an application needed to get a [[certificate of occupancy]]. The official opening ceremony of the stadium took place on 29 January 2012. The event was celebrated by concerts by Polish celebrities: [[Voo Voo]] and Haydamaky, [[Zakopower]], [[Coma (band)|Coma]], [[T. Love]], [[Lady Pank]] and ended with an evening fireworks show. On 10 February 2012, installation of heating and irrigation systems and the pitch installation was completed.

The '''Palais des Sports Léopold-Drolet''' is a 3,646-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]], Canada. It was built in 1965. Starting in 2012, this arena was renovated and is now home to the [[Sherbrooke Phoenix]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapresse.ca/la-tribune/sherbrooke/201201/31/01-4491145-palais-des-sports-les-sherbrookois-paieront-plus-cher.php La Tribune, Palais des sports: les Sherbrookois paieront plus cher]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in neighbouring [[Montreal]], it hosted four women and five men's [[Handball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|team handball]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1976/1976v2.pdf 1976 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 212-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1976/1976v3.pdf 1976 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 3. pp. 349-51, 355-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was home to the [[Sherbrooke Castors]] [[ice hockey]] [[team]], before their move to [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], [[Maine]] as the [[Lewiston Maineiacs]] in 2003. It was also home to two AHL hockey teams, the [[Sherbrooke Jets]], and the [[Sherbrooke Canadiens]] who became the [[Fredericton Canadiens]] in 1990. With the recent folding of the Lewiston Maineiacs, Sherbrooke will be getting an expansion QMJHL team ([[Sherbrooke Phoenix]]) for the 2012-13 and the team will play at the renovated Palais De Sports. The team will be owned by a group led by former NHL goaltender [[Jocelyn Thibault]].

It held the 2015 QMJHL Draft on June 7, 2015.

'''Paleta frontón''' is a [[Peru]]vian sport that was born in the capital, [[Lima]], in 1945. This sport has its roots in the "[[Basque pelota|pelota vasca]]" brought by the Spanish conquerors, and the domestic "pelota mano", called "handball" at that time due to English influence. Paleta is typically played on the high peaks of their mountainous terrain.

[[Image:Paleta Fronton 2.jpg|thumb|150px|A paleta frontón court]]

A wooden, carbon fiber or glass fiber paddle and a black rubber ball are required to play paleta frontón. The court contains a concrete wall {{convert|5|m}} high by {{convert|6|m}} wide. There are lines on the court limiting the play area and marking the reception zones, similar to [[tennis]]. The paddle is made from Peruvian oak typically logged near water based townships. The chopping of the tree is a celebration for younger males becoming men. The celebration is a seven-day festival.

The [[Federación Peruana de Paleta Frontón]] (FDPPF) is in charge of regulating the sport. The official rules, written in the "Reglamento Oficial", are provided to each player for free. The official judge of the match is called the "Wes". The FDPPF is also in charge of organizing two national championships, the regionals and the "Campeón de Campeones" (''Champion of Champions'') tournament.

'''Pitton''' is a [[List of racquet sports|racquet sport]] played by two teams of up to four people with a [[Shuttlecock|birdie]] and a hard [[pickleball]] paddle.  It is a combination of pickleball and [[badminton]].

==History and Development==
Pitton originated in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Its origins can be traced to [[Everett School District#Heatherwood Middle School|Heatherwood Middle School]] in the [[Everett School District]].&lt;ref name="Pitton Documentation" /&gt; Pitton's name is derived from '''pi'''ckleball and badmin'''ton'''.

==Rules==
The following information is a simplified summary of the rules of pitton.

===Playing court dimensions===
[[File:Badminton court 3d.svg|right|thumb|400px|Pitton court, [[isometric projection|isometric]] view]]
The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play.

The full width of the court is 6.1 meters (20&amp;nbsp;ft). The full length of the court is 13.4 meters (44&amp;nbsp;ft). The service courts are marked by a center line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 meters (6&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 meters (2&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the back boundary.
The net is 1.55 meters (5&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;inch) high at the edges and 1.524 meters (5&amp;nbsp;ft) high in the center. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Rules of Pitton. Nonetheless, a pitton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

The '''Power Pad''' (known in [[Japan]] as '''Family Trainer''', and in [[Europe]] and briefly in the [[United States]] as '''Family Fun Fitness''') is a floor mat game controller for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is a gray mat with twelve pressure-sensors embedded between two layers of flexible plastic. It was originally developed by [[Bandai]].

Bandai first released the accessory in 1986 as the ''Family Trainer'' pack for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System#The Nintendo Family Computer|Famicom]] in Japan, and later released in the United States. Nintendo released it in 1988 as the Power Pad,&lt;ref&gt;Bogost, Ian (2005). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110626154556/https://www.exergamefitness.com/pdf/The%20Rhetoric%20of%20Exergaming.pdf The Rhetoric of Exergaming]. [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Retrieved on 8 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the game ''[[Stadium Events|World Class Track Meet]]'', which was a rebranding of an earlier game.

==Overview==
The Power Pad was originally released by Bandai as the ''Family Trainer'' in Japan in 1986, and  as the  ''Family Fun Fitness'' both in North America and Europe in 1987 and 1988 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11339534/Is-this-the-worlds-most-expensive-computer-game.html&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Nintendo acquired the rights from Bandai for the accessory in North America and renamed it the Power Pad, with the remaining Family Fun Fitness mats recalled from stores.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/66183/10-very-rare-and-very-expensive-video-games&lt;/ref&gt; Bandai retained the rights to the product outside of North America.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifewire.com/stadium-events-history-729683&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NES Family Fun Fitness.JPG|thumbnail|European version Family Fun Fitness.]]
The Power Pad accessory is laid out in front of the video display for various games, generally plugged into the second NES controller port, with players stepping on the large buttons to control gameplay. There are two illustrated sides to the pad: Side A, which is rarely used, has eight buttons, while side B has twelve buttons numbered 1-12.

Games using the Power Pad often test players on their timing and coordination, memory, "running" speed, or allow them to play music with their steps. Games such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' can trace the lineage of their control mechanisms back to the Power Pad (see [[dance pad]]).&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Andrew. ''[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/03/ne-music-game-feature.ars Roots of rhythm: a brief history of the music game genre]''. [[Ars Technica]]. 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Chris. ''[http://www.1up.com/features/out-of-control?pager.offset=3 Out of Control: The Craziest Game Controllers Evar - Atari Vs. NES]''. [[1UP.com]]. 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
In 2007, [[Namco Bandai Games]] announced that the Power Pad would see a reappearance for the [[Wii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/820/820944p1.html |title=The Power Pad Returns |publisher=IGN |date=2007-09-18 |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the pad will also work in conjunction with the [[Wii Remote]]. It was released as ''[[Active Life: Outdoor Challenge]]'' in North America &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyes |first=Emma |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6179193.html |title=TGS '07: Namco Bandai embraces Active Life |publisher= Gamespot |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as ''Family Trainer Athletic World'' in Japan and ''Family Trainer'' in Europe) in 2008. Its sequel ''[[Active Life: Extreme Challenge]]'' was released in 2009.

==Compatible games==
The following is a list of all 11 video games which were created for use with the accessory. The games were developed by [[Human Entertainment]] except for the last three entries in the series. All but one of them were published by Bandai, though some were localized in North America by Nintendo.

|release= Famicom, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]
|notes= {{nihongo|'''''Athletic World'''''|アスレチックワールド}} was developed by [[Human Entertainment]] and published by [[Bandai]] in [[Japan]] in {{vgy|1986}} and in [[North America]] in {{vgy|1987}}. ''Athletic World'' was the first of ten games Bandai released for the Family Trainer series. The first edition of the game in North America features the '''Family Fun Fitness''' logo on the label and box art, and also a mention of compatibility only with FFF accessory.  Once Nintendo of America bought the rights to the Family Fun Fitness pad in North America, Bandai re-released ''Athletic World'' with an updated different box art, this time displaying compatibility with the Power Pad.  The original North American box art is now a rare item for collectors. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfgeneration.com/forum/index.php?topic=6196.msg93355&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the box art, the label featured on the cartridge itself did not experienced a major change for the reprint of the game; the only difference being the removal of "Family Fun Fitness" references on the sticker. No change at all was made to the [[ROM file]] for the second edition of ''Athletic World'' which retains the original 1987 titlescreen with the in-game mention "Family Fun Fitness". 

''Athletic World'' simulates five different [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-style challenges — [[Hurdles]], Hop A Log, Animal Trail, Rafting, and Dark Tunnel. Movements in the game are controlled by the player physically running, jumping, and stepping on the pad in a similar fashion to modern dance pad games. Each challenge is designed to train the player in a different manner.  Hurdles tests the player on timing, while Dark Tunnel challenges the player's [[dexterity]].  This game also offers the unique feature of having players' game play experience tailored to them by asking for their Name, Age, Gender, and the current date to provide them with customized advice.

|notes= {{nihongo|'''''Running Stadium'''''|ランニングスタジアム|Ranningu Sutajiamu}} was published by [[Bandai]] and was released in Japan in {{vgy|1986}} and in North America in {{vgy|1987}} under the title '''''Stadium Events'''''. However, shortly after release, Nintendo purchased the North American rights to the Family Fun Fitness series and decided to market this particular game themselves. As a result, ''[[Stadium Events]]'' was renamed and repackaged under the title '''''World Class Track Meet''''', and copies of Bandai's ''Stadium Events'' were pulled from store shelves. The North American release of ''Stadium Events'' has become the [[Stadium Events#Rarity|hardest to find]] game available on the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Despite the changes, ''Stadium Events'' and ''World Class Track Meet'' are identical to one another, aside from the titlescreen. 

The game features an Olympics-style competition, with events such as the 100m dash, 110m hurdles, long jump, and triple jump. Race opponents were named after animals, the slowest being Turtle and the fastest being Cheetah.

There have been three versions of '''George Taylor Richardson Memorial Stadium,''' a [[Canadian football]] [[stadium]] located on the campus of the [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. All three have been the home of the [[Queen's Golden Gaels|Golden Gaels]]/Gaels football team. The facilities are named in memory of [[George Richardson (ice hockey)|George Taylor Richardson]], a Queen's graduate renowned for his athleticism and sportsmanship who died in the First World War. 

The original stadium built in 1921 was funded by George's brother, [[James Armstrong Richardson, Sr.|James Armstrong Richardson]], graduate and [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of Queen's. 

The second stadium was built in 1971. The stadium's bleachers (which recycled steel from the first facility) were deemed structurally unsafe in May 2013, causing 6,500 seats to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhig.com/2013/05/03/upper-bleachers-at-richardson-stadium-deemed-unsafe&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations were completed in July 2013, with a new seat capacity of 8,500 with two new end zone seating sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=QJsports|author=QJ Sports|number=362605365898129408|date=31 July 2013|title=With new temporary bleachers, Richardson Stadium's capacity will be roughly 8,500 for football season - about 1,700 less than before.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2014, a $20.27 million revitalization was announced that was completed for September 17, 2016 for its inaugural football game. According to the university the facility has "over 8,000" seats, but no specific number is provided by the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardsonstadium.com/amenities.html|title=Amenities|website=www.richardsonstadium.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/board-approves-stadium-revitalization Board approves stadium revitalization] from ''Queen's Gazette'', 9 December 2014, retrieved 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/connect/richardsonstadium/|title=Richardson Stadium Revitalization|publisher=Queen's University|date=3 August 2016|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Original Field (1921–1971)===

The original field was located on Union Street at the present site of Mackintosh-Corry Hall and its parking lot. It was opened in 1921 on a piece of land bought from a community of nuns. This field hosted the [[10th Grey Cup|1922 Grey Cup]], where the Golden Gaels defeated the [[Edmonton Elks]] 13–1, for their first of three Grey Cups. The official attendance was listed at 4,700. According to Michael Januska's book, ''Grey Cup Century'' there were more spectators on hand than the original grandstand could accommodate. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The 10th Grey Cup was the only final played in Kingston, Ontario. The stands at Richardson Stadium were filled to capacity, just under 5,000, with the overflow standing around the field." - ''Grey Cup Century'', pg. 46&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=iM02FnDRZMIC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=richardson+stadium+10th+grey+cup&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m4Ib9E6Kkv&amp;sig=UOPbs-4OeLXokQUQxsQry4p1iLw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiosOhzavZAhUO9WMKHZuMA20Q6AEIWjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=richardson%20stadium%2010th%20grey%20cup&amp;f=false|title=Grey Cup Century|last=Januska|first=Michael|date=2012-09-22|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781459704480|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] received his [[honorary degree]] from Queen's on August 18, 1938 at Richardson, where he made a historic speech that was seen as a departure from [[Quarantine Speech|American isolationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Second stadium (1971–2016) ===
[[Image:Queen'sRichardson.jpg|250px|left|thumb| The West (alumni and public) stands at the second Richardson Memorial Stadium]]
When a new social sciences complex, Mackintosh-Corry Hall was planned, the original stadium was torn down and relocated to the newly acquired West Campus. Many staff, students, and alumni were very upset about the move, feeling that the stadium belonged in the heart of campus, but the project went ahead anyway and the stadium was built on West Campus in 1971.

In 2013, [[seating capacity]] was reduced to 8,500, down from 10,200, because of the temporary bleachers due to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=QJsports|author=QJ Sports|number=362605365898129408|date=31 July 2013|title=With new temporary bleachers, Richardson Stadium's capacity will be roughly 8,500 for football season - about 1,700 less than before.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third stadium (2016–) ===
Plans to reconstruct the 40-year-old stadium at the same location were approved in December 2014, with $20.27 million of funding needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2014-12-08/sports/queens-approves-construction-new-stadium/|title=Queen's Approves Construction of New Stadium|publisher=Queen's Journal|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal Daniel Woolf stated that the stadium was "desperately in need of revitalization". $17 million was raised from donations, including $10 million from former Gaels football player and current [[Guelph Gryphons]] head coach Stu Lang. Construction began on December 5, 2015 and the stadium re-opened for the beginning of the 2016 football season on September 17, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2016-01-11/news/richardson-stadium-then-and-now/|title=Richardson Stadium Then and Now|date=12 January 2016|publisher=Queen's Journal|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer==
Richardson played host to two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] 2006 qualifiers between [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] and [[Belize]] in 2004. Canada won both matches 4–0 and progressed to the semifinal stage after [[Belize]] had forfeited their right to play a home match due to a lack of infrastructure.  

== Rugby League ==
It hosted the [[Colonial Cup (rugby league)|Colonial Cup]] match between the [[United States national rugby league team|U.S. Tomahawks]] and [[Canada national rugby league team|Canada Wolverines]] on September 19, 2010 which was the first international [[rugby league]] match played in Canada since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadarugbyleague.com/news/article.php?id=10052 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708113850/http://www.canadarugbyleague.com/news/article.php?id=10052 |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4619">'''Spartan Cricket Club''' is a cricket club in [[Barbados]].

Spartan was formed in 1893 as a club for [[middle-class]] black and creole cricketers who were denied entry into all-white cricket clubs such as [[Wanderers Cricket Club|Wanderers]] and [[Pickwick Cricket Club|Pickwick]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandiford, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural president of the club was Sir [[William Conrad Reeves]], Chief Justice of Barbados and other members consisted mostly of "lawyers, medical practitioners, elite schoolmasters, higher level civil servants and the few non-whites to have penetrated the managerial levels of the business, commercial and plantation worlds."&lt;ref&gt;Stoddart, pp. 327&amp;ndash;328.&lt;/ref&gt; The club played its matches at the Belleville ground in [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]] and the first captain of the club was [[George Learmond (cricketer)|George Learmond]].&lt;ref name=Sandiford12&gt;Sandiford, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket in Barbados at the time was strictly divided by colour and class. Spartan was seen as a middle-class club and in its early years efforts to admit working-class cricketers met with some resistance. In 1899, the club was divided about the admission of [[Fitz Hinds]]&amp;mdash;a talented cricketer who had previously worked as a groundsman at Pickwick Cricket Club. After his admission, many of his team-mates refused to play with him.&lt;ref name=Sandiford12/&gt; The club was split again in 1913 when [[Herman Griffith]] attempted to join the club. Considered "too poor to enter", he was denied admission. This attitude distressed a significant minority of the club who split and established a club for working-class blacks, [[Empire Cricket Club]] in 1914. Spartan and Empire developed a strong rivalry.&lt;ref name=Sandiford16&gt;Sandiford, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after Barbadian independence, members of Spartan Cricket Club were influential members of Barbadian society, including [[Grantley Adams]], the first Premier of Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;Stoddart, p. 328 "Interviewees invariably pointed to the fact that all post-independence Governors-General and Prime Ministers have been Spartan men, not to mention a preponderance of politicians and senior civil servants."&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that Spartan has "produced more &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[West Indies]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Test cricket]]ers than any other [club] in the Caribbean".&lt;ref name=Benn&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilde|first=Simon|title=Wisdom of Sulieman Benn|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article5733170.ece|accessdate=30 June 2011|newspaper=Sunday Times|date=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club now plays its games at Queen's Park in [[Bridgetown]].&lt;ref name=QueensPark&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenkley|first=Stephen|title=Timely rock for cradle of the Caribbean|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/timely-rock-for-cradle-of-the-caribbean-558859.html|accessdate=30 June 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tank McNamara''''' is a daily syndicated [[comic strip]] written by [[Jeff Millar]] and illustrated by [[Bill Hinds]]. The strip debuted in 1974. Hinds took over writing after the death of Millar in late November 2012 due to bile duct cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cavna|first=Michael|title=RIP, JEFF MILLAR: ‘Tank McNamara’ co-creator Bill Hinds memorializes his good friend’s ‘bewildered’ sense of humor [UPDATED]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/rip-jeff-millar-tank-mcnamara-co-creator-bill-hinds-memorializes-his-good-friends-bewildered-sense-of-humor/2012/12/03/e0a9f574-3d5d-11e2-ae43-cf491b837f7b_blog.html|accessdate=December 9, 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character is a local sports television reporter who used to be a [[defensive lineman]] in the [[National Football League]], hence his name (whether nickname or given name is unclear). The strip focuses primarily on contemporary American athletics, which allows it to remain topical and also to dabble in related subjects such as politics and social issues.

==Characters and story==
Before becoming a multi-sport broadcaster and reporter, Tank McNamara played college football for "Enormous State University" (team name: the Sandcrabs), which serves the role of a generic [[NCAA Division I]] university with problem-plagued athletic programs. The local professional teams are fictional American major-league franchises (baseball's "Bashers"; [[American football|football]]'s "Smashers"; [[ice hockey]]'s "Igloos"; basketball's "Stuffers"). The strip also portrays fictional sponsors, including "Heavy Beer", spoofing the [[light beer]] ads that are so common in American sports broadcasts. It also features caricatures of many real figures from sports. A scientist named Dr. Tszap (also spelled Tzap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2014/07/26|title=Tank McNamara strip for July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) develops strange products intended to help sports teams.

In earlier years, Tank was portrayed as a buffoon ex-professional athlete (an [[NFL]] defensive [[linebacker]], jersey number 55) unqualified to do his journalistic job. Recurring gags focused on Tank's "fumble-mouth" mistakes (such as presenting the "Norts Spews"), and on his tendency to jump on anything loose on the floor as if it were a [[fumble]]d football. An annual feature was a Christmas tale of Tank's last minute quest to obtain that year's "must have" toy for his nephew.

Tanks' overprotective mother and his father Ed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2014/12/29|title=Tank McNamara strip for December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; make occasional appearances.

Tank has matured with the strip, which has gone on to highlight his loyalty, inherently gentle nature, and good heart. Recent years have seen several sequences dealing with Tank's youthful indiscretions. His behavior is never as damning as he believes it to have been, and he is always deeply sorry for his actions. While these sequences flesh out the background of Tank's character, they show the reader that he has always been a decent human being.

Tank, who is a bachelor portrayed as being vulnerable to romantic injury, began seriously dating a woman named Angela in 2005. Angela works at his TV station, and the two met after she beat him in the station's 2005 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] pool, despite choosing teams based on their uniform colors. Angela is the single mother of an athletically gifted son to whom Tank serves as a father figure, and she has eschewed competing in sports since a youthful tennis talent took over her life. She accompanies Tank to many work assignments, often assisting him in undercover reporting.
[[File:Tankstrip.gif|thumb|400px|right|Example of contemporary sports-based social commentary and humor utilized in ''Tank McNamara'' (September 4, 2007)]]

In November 2012, Tank agreed to escort a producer named Natalie to the Women in Media Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2012/10/22|title=Tank McNamara strip for October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2012/11/09|title=Tank McNamara strip for November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that he and Angela were "taking time off from each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2012/11/12|title=Tank McNamara strip for November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angela also confirmed that she was seeing someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2012/11/14|title=Tank McNamara strip for November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank is still friends with Buck Baker, a [[quarterback]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2017/10/28|title=Tank McNamara strip for October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he protected as a [[Lineman (gridiron football)|lineman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/tankmcnamara/2017/10/31|title=Tank McNamara strip for October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Tank's neighbors Nick and Kate had their own comic strip, ''Second Chances'', from 1996 to 2000.

==Social issues==
The strip consistently addresses contemporary social problems related to sports, including gambling addiction, [[anabolic steroid|steroids]], the arrests of pro athletes, and athlete salaries. Sometimes these issues are portrayed fictionally, as when Tank's [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Little Brother]] battles an online gambling problem, but sometimes the strip treats specific controversies by naming names. One popular example is its Sports Jerk of the Year award, which allows readers to nominate the figure they have found most objectionable and then vote on who is the worst. Previous "winners" include [[Terrell Owens]] (2x), [[Bud Selig]] (2x), [[Daniel Snyder]], [[John Rocker]], [[Lleyton Hewitt]], [[Latrell Sprewell]], [[Ronald Curry]] and [[Roberto Alomar]].  Marking the strip's fortieth anniversary in 2014, readers were invited to submit nominations for the Sports Jerk of the last 40 years, which was "won" by [[Lance Armstrong]], with [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Pete Rose]] as runners-up.

==Cartoonists==
Jeffrey Lynn Millar was born July 10, 1942 in [[Pasadena, Texas]]. He graduated from [[The University of Texas]].

Jeff Millar reviewed movies for ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'', the newspaper where he worked from 1965 until his retirement in 2000. In addition to writing ''Tank McNamara'', he wrote a humor column for the paper. His autobiographical comic strip ''Second Chances'' ran from 1996 to 2000. Other works included the novel ''Private Sector'' and three plays, including ''The Rice''.

Millar died after a four-year battle with [[Cholangiocarcinoma|biliary cancer]] November 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Millar-Chronicle-reviewer-and-comic-strip-4082470.php|title=Millar, Chronicle reviewer and comic strip writer, dies at 70|last=Tolson|first=Mike|work=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Hinds (born April 21, 1950, Houston, Texas) is a graduate of Stephen F. Austin University. Hinds illustrated ''Tank McNamara'' with co-creator and writer Jeff Millar from 1974 to 2012, when he also took over writing due to Millar's failing health.

In addition to ''Tank McNamara'', Bill created, writes and draws the feature ''Buzz Beamer'' in the monthly ''Sports Illustrated Kids''.  His ''Buzz'' work can be found online at sikids.com [http://www.sikids.com/buzzs-laugh-locker Buzz animation]

Bill created a parent/kids/sports strip, ''[[Cleats (comics strip)|Cleats]]'', which ran from 2001 to 2010. ''Cleats'' [http://www.gocomics.com/cleats/#.U1beVseM4r0 reruns] can be found on GoComics.com.

He also illustrated the feature ''According to Guinness'' for ten years, and created two experimental short-lived comic strips ''Clown Alley'' and ''Longshots'' for the Philadelphia Inquirer Sunday page.

Hinds collaborated with writing partner Millar on the "Second Chances" strip.

Bill Hinds received the National Cartoonist Society divisional award for Sports Cartoons in 1986 and their New Media Award in 2000. He received an additional nomination for the New Media Award in 2002.

Hinds has held seats on the board of the National Cartoonists Society and the Newspaper Features Council.

He lives with his wife, Lisa, in Spring, Texas. They have three children.

==Cultural legacy==
* In the NBC-TV series ''[[Seinfeld (TV series)|Seinfeld]]'', episode No. 142 "[[The Chicken Roaster]]", [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] refuses to give up his copy of a newspaper to his college friend Seth because he "hasn't read ''Tank McNamara'' yet".
* [[Robert B. Parker]]'s detective character [[Spenser (character)|Spenser]] is a fan of Tank, often making comments such as reading it twice to make sure there wasn't a clue hidden in it.
