      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">''''Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As''' (died 684 CE/65 AH, the son of [['Amr ibn al-'As]] of [[Banu Sahm]]) was a [[Sahaba|companion]] of the [[Islamic]] prophet [[Muhammad]]. He was the author of "''Al-Sahifah al-Sadiqah''" ("''The Truthful Script''", {{lang-ar | الصحيفة الصادقة}}), a [[hadith]] compilation document which recorded about one thousand of [[Muhammad]]'s narrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoeler|first=Gregor|title=The oral and the written in early Islam|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-415-39495-3|author2=James Edward Montgomery, Uwe Vagelpohl|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gülen|first=Fethullah|title=The Messenger of God Muhammad: an analysis of the Prophet's life|year=2005|publisher=Tughra Books|isbn=1-932099-83-2|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He embraced Islam in the year 7 [[Hijri year|AH]] a year before his father did, [[Amr ibn al-'As]]. The prophet Muhammad used to show preference to Abd Allah ibn 'Amr due to his knowledge. He was one of the first companions to write down the Hadith, after receiving permission from prophet Muhammad to do so. [[Abu Huraira]] used to say that Abd Allah ibn 'Amr was more knowledgeable than him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitaba.org/Content.aspx?cid=20 Biography of Abdullah Ibn Amr ibn al-'As]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Introduction&gt;An Introduction to the Conservation of Hadith (In the Light of [[Sahifah Hammam ibn Munabbih]]), Dr. Hamidullah, Islamic Book Trust, {{ISBN|978-983-9154-94-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work Al-Sahifah al-Sadiqah remained in his family and was used by his grandson 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] incorporated the whole of the work of Abd Allah ibn 'Amr in his voluminous book [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] thereby covering up for the missing Al-Sahifah al-Sadiqah which was written in the days of Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref name=Introduction/&gt;

'''Perry Shaw''' (born Jan 21, 1994), professionally known as '''88Rackz''', is an English [[record producer]] from [[Milton Keynes]], [[United Kingdom]].

== Early life ==
Born in [[Slough]], [[United Kingdom]], Rackz speaks of first being inspired to produce music at the age of 21 shortly after moving to [[Milton Keynes]]. He started out producing on '''FL Studio''' (formerly known as '''FruityLoops''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flstudio.image-line.com/documents/history.php?entry_id=1286984399&amp;title=10|title=History|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|work=FL Studio|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026044232/http://flstudio.image-line.com/documents/history.php?entry_id=1286984399&amp;title=10|archivedate=2011-10-26|accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed by the Belgian company [[Image-Line]].

After teaching himself the basics of FL Studio, Rackz began to spend a lot of time learning the art of producing &amp; then began to publish his material on [[YouTube]] and beat selling platforms.

== Early career ==
In August 2018, Rackz began working with [[Sacramento, California]] rapper E Mozzy on his album, ''Easy Mathematics'', for which he produced the singles "Don't Lie To Me" &amp; "Same As” featuring [[Mozzy]].

In October Rackz then started to work closely with [[Freebandz]] artist Test &amp; the two built up a good working relationship. Test flew over from Baltimore to the UK and hit the studio in West London where they recorded the track 'Already Know'.

== Production discography ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">'''ASR-complete''' is, by analogy to "[[NP-completeness]]" in complexity theory, a term to indicate that the difficulty of a computational problem is equivalent to solving the central [[Automatic Speech Recognition]] problem, i.e. recognize and understanding [[spoken language]]. Unlike "NP-completeness", this term is typically used informally.

Such problems are hypothesised to include:

*Spoken natural language understanding
*Understanding speech from far-field microphones - i.e. handling the reverbation and background noise

These problems are easy for humans to do (in fact, they are described directly in terms of imitating humans). Some systems can solve very simple restricted versions of these problems, but none can solve them in their full generality.

'''Aaron of Neustadt''' was an Austrian Talmudist who with [[Shallum]] and [[Jaekel (Talmudic scholar)|Jaekel]] of Vienna formed a triumvirate of Talmudic scholars in Austria at the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth century; uncle and chief instructor of [[Isserlein]], who frequently alludes in his works to the decisions and opinions of his teacher.  [[Jacob Mölln]] (Maharil) also refers to him and his colleagues.  Aaron suffered the death of a martyr, at Vienna, on 13 March 1421. He wrote a digest, "Hilkot Niddah," which is mentioned by Isserlein.  A collection of sermons by Aaron is now known only through three citations in the works of Jacob Mölln and of Isserlein.

'''Ableism in Canada''' refers to a set of discourses, behaviours and structures which express feelings of anxiety, fear, hostility and antipathy towards [[disabled people]] in [[Canada]]. 

==Overview==
The specific types of discrimination that have occurred or are still occurring in Canada include the ability to access to important facilities such as infrastructure within the transport network, restrictive immigration policies, involuntary sterilization to stop the disabled from having offspring, barriers to employment opportunities, a wage that is high enough to maintain a minimal standard of living, and institutionalization of the disabled in substandard conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy on ableism and discrimination based on disability |url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-ableism-and-discrimination-based-disability |publisher=Ontario Human Rights Commission |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austerity decisions made by the government of Canada have also at time been referred to as ableist, such as funding cuts that put disabled people at risk of living in abusive arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/austerity-left-people-with-disabilities-without-housing-n-s-inquiry-told|title=‘Ableist’ bias left people with disabilities without housing, N.S. inquiry told|date=4 June 2018|work=National Post|accessdate=26 August 2018|first=Michael|last=Tutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Alexius of Kiev,
*Helladius of Kiev,
*Sisoes of Kiev,
*Theophilus of Kiev,

'''Astellas Institute for Regenerative Medicine''' is a subsidiary of [[Astellas Pharma]]  located in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]], developing [[stem cell therapy|stem cell therapies]] with a focus on diseases that cause blindness.  It was formed in 1994 as a company named '''Advanced Cell Technology, Incorporated''' ('''ACT'''), which was renamed to '''Ocata Therapeutics''' in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.ocata.com/press-releases/detail/2644/advanced-cell-technology-changes-name-to-ocata-therapeutics |title=Advanced Cell Technology Changes Name to Ocata Therapeutics |publisher=Ocata Therapeutics |date=2014-11-14 |accessdate=2015-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112607/http://ir.ocata.com/press-releases/detail/2644/advanced-cell-technology-changes-name-to-ocata-therapeutics |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016 Ocata acquired by Astellas for $379 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-to-acquire-ocata-therapeutics-for-379m/81251957/&lt;/ref&gt; which was finally completed in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsroom.astellas.us/news-releases?item=137160%29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Advanced Cell Technology was formed in 1994 and was led from 2005 to late 2010 by William M. Caldwell IV, [[Chairman]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Executive Profile | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=399367&amp;ticker=ACTC:US |work= BusinessWeek.com |date= 23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Caldwell's death on December 13, 2010, Gary Rabin, a member of ACT's board of directors with experience in investment and capital raising, assumed the role of Chairman and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.advancedcell.com/about-act/leadership-team/senior-executive-officers//| title=Advanced Cell Technology Senior Executive Officers| publisher=Advanced Cell Technology| accessdate=2014-08-13| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181139/http://www.advancedcell.com/about-act/leadership-team/senior-executive-officers/| archive-date=2014-07-20| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the company's Chief Scientific Officer (CSO), [[Michael D.

{{original research|date=March 2017}}
Domestic violence is one of the most common crimes among male athletes.There is an ongoing struggle among sporting leagues, governments, and viewers to address the increasing number of domestic violence incidents committed by athletes. The [[NFL]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]](NCAA), [[National Basketball Association]](NBA), and the sport of [[Boxing]] employ and promote athletes who have committed domestic violence. Most prominent are instances of domestic violence that occur by members of the [[NFL]], due largely to its immense popularity in the [[United States]].

==Background==
[[Domestic violence]] among athletes specifically occurs off the field and is most often perpetrated by collegiate and professional athletes. Women are most often the victims during these perpetrations of violence. [[American football|football]], a high contact sport, is played and watched by millions of Americans, and is at the center of the discussion surrounding domestic violence and major athletes. Scholars have worked on this phenomenon considering many variables when attempting to correlate the nature of athletes to domestic violence. Scholars (discussed below) have suggested that the violent behavior inherent in the football environment can be a potential accelerator or stimulator of domestic violence. Major sports franchises are increasingly criticized for their lack of action in regard to domestic violence.

==Football==

Domestic abuse among professional athletes is not a new problem, but it became a nationally recognized issue when [[Baltimore Ravens]] football player [[Ray Rice]] assaulted his then-fiancee, now wife, in 2014 and was only suspended from two [[NFL]] games.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt; The incident took place in elevator in a hotel, in which Rice knocks out his wife- the video was released by [[TMZ]]. Prior to the incident, the NFL’s conduct policy stated that players would be disciplined for domestic abuse offense, but gave no specifics, so the league was left scrambling to come up with an appropriate punishment for Rice.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt; After receiving a great deal of criticism for the light suspension, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell created new rules for players who abuse a partner, saying the first offense would lead to a six-game suspension without pay and a second offense would lead to being kicked out of the league for at least a year.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt;

The criminal behavior of football players has been studied more than that of other players in other sports. Because of the sport's intrinsically violent nature, one might suppose that football players are particularly prone to off-the-field violence. One of the NFL's biggest problems off the field is Domestic violence, according to Jon Shuppe from NBC News over the last 14 years there have been 87 arrests involving 80 football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuppe|first1=Jon|title=Still Playing: 12 NFL Players Have Domestic Violence Arrests|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nfl-controversy/still-playing-12-nfl-players-have-domestic-violence-arrests-n204831|accessdate=22 April 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of 252 nationally-reported criminal cases in one year that involved athletes found that about 14% (49) of the athletes involved were professional football players. This compared to about 7% (25) professional [[baseball]] players and about 6%  (twenty-one) of professional [[basketball]] and [[hockey]] players.&lt;ref name="1-BlueCollar Crimes/WhiteCollar Criminals" /&gt; While this does not draw any specific causation of the violence, the survey is at least suggestive that professional athletes who play other sports besides football also break the law in significant numbers, amounting to perhaps dozens of high-profile incidents each year.&lt;ref name="1-BlueCollar Crimes/WhiteCollar Criminals"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Hear|first1=Michael|title=Blue-Collar Crimes/White-Collar Criminals: Sentencing Elite Athletes Who Commit Violent Crimes|journal=Marquette Sports LawReview|date=2001|volume=12|issue=1|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to domestic violence among football players may be that they are [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to physical conduct because it is a part of what they do all the time.&lt;ref name="2 - Abrams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Mitch|title=Anger Management in Sports|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Teitelbaum, a Ph.D Clinical Psychologist and author of Sports Heroes, Fallen Idols and Illusions and Disillusions agrees with the previous statement by Mitch Abrams, saying, "They're (elite football players) trained to be very aggressive and somewhat violent on the field, that's the nature of the game and that’s how they become important players. And sometimes it's difficult for athletes to turn that off when they go back to their regular lives."&lt;ref name="3 - Teitelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teitelbaum|first1=Stanley|title=Athletes Who Indulge Their Dark Side|date=2009|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players are raised  in an environment where violence is used to resolve conflict. As one is raised in an environment that welcomes violence, their propensity to repeat what they've seen, or what has been done to them may increase.&lt;ref name="3 - Teitelbaum" /&gt; [[Adrian Peterson]] has said that he disciplined his son the way he was disciplined as a child, then went on to say that he will, "Never use a switch again" (in reference to accusations of disciplining his 4-year old with a whip.)&lt;ref name="4 - usatodayonswitch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelissero|first1=Tom|title=A Dad First|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/vikings/2014/11/20/adrian-peterson-roger-goodell-child-abuse-switch-minnesota-vikings/70025476/|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=USAToday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost every case, the domestic violence involves male athletes who play violent sports physically abusing wives or girlfriends.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; In 2010, starting running back [[Steve Jackson (running back)|Steve Jackson]] of the St. Louis Rams was accused of beating up his girlfriend while she was nine months pregnant with his child.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; His former girlfriend, Supriya Harris, said that Jackson “forcibly grabbed my arm, flung me against the door and repeatedly pushed me to the ground.”&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; Jackson took Harris to the hospital and told her to tell the doctors she had fallen in the shower. Ten days later, she delivered their child, but the couple separated four months later after he threatened her again.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

Yet it is not clear that athletes are any more involved in serious crime than the general population is. In a follow-up study, Blumstein and Benedict (1999) showed that 23% of the males in cities with a population of 250,000 or more are arrested for a serious crime at some point in their life. That compares with the 21.4% of NFL football players who had been arrested for something more serious than a minor crime as reported in Benedict’s earlier study (Benedict and Yaeger 1998). In fact, when Blumstein and Benedict compared NFL players with young men from similar racial backgrounds, they discovered that the arrest rates for NFL players were less than half that of the other group for crimes of domestic violence and nondomestic assaults.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

Woods brings attention to issue of [[male entitlement|Male Entitlement]], a topic that Benedict and Yaeger also shed light on. Some athletes develop a sense of entitlement as their fame grows. Whatever city they’re in, male athletes are surrounded by female groupies. The athletes often treat these women with disdain and yet are still tempted by their offers of sex. [[Wilt Chamberlain]], a former great NBA player, boasted in his autobiography that he had slept with over 20,000 women, which, if true, shows a definite degree of deviance.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

==NCAA==
A sensitive topic for many athletes is the apparent rise in violence against women among male athletes. Most men would be quick to say that they respect women and certainly don’t intend women harm. Here are some statistics from the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes on its website at ncava.org: A three-year study showed that while male student-athletes make up 3% of the population on college campuses, they account for 20% of sexual assaults and 35% of domestic assaults on college campuses.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Ronald|title=Social Issues in Sport|date=2011|isbn=9780736089821|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes commit one in three college sexual assaults. The general population has a conviction rate of 80% for sexual assaults, while the rate for athletes is only 38%.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; These statistics were gathered from 107 cases of sexual assault reported at 30 Division I schools between 1991 and 1993.&lt;ref name="6 - BenedictMcDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosset|first1=T. W.|last2=Benedict|first2=J. R.|last3=McDonald|first3=M.

More recent studies have corroborated the study by Crosset and colleagues, and one researcher concluded that “a disproportionate number of campus gang rapes involve fraternities or athlete groups.”&lt;ref name="7 - simmons" /&gt;

Due to the rising accounts of sexual assault on college campuses, the “It’s On Us” campaign was launched in 2014 by President Barack Obama. The campaigns goal is to raise awareness of sexual assault by inspiring people to realize that it is everyone’s responsibility to do something, no matter how big or small. Over 200 universities have partnered with the “It’s On Us” campaign along with sports organizations such as the N.C.A.A. According to an article from the New York Times &lt;ref&gt;[Tracy, M. (2015, April 4). College Teams Add Assault Prevention to the Basic Drills. New York Times, p. D1(L). Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA408139956&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=uiuc_uc&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=995314d1760c4f8469e83b5843a303ab]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Big East Conference, which like the N.C.A.A. was a charter partner of ''It's on Us,'' had its lawyers brief the presidents of its 10 universities on developments in law and policy over the summer. At several universities, athletes produced public service announcements; DePaul enlisted the Chicago Police Department's Sexual Assault Task Force for athlete training, according to the conference."

==National Basketball Association==
In wake of the September media craze regarding the NFL's domestic violence issue, NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] said that his league will "take a fresh look" at its domestic violence procedures in the wake of the NFL's rash of incidents. Underscoring to the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families. "We learn from other leagues' experiences," Silver said.&lt;ref name="15 nba"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Mahoney|title=Silver: NBA will review domestic violence policies|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/|website=Nba|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We're studying everything that's been happening in the NFL. We're working with our players' association. We've been talking for several weeks and we're going to take a fresh look at everything we do." The NFL and Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] has been criticized for punishments that were too slow or lenient for [[Ray Rice]], [[Adrian Peterson]] and other players involved in issues of domestic violence brought to light in September 2014. Goodell aimed to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl. The NBA's [[collective bargaining agreement]] calls for a minimum 10-game suspension for a first offense of a player convicted of a violent felony, however nothing regarding misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Silver says that the NBA has in place, the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, but also acknowledged that it is his wish to continually revise and revisit the policy if need be.&lt;ref name="15 nba" /&gt; Silver also mentioned that "most importantly, it's education, and it's not just the players, but it's the players' families. That's what we're learning, too. We have to take these programs directly to the players' spouses, directly to their partners so that they're aware of places they can go to express concerns, whether they're anonymous hotlines, team executives, league executives. And we're consulting experts. There's a lot to be learned here. It's a societal problem; it's not one that's unique to sports."&lt;ref name="15 nba" /&gt; This proactive approach by Silver is surely helping the issue, but it does not diminish the fact that from 2010 to present, the NFL had an average arrest rate (for a population of 100,000) of approximately 2,466, followed by the NBA’s 2,157. Comparatively, professional baseball and hockey players clocked average arrest rates of 553 and 175, respectively, over the same period.&lt;ref name="14 - vocative"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Abigail|title=NFL, NBA Lead Arrest Rates Across Pro Sports|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/|website=Vocative|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boxing/Floyd Mayweather==
Neither the World Boxing Federation or the Nevada Athletics Commission have rules forbidding boxers to commit domestic violence or sexual assault.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holter|first1=Lauren|title=Boxing's Disturbing History With Domestic Violence Is Thrust Into The Spotlight By Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s Fight|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/80408-boxings-disturbing-history-with-domestic-violence-is-thrust-into-the-spotlight-by-floyd-mayweather-jrs-fight|website=Bustle|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Floyd Mayweather, Jr]], the world's highest-paid athlete&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Louisa|title=The Boxer and the Batterer|url=http://grantland.com/features/floyd-mayweather-pacquiao-domestic-violence-allegations/|website=Grantland|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is arguably the face of the sport. Floyd had been charged with domestic violence on more than one occasion, but rarely are they spoken of. Recently during the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]] fight [[ESPN]] and HBO’s [[Michelle Beadle]] and [[CNN]] reporter [[Rachel Nichols (journalist)|Rachel Nichols]], both of whom have covered Mayweather’s history of domestic violence, tweeted that Mayweather’s camp had “banned” them from the [[MGM Grand Arena]], preventing them from covering there for the respective media outlets.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; The first documented claim of domestic violence occurred in 2001. After Mayweather and Melissa Brim, the mother of his daughter Ayanna, got into an argument over child support, according to court documents, Mayweather swung open a car door that slammed her in the head, then he punched her three times in the face, leaving bruises. 
&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; In 2003, Mayweather was at a nightclub at the Luxor in Las Vegas when he spotted two friends of Josie Harris, who was the mother of three of his children. According to the testimony , Mayweather hit them both announced after following them outside the club, then. Outside, he allegedly picked up and shook a female security guard; police issued him a citation.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; A month after beating [[Arturo Gatti]] Mayweather went to trial on a felony battery charge. The previous year, Josie Harris had angrily confronted Mayweather about another woman. In response, Harris told police, he repeatedly punched her, kicked her, and dragged her by her hair, cutting her face. “My babies’ father just beat me up,” she said when she called 911.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; According to Lauren Holters article, Mayweather then, in 2010 got into another argument with mother of his children, Josie Harris, in which: punched her on the top of and in the back of the head. He allegedly kicked her, pulled her hair, and tried to break her left arm. “I’m going to get someone to pour acid on you,” he also said, according to the police report. Zion, their 9-year-old son, gave police a voluntary statement about what he saw: “He was punching her and kicking her. He was punching her in the head and he was stomping on her sholder [sic].” When Harris yelled for the children to call the police, Mayweather threatened them with violence if they did, and a friend who had come with him blocked the way, according to police. But Zion’s brother Koraun escaped, “jumped the fence,” and made his way to the main security gate, where he told the guard to call the police and an ambulance. A doctor’s examination of Harris afterward showed bruises and a concussion.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; Floyd Mayweather, who just made roughly 180 million dollars from the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]], his domestic abuse charges however, remain a quieter issue in comparison to his money or his 48-0, undefeated record.&lt;ref name="13 abc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dahlberg|first1=Tim|title=Mayweather Wins Decision in Richest Fight Ever|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/mayweather-wins-decision-richest-fight-30765218|website=Abc|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Economics==
The statistics do show that the NFL’s arrest rate for domestic violence is only half of the national average arrest rate. However, the socio-economic factor needs to be considered. While no arrest data broken down by income, BJS survey provided breakdowns for victimization rates. Benjamin Morris, the researcher and writer of FiveThirtyEight, found that the domestic violence victimization rate for people from households making $75,000 or more was 39% of the overall domestic violence victimization rate, and for women ages 20 to 34 it was less than 20%. Although it is impossible to compare directly to the relative NFL arrest rate with precision, at least it gives some benchmark to show that people with higher income levels generally tend to have lower rates of arrest for domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Benjamin|title=More On The Rate Of Domestic Violence Arrests Among NFL Players|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/more-on-the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/|website=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of domestic violence among NFL players is higher than expected for their income level, which could suggest that these athletes are indeed more prone to domestic violence.&lt;ref name="8 - Live Science"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rachel|first1=Rettner|title=Are Athletes Prone to Violence|url=http://www.livescience.com/47949-pro-athletes-domestic-violence.html|website=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''B.C. Women's Hospital &amp; Health Centre''', an agency of the [[Provincial Health Services Authority (British Columbia)|Provincial Health Services Authority]] (PHSA), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[hospital]] located in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], specializing in [[women's health]] programs. It is the only facility in [[Western Canada]] dedicated to the health of women, newborns and families, and is the largest [[maternity hospital]] in the country. It is a [[teaching hospital]] and major provincial health care resource, and is a key component in women's health research.

BC Women's employs more than 1,000 full and part-time staff.

== History ==
The former Salvation Army Grace Maternity Hospital, has been caring for BC families starting in 1927 at its original location at Heather Street and West 27th Avenue.  Both Grace Hospital and Vancouver General Hospital's Willow Pavilion Maternity care moved to the current location at 4500 Oak Street in 1982 and shared the campus with BC Children's Hospital and Shaughnessy Hospital. It provides health services that address the health needs of women of all ages and backgrounds. Women's is the largest maternity hospital in Canada with over 7,000 babies delivered every year. Women's provides a combination of acute care services such as HIV/AIDS care and treatment, abortion and sexual assault services for women throughout the province (through outreach and on-site services in Vancouver) and basic health care services such as breast health checks for women in the [[Lower Mainland]]. It provides training for providers across the province.


Following the closure of Shaughnessy Hospital in 1993, The Salvation Army withdrew administration in 1994 and the facility was renamed BC Women's Hospital &amp; Health Centre. Under the Provincial Health Services Authority, BC Women's Hospital &amp; Health Centre has a mandate to serve women, babies and their families across B.C. Only 43 percent of patients reside in the Lower Mainland, while 57 per cent of patients live in other areas of B.C. With many specialized women's health services not available anywhere else in the province, BC Women's treats over 68,000 patients each year.

== Recent hallmarks ==

October 29, 2017 The Teck Acute Care Centre opens with a new high risk birthing unit, obstetrical surgical services and 60 bed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

On October 25, 2006, Felicia Simms delivered [[conjoined twins]] ([[Krista and Tatiana Hogan]]) at BC Women's Hospital &amp; Health Centre. They are believed to be the first ever conjoined twins born in British Columbia.

Canada's first set of [[Multiple birth|sextuplets]], four boys and two girls, were born at the hospital on January 6 and 7, 2007. They were in the 25th week of gestation when born, or approximately 3 months premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=610a452f-edbb-489a-bb80-ff7618e36054 |title='Very tiny but all 6 are alive' |author=David Carrigg |publisher=The Vancouver Province |date=January 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628221451/http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=610a452f-edbb-489a-bb80-ff7618e36054 |archivedate=2011-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catastrophic interference''', also known as catastrophic forgetting, is the tendency of an [[artificial neural network]] to completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information.&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989"&gt;McCloskey, M. &amp; Cohen, N. (1989) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108605368 Catastrophic interference in connectionist networks: The sequential learning problem]. In G. H. Bower (ed.) ''The Psychology of Learning and Motivation'',''24'', 109-164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990"&gt;Ratcliff, R. (1990) Connectionist models of recognition memory: Constraints imposed by learning and forgetting functions. ''Psychological Review'',''97'', 285-308&lt;/ref&gt; Neural networks are an important part of the [[Connectionism|network approach and connectionist approach]] to [[cognitive science]]. These networks use computer simulations to try to model human behaviours, such as memory and learning. Catastrophic interference is an important issue to consider when creating connectionist models of memory. It was originally brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from McCloskey and Cohen (1989),&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989" /&gt; and Ractcliff (1990).&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt; It is a radical manifestation of the 'sensitivity-stability' dilemma&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D.O. (1949). '`Organization of Behaviour'`. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; or the 'stability-plasticity' dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Caroebterm G., &amp; Grossberg, S. (1987) ART 2: Self-organization of stable category recognition codes for analog input patterns. ``Applied Optics, 26``, 4919-4930&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, these problems refer to the issue of being able to make an artificial neural network that is sensitive to, but not disrupted by, new information. [[Lookup table]]s and connectionist networks lie on the opposite sides of the stability plasticity spectrum.&lt;ref name ="French1997"&gt;French, R. M. (1997) Pseudo-recurrent connectionist networks: an approach to the 'sensitivity-stability' dilemma. ''Connection Science'', ''9''(4), 353–379.&lt;/ref&gt; The former remains completely stable in the presence of new information but lacks the ability to [[machine learning#Generalization|generalize]], i.e. infer general principles, from new inputs. On the other hand, connectionist networks like the [[backpropagation|standard backpropagation network]] are very sensitive to new information and can generalize on new inputs. Backpropagation models can be considered good models of [[human memory]] insofar as they mirror the human ability to generalize but these networks often exhibit less stability than human memory. Notably, these backpropagation networks are susceptible to catastrophic interference. This is considered an issue when attempting to model human memory because, unlike these networks, humans typically do not show catastrophic forgetting. Thus, the issue of catastrophic interference must be eradicated from these backpropagation models in order to enhance the plausibility as models of human memory.

==History of catastrophic interference==

The term catastrophic interference was originally coined by McCloskey and Cohen (1989) but was also brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from Ratcliff (1990).&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt;

=== ''The Sequential Learning Problem'': McCloskey and Cohen (1989)===

McCloskey and Cohen (1989) noted the problem of catastrophic interference during two different experiments with backpropagation neural network modelling.

* Experiment 1: ''Learning the ones and twos addition facts''
In their first experiment they trained a standard backpropagation neural network on a single training set consisting of 17 single-digit ones problems (i.e., 1 + 1 through 9 + 1, and 1 + 2 through 1 + 9) until the network could represent and respond properly to all of them. The error between the actual output and the desired output steadily declined across training sessions, which reflected that the network learned to represent the target outputs better across trials.  Next they trained the network on a single training set consisting of 17 single-digit twos problems (i.e., 2 + 1 through 2 + 9, and 1 + 2 through 9 + 2) until the network could represent, respond properly to all of them. They noted that their procedure was similar to how a child would learn their addition facts. Following each learning trial on the twos facts, the network was tested for its knowledge on both the ones and twos addition facts. Like the ones facts, the twos facts were readily learned by the network. However, McCloskey and Cohen noted the network was no longer able to properly answer the ones addition problems even after one learning trial of the twos addition problems. The output pattern produced in response to the ones facts often resembled an output pattern for an incorrect number more closely than the output pattern for an incorrect number.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} This is considered to be a drastic amount of error. Furthermore, the problems 2+1 and 2+1, which were included in both training sets, even showed dramatic disruption during the first learning trials of the twos facts.

* Experiment 2: ''Replication of Barnes and Underwood (1959) study''&lt;ref name="Barnes1959"&gt;Barnes, J. M., &amp; Underwood, B. J. (1959). Fate of first-list associations in transfer theory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', ''58'', 97–105.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In their second connectionist model, McCloskey and Cohen attempted to replicate the study on retroactive interference in humans by Barnes and Underwood (1959). They trained the model on A-B and A-C lists and used a context pattern in the input vector (input pattern), to differentiate between the lists. Specifically the network was trained to responds with the right B response when shown the A stimulus and A-B context pattern and to respond with the correct C response when shown the A stimulus and the A-C context pattern. When the model was trained concurrently on the A-B and A-C items then the network readily learned all of the associations correctly. In sequential training the A-B list was trained first, followed by the A-C list. After each presentation of the A-C list, performance was measured for both the A-B and A-C lists. They found that the amount of training on the A-C list in Barnes and Underwood study that lead to 50% correct responses, lead to nearly 0% correct responses by the backpropagation network. Furthermore, they found that the network tended to show responses that looked like the C response pattern when the network was prompted to give the B response pattern. This indicated that the A-C list apparently had overwritten the A-B list. This could be likened to learning the word dog, followed by learning the word stool and then finding that you cannot recognize the word cat well but instead think of the word stool when presented with the word dog.

McCloskey and Cohen tried to reduce interference through a number of manipulations including changing the number of hidden units, changing the value of the learning rate parameter, overtraining on the A-B list, freezing certain connection weights, changing target values 0 and 1 instead 0.1 and 0.9. However none of these manipulations satisfactorily reduced the catastrophic interference exhibited by the networks.

Overall, McCloskey and Cohen (1989) concluded that: 
*at least some interference will occur whenever new learning alters the weights involved representing 
*the greater the amount of new learning, the greater the disruption in old knowledge 
*interference was catastrophic in the backpropagation networks when learning was sequential but not concurrent

===''Constraints Imposed by Learning and Forgetting Functions'': Ratcliff (1990)===

Ratcliff (1990) used multiple sets of backpropagation models applied to standard recognition memory procedures, in which the items were sequentially learned.&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt; After inspecting the recognition performance models he found two major problems:
* Well-learned information was catastrophically forgotten as new information was learned in both small and large backpropagation networks. 
Even one learning trial with new information resulted in a significant loss of the old information, paralleling the findings of McCloskey and Cohen (1989).&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989" /&gt; Ratcliff also found that the resulting outputs were often a blend of the previous input and the new input. In larger networks, items learned in groups (e.g. AB then CD) were more resistant to forgetting than were items learned singly (e.g. A then B then C…). However, the forgetting for items learned in groups was still large. Adding new hidden units to the network did not reduce interference. 
* Discrimination between the studied items and previously unseen items decreased as the network learned more. 
This finding contradicts with studies on human memory, which indicated that discrimination increases with learning. Ratcliff attempted to alleviate this problem by adding 'response nodes' that would selectively respond to old and new inputs. However, this method did not work as these response nodes would become active for all inputs. A model which used a context pattern also failed to increase discrimination between new and old items.

==Proposed solutions==

Many researchers have suggested that the main cause of catastrophic interference is overlap in the representations at the hidden layer of distributed neural networks.&lt;ref name="French1991"&gt;French, R. M. (1991). [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/1993/SS-93-06/SS93-06-007.pdf Using Semi-Distributed Representations to Overcome Catastrophic Forgetting in Connectioniost Networks].

(1993). [https://sites.google.com/site/kenmcraelab/publications/McRae_Heth_CogSci_93.pdf Catastrophic Interference is Eliminated in Pre-Trained Networks]. In: ''Proceedings of the 15th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'' (pp. 723-728). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French1999"&gt;French, R. M. (1999). Catastrophic forgetting in connectionist networks. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', ''3''(4), 128–135.&lt;/ref&gt; In a distributed representation any given input will tend to create changes in the weights to many of the nodes. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because when many of the weights where "knowledge is stored" are changed, it is impossible for prior knowledge to be kept intact. During sequential learning, the inputs become mixed with the new input being superimposed over top of the old input.&lt;ref name="McRae1993" /&gt; Another way to conceptualize this is through visualizing learning as movement through a weight space.&lt;ref name="Lewandowsky1991"&gt;Lewandowsky S. (1991). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LQh7AgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=%22Gradual+unlearning+and+catastrophic+interference:+a+comparison+of+distributed+architectures%22&amp;ots=WwiRSSEVfe&amp;sig=OJUPPpmD_VE795zJx88lHUIUxYk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gradual%20unlearning%20and%20catastrophic%20interference%3A%20a%20comparison%20of%20distributed%20architectures%22&amp;f=false Gradual unlearning and catastrophic interference: a comparison of distributed architectures]. In: Hockley WE and Lewandowsky S (eds). ''Relating theory and data: essays on human memory in honor of Bennet B. Murdock'' (pp. 445–476). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; This weight space can be likened to a spatial representation of all of the possible combinations of weights that the network can possess. When a network first learns to represent a set of patterns, it has found a point in weight space which allows it to recognize all of the patterns that it has seen.&lt;ref name=French1999 /&gt; However, when the network learns a new set of patterns sequentially it will move to a place in the weight space that allows it to only recognize the new pattern.&lt;ref name=French1999 /&gt; To recognize both sets of patterns, the network must find a place in weight space that can represent both the new and the old output. One way to do this is by connecting a hidden unit to only a subset of the input units. This reduces the likelihood that two different inputs will be encoded by the same hidden units and weights, and so will decrease the chance of interference.&lt;ref name="McRae1993" /&gt;  Indeed, a number of the proposed solutions to catastrophic interference involve reducing the amount of overlap that occurs when storing information in these weights.

Many of the early techniques in reducing representational overlap involved making either the input vectors or the hidden unit activation patterns [[orthogonality#Definitions|orthogonal]] to one another. Lewandowsky and Li (1995)&lt;ref name="Lewandowsky1995"&gt;Lewandowsky, S., &amp; Li, S-C. (1995). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122089305500118 Catastrophic interference in neural networks: causes, solutions, and data]. In: Dempster, F.N. &amp; Brainerd, C. (eds). ''Interference and Inhibition in Cognition'' (pp. 329–361). San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the interference between sequentially learned patterns is minimized if the input vectors are orthogonal to each other. Input vectors are said to be orthogonal to each other if the pairwise product of their elements across the two vectors sum to zero. For example, the patterns [0,0,1,0] and [0,1,0,0] are said to be orthogonal because (0&amp;times;0 + 0&amp;times;1 + 1&amp;times;0 + 0&amp;times;0) = 0. One of the techniques which can create orthogonal representations at the hidden layers involves bipolar feature coding (i.e., coding using -1 and 1 rather than 0 and 1).&lt;ref name="French1999" /&gt; Orthogonal patterns tend to produce less interference with each other. However, not all learning problems can be represented using these types of vectors and some studies report that the degree of interference is still problematic with orthogonal vectors.&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt; Simple techniques such as varying the learning rate parameters in the backpropagation equation were not successful in reducing interference. Varying the number of hidden nodes has also been used to try and reduce interference. However, the findings have been mixed, with some studies finding that more hidden units decrease interference&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, M. (2004). [https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2004/10250/Reassessment_of_catastrophic_interference.24.aspx Reassessment of Catastrophic Interference]. ''Computational Neuroscience'', ''15''(15), 2423 – 2426&lt;/ref&gt; and other studies finding it does not.&lt;ref name="McCloskey1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ratcliff1990" /&gt;

Below are a number of techniques which have empirical support in successfully reducing catastrophic interference in backpropagation neural networks:

===Node sharpening technique===
French (1991)&lt;ref name="French1991" /&gt;  proposed that catastrophic interference arises in [[feedforward neural network|feedforward]] backpropagation networks due to the interaction of node activations, or activation overlap, that occur in distributed representations at the hidden layer. Specifically, he defined this activation overlap as the average shared activation over all units in the hidden layer, calculated by summing the lowest activation of the nodes at the hidden layer and averaging this sum. For example, if the activations at the hidden layer from one input are (0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0) and the activations from the next input are (0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) the activation overlap would be (0.0 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.9 ) / 4 = 0.275. When using [binary number|binary] representation of input [row vector|vectors], activation values will be 0 through 1, where 0 indicates no activation overlap and 1 indicates full activation overlap. French noted that [[neural network]]s which employ very localized representations do not show catastrophic interference because of the lack of overlap at the hidden layer. That is to say, each input pattern will create a hidden layer representation that involves the activation of only one node, so differed inputs will have an activation overlap of 0. Thus, he suggested that reducing the value of activation overlap at the hidden layer would reduce catastrophic interference in distributed networks. Specifically he proposed that this could be done through changing the distributed representations at the hidden layer to 'semi-distributed' representations. A 'semi-distributed' representation has fewer hidden nodes that are active, and/or a lower activation value for these nodes, for each representation, which will make the representations of the different inputs overlap less at the hidden layer.  French recommended that this could be done through 'activation sharpening', a technique which slightly increases the activation of a certain number of the most active nodes in the hidden layer, slightly reduces the activation of all the other units and then changes the input-to-hidden layer weights to reflect these activation changes (similar to error backpropagation). Overall the guidelines for the process of 'activation sharpening' are as follows:

# Perform a forward activation pass by feeding an input from the input layer to the hidden layer and record the activations at the hidden layer
# '''''"Sharpen" the activation''''' of x number of most active nodes by a sharpening factor α:
#: ''A&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''A&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''α''(1- ''A&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'') 		For nodes to be sharpened, i.e. more activated
#: ''A&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''A&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''αA&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;''	           For all other nodes
#: French suggested the number of nodes to be sharpened should be log ''n'' nodes, where n is the number of hidden layer nodes
# 	Use the difference between the old activation (A&lt;sub&gt;''old''&lt;/sub&gt;) and the sharpened activation (''A&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'') as an error, backpropagate this error to the input layer, and modify the weights of input-to-output appropriately
# 	Do a full forward pass with the input through to the output layer
# 	Backpropagate as usual from the output to the input layer
# 	Repeat

In his tests of an 8-8-8 (input-hidden-output) node backpropagation network where one node was sharpened, French found that this sharpening paradigm did result in one node being much more active than the other seven. Moreover, when sharpened, this network took one fourth the time to relearn the initial inputs than a standard backpropagation without node sharpening. Relearning is a measure of memory savings and thus extent of forgetting, where more time to relearn suggests more forgetting ([[Herman Ebbinghaus|Ebbinghaus]] savings method). A two-node sharpened network performed even slightly better, however if more than two nodes were sharpened forgetting increased again.

According to French, the sharpened activations interfere less with weights in the network than unsharpened weights and this is due specifically to the way that backpropagation algorithm calculates weight changes. Activations near 0 will change the weights of links less than activations near 1. Consequently, when there are many nodes with low activations (due to sharpening), the weights to and from these nodes will be modified much less than the weights on very active nodes. As a result, when a new input is fed into the network, sharpening will reduce activation overlap by limiting the number of highly active hidden units and will reduce the likelihood of representational overlap by reducing the number of weights that are to be changed.  Thus, node sharpening will decrease the amount of disruption in the old weights, which store prior input patterns, thereby reducing the likelihood of catastrophic forgetting.

===Novelty rule===
Kortge (1990)&lt;ref name="Kortge1990"&gt;Kortge, C. A. (1990). Episodic memory in connectionist networks. In: ''The Twelfth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'', (pp. 764-771). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a learning rule for training neural networks, called the 'novelty rule', to help alleviate catastrophic interference. As its name suggests, this rule helps the neural network to learn only the components of a new input that differ from an old input. Consequently, the novelty rule changes only the weights that were not previously dedicated to storing information, thereby reducing the overlap in representations at the hidden units. Thus, even when inputs are somewhat similar to another, dissimilar representations can be made at the hidden layer. In order to apply the novelty rule, during learning the input pattern is replaced by a novelty vector that represents the components that differ. The novelty vector for the first layer (input units to hidden units) is determined by taking the target pattern away from the current output of the network (the [[delta rule]]). For the second layer (hidden units to output units) the novelty vector is simply the activation of the hidden units that resulted from using the novelty vector as an input through the first layer. Weight changes in the network are computed by using a modified delta rule with the '''''novelty vector''''' replacing the activation value (sum of the inputs):

: Δ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''k''δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  
: 
: Δw&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = weight change between nodes ''i'' and ''j''  
: ''k'' = learning rate
: δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = error signal 
: ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;= novely vector

When the novelty rule is used in a standard backpropagation network there is no, or lessened, forgetting of old items when new items are presented sequentially.&lt;ref name="Kortge1990" /&gt; However, this rule can only apply to auto-encoder or auto-associative networks, in which the target response for the output layer is identical to the input pattern. This is because the novelty vector would be meaningless if the desired output was not identical to the input as it would be impossible to calculate how much a new input differed from the old input.

===Pre-training networks===

McRae and Hetherington (1993)&lt;ref name="McRae1993" /&gt; argued that humans, unlike most neural networks, do not take on new learning tasks with a random set of weights. Rather, people tend to bring a wealth of prior knowledge to a task and this helps to avoid the problem of interference. They proposed that when a network is pre-trained on a random sample of data prior to starting a sequential learning task that this prior knowledge will naturally constrain how the new information can be incorporated. This would occur because a random sample of data from a domain which has a high degree of internal structure, such as the English language, training would capture the regularities, or recurring patterns, found within that domain. Since the domain is based on regularities, a newly learned item will tend to be similar to the previously learned information, which will allow the network to incorporate new data with little interference with existing data. Specifically, an input vector which follows the same pattern of regularities as the previously trained data should not cause a drastically different pattern of activation at the hidden layer or drastically alter weights.

To test their hypothesis, McRae and Hetherington (1993) compared the performance of a naïve and pre-trained auto-encoder backpropagation network on three simulations of verbal learning tasks. The pre-trained network was trained using letter based representations of English monosyllabic words or English word pairs.  All three tasks involved the learning of some consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) strings or CVC pairs (list A), followed by training on a second list of these items (list B). Afterwards, the distributions of the hidden node activations were compared between the naïve and pre-trained network. In all three tasks, the representations of a CVC in the naïve network tended to be spread fairly evenly across all hidden nodes, whereas most hidden nodes were inactive in the pre-trained network. Furthermore, in the pre-trained network the representational overlap between CVCs was reduced compared to the naïve network. The pre-trained network also retained some similarity information as the representational overlap between similar CVCs, like "JEP" and "ZEP", was greater than for dissimilar CVCs, such as "JEP" and "YUG". This suggests that the pre-trained network had a better ability to generalize, i.e. notice the patterns, than the naïve network.  Most importantly, this reduction in hidden unit activation and representational overlap resulted in significantly less forgetting in the pre-trained network than the naïve network, essentially eliminating catastrophic interference. Essentially, the pre-training acted to create internal orthogonalization of the activations at the hidden layer, which reduced interference.&lt;ref name="French1999" /&gt; Thus, pre-training is a simple way to reduce catastrophic forgetting in standard backpropagation networks.

===Pseudo-recurrent networks===

French (1997) proposed the idea of a pseudo-recurrent backpropagation network in order to help reduce catastrophic interference (see Figure 2).&lt;ref name ="French1997" /&gt; In this model the network is separated into two functionally distinct but interacting sub-networks. This model is biologically inspired and is based on research from McClelland, McNaughton, and O'Reilly (1995).&lt;ref name="McClelland1995"&gt;McClelland, J., McNaughton, B. &amp; O'Reilly, R. (1995) Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: Insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory. ''Psychological Review'', ''102'', 419-457.&lt;/ref&gt; In this research McClelland et al. (1995), suggested that the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]] act as separable but complementary memory systems. Specifically, the hippocampus [[short term memory]] storage and acts gradually over time to transfer memories into the neocortex for [[long term memory]] storage. They suggest that the information that is stored can be "brought back" to the hippocampus during active rehearsal, reminiscence, and sleep and renewed activation is what acts to transfer the information to the neocortex over time. In the pseudo-recurrent network, one of the sub-networks acts as an early processing area, akin to the hippocampus, and functions to learn new input patters. The other sub-network acts as a final-storage area, akin to the neocortex. However, unlike in McClelland et al. (1995) model, the final-storage area sends internally generated representation back to the early processing area. This creates a recurrent network. French proposed that this interleaving of old representations with new representations is the only way to reduce radical forgetting. Since the brain would most likely not have access to the original input patterns, the patterns that would be fed back to the neocortex would be internally generated representations called ''pseudopatterns''.  These pseudopatterns are approximations of previous inputs&lt;ref name ="Robins1995"&gt;Robins, A. (1995). Catastrophic Forgetting, rehearsal and pseudorehearal. ''Connection Science'', ''7'', 123-146.&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be interleaved with the learning of new inputs. [[File:Pseudorecurrentnetwork.jpg|thumbnail|Figure 2: The architecture of a pseudo-recurrent network]]The use of these pseudopatterns could be biologically plausible as parallels between the consolidation of learning that occurs during sleep and the use of interleaved pseudopatterns. Specifically, they both serve to integrate new information with old information without disruption of the old information.&lt;ref name ="Robins1996"&gt;Robins, A. (1996). Consolidation in Neural Networks and in the Sleeping Brain. ''Connection Science'', ''8''(2), 259-276.&lt;/ref&gt; When given an input (and a teacher value) is fed into the pseudo-recurrent network would act as follows:

*When a pattern is fed from the environment (a real input), the information travels both to the early processing area and the final storage area, however the teacher nodes will inhibit the output from the final storage area
*The new pattern is learned by the early processing area by the standard backpropagation algorithm
*At the same time random input is also fed into the network and causes pseudopatterns to be generated by the final storage area
*Output from the final-storage area, in the form of pseudopatterns, will be used as a teacher for the early-processing area. In this way, the pseudopatterns are interleaved with the 'real inputs' from the environment 
*Once the new pattern and the pseudopattern are learned by the early processing area, its weights are copied to the corresponding weights in the final storage area.

When tested on sequential learning of real world patterns, categorization of edible and poisonous mushrooms, the pseudo-recurrent network was shown less interference than a standard backpropagation network. This improvement was with both memory savings and exact recognition of old patterns. When the activation patterns of the pseudo-recurrent network were investigated, it was shown that this network automatically formed semi-distributed representations. Since these types of representations involve fewer nodes being activated for each pattern, it is likely what helped to reduce interference.

Not only did the pseudo-recurrent model show reduced interference but also it models list-length and list-strength effects seen in humans. The list-length effect means that adding new items to a list harms the memory of earlier items. Like humans, the pseudo recurrent network showed a more gradual forgetting when to be trained list is lengthened. The list-strength effect means that when the strength of recognition for one item is increased, there is no effect on the recognition of the other list items. This is an important finding as other models often exhibit a decrease in the recognition of other list items when one list item is strengthened. Since the direct copying of weights from the early processing area to the final storage area does not seem highly biologically plausible, the transfer of information to the final storage area can be done through training the final storage area with pseudopatterns created by the early processing area. However, a disadvantage of the pseudo-recurrent model is that the number of hidden units in the early processing and final storage sub-networks must be identical.

=== Neural networks with self-refreshing memory ===
Following the same basic idea contributed by Robins,&lt;ref name ="Robins1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Robins1996" /&gt; Ans and Rousset (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B., &amp; Rousset, S. (1997). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0764446997824729 Avoiding catastrophic forgetting by coupling two reverberating neural networks]. ''CR Academie Science Paris, Life Sciences'', ''320'', 89-997.&lt;/ref&gt; have also proposed a two-network artificial neural architecture with ''memory self-refreshing'' that overcomes catastrophic interference when sequential learning tasks are carried out in distributed networks trained by backpropagation. The principle is to interleave, at the time when new external patterns are learned, those to-be-learned new external patterns with internally generated pseudopatterns, or 'pseudo-memories', that reflect the previously learned information. What mainly distinguishes this model from those that use classical pseudorehearsal in feedforward multilayer networks is a ''reverberating'' process that is used for generating pseudopatterns. This process which, after a number of activity re-injections from a single random seed, tends to go up to nonlinear network ''attractors'', is more suitable for optimally capturing the deep structure of previously learned knowledge than a single feedforward pass of random activation. Ans and Rousset (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B., &amp; Rousset, S. (2000). Neural networks with a self-refreshing memory: Knowledge transfer in sequential Learning tasks without catastrophic forgetting. ''Connection Science'', ''12'', 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the learning mechanism they proposed avoiding catastrophic forgetting, provides a more appropriate way to deal with knowledge transfer as measured by learning speed, ability to generalize and vulnerability to network damages. Musca, Rousset and Ans (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Musca, S. C., Rousset, S., &amp; Ans, B. (2009). Artificial neural network whispering to the brain: Nonlinear system attractors induce familiarity with never seen items. ''Connection Science'', ''21''(4), 359-377.&lt;/ref&gt; have also shown that pseudopatterns originating from an artificial reverberating neural network could induce familiarity in humans with never seen items in the way predicted by simulations conducted with a two-network artificial neural architecture. Furthermore, Ans (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B. (2004). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.98.2552&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Sequential learning in distributed neural networks without catastrophic forgetting: A single and realistic self-refreshing memory can do it]. ''Neural Information Processing-Letters and Reviews'', ''4'', 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; has implemented a version of the self-refreshing mechanism using only one network trained by the Contrastive Hebbian Learning rule, a training rule considered as more realistic than the largely used backpropagation algorithm, but fortunately equivalent to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, X.,  &amp; Seung, H. S.  (2003). Equivalence of backpropagation and Contrastive Hebbian Learning in a layered network. ''Neural Computation'', ''15'', 441-454.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, the different solutions to catastrophic interference that have been presented concern tasks of sequential learning involving only non-temporally ordered lists of items. But, to be credible, the self-refreshing mechanism for 'static' learning has to encompass our human ability to learn serially many temporal sequences of patterns without catastrophic interference (e.g. learning one song followed by learning a second song without forgetting the first one). This was done by Ans, Rousset, French and Musca (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ans, B., Rousset, S., French, R. M., &amp; Musca, S. C. (2004). Self-refreshing memory in artificial neural networks: Learning temporal sequences without catastrophic forgetting. ''Connection Science'', ''16'', 71-99.&lt;/ref&gt; who have presented, in addition to simulation work, an experiment that evidences a close similarity between the behaviour of humans and the behaviour of the proposed neuromimetic architecture.

===Latent learning===

Latent Learning is a technique used by Gutstein &amp; Stump (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Gutstein and Stump (2015). [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7280416/ Reduction Of Catastrophic Forgetting With Transfer Learning And Ternary Output Codes]. In: Proceedings ''2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Nets'' (pp 1-8)&lt;/ref&gt; both to mitigate catastrophic interference and to take advantage of transfer learning. Rather than manipulating the representations for new classes used by the hidden nodes, this approach tries to train optimal representations for new classes into the output nodes. It chooses output encodings that are least likely to catastrophically interfere with existing responses.

Given a net that has learned to discriminate among one set of classes using Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC)&lt;ref&gt;Dietterich, T. G., &amp; Bakiri, G. (1995). [https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/download/10127/23985 Solving multiclass learning problems via error-correcting output codes]. ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research'', (pp. 263-286)&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to [[one-hot|1 hot codes]]), optimal encodings for new classes are chosen by observing the net's average responses to them. Since these average responses arose while learning the original set of classes ''without any exposure to the new classes'', they are referred to as 'Latently Learned Encodings'. This terminology borrows from the concept of [[Latent Learning]], as introduced by Tolman in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, E.C.; C.H. Honzik (1930). ""Insight" in Rats". University of California Publications in Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, this technique uses transfer learning to avoid catastrophic interference, by making a net's responses to new classes as consistent as possible with existing responses to classes already learned.

===Elastic weight consolidation===

Kirkpatrick et al. (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=James|title=Elastic Weight Consolidation|eprint=1612.00796|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a method to train a single artificial neural network on multiple tasks using a technique called elastic weight consolidation.

===Anapoiesis===
[[Practopoietic theory]]&lt;ref name=Nikolic2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that biological systems solve the problem of catastrophic interference by storing long-term memories only in a general form, not applicable to a given situation but instead loosely applicable to a class of different situations. In order to adjust the loosely applicable knowledge to the given current situation, the process of ''anapoiesis'' is applied. Anapoiesis stands for "reconstruction of knowledge"—transforming knowledge from a general form to a specific one. Practopoietic theory is founded in the [[Variety (cybernetics)|theorems]] of [[cybernetics]] and is concerned with the question of how cybernetic systems obtain their capabilities to control and act.

'''DNA ligase''' is a specific type of enzyme, a [[ligase]], ({{EC number|6.5.1.1}}) that facilitates the joining of [[DNA]] strands together by catalyzing the formation of a [[phosphodiester bond]]. It plays a role in repairing single-strand breaks in duplex [[DNA]] in living organisms, but some forms (such as [[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]) may specifically repair double-strand breaks (i.e. a break in both [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strands of DNA). Single-strand breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the double helix as a template,&lt;ref name="pmid15565146"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pascal JM, O'Brien PJ, Tomkinson AE, Ellenberger T | title = Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7016 | pages = 473–8 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15565146 | doi = 10.1038/nature03082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with DNA ligase creating the final phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA.

DNA ligase is used in both [[DNA repair]] and [[DNA replication]] (see ''[[DNA ligase#Mammalian ligases|Mammalian ligases]]'').  In addition, DNA ligase has extensive use in [[molecular biology]] laboratories for [[recombinant DNA]] experiments (see ''[[DNA ligase#Research Applications|Research Applications]]''). Purified DNA ligase is used in gene cloning to join DNA molecules together to form [[recombinant DNA]].

== Enzymatic mechanism ==
[[File:Ligase.svg|thumb|The image demonstrates how ligase (yellow oval) catalyzes two DNA fragment strands. The ligase joins the two fragments of DNA to form a longer strand of DNA by "pasting" them together.]]
The mechanism of DNA ligase is to form two [[covalent]] [[phosphodiester bonds]] between [[3' end|3' hydroxyl ends]] of one [[nucleotide]] ("acceptor"), with the [[5' end|5' phosphate end]] of another ("donor"). Two ATP molecules are consumed for each phosphodiester bond formed. AMP is required for the ligase reaction, which proceeds in four steps:

# Reorganization of activity site such as nicks in DNA segments or Okazaki fragments etc.
# Adenylation (addition of AMP) of a [[lysine]] residue in the active center of the enzyme, [[pyrophosphate]] is released;
# Transfer of the AMP to the 5' phosphate of the so-called donor, formation of a pyrophosphate bond; 
# Formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5' phosphate of the donor and the 3' hydroxyl of the acceptor.&lt;ref name="pmid4377758"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehman IR | title = DNA ligase: structure, mechanism, and function | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = 4166 | pages = 790–7 | date = November 1974 | pmid = 4377758 | doi = 10.1126/science.186.4166.790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ligation.svg|thumb|center|350px|A pictorial example of how a ligase works (with [[DNA end|sticky end]]s)]]

Ligase will also work with [[DNA end|blunt end]]s, although higher enzyme concentrations and different reaction conditions are required.

== Types ==

=== ''E. coli'' ===
The ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' DNA ligase is encoded by the ''lig'' gene.  DNA ligase in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', as well as most prokaryotes, uses energy gained by cleaving [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) to create the phosphodiester bond.&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt;  It does not ligate blunt-ended DNA except under conditions of molecular crowding with [[polyethylene glycol]], and cannot join RNA to DNA efficiently.

The activity of E. coli DNA ligase can be enhanced by [[DNA polymerase]] at the right concentrations. Enhancement only works when the concentrations of the DNA polymerase 1 are much lower than the DNA fragments to be ligated. When the concentrations of Pol I DNA polymerases are higher, it has an adverse effect on E. coli DNA ligase&lt;ref name="pmid29409896"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang Y, LiCata VJ | title = Pol I DNA polymerases stimulate DNA end-joining by Escherichia coli DNA ligase | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 497 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–18 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29409896 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== T4 ===
The DNA ligase from [[bacteriophage T4]]('''Enterobacteria phage T4''' is a [[bacteriophage]] that infects ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacteria. The T4 phage is a member of the [[T-even bacteriophages|T-even phages]], a group including enterobacteriophages [[Enterobacteria phage T2|T2]] and [[Enterobacteria phage T6|T6]]. T4 is capable of undergoing only a [[Lytic|lytic lifecycle]] and not the [[Lysogeny|lysogenic lifecycle]].) is the ligase most-commonly used in laboratory research.&lt;ref name="url_www.promega.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.promega.com/~/media/files/resources/product%20guides/cloning%20enzymes/ligases.pdf?la=en+ | title = Ligases | work = Enzyme Resources Guide | publisher = Promega Corporation | pages = 8–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can ligate either [[cohesive end|cohesive or  blunt ends]] of DNA, oligonucleotides, as well as RNA and RNA-DNA hybrids, but not single-stranded nucleic acids. It can also ligate [[Sticky and blunt ends|blunt-ended DNA]] with much greater efficiency than ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' DNA ligase.  Unlike ''E. coli'' DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase cannot utilize NAD and it has an absolute requirement for ATP as a cofactor. Some engineering has been done to improve the ''in vitro'' activity of T4 DNA ligase; one successful approach, for example, tested T4 DNA ligase fused to several alternative DNA binding proteins and found that the constructs with either p50 or [[NF-kB]] as fusion partners were over 160% more active in blunt-end ligations for cloning purposes than wild type T4 DNA ligase.&lt;ref name="pmid23754529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson RH, Morton SK, Deiderick H, Gerth ML, Paul HA, Gerber I, Patel A, Ellington AD, Hunicke-Smith SP, Patrick WM | title = Engineered DNA ligases with improved activities in vitro | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 471–8 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23754529 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzt024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical reaction for inserting a fragment into a plasmid vector would use about 0.01 (sticky ends) to 1 (blunt ends) units of ligase.  The optimal incubation temperature for T4 DNA ligase is 16 °C.&amp;nbsp;

=== Mammalian ===
In mammals, there are four specific types of ligase.
#[[LIG1|DNA ligase I]]: ligates the nascent DNA of the [[DNA replication#Lagging strand|lagging strand]] after the [[RNase H|Ribonuclease H]] has removed the RNA primer from the [[Okazaki fragment]]s.
#[[LIG3|DNA ligase III]]: [[protein complex|complexes]] with [[DNA repair]] [[protein]] [[XRCC1]] to aid in sealing DNA during the process of [[DNA repair|nucleotide excision repair]] and recombinant fragments. Of the all known mammalian DNA ligases, only Lig III has been found to be present in mitochondria.
#[[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]: complexes with [[XRCC4]].  It catalyzes the final step in the [[non-homologous end joining]] DNA double-strand break repair pathway.  It is also required for [[V(D)J recombination]], the process that generates diversity in [[immunoglobulin]] and [[T-cell receptor]] loci during [[immune system]] development.

*DNA ligase II: appears to be used in repair. It is formed by alternative splicing of a proteolytic fragment of DNA ligase III and does not have its own gene, therefore it is often considered to be virtually identical to DNA ligase III.

DNA ligase from [[eukaryotes]] and some microbes uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) rather than NAD.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Foster JB, Slonczewski J | title = Microbiology: An Evolving Science | edition = Second | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-393-93447-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermostable===
Derived from a thermophilic bacterium, the enzyme is stable and active at much higher temperatures than conventional DNA ligases. Its half-life is 48 hours at 65°C and greater than 1&amp;nbsp;hour at 95°C. Ampligase DNA Ligase has been shown to be active for at least 500 thermal cycles (94°C/80°C) or 16 hours of cycling.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;This exceptional thermostability permits extremely high hybridization stringency and ligation specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epibio.com/enzymes/ligases-kinases-phosphatases/dna-ligases/ampligase-thermostable-dna-ligase?details|title=Ampligase- Thermostable DNA Ligase|website=www.epibio.com|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of activity==
There are at least three different units used to measure the activity of DNA ligase:&lt;ref name="Russell_2001"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-87969-577-4 | volume = 1 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 1: Plasmids and Their Usefulness in Molecular Cloning  | pages=1–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Weiss unit''' - the amount of ligase that catalyzes the exchange of 1 nmole of &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P from inorganic [[pyrophosphate]] to ATP in 20 minutes at 37&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;C.  This is the one most commonly used.
* '''Modrich-Lehman unit''' - this is rarely used, and one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 100 nmoles of d(A-T)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to an exonuclease-III resistant form in 30 minutes under standard conditions.
* Many commercial suppliers of ligases use an arbitrary unit based on the ability of ligase to ligate cohesive ends.  These units are often more subjective than quantitative and lack precision.

== Research applications ==
{{main|Ligation (molecular biology) }}
DNA ligases have become indispensable tools in modern molecular biology research for generating [[recombinant DNA]] sequences.  For example, DNA ligases are used with [[restriction enzyme]]s to insert DNA fragments, often [[genes]], into [[plasmid]]s.

Controlling the optimal temperature is a vital aspect of performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments.  Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]]), which is most active at 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Baneyx_1993"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Baneyx F, Lucotte G | title = Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 1993 | page = 156 | isbn = 978-0-471-18849-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments ("sticky ends"), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of the sticky ends being ligated,&lt;ref name="Tabor_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabor S | title = DNA ligases | journal = Current Protocols in Molecular Biology | volume = Chapter 3 | issue =  | pages = Unit 3.14 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 18265223 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb0314s08 | isbn = 978-0-471-14272-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous pairing]] of the sticky ends will not be stable because the high temperature disrupts [[hydrogen bonding]]. A ligation reaction is most efficient when the sticky ends are already stably annealed, and disruption of the annealing ends would therefore result in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the [[DNA end#Overhangs and sticky ends|overhang]], the lower the T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. It has been shown recently that T4 DNA ligase in combination with 3 M [[Trimethylglycine|betaine]] and 10 % [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] 8000 can ligate [[Xeno nucleic acid|XNA]] molecules &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kestemont|first=Donaat|last2=Renders|first2=Marleen|last3=Leonczak|first3=Piotr|last4=Abramov|first4=Mikhail|last5=Schepers|first5=Guy|last6=Pinheiro|first6=Vitor B.|last7=Rozenski|first7=Jef|last8=Herdewijn|first8=Piet|date=2018|title=XNA ligation using T4 DNA ligase in crowding conditions|url=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/CC/C8CC02414F|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=54|issue=49|pages=6408–6411|doi=10.1039/c8cc02414f|issn=1359-7345}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since blunt-ended DNA fragments have no cohesive ends to anneal, the melting temperature is not a factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction. The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not the activity of the ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur.  The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur.  The majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-25&amp;nbsp;°C overnight.  The absence of stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.&lt;ref name="Tabor_2001"/&gt;

A novel use of DNA ligase can be seen in the field of nano chemistry, specifically in DNA origami. &amp;nbsp;DNA based self-assembly principles have proven useful for organizing nanoscale objects, such as biomolecules, nanomachines, nanoelectronic and photonic component. Assembly of such nano structure requires the creation of an intricate mesh of DNA molecules. Although DNA self-assembly is possible without any outside help using different substrates such as provision of catatonic surface of Aluminium foil, DNA ligase can provide the enzymatic assistance that is required to make DNA lattice structure from DNA over hangs.&lt;ref name="pmid28189681"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhanjadeo MM, Nayak AK, Subudhi U | title = Surface-assisted DNA self-assembly: An enzyme-free strategy towards formation of branched DNA lattice | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 485 | issue = 2 | pages = 492–498 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28189681 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first DNA ligase was purified and characterized in 1967 by the Gellert, Lehman, Richardson, and Hurwitz laboratories.&lt;ref name="Shuman 17365–17369"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shuman S | title = DNA ligases: progress and prospects | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 26 | pages = 17365–9 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19329793 | pmc = 2719376 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R900017200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first purified and characterized by Weiss and Richardson using a six-step chromatographic-fractionation process beginning with elimination of cell debris and addition of streptomycin, followed by several Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose column washes and a final phosphocellulose fractionation. The final extract contained 10% of the activity initially recorded in the&amp;nbsp;''E. coli&amp;nbsp;''media; along the process it was discovered that ATP and Mg++ were necessary to optimize the reaction. The common commercially available DNA ligases were originally discovered in [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]], ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and other [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="WeissRichardson1967"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss B, Richardson CC | title = Enzymatic breakage and joining of deoxyribonucleic acid, I.

== Disorders ==
Genetic deficiencies in human DNA ligases have been associated with clinical syndromes marked by immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, and developmental abnormalities,&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Shuman 17365–17369"/&gt; [[LIG4 syndrome]] (Ligase IV syndrome) is a rare disease associated with mutations in DNA ligase 4 and interferes with dsDNA break-repair mechanisms. Ligase IV syndrome causes immunodeficiency in individuals and is commonly associated with microcephaly and marrow hypoplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altmann T, Gennery AR | title = DNA ligase IV syndrome; a review | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 137 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27717373 | pmc = 5055698 | doi = 10.1186/s13023-016-0520-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of prevalent diseases caused by lack of or malfunctioning of DNA ligase is as follows.

=== Xeroderma pigmentosum ===

Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is commonly known as XP, is an inherited condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. This condition mostly affects the eyes and areas of skin exposed to the sun. Some affected individuals also have problems involving the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/xeroderma-pigmentosum|title=xeroderma pigmentosum| work = Genetics Home Reference | access-date = 2017-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ataxia-telangiectasia ===

Mutations in the&amp;nbsp;ATM&amp;nbsp;gene cause&amp;nbsp;ataxia-telangiectasia. The&amp;nbsp;ATM&amp;nbsp;gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control&amp;nbsp;cell&amp;nbsp;division&amp;nbsp;and is involved in DNA repair. This protein plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and immune system. The ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands and coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ataxia-telangiectasia#genes | title = ataxia-telangiectasia | work = Genetics Home Reference | access-date = 2017-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fanconi Anemia ===

[[Fanconi anemia]] (FA) is a rare, inherited blood disorder that leads to bone marrow failure. FA prevents bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for the body to work normally. FA also can cause the bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/fanconi | title = What Is Fanconi Anemia? | publisher = NHLBI, NIH | access-date = 2017-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bloom syndrome ===

[[Bloom syndrome]] results in skin that is sensitive to sun exposure, and usually the development of a butterfly-shaped patch of reddened skin across the nose and cheeks. A skin rash can also appear on other areas that are typically exposed to the sun, such as the back of the hands and the forearms. Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels (telangiectases) often appear in the rash; telangiectases can also occur in the eyes. Other skin features include patches of skin that are lighter or darker than the surrounding areas (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation respectively). These patches appear on areas of the skin that are not exposed to the sun, and their development is not related to the rashes.

== As a drug target ==
In recent studies, human DNA ligase I was used in [[Computer-aided drug design]] to identify DNA ligase inhibitors as possible therapeutic agents to treat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomkinson AE, Howes TR, Wiest NE | title = DNA ligases as therapeutic targets | journal = Translational Cancer Research | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24224145 | pmc = 3819426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since excessive cell growth is a hallmark of cancer development, targetes chemotherapy that disrupts the functioning of DNA ligase can impede adjuvant cancer forms. Furthermore, it has been shown that DNA ligase can be broadly divided into two categories namely, ATP dependent and NAD+ dependent. Previous research has shown that although NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent DNA ligases have been discovered in sporadic cellular or viral niches outside the bacterial domain of life, there is no instance in which a NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent ligase is present in a eukaryal organism. The narrow phylogenetic distribution, unique substrate specificity, and distinctive domain structure of NAD+ depandant compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases recommend the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ligases as targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs.&lt;ref name="Shuman 17365–17369" /&gt;

'''Edward Acton''' (died 1707) was a [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] in the [[Royal Navy]], distinguished for services in the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].

==Life==
Acton was the son of Mary Acton,&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=72|title=Acton, Edward|first=Peter |last=Le Fevre}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumed to have been the grandson of [[Sir Edward Acton, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Acton]] of [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Acton, Edward|first=John Knox |last=Laughton|authorlink=John Knox Laughton|volume=1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He engaged as a volunteer and rose to become a captain.

In 1703 Acton had Captain [[Richard Kirkby (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Kirkby]] and Captain [[Cooper Wade]] as prisoners as he escorted them back to England to be executed. They had been found guilty of failing to support Vice-Admiral [[John Benbow]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In Sir [[George Rooke]]'s vigorous and intrepid attack of [[Gibraltar]], he commanded the [[HMS Kingston (1697)|HMS ''Kingston'']], one of the [[battleship]]s at the [[Capture of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=ngb&gt;{{Cite Newgenbio |title=Acton, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the same chief, Acton took part in the [[Battle of Málaga (1704)|Battle of Málaga]] (1704); but aspersions had been cast upon his bravery. Fortunately, however, for Acton, and others who underwent the same ordeal, a [[court martial]] silenced slander and exposed the fabrications. He was fully and honourably acquitted.&lt;ref name=ngb/&gt;

In 1706 he took command of {{HMS|Grafton}} which was refitted the following year. Whilst part of a larger battle and while escorting other ships his ship was engaged by two French ships under the command of [[Claude de Forbin]] off [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]]. Acton was killed.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

The '''European social model''' is a common vision many European states have for a society that combines economic growth with high [[living standard]]s and good [[working conditions]]. Historian [[Tony Judt]] has argued that the European social model "binds Europe together" in contrast to the '[[American way of life]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/politics1|title=The Guardian|last=Laity|first=Paul|date=17 May 2008|work=Uncomfortable truths. Interview with Tony Judt.|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European states do not all use a single [[social model]], but [[welfare state]]s in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include a commitment to [[full employment]], [[social protection]]s for all citizens, [[social inclusion]], and democracy. Examples common among European countries include [[universal health care]], free higher education, strong labor protections and regulations, and generous welfare programs in areas such as unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and public housing. The [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of the European Community]] set out several social objectives: "promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|title=The European Social Model|date=21 March 2007|publisher=European Trade Union Confederation|accessdate=4 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109165943/http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe: the Nordic, British, Mediterranean and the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, André. 2005.

New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the [[Post-World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]]. [[Tony Judt]] lists a number of causes: the abandonment of [[protectionism]], the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]], cheap energy, and a desire to catch up with [[living standards]] enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12767280&amp;source=login_payBarrier|title=The Economist|last=Charlemagne|date=11 December 2008|work=The left's resignation note|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, [[globalisation]], [[Europeanisation]] and an [[Ageing of Europe|ageing population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/933|title=Europe's Ailing Social Model: Facts &amp; Fairy-Tales|author=Martin De Vlieghere|author2=Paul Vreymans|last-author-amp=yes|date=23 March 2006|work=The Brussels Journal|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/en/suomen_pankki/ajankohtaista/puheet/2007/EL_puhe27112007.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Liikanen: "A European Social Model: an Asset or a Liability?"|date=27 November 2007|publisher=The World Political Forum|accessdate=3 January 2010|location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare state in Europe==
[[Image:Social Expenditures in the EU.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]
Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/cre/publish/pdfs/wp61a.pdf article]&lt;/ref&gt; A unique "European social model" is described in contrast with the social model existing in the US.

===Nordic model===
{{see also|Nordic model}}
As can be seen in the graph to the right, the Nordic model holds the highest level of [[social insurance]]. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of "citizenship". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions.

As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in [[active labour market policies]] whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the [[unemployment|unemployed]] into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of [[public employment]]. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution.

The Nordic model is also characterised by a high [[tax wedge]].

===Continental model===
{{see also|Rhine capitalism}}
The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of "security" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25).

As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in [[collective agreement]]s.

Another important aspect of the Continental model is the [[disability pension]]s.

===Anglo-Saxon model===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}
The Anglo-Saxon model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its [[social assistance]] of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously).

Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.

===Mediterranean model===&lt;!-- "Mediterranean model" redirects here --&gt;
The '''Mediterranean model'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; corresponds to southern European countries who developed their [[welfare state]] later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with the lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions.

The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid [[employment protection legislation]] and a frequent resort to [[early retirement]] policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglo-Saxon model.

==Evaluating the different social models==
[[Image:Reducción en la pobreza de los Modelos Sociales Europeos.png|thumb|350px|Reduction in poverty by the different European social models. Reduction in [[Gini index]] after transfers and taxes (in percentage change).]]
[[Image:Eficiencia Gastos Sociales.jpg|thumb|350px|Efficiency of social expenditures in the four European social models]]

To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following:
# Reduction in poverty. 
# Protection against labour market risks. 
# Rewards for labour participation.

===Reduction in poverty===
The graph on the right shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the [[Gini index]]) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoqued by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =European Social Model and East Asian Economic Model – different approach to productivity and competition in economy|publisher= Asia – Europe. Partnership or Rivalry?”|date= 2010|accessdate=4 August 2016|location= Wrocław|pages= 35–47|url= http://www.proeconomics.pl/artykuly/ESMandEAEM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line.

===Protection against labour market risks===
[[Image:Relación entre protección al empleo y % trabajadores con beneficios desempleo.jpg|thumb|350px|As can be seen, there exists a negative relationship between [[employment protection legislation]] and the share of workers receiving [[unemployment benefits]].]]

Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: 
# Regulation of the labour market by means of employment protection legislation which basically increases firing costs and [[severance payments]] for the employers. This is generally referred to as providing "employment" protection.
# [[Unemployment benefit]]s which are commonly financed with taxes or [[mandatory public insurance]]s to the employees and employers. This is generally referred to as providing protection to the "worker" as opposed to "employment".

As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: 
* The Mediterranean countries have chosen a higher "employment" protection while a very low share of their unemployed workers receives unemployment benefits. 
* The Nordic countries have chosen to protect to a lesser extent "employment" and instead, an important share of their unemployed workers receives benefits. 
* The continental countries have a higher level of both mechanisms than the European average, although by a small margin. 
* The Anglo-Saxon countries base their protection on unemployment benefits and a low level of employment protection.

Evaluating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment.

===Rewards for labour participation===
[[Image:Ratio Empleo-Población.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Employment rate|Employment]] and [[Unemployment rate|unemployment]] rates for each social model]]
Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the [[employment-to-population ratio]] as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The [[Lisbon Strategy]] initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010.

In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target.

===Conclusion===
[[Image:Tipologia de los distintos modelos sociales europeos.png|thumb|400px|Classifying the different social models according to their [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Equity (economics)|equity]]. Elevada means high whereas Baja means low.]]
Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: 
# [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]], that is, whether the model provides the incentives so as to achieve the largest number possible of employed persons, that is, the highest [[employment rate]]. 
# Equity, that is, whether the social model achieves a relatively low poverty risk.

As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model under-performs in both criteria.

Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglo-Saxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="96456">{{About|the theological questions of free will||Free will (disambiguation)}}
'''Free will in theology''' is an important part of the debate on [[free will]] in general. Religions vary greatly in their response to the standard argument against free will and thus might appeal to any number of responses to the [[argument from free will|paradox of free will]], the claim that [[omniscience]] and free will are incompatible.

==Overview==
{{main article|Argument from free will}}
The [[theology|theological]] doctrine of divine foreknowledge is often alleged to be in conflict with free will, particularly in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] circles: if [[God]] knows exactly what will happen (right down to every choice a person makes), it would seem that the "freedom" of these choices is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Alston, William P. 1985. "Divine Foreknowledge and Alternative Conceptions of Human Freedom." International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 18:1, 19–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] problem of the sea battle: tomorrow either there will or will not be a sea battle. According to the [[Law of excluded middle]], there seems to be two options. If there will be sea battle, then it seems that it was true even yesterday that there would be one. Thus it is ''necessary'' that the sea battle will occur. If there will not be one, then, by similar reasoning, it is necessary that it will not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "De Interpretatione" in ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', vol. I, ed. Jonathan Barnes. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; That means that the future, whatever it is, is completely fixed by past truths: true propositions about the future (a [[determinism|deterministic]] conclusion is reached: things could not have been any other way).

However, some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp p. 46–7&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo]] in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common defenses==
[[Jewish philosophy]] stresses that free will is a product of the intrinsic human soul, using the word ''neshama'' (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew root]] ''n.sh.m.'' or .נ.ש.מ meaning "breath"), but the ability to make a free choice is through ''Yechida'' (from Hebrew word "yachid", יחיד, singular), the part of the soul that is united with God,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the only being that is not hindered by or dependent on cause and effect (thus, freedom of will does not belong to the realm of the physical reality, and inability of natural philosophy to account for it is expected).

In [[Islam]], the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge but with God's ''jabr'' or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia Islam]], Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm Man and His Destiny]&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. All actions committed by man's free will are said to be counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are his/her own and not God's.

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848)''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence,"''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

===In the Bible===
The biblical ground for free will lies in the [[fall of man|fall]] into sin by [[Adam and Eve]] that occurred in their "willfully chosen" disobedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. "Fall, the."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom” and "free will" can be treated as one because the two terms are commonly used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, “Determinism and Freedom Philosophy – Its Terminology,” http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwTerminology.html (accessed November 7, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are widespread disagreements in definitions of the two terms.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', (Oxford, 2005), 10 and Fischer, J., Kane, R., Pereboom, D., &amp; Vargas, M., ''Four Views on Free Will'' (Blackwell, 2007), 128 and R. Eric Barnes, {{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/ebarnes/101/101-freedom-topic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216033737/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/ebarnes/101/101-freedom-topic.htm |archivedate=2005-02-16 |df= }} (accessed October 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these disagreements, [[Mortimer Adler]] found that a delineation of three kinds of freedom is necessary for clarity on the subject, as follows:

(1) '''Circumstantial freedom''' is "freedom from coercion or restraint" that prevents acting as one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the Bible, circumstantial freedom was given to the Israelites in [[The Exodus]] from slavery in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, Philip Wesley Comfort, eds, ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' (Tyndale House, 2001), s.v. “Exodus,” 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) '''Natural freedom''' (a.k.a. volitional freedom) is freedom to determine one’s own "decisions or plans." Natural freedom is inherent in all people, in all circumstances, and "''without regard'' to any state of mind or character which they may or may not acquire in the course of their lives."&lt;ref name="Mortimer J. Adler 1958"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bible, paralleling Adler, views all humanity as naturally possessing the "free choice of the will."&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. McKim, ''Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996). s.v. "free will."&lt;/ref&gt; If  "free will" is taken to mean unconstrained and voluntary choice, the Bible assumes that all people, unregenerate and regenerate, possess it.&lt;ref name="D. Douglas 1962"&gt;J. D. Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'' (Eerdmans, 1962), s.v. "Liberty, Section III. FREE WILL."&lt;/ref&gt; For examples, "free will" is taught in Matthew 23:37 and Revelation 22:17.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Free, revised and expanded by Howard Frederic Vos, ''Archaeology and Bible History'' (Zondervan, 1992.), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2015}}

(3) '''Acquired freedom''' is freedom "to live as [one] ought to live," a freedom that requires a transformation whereby a person acquires a righteous, holy, healthy, etc. "state of mind or character."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bible testifies to the need for acquired freedom because no one "is free for obedience and faith till he is freed from sin’s dominion." People possess natural freedom but their “voluntary choices” serve sin until they acquire freedom from "sin’s dominion." The ''New Bible Dictionary'' denotes this acquired freedom for "obedience and faith" as "free will" in a theological sense.&lt;ref name="D. Douglas 1962"/&gt; Therefore, in biblical thinking, an acquired freedom from being "enslaved to sin" is needed "to live up to Jesus' commandments to love God and love neighbor."&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Sin: Radical Evil in Soul and Society'' (Eerdmans, 1994), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus told his hearers that they needed to be made "free indeed" (John 8:36). "Free indeed [''ontós'']" means "truly free" or "really free," as it is in some translations.&lt;ref&gt;Strong’s ''Greek Dictionary'' translates ''ontós'' as “really” or “truly.” Versions using these translations include ''The Darby Translation'', ''The Bible in Basic English'', ''New Century Version'', ''Young’s Literal Translation'', and ''Good News Translation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Being made “free indeed” means freedom from “bondage to sin.”&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Burge, “Gospel of John,” in ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation'', ed. Craig A. Evans, (David C. Cook, 2005), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This acquired freedom is “freedom to serve the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. “Freedom.”&lt;/ref&gt; Being "free indeed" (i.e., true freedom) comes by "God’s changing our nature" to free us from being "slaves to sin." and endowing us with "the freedom to choose to be righteous."

Mark R. Talbot,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Mark-Talbot&lt;/ref&gt; a "classical Christian theist,"&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “Does God Reveal Who He Actually Is?” in ''God Under Fire'', ed. Douglas S. Huffman, Eric L. Johnson (Zondervan, 2002), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; views this acquired [[Compatibilism|"compatibilist]] freedom" as the freedom that "Scripture portrays as worth having."&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “True Freedom: The Liberty That Scripture Portrays as Worth Having” in ''Beyond the Bounds'', ed. John Piper and others, 105-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open theism]] denies that classical theism’s [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] "freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, "True Freedom: The Liberty That Scripture Portrays as Worth Having" in ''Beyond the Bounds'', ed. John Piper and others, (Crossway, 2003), 107,109.&lt;/ref&gt; qualifies as true freedom. For open theism, true [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian freedom]] is [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist freedom]]. Regardless of factors, a person has the freedom to choose opposite alternatives. In open theist [[William Hasker]]’s words, regarding any action it is always "''within the agent’s power to perform the action and also in the agent’s power to refrain from the action''."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, “A Philosophical Perspective,” in ''The Openness of God'' (InterVarsity, 1994), 136-137, Hasker’s italics.&lt;/ref&gt; Although open theism generally contradicts classical theism’s "freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise," Hasker allows that Jesus possessed and humans in heaven will possess such a freedom. Regarding Jesus, Hasker views Jesus as “a free agent,” but he also thinks that "it was not really possible" that Jesus would "abort the mission."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, answer to "Did Jesus have free will?" at {{cite web |url=http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_03.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306181014/http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_03.php |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }} (accessed September 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding heaven, Hasker foresees that as the result of our choice we will be "unable to sin" because all sinful impulses will be gone.&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, answer to "So, will there be free will in heaven?" at

===Roman Catholic===
Theologians of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] universally embrace the idea of free will, but generally do not view free will as existing apart from or in contradiction to [[divine grace|grace]]. According to the Roman Catholic Church "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, section 600&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] wrote extensively on free will, with Augustine focusing on the importance of free will in his responses to the [[Manichaeans]], and also on the limitations of a concept of unlimited free will as denial of grace, in his refutations of [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]].

The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church asserts that "Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1731|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It goes on to say that "God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1730|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The section concludes with the role that grace plays, "By the working of grace the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1742|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin Christianity's views on free will and grace are often contrasted with predestination in [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[Protestant Christianity]], especially after the [[Counter-Reformation]], but in understanding differing conceptions of free will it is just as important to understand the differing conceptions of the nature of God, focusing on the idea that God can be all-powerful and all-knowing even while people continue to exercise free will, because God transcends time.

The papal encyclical on human freedom, ''Libertas Praestantissimum'' by Pope Leo XIII (1888),&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13liber.htm Libertas Praestantissimum]'', 1888&lt;/ref&gt; seems to leave the question unresolved as to the relation between free will and determinism: whether the correct notion is the compatibilist one or the libertarian one. The quotations supporting compatibilism include the one from St. Thomas (footnote 4) near the end of paragraph 6, regarding the cause of evil ("Whereas, when he sins, he acts in opposition to reason, is moved by another, and is the victim of foreign misapprehensions"),&lt;ref&gt;Likewise in paragraph 5 that the good or the choice of the good comes from the judgement of reason (in Roman Catholic doctrine it is not identical with free will), which is usually considered causal in philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar passus suggesting a natural, cause-and-effect function of human will ("harmony with his natural inclinations", "Creator of will", "by whom all things are moved in conformity with their nature") near the end of paragraph 8 (when considering the problem of how grace can have effects on free will). On the other hand, metaphysical libertarianism &amp;ndash; at least as a sort of possibility of reversing the direction of one's acting &amp;ndash; is suggested by the reference to the well-known philosophical term ''metaphysical freedom'' at the beginning of paragraph 3 and, to an extent, a contrasting comparison of animals, which always act "of necessity", with human liberty, by means of which one can "either act or not act, do this or do that".

Critique that seems more or less to support popular incompatibilistic views can be found in some papal documents especially in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;See especially e.g. [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYRE.HTM an address of Pius XII to the Fifth International Congress on Psychotherapy and Clinical Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; no ''explicit'' condemnation, however, of causal determinism in its most generic form can be found there. More often these documents focus on condemnation of physicalism/materialism and the stressing of significance of belief in soul, as a non-physical indivisible substance equipped with intellect and will, which decides human proceeding in a (perhaps imprecise) way.

===Orthodox Christianity===

====Oriental Orthodox====
The concept of free will is also of vital importance in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental]] (or [[miaphysitism|non-Chalcedonian]]) Churches,  those in communion with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. As in Judaism, free will is regarded as [[axiomatic]]. Everyone is regarded as having a free choice as to in what measure he or she will follow his or her [[conscience]] or [[:wikt:arrogance|arrogance]], these two having been appointed for each individual. The more one follows one's conscience, the more it brings one good results, and the more one follows one's arrogance, the more it brings one bad results. Following only one's arrogance is sometimes likened to the dangers of falling into a pit while walking in pitch darkness, without the light of conscience to illuminate the path. Very similar doctrines have also found written expression in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] "Manual of Discipline", and in some religious texts possessed by the [[Beta Israel]] Jews of [[Ethiopia]].

====Eastern Orthodox====
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] (or [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] espouses a belief different from the Lutheran, Calvinist, and Arminian Protestant views. The difference is in the interpretation of [[original sin]], alternatively known as "[[ancestral sin]]," where the Orthodox do not believe in [[total depravity]]. The Orthodox reject the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] view that the original sin did not damage human nature; they accept that the human nature is depraved, but despite man's fallenness the divine image he bears has not been destroyed.

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. St. [[John Cassian]], a 4th-century Church Father and pupil of St. [[John Chrysostom]], articulated this view and all the Eastern Fathers embraced it. He taught that "Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God", and that "Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.".

Some [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] use the parable of a drowning man to plainly illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, pulls him up, saving him, and the man, if he wants to be saved, must hold on tightly to the rope; explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself, and that man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christian novelist, suggested many arguments for and against free will. Famous arguments are found in "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" chapter in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', and in his work ''[[Notes from Underground]]''. He also developed an argument that suicide, if irrational, is actually a validation of free will (see Kirilov in the [[The Devils (novel)|Demons]]) novel. As for the argument presented in ''The Brothers Karamazov'''s section "The Rebellion" that the suffering of innocents was not worth the price of free will, Dostoevsky appears to propose the idea of [[apocatastasis]] (or [[universal reconciliation]]) as one possible rational solution.

;Roman Catholic teaching
Illustrating as it does that the human part in salvation (represented by holding on to the rope) must be preceded and accompanied by grace (represented by the casting and drawing of the rope), the image of the drowning man holding on to the rope cast and drawn by his rescuer corresponds closely to Roman Catholic teaching, which holds that God, who "destined us in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 257] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003725/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM |date=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes in his eternal plan of "predestination" each person's free response to his grace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 600]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church holds to the teaching that "by free will, (the human person) is capable of directing himself toward his true good … man is endowed with freedom, an outstanding manifestation of the divine image'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a1.htm CCC 1704-1705]&lt;/ref&gt; Man has free will either to accept or reject the grace of God, so that for salvation "there is a kind of interplay, or [[synergy]], between human freedom and divine grace".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cymM4xEM76wC&amp;pg=PA766&amp;dq=Catechism+Catholic+Church+synergy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cu4dTLPRE8qHOLbolPEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Catechism of the Catholic Church, Reader's Guide to Themes (Burns &amp; Oates 1999] {{ISBN|0-86012-366-9}}), p. 766&lt;/ref&gt; "Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent: 'When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God's sight' (Council of Trent)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm CCC 1993] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623190358/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm |date=June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P70.HTM CCC 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, therefore, human cooperation with grace is essential.&lt;ref name="ZJlLHLPY8C p. 186"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i6ZJlLHLPY8C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=%22holy+spirit%22+%22human+cooperation%22+catholic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=apsdeqjBwe&amp;sig=lUEQnuuiY2rMxLf2_4Yq8fzAezg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E4EpTJ-mCI3y0gSi9NDcAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22holy%20spirit%22%20%22human%20cooperation%22%20catholic&amp;f=false James Patrick, ''Renaissance and Reformation'' (Marshall Cavendish 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-7614-7651-1}}), vol. 1, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; When God establishes his eternal plan of 'predestination', he includes in it each person's free response to his grace, whether it is positive or negative: "In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place" ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:27-28}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM CCC 600)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative comes from God,&lt;ref&gt;We receive the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit, and without the Holy Spirit no one can have faith in Christ ({{bibleverse|1|Cor.|12:3}}), and as Saint Cyril of Alexandria said: "It is unworkable for the soul of man to achieve any of the goods, namely, to control its own passions and to escape the mightiness of the sharp trap of the devil, unless he is fortified by the grace of the Holy Spirit and on this count he has Christ himself in his soul" (Against Julian, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; but it demands a free response from man: "God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration".&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt; "Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P70.HTM CCC 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Orthodox criticism of Roman Catholic theology
Orthodox theologian [[Vladimir Lossky]] has stated that the teaching of [[John Cassian]], who in the East is considered a witness to Tradition, but who "was unable to make himself correctly understood", "was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West".&lt;ref&gt;It is not, in the circumstances, surprising that a representative of the Eastern tradition-St. John Cassian-who took part in this debate and was opposed both to the Pelagians and to St Augustine, was not able to make himself correctly understood. His position of seeming to stand 'above' the conflict, was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West. The Eastern Church, on the other hand, has always considered him as a witness to tradition.

Where the Roman Catholic Church defends the concept of faith and free will these are questioned in the East by the conclusions of the [[Second Council of Orange]]. This council is not accepted by the Eastern churches and the Roman Catholic Church's use{{Failed verification|date=August 2010|reason = the citation says nothing of an alleged use or even a single instance of the Roman Catholic Church describing "their position" (whose?) and Cassian himself as semi-Pelagian - and Florovsky explicitly says that there wasn't unanimity within the Latin Church}}&lt;ref&gt;Council of Orange local Council, never accepted in the East, 529 AD Convened regarding Pelagianism. Condemned various beliefs of Pelagianism: that humans are unaffected by Adam's sin, that a person's move towards God can begin without grace, that an increase of faith can be attained apart from grace, that salvation can be attained apart from the Holy Spirit, that man's free will can be restored from its destruction apart from baptism, that 'merit' may precede grace, that man can do good and attain salvation without God's help, Statement we must, under the blessing of God, preach and believe as follows. The sin of the first man has so impaired and weakened free will that no one thereafter can either love God as he ought or believe in God or do good for God's sake, unless the grace of divine mercy has preceded him....According to the Roman Catholic faith we also believe that after grace has been received through baptism, all baptized persons have the ability and responsibility, if they desire to labor faithfully, to perform with the aid and cooperation of Christ what is of essential importance in regard to the salvation of their soul. We not only do not believe that any are foreordained to evil by the power of God, but even state with utter abhorrence that if there are those who want to believe so evil a thing, they are anathema. We also believe and confess to our benefit that in every good work it is not we who take the initiative and are then assisted through the mercy of God, but God himself first inspires in us both faith in him and love for him without any previous good works of our own that deserve reward, so that we may both faithfully seek the sacrament of baptism, and after baptism be able by his help to do what is pleasing to him.

The balanced synergistic doctrine of the early and Eastern Church, a doctrine misunderstood and undermined by Latin Christianity in general from St. Augustine on— although there was always opposition to this in the Latin Church— always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation.

Although the Roman Catholic Church explicitly teaches that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants",&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904224955/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM |date=September 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some Eastern Orthodox nevertheless claim that Roman Catholicism professes the teaching, which they attribute to Saint Augustine, that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt of Adam's sin.&lt;ref&gt;So far Roman Catholicism agrees with the Church; it differs with Orthodoxy on the nature of man's fall and the human condition. Following Augustine of Hippo, the Latins teach that Adam and Eve sinned against God. The guilt of their sin has been inherited by every man, woman and child after them. All humanity is liable for their "original sin." WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORTHODOXY AND ROMAN CATHOLICISM? by Father [[Michael Azkoul]] [http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/ortho_cath.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Orthodox, I discovered, objected to the Roman Catholic understanding of original sin as the stain of inherited guilt passed down from Adam, as a result of his sin, to the rest of the human race. The Orthodox saw this notion of original sin as skewed, drawing almost exclusively on the thought of Saint Augustine. He had virtually ignored the teachings of the Eastern Fathers, who tended to see original sin not as inherited guilt but rather as "the ancestral curse" by which human beings were alienated from the divine life and thus became subject to corruption and death.

As I read further, I discovered that Saint Augustine's and consequently, the Roman Catholic Church's view was the result of the faulty Latin translation of Romans 5:12, the New Testament passage on which the teaching of original sin is based. When the original Greek is properly translated it reads, "Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and death spread to all in that (eph ho) all sinned.  . ." The Latin which Augustine used rendered the eph ho ("in that") as in
&gt; quo ("in whom"), meaning "in Adam." Thus the passage was misconstrued as saying that all sinned in Adam, that all shared in the guilt of his original disobedience.

It is understandable how the Roman Catholic doctrine of original sin followed from this misinterpretation. It is also easy to see why the Orthodox rejected the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. Because they understood original sin in terms of the ancestral curse of human mortality, they saw Pius IX's dogma as amounting to no less than an assertion of Mary's immortality! That is, by saying that Mary was free from original sin, the Roman Church in effect was saying that Mary was not mortal! She was therefore not like the rest of the human race. This was something no Orthodox Christian could accept. In fact, Orthodoxy calls Mary "the first of the redeemed", the first human to receive the great blessing of salvation now available to all mankind.

===Differences of view between Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches===
Various Roman Catholic theologians identify Cassian as a teacher of the [[Semipelagianism|semipelagian]] heresy which was condemned by the Council of Orange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWpO1--eMrYC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Catholic+History++Cassian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=87M0TJ2PCIL78Aa_6-WIAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cassian&amp;f=false OSV's encyclopedia of Roman Catholic history By Matthew Bunson's]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=cassian+semipelagianism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nyI1TNvKEIaBlAfm2unUBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An Introduction to the Early History of Christian Doctrine: To the Time of ... - James Franklin Bethune-Baker - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;Yet Cassian did not himself escape the suspicion of erroneous teaching; he is in fact regarded as the originator of what, since the Middle Ages, has been known as Semipelagianism.

But— and here is the great difficulty created by an unbalanced Christianity on the doctrine of grace and freedom— in freely creating man God willed to give man an inner spiritual freedom. In no sense is this a Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian position. The balanced synergistic doctrine of the early and Eastern Church, a doctrine misunderstood and undermined by Latin Christianity in general from St. Augustine on— although there was always opposition to this in the Latin Church— always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation. What it always rejected— both spontaneously and intellectually— is the idea of irresistible grace, the idea that man has no participating role in his salvation. The Ascetic Ideal and the New Testament: Reflections on the Critique of the Theology of the Reformation [[Georges Florovsky]] [http://jbburnett.com/resources/florovsky/florovsky_10-1-ascet-ideal.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, some Roman Catholic theologians have argued that Cassian's writings should not be considered semipelagian.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} And scholars of other denominations too have concluded that Cassian's thought "is not Semi-Pelagian",&lt;ref name=Pristas&gt;[http://escholarship.bc.edu/dissertations/AAI9329276/ Lauren Pristas, ''The Theological Anthropology of John Cassian'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he instead taught that "salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace"&lt;ref name=Pristas/&gt; and held that "God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' - even faith."&lt;ref name=Casiday-faith&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fC0tYhHDHbEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=cassian+baldly+asserts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OFvglZnBsV&amp;sig=NArSD9TzmzlWaaGNmWXDFF6CM3I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XQxATKKRHJr40wSO4NyZDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cassian%20baldly%20asserts&amp;f=false Augustine Casiday, ''Tradition and Theology in St John Cassian'' (Oxford University Press 2007] {{ISBN|0-19-929718-5}}), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of [[synergy]] (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. Once baptised the experience of his salvation and relationship with God is called [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]. Mankind has free will to accept or reject the grace of God. Rejection of the gifts of God is called blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (gifts of grace, faith, life).&lt;ref&gt;We receive the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit, and without the Holy Spirit no one can have faith in Christ (I Cor. 12:3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Alexandria: "For it is unworkable for the soul of man to achieve any of the goods, namely, to control its own passions and to escape the mightiness of the sharp trap of the devil, unless he is fortified by the grace of the Holy Spirit and on this count he has Christ himself in his soul." (Against Julian, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The first who defined this teaching was [[John Cassian]], 4th-century Church Father, and a pupil of [[John Chrysostom]], and all Eastern Fathers accept it. He taught that "Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God", and that "Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason = Are these 20th-century-sounding quotations really Cassian's words or only something taken from the Elwell Evangelical Dictionary? They seem to go far beyond what I have so far found in the much-cited conference of John Cassian.  Did I miss them?}}

Some Orthodox use an example of a drowning man to illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, the man may take the rope if he wants to be saved, but he may decide not to take the rope and perish by his own will. Explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself. That man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

====Arminianism====
{{Main article|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate}}

Christians who were influenced by the teachings of [[Jacobus Arminius]] (such as [[Methodists]]) believe that while God is all-knowing and always knows what choices each person will make, and he still gives them the ability to choose or not choose everything, regardless of whether there are any internal or external factors contributing to that choice. 

Like [[John Calvin]], Arminius affirmed [[total depravity]], but Arminius believed that only [[prevenient grace]] allowed people to choose salvation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concerning grace and free will, this is what I teach according to the Scriptures and orthodox consent: Free will is unable to begin or to perfect any true and spiritual good, without grace....  This grace [''prœvenit''] goes before, accompanies, and follows; it excites, assists, operates that we will, and co operates lest we will in vain.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Arminius, ''The Works of James Arminius, D.D., Formerly Professor of Divinity in the University of Leyden'' (Auburn, NY: Derby and Miller, 1853), 4:472.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prevenient grace is [[divine grace]] which precedes human decision. It exists prior to and without reference to anything humans may have done. As humans are corrupted by the effects of [[sin]], prevenient grace allows persons to engage their God-given [[free will]] to choose the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ or to reject that salvific offer.

[[Thomas Jay Oord]] offers perhaps the most cogent free will theology presupposing prevenient grace. What he calls "essential kenosis" says God acts preveniently to give freedom/agency to all creatures. This gift comes from God's eternal essence, and is therefore necessary. God remains free in choosing how to love, but the fact that God loves and therefore gives freedom/agency to others is a necessary part of what it means to be divine.

This view is backed in the Bible with verses such as [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke13:34&amp;version=NKJV Luke 13:34], NKJV
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here we see Jesus lamenting that He is unable to save [[Jerusalem]] as they are not willing. We see that whilst Jesus wants to save Jerusalem He respects their choice to continue on in sin despite His will that they be saved.

====Lutheranism====
{{main article|Lutheranism}}
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=50; 1 Cor. 2:14], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2012:3;&amp;version=31; 12:3], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.%208:7;&amp;version=31; Rom. 8:7], [[Martin Chemnitz]], [[Examination of the Council of Trent]]: Vol. I. Trans. Fred Kramer,  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1971, pp. 409-53, "Seventh Topic, Concerning Free Will: From the Decree of the Sixth Session of the Council of Trent".&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe that although humans have free will concerning civil righteousness, they cannot work spiritual righteousness without the Holy Spirit, since righteousness in the heart cannot be wrought in the absence of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.html#article18 Augsburg Confession, Article 18, Of Free Will].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, humanity is free to choose and act in every regard except for the choice of salvation.

Lutherans also teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly "good," are [[Incurvatus in se|not capable]] of doing works that satisfy God's justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:18 Rom. 7:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:7;&amp;version=9; 8:7] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=31; 1 Cor. 2:14], [[Martin Chemnitz]], Examination of the Council of Trent: Vol. I. Trans. Fred Kramer,  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1971, pp. 639-52, "The Third Question: Whether the Good Works of the Regenerate in This Life Are So Perfect that They Fully, Abundantly, and Perfectly Satisfy the Divine Law".&lt;/ref&gt; Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and [[Concupiscence|sinful motives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%206:5;&amp;version=9; Gen. 6:5], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%208:21;&amp;version=31;#en-NIV-205 8:21], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat.%207:17;&amp;version=31; Mat. 7:17], [[Charles Porterfield Krauth|Krauth, C.P.]],&lt;cite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiURAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=388 The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology: As Represented in the Augsburg Confession, and in the History and Literature of the Evangelical Lutheran Church] &lt;/cite&gt;. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. 1875. pp. 388-90, Part IX The Specific Doctrines Of The Conservative Reformation: Original Sin, Thesis VII The Results, Section ii Positive.&lt;/ref&gt; For Luther himself, in his ''Bondage of the Will'', people are by nature endowed with free-will/free choice in regard to “goods and possessions” with which a person “has the right of using, acting, and omitting according to his Free-will.” However, in “God-ward” things pertaining to “salvation or damnation” people are in bondage “either to the will of God, or to the will of Satan.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823),  66.&lt;/ref&gt;

As found in [[Paul Althaus]]’ study of Luther’s theology,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), §§ “The Bondage of the Will” and “Original Sin,” 156-170, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; sin’s infection of every human thought and deed began with [[Fall of man|Adam’s fall]] into sin, the [[Original sin|Original Sin]]. Adam’s fall was a “terrible example” of what “free will” will do unless God constantly motivates it to virtuous behavior. Humanity inherits Adam’s sin. Thus, in our “natural condition,” we have an inborn desire to sin because that is the person we are by birth. As Luther noted, “Adam sinned willingly and freely and from him a will to sin has been born into us so that we cannot sin innocently but only voluntarily.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial term ''liberum arbitrium'' was translated “free-will” by [[Henry Cole (minister)|Henry Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823)&lt;/ref&gt; and “free will” remains in general use. However, the [[Ernest Gordon Rupp|Rupp]]/Watson study of Luther and Erasmus chose “free choice” as the translation and provided a rationale.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson, ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'' (Westminister, 1969), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther used “free choice” (or “free-will”) to denote the fact that humans act “spontaneously” and with “a desirous willingness.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 60&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed “Free-will” as that “power” by which humans “can be caught by the Spirit” of God.&lt;ref&gt;63BOWCole&lt;/ref&gt; However, he deplored the use of the term “Free-will” because it is too “grand, copious, and full.” Therefore, Luther held that the inborn faculty of “willingness” should be “called by some other term.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although our wills are a function of and are in bondage to our inherited sinful desires, Luther insisted that we sin “voluntarily.” Voluntarily means that we sin of our own free will.&lt;ref&gt;“Voluntarily” means “of one's own free will.” http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/voluntarily&lt;/ref&gt; We will to do what we desire. As long as we desire sin, our wills are only free for sin. This is Luther’s “bondage of the will” to sin. The sinner’s “will is bound, but it is and remains ''his'' will. He repeatedly and voluntarily acts according to it.” So it is, to be set free from sin and for righteousness requires a “rebirth through faith.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; A rebirth of faith gives “true freedom from sin,” which is, wrote Luther, "a liberty [freedom] to do good.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Commentary on Romans'', J. Theodore Mueller, translator (Kregel Classics, 1976), xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

To use a biblical word important to Luther, to be set free ''from'' sin and ''for'' righteousness requires a [[Metanoia (theology)|metanoia]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadwell Walden, ''The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia: Lost in the Old Version, Unrecovered in the New'' (Thomas Whittaker, 1896), 26, footnote #1. Available online in Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther used Jesus’ image of [[The Tree and its Fruits|the good and bad trees]] to depict the necessity of changing the person to change what a person wills and does. In Jesus’ image, “a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit” (Matthew 7:18).&lt;ref&gt;Steven D. Paulson, ''Luther for the Armchair Theologians'' (Westminster John Knox, 2004), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the bad tree that can only produce bad fruit, before a rebirth through faith, people are in bondage to the sinful desires of their hearts. They can only will to do sin, albeit “spontaneously and with a desirous willingness.”&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Lutzer, ''The Doctrines That Divide: A Fresh Look at the Historic Doctrines That Separate Christians'' (Kregel, 1998), 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Given his view of the human condition, Luther concluded that, without a rebirth, the “free choice” that all humans possess is “not free at all” because it cannot of itself free itself from its inherent bondage to sin.&lt;ref&gt;''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'', edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Luther distinguished between different kinds of freedom: (a) by nature, a freedom to act as we will and (b) by rebirth through faith, a freedom to act righteously.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, “On the Bondage of the Will” (1525), in ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'', edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969, reissued by Westminster John Knox, 2006), 27, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

====God and creation====
Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, [[Adam and Eve]] chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Sponheim, "The Origin of Sin," in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;, Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson, eds. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984), 385–407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pieper"&gt;[[Franz August Otto Pieper|Francis Pieper]], "Definition of Original Sin," in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt; (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1953), 1:538.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, people are saddled with [[Original sin#Lutheranism|original sin]], born sinful and unable to avoid committing sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Porterfield Krauth|Krauth, C.P.]],&lt;cite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiURAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=355 The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology: As Represented in the Augsburg Confession, and in the History and Literature of the Evangelical Lutheran Church] &lt;/cite&gt;. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. 1875. pp. 335-455, Part IX The Specific Doctrines Of The Conservative Reformation: Original Sin.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lutherans, original sin is the "chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins."&lt;ref&gt;[[Formula of Concord]], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-sd/originalsin.html Original Sin].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lutherans, God preserves his creation, in doing so cooperates with everything that happens, and guides the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House. 1934. pp. 189-195 and Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 635 and [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=P&amp;word=PROVIDENCE Christian Cyclopedia] article on Divine Providence.

Lutherans disagree with those that make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Lutherans reject the Calvinist doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]]. Like both Calvinist camps, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in that "the natural [that is, corrupted and divinely unrenewed] powers of man cannot do anything or help towards salvation" ([[Formula of Concord]]: [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71]), and Lutherans go further along the same lines as the Free Grace advocates to say that the recipient of saving grace need not cooperate with it. Hence, Lutherans believe that a true Christian (that is, a genuine recipient of saving grace) can lose his or her salvation, "[b]ut the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work... [but that these persons] wilfully turn away..." ([http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/election.html Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. xi, par. 42]). Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

The Election of Grace, pp. 124-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

====Anabaptism====
The [[Anabaptist]] movement was characterized by the fundamental belief in the free will of man. Many earlier movements such as [[Waldensians]] and others likewise held this viewpoint.  Denominations today representing this view include [[Old Order Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]].

====Calvinism====
{{main article|Calvinism}}
[[John Calvin]] ascribed “free will” to all people in the sense that they act “voluntarily, and not by compulsion.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.23.2. Available online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.toc.html CCEL.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated his position by allowing "that man has choice and that it is self-determined” and that his actions stem from “his own voluntary choosing.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin from ''Bondage and Liberation of the Will'', edited by A.N.S. Lane, translated by G. I. Davies (Baker Academic, 2002) 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will that Calvin ascribed to all people is what [[Mortimer Adler#Freedom and free will|Mortimer Adler]] calls the “natural freedom” of the will. This freedom to will what one desires is inherent in all people.&lt;ref name="Mortimer J. Adler 1958"/&gt;

Calvin held this kind of inherent/natural&lt;ref&gt;Inherent and natural are synonyms. http://thesaurus.com/browse/inherent.&lt;/ref&gt; free will in disesteem because unless people acquire the freedom to live as they ought by being transformed, they will desire and voluntarily choose to sin. “Man is said to have free will,” wrote Calvin, “because he acts voluntarily, and not by compulsion. This is perfectly true: but why should so small a matter have been dignified with so proud a title?”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The glitch in this inherent/natural freedom of the will is that although all people have the “faculty of willing,” by nature they are unavoidably (and yet voluntarily without compulsion) under “the bondage of sin.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.3.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of free will that Calvin esteems is what Adler calls “acquired freedom” of the will, the freedom/ability&lt;ref&gt;Freedom and ability are synonyms. http://thesaurus.com/browse/freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; “to live as [one] ought.” To possess acquired free will requires a change by which a person acquires a desire to live a life marked by virtuous qualities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As Calvin describes the change required for acquired freedom, the will “must be wholly transformed and renovated.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin depicts this transformation as “a new heart and a new spirit (Ezek. 18:31).” It sets one free from “bondage to sin” and enables “piety towards God, and love towards men, general holiness and purity of life.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.3.6, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] embrace the idea of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]], namely, that God chose who would be saved and who would be not saved prior to the creation.  They quote Ephesians 1:4 "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight" and also 2:8 "For it is by grace you are saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." One of the strongest defenders of this theological point of view was the American [[Puritan]] preacher and theologian [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].

Edwards believed that indeterminism was incompatible with individual dependence on God and hence with his sovereignty. He reasoned that if individuals' responses to God's grace are contra-causally free, then their salvation depends partly on them and therefore God's sovereignty is not "absolute and universal." Edwards' book ''Freedom of the Will'' defends theological determinism. In this book, Edwards attempts to show that libertarianism is incoherent. For example, he argues that by 'self-determination' the libertarian must mean either that one's actions including one's acts of willing are preceded by an act of free will or that one's acts of will lack sufficient causes. The first leads to an infinite regress while the second implies that acts of will happen accidentally and hence can't make someone "better or worse, any more than a tree is better than other trees because it oftener happens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale; or a rock more vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have happened oftener to crawl over it."&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom of the Will'', 1754; Edwards 1957-, vol. 1, pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be thought that this view completely denies freedom of choice, however. It claims that man is free to act on his strongest moral impulse and volition, which is externally determined, but is not free to act contrary to them, or to alter them. Proponents, such as [[John L. Girardeau]], have indicated their belief that moral neutrality is impossible; that even if it were possible, and one were equally inclined to contrary options, one could make no choice at all; that if one is inclined, however slightly, toward one option, then that person will necessarily choose that one over any others.

Some non-Calvinist Christians attempt a reconciliation of the dual concepts of predestination and free will by pointing to the situation of God as Christ. In taking the form of a man, a necessary element of this process was that Jesus Christ lived the existence of a mortal. When Jesus was born he was not born with the omniscient power of God the Creator, but with the mind of a human child - yet he was still God in essence. The precedent this creates is that God is able to will the abandonment of His knowledge, or ignore knowledge, while remaining fully God. Thus it is not inconceivable that although omniscience demands that God knows what the future holds for individuals, it is within his power to deny this knowledge in order to preserve individual free will. Other theologians argue that the Calvinist-Edwardsean view suggests that if all human volitions are predetermined by God, then all actions dictated by fallen will of man necessarily satisfy His sovereign decree. Hence, it is impossible to act outside of God's perfect will, a conclusion some non-Calvinists claim poses a serious problem for ethics and [[moral theology]].

An early proposal toward such a reconciliation states that God is, in fact, not aware of future events, but rather, being eternal, He is outside time, and sees the past, present, and future as one whole creation.  Consequently, it is not as though God would know "in advance" that [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] would become guilty of homicide years prior to the event as an example, but that He was aware of it from all eternity, viewing all time as a single present.  This was the view offered by [[Boethius]] in Book V of ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''.

Calvinist theologian [[Loraine Boettner]] argued that the doctrine of divine foreknowledge does not escape the alleged problems of divine foreordination. He wrote that "what God foreknows must, in the very nature of the case, be as fixed and certain as what is foreordained; and if one is inconsistent with the free agency of man, the other is also. Foreordination renders the events certain, while foreknowledge presupposes that they are certain."[https://web.archive.org/web/20060805100404/http://www.solagratia.org/Articles/The_Foreknowledge_of_God.aspx] Some Christian theologians, feeling the bite of this argument, have opted to limit the doctrine of foreknowledge if not do away with it altogether, thus forming a new school of thought, similar to [[Socinianism]] and [[process theology]], called [[open theism]].

====Comparison of Protestants====
This table summarizes three classical Protestant beliefs about free will.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! John Calvin !! Martin Luther !! Jacob Arminius
|-
| For [[John Calvin|Calvin]], humanity possesses “free will,”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.23.2.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is in bondage to sin,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; unless it is “transformed.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; || For [[Martin Luther|Luther]], humanity possesses free-will/free choice in regard to “goods and possessions,” but regarding “salvation or damnation” people are in bondage either to God or Satan.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Cole (minister)|Henry Cole]], trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 66. The controversial term ''liberum arbitrium'' was translated “free-will” by Cole. However [[Ernest Gordon Rupp]] and Philip Saville Watson, ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'' (Westminister, 1969) chose “free choice” as their translation.&lt;/ref&gt; || For [[Jacobus Arminius|Arminius]], humanity possesses freedom from necessity, but not “freedom from sin” unless enabled by “[[prevenient grace]].”&lt;ref&gt;Keith D. Stanglin and Thomas H. McCall, ''Jacob Arminius: Theologian of Grace'' (Oxford University, 2012), 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Agency (LDS Church)}}
[[Mormonism|Mormons]] or Latter-day Saints, believe that God has given all humans the gift of moral agency. Moral agency includes free will and [[Agency (Mormonism)|agency]]. Proper exercise of unfettered choice leads to the ultimate goal of returning to God's presence. Having the choice to do right or wrong was important, because God wants a society of a certain type—those that comply with eternal laws. Before this Earth was created, this dispute over agency rose to the level that there was a "[[War of Heaven|war in heaven]]." [[Lucifer]] (who favored no agency) and his followers were cast out of heaven for rebelling against God's will.  Many Mormon leaders have also taught that the battle in Heaven over agency is now being carried out on earth{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, where dictators, influenced by Satan, fight against freedom (or free agency) in governments contrary to the will of God.

Mormons also believe in a limited form of foreordination — not in deterministic, unalterable decrees, but rather in callings from God for individuals to perform specific missions in mortality. Those who are foreordained can reject the foreordination, either outright or by transgressing the laws of God and becoming unworthy to fulfill the call.

===New Church===
[[The New Church]], or Swedenborgianism, teaches that every person has complete freedom to choose heaven or hell. [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], upon whose writings the New Church is founded, argued that if God is love itself, people must have free will.  If God is love itself, then He desires no harm to come to anyone: and so it is impossible that he would predestine anyone to hell.  On the other hand, if God is love itself, then He must love things outside of Himself; and if people do not have the freedom to choose evil, they are simply extensions of God, and He cannot love them as something outside of Himself.  In addition, Swedenborg argues that if a person does not have free will to choose goodness and faith, then all of the commandments in the Bible to love God and the neighbor are worthless, since no one can choose to do them - and it is impossible that a God who is love itself and wisdom itself would give impossible commandments.

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Free will#In Hindu philosophy}}
As [[Hinduism]] is primarily a conglomerate of different religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuhcs.org.uk/info.faq.php Cambridge University HCS] "Since Hinduism is itself a conglomerate of religions, an attitude of tolerance and acceptance of the validity of other belief systems has long been a part of Hindu thought."&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one accepted view on the concept of free will. Within the predominant schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] there are two main opinions. The [[Advaita]] ([[monistic]]) schools generally believe in a [[destiny|fate]]-based approach, and the [[Dvaita]] ([[Dualistic cosmology#Theistic dualism|dualistic]]) schools are proponents for the theory of free will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/vp/predictiveastrologyfatekarmafreewill.htm Predictive Astrology - Understanding Karma, Fate, &amp; Free Will ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206040507/http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/vp/predictiveastrologyfatekarmafreewill.htm |date=2006-12-06 }} "“Dvaita” or dualism and is generally a proponent of a free will orientation. The path of surrender or non-action, represents “Advaita” or non-dualism and is generally a proponent of fate orientation."&lt;/ref&gt; The different schools' understandings are based upon their conceptions of the nature of the supreme Being (see [[Brahman]], [[Paramatma]] and [[Ishvara]]) and how the individual soul ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atma]] or [[jiva]]) dictates, or is dictated by [[karma]] within the illusory existence of [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].

In both Dvaita and Advaita schools, and also in the many other traditions within Hinduism, there is a strong belief in [[destiny]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/nineb/ Himalayan Academy] "Hindus believe in karma, the law of cause and effect by which each individual creates his own destiny by his thoughts, words and deeds"&lt;/ref&gt; and that both the past and future are known, or viewable, by certain [[saint]]s or [[rishi|mystics]] as well as by the supreme being ([[Ishvara]]) in traditions where Ishvara is worshipped as an ''all-knowing being''. In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Avatar]], [[Krishna]] says to [[Arjuna]]: 
*''I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/7/26 Bhagavad Gita 7.26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220001/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/26/en1 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this belief in destiny is not necessarily believed to rule out the existence of free will, as in some cases both free will and destiny are believed to exist simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/27/en1 Bhagavad-Gita 3.27] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707123748/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/27/en1 |date=2012-07-07 }} "The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/bg/15/7/en1 B-Gita 15.7 purport] "As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] also states:
:: ''Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious activities'' (Bhagavad Gita 5.15)
:: ''From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the self'' (Bhagavad Gita 6.26), indicating that God does not control anyone's will, and that it is possible to control the mind.

===Different approaches===
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] give differing opinions: In the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.  For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will.  The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name="viveka"&gt;Swami Vivekananda (1907) "Freedom" from The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. vol. 1.  [http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/vol_1 ((online))]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Vivekananda's above quote can't be taken as a literal refutation of all free will, as Vivekanda's teacher, [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]] used to teach that man is like a goat tied to a stake - the karmic debts and human nature bind him and the amount of free will he has is analogous to the amount of freedom the rope allows; as one progresses spiritually, the rope becomes longer.

On the other hand, [[Mimamsa]], [[Vedanta]], and the more theistic versions of Hinduism such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] have often emphasized the importance of free will. For example, in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] the living beings ([[jiva]]s) are described as being of a ''higher nature'' who have the freedom to exploit the inferior material nature ([[prakrti]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/5/en1 Bhagavad Gita 7.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301173148/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/5/en1 |date=2007-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The doctrine of [[Karma in Hinduism]] requires both that we pay for our actions in the past, and that our actions in the present be free enough to allow us to deserve the future reward or punishment that we will receive for our present actions. The [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitin]] philosopher [[Chandrashekhara Bharati|Chandrashekhara Bharati Swaminah]] puts it this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fate is past karma, free-will is present karma.  Both are really one, that is, karma, though they may differ in the matter of time.  There can be no conflict when they are really one.

Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exercise of your free-will.  By exercising your free-will in the past, you brought on the resultant fate.  By exercising your free-will in the present, I want you to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find it enjoyable.  In any case, whether for acquiring more happiness or for reducing misery, you have to exercise your free-will in the present.&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;[[Chandrashekhara Bharati]] in ''Dialogues with the Guru'' by R. Krishnaswami Aiyar, Chetana Limited, Bombay, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islam==
{{See also|Predestination in Islam}}
Disputes about free will in [[Islam]] began with the [[Mu'tazili]] vs [[Hanbali]] disputes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldschmit|first=Arthur|title=A Concise History of the Middle East|year=2010|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4388-4|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Mu'tazili arguing that humans had ''qadar'', the capacity to do right or wrong, and thus deserved the reward or punishment they received, whereas Hanbali insisted on God's ''jabr'', or total power and initiative in managing all events.&lt;ref&gt;Denny, Frederick. An Introduction to Islam, 1985 Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools that developed around earlier thinkers such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] searched for ways to explain how both human ''qadar'' and divine ''jabr'' could be asserted at the same time.  Ash'ari develops a "dual agency" or "acquisition" account of free will in which every human action has two distinct agents. God creates the possibility of a human action with his divine ''jabr'', but then the human follows through and "acquires" the act, making it theirs and taking responsibility for it using their human ''qadar''.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Montgomery.

The belief in free will ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''bechirah chofshit'' בחירה חפשית, ''bechirah'' בחירה) is [[axiom]]atic in [[Jewish principles of faith|Jewish thought]], and is closely linked with the concept of reward and punishment, based on the [[Torah]] itself: "I [God] have set before you life and death, blessing and curse: therefore choose life" ( [[Deuteronomy]] 30:19).

Free will is therefore discussed at length in [[Jewish philosophy]], firstly as regards God's purpose in [[Creation myth|creation]], and secondly as regards the closely related, resultant, [[paradox]]. The topic is also often discussed in connection with [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]], [[Divine simplicity]] and [[Divine Providence#In Jewish thought|Divine Providence]], as well as [[Jewish principles of faith]] in general.

===Free will and creation===
The traditional teaching regarding the purpose of [[Jewish principles of faith#God as Creator of the universe|creation]], particularly as influenced by [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], is that "This world is like a corridor to the [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|World to Come]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' {{cite web |url=http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-16.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830200534/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-16.htm |archivedate=2006-08-30 |df= }} 4:16]&lt;/ref&gt; "Man was created for the sole purpose of rejoicing in God, and deriving pleasure from the splendor of His Presence… The place where this joy may truly be derived is the World to Come, which was expressly created to provide for it; but the path to the object of our desires is this world..."&lt;ref&gt;([[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'', [http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/1.htm Ch.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912040826/http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/1.htm |date=2006-09-12 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Free will is thus required by God's justice, “otherwise, Man would not be given or denied good for actions over which he had no control”.&lt;ref name="aish.com"&gt;http://www.aish.com/literacy/concepts/The_Essence_of_Mankind.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further understood that in order for Man to have true free choice, he must not only have inner free will, but also an environment in which a choice between obedience and disobedience exists. God thus created the world such that both good and evil can operate freely, this is the meaning of the rabbinic [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]], "All is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]], ''Berachot'' 33b)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maimonides,
{{quote|Free will is granted to every man. If he desires to incline towards the good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so; and if he desires to incline towards the unrighteous way and be a wicked man, he also has the power to do so. Give no place in your minds to that which is asserted by many of the ignorant: namely that the Holy One, blessed be He, decrees that a man from his birth should be either righteous or wicked. Since the power of doing good or evil is in our own hands, and since all the wicked deeds which we have committed have been committed with our full consciousness, it befits us to turn in penitence and to forsake our evil deed.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The paradox of free will===
In [[rabbinic literature]], there is much discussion as to the apparent [[contradiction]] between God's [[omniscience]] and free will. The representative view is that "Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given".&lt;ref&gt;([[Rabbi Akiva]], ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' [http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm 3:15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830203834/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm |date=2006-08-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a [[paradox]], beyond our understanding.
{{quote|The Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows everything that will happen before it has happened. So does He know whether a particular person will be righteous or wicked, or not? If He does know, then it will be impossible for that person not to be righteous. If He knows that he will be righteous but that it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know everything that He has created. ...[T]he Holy One, Blessed Be He, does not have any temperaments and is outside such realms, unlike people, whose selves and temperaments are two separate things. God and His temperaments are one, and God's existence is beyond the comprehension of Man… [Thus] we do not have the capabilities to comprehend how the Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows all creations and events. [Nevertheless] know without doubt that people do what they want without the Holy One, Blessed Be He, forcing or decreeing upon them to do so... It has been said because of this that a man is judged according to all his actions.|[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panix.com/~jjbaker/MadaT.html ''Teshuva'' 5:5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The paradox is explained, but not resolved, by observing that God exists outside of [[time]], and therefore, his knowledge of the future is exactly the same as his knowledge of the past and present. Just as his knowledge of the past does not interfere with man's free will, neither does his knowledge of the future.&lt;ref name="aish.com"/&gt; This distinction, between [[Foreknowledge of God|foreknowledge]] and [[predestination]], is in fact discussed by [[Abraham ibn Daud]].

One [[analogy]] here is that of [[time travel]]. The time traveller, having returned from the future, knows in advance what x will do, but while he knows what x will do, that knowledge does not cause x to do so: x had free will, even while the time traveller had foreknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/John_Gribbin/timetrav.htm#time_an_illusion See]&lt;/ref&gt; One objection raised against this analogy – and ibn Daud’s distinction – is that if x truly has free will, he may choose to act otherwise when the event in question comes to pass, and therefore the time traveller (or God) merely has knowledge of a ''possible'' event: even having seen the event, there is no way to know with certainty what x will do; see the view of [[Gersonides]] below.  Further, the presence of the time traveller, may have had some [[chaos theory|chaotic]] effect on x's circumstances and choice, absent when the event comes to pass in the present.)

===Alternate approaches===
Although the above discussion of the paradox represents the majority Rabbinic view, there are several major thinkers who resolve the issue by explicitly ''excluding'' human action from divine foreknowledge.

Both [[Emunoth ve-Deoth#iv Free will: obedience and disobedience|Saadia Gaon]] and [[Judah ha-Levi]] hold that "the decisions of man precede God's knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=363&amp;letter=F&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gersonides]] holds that God knows, beforehand, the choices open to each individual, but does not know which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make. [[Isaiah Horowitz]] takes the view that God cannot know which moral choices people will make, but that, nevertheless, this does not impair his perfection.

In line with this thinking, the teaching from ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' above, is then to be read as: "Everything&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chagigah]]'' [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l2b01.htm 5b]: " Rab said: Even the superfluous conversation between a man and his wife is declared to a person in the hour of his death."&lt;/ref&gt; is ''observed'' (while - and no matter where - it happens), ''and'' (since the actor is unaware of being observed) free will is given ".&lt;ref&gt;See for example, the [[Mishnah#Commentaries|commentary]] of  "The Bartenura", [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], ''[[ad loc]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabbalistic thought===
The existence of free will, and the paradox above (as addressed by either approach), is closely linked to the concept of ''[[Tzimtzum]]''. ''Tzimtzum'' entails the idea that God "constricted" his [[Infinity|infinite]] essence, to allow for the existence of a "conceptual space" in which a [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], independent world could exist. This "constriction" made free will possible, and hence the potential to earn the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|World to Come]].

Further, according to the first approach, it is understood that the Free-will Omniscience paradox provides a temporal parallel to the paradox inherent within ''Tzimtzum''. In granting free will, God has somehow "constricted" his foreknowledge, to allow for Man's independent action; He thus has foreknowledge and yet free will exists. In the case of ''Tzimtzum'', God has "constricted" his essence to allow for Man's independent existence; He is thus [[Immanence|immanent]] and yet [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]].

The '''genomics sector innovation network''' portal was developed to highlight and support the [[genomics]] sector in [[Ontario]] and was created by the [[Ontario Genomics Institute]].

== What is Genomics? ==

[[Genomics]] is the holistic, systematic, and high-throughput characterization of [[genome]]s—the full complement of [[DNA]] underlying the genetic make-up of a given organism. Though smaller genomes had been previously completely sequenced, the consideration of the possibility of doing so for the entire human genome crystallized the notion of a new paradigm for the life sciences, intended to enable and accelerate traditional hypothesis-driven research.

Genomics has since been generalized to capture the application of this approach to any and all aspects of life sciences, but many of these applications have also stimulated the coining of a much broader vocabulary of "[[omics]]" applications.

The growth of genomics and the resulting boom in technology development have created a tremendous global impact on our knowledge and understanding of the molecular basis of life. This impact ranges from drug and pesticide discovery to industrial enzymology, to crop and livestock cultivation, to environmental remediation, to natural resource management, and to criminal and civil law. This impact of these changes in technological underpinnings has also been reflected in other sectors focused more on societal implications, including public policy, education, journalism, fine arts, and entertainment.

== Genomics in Ontario ==
The genomics sector in Ontario consists of the individuals, institutions, and associations—a sub-set of the province's life-sciences industry—who are working:

* to create deeper understanding in the life sciences through genomics;
* to generate and maintain genomics resources (databases, instruments, reagents, software) for use in the public and private sectors;
* to translate this understanding and these resources into products which may be beneficial to society through the development of new products and services that can be distributed in the commercial marketplace.

This industry includes universities and private research institutions, individual and institutional investors, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and related companies, and the various public and private institutions devoted to servicing and supporting these enterprises.

There are more than 500 scientists conducting research in genomics located at 20 universities, research institutions, hospitals and government laboratories across the province. These individuals are generating genomics discoveries and innovations as well as using genomic tools and products.

'''Life Sciences Industry'''

* More than half the country's brand-name pharmaceutical and medical devices industries and almost half the medical biotechnology industry are located in Ontario.
* Ontario is North America's 3rd largest regional concentration of biotechnology firms and the 6th largest in revenues earned.
* The province's bio-medical sector employs more than 33,000 highly educated people and posted more than $1.0 billion in revenues in 2002.
* The biotechnology sector is built on world-class science and is involved in leading edge research in molecular biology and medical genetics.
* Ontario's pharmaceutical sector employs more than 15,000 talented people and includes global giants like GlaxoSmithKline, Amgen, Biogen, Genzyme, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and home-grown stars like Biovail Corporation, Apotex, and Patheon.
* Ontario has achieved worldwide recognition as a site for clinical trials because of its large and ethnically diverse patient population and a centrally managed public health-care system.
* Ontario's medical devices sector employs more than 19,000 highly educated people and comprises more than 500 manufacturing companies that include global subsidiaries as well as niche-driven domestic companies.
* Ontario's agricultural-biotech / [[bioproducts]] sector employs more than 6,000 people, including 700 scientists and invests $166 million annually in agricultural-food research at 12 world-class institutions.
* This sector works closely with the manufacturing sector in the production of bio-chemicals and bio-fuels.
* Ontario ranks in the top three jurisdictions in North America in terms of workforce and R&amp;D expenditures in the agricultural-biotechnology sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4330">'''Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis''', [[Privy Council of Scotland|PC]] (c. 1541–14 December 1576) was a [[British peerage|Scottish peer]], the son of [[Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis]]. He succeeded to the titles of 6th Lord Kennedy and 4th Earl of Cassillis on 28 November 1558. He fought in the [[Battle of Langside]] on 13 May 1568, for the side of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

He married Margaret Lyon, daughter of [[John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kennedy, Gilbert (1541?-1576)|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a Protestant after his marriage. They had two legitimate children.
*[[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis]] (1575–1615)
*Hew Kennedy, Master of Cassilis (1576/77-1607)

Cassilis was known as the "King of [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]" for the feudal influence he possessed in that region.

Cassilis died in 1576 after falling from his horse.&lt;ref name="culzean" /&gt;


==Reputation==
According to [[Robert Pitcairn (antiquary) | Robert Pitcairn]], an early historian of [[Clan Kennedy]], Earl Gilbert was a “werry greidy manne and cairitt nocht how he gatt land sa that he culd cum be the samin.” During the era of the [[Protestant Reformation]], Earl Gilbert desired the [[Glenluce Abbey | Abbey of Glenluce]] and entered into transactions with the abbot in an effort to hold the abbey by [[Feu (land tenure) | feudal tenure]]. However, before the transaction could be completed, the abbot died. Undeterred, Gilbert turned to a monk in the abbey, requesting him to “counterfeit” the abbot’s handwriting to draw up a deed and to forge the signatures of all the members of the convent. This ruse succeeded, but, fearing the monk would reveal this deceit, he solicited a peasant “to stik him.” That done, he began to fear that the peasant would reveal the crime and arranged with his uncle, Hugh of Bargany, to accuse the peasant of theft and have him hanged. "And sa the landis of Glenluse wes conqueist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitcairn|first1=Robert|title=Historical and Genealogical Account of the Principal Families of the Surname of Kennedy|date=1830|publisher=Tait &amp; Stevenson|location=Edinburgh|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_o-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=ane+werry+greidy+manne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EnULzLwm_r&amp;sig=Ac4dcRbR2teSRqTQlEzZjoxIv1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf3PeKqcLOAhVDRCYKHZ4lDOkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ane%20werry%20greidy%20manne&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roasting of the Commendator ==
In 1565, he seized Allan Stewart, the [[Abbot of Crossraguel|Commendator of Crossraguel]], and imprisoned him at [[Dunure Castle]], seeking to obtain from him certain of the rights over the lands of [[Crossraguel Abbey]]. For two days he was left to consider his fate, when Stewart proved recalcitrant, Cassilis had him dragged to the Black Vault of Dunure, and roasted him alive over a fire until he was willing to subscribe to the charters the Earl had drawn up.&lt;ref name="culzean"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kennedy family | url=http://www.camelotintl.com/heritage/castles/scotland/culzean/culfamily.html | accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Discovering a County|last = Love|first = Dane|publisher = Fort Publishing|year = 2003|isbn = 0-9544461-1-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was finally rescued by his brother-in-law, the Laird of [[Bargany]], who captured Dunure and procured his deliverance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=History of Dunure Castle | url=http://www.maybole.org/history/sketches/spratt/dunure.htm | accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue, however, occasioned a feud between the subsequent Earls of Cassilis and Lairds of Bargany.

'''Grover''', also known as '''Super Grover''' and '''Grover Monster''', is a muppet character on the popular television show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. Self-described as lovable, cute and furry, he is a blue [[monster]] who rarely uses [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] when he speaks or sings. Grover was originally performed by [[Frank Oz]] from his earliest appearances. [[Eric Jacobson]] began performing Grover in 1998; he has performed the character regularly since 2000.

==Origins==
A prototype version of Grover appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in a [[Christmas Eve]] appearance in 1967. This puppet had greenish-brown fur and a red nose. He also had a raspier voice, and was played a bit more unkempt than Grover would later behave. The monster was referred to as "Gleep", a monster in Santa's workshop. He later made a cameo appearance in ''The Muppets On Puppets'' in 1968 with the Rock and Roll Monster. In 1969, clad in a necktie, he appeared in the ''Sesame Street Pitch Reel'' in the board room sequences. During the first season of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', the character was nicknamed "Fuzzyface" or "The Hairy One", though neither would be used for his actual name. In his book ''The Tipping Point,'' author [[Malcolm Gladwell]] notes that the character "was used in promotional films for IBM."

In an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on May 31, 1970, the character acquired his present name and his appearance was changed to the more familiar puppet with blue fur and a pink nose. In this appearance, [[Kermit the Frog]] tried to sing "[[What Kind of Fool Am I?]]" (accompanying himself on [[piano]]), but Grover repeatedly interrupted him. The true Grover "officially" debuted in the second season of ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

==Appearances==

===Charlie's Restaurant===
One of the more frequent sketch segments featuring Grover involves him taking a series of customer service jobs. One of his customers is always [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]], a balding, mustachioed customer who invariably becomes frustrated at Grover's poor service and/or his (Grover's) insistence that he is serving him properly.

The first Grover-Mr. Johnson series of sketches, set at "Charlie's Restaurant," aired in the early 1970s; here, Grover is employed as a [[waiting staff|waiter]] and Mr. Johnson is his customer. The sketches followed the same basic premise: Mr. Johnson would order a menu item, Grover would serve the customer, a disagreement results (usually) as a result of Grover's mistakes, and Grover attempting (often, more than once) to correct the mistake with varying degrees of success. Under this backdrop, the sketches served to teach the childhood audience basic concepts such as same and different, big and little, hot and cold, the alphabet, following directions and patience, among other things.

Repeats of the "Charlie's Restaurant" series of sketches aired for many years on ''Sesame Street''. In the years since, new Grover-Mr. Johnson sketches have been produced, with Grover taking other customer service jobs and Mr. Johnson as his hapless customer. Every time, Mr. Johnson recognizes Grover as "that waiter from Charlie's." Grover's jobs have ranged from that of a taxi driver and a photographer to a flight attendant and [[singing telegram]] artist. One sketch parodied the ABC television series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' in a segment where Grover began remodeling Mr. Johnson's home against his express wishes. In another one, Mr. Johnson is the only patron ,and Grover is the only actor, for a production of ''Spider-Monster: The Musical'', a parody of the musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. The play is, of course, a complete calamity and finally comes crashing down on both of them.

===Other segments===
Grover also has an instructional persona who wears a [[Academic dress|cape and gown]] to provide educational context for simple, everyday things. His lessons are often wrong, leaving himself open to correction by a group of children or Muppets. This, combined with the failings of the Super Grover character, means that Grover can be very self-conscious and timid. He is often a source of slapstick humor and often accidentally injures himself.

Early in the series, Grover would often greet [[Kermit the Frog]] by running up to him and yelling, "Hey, froggy babeee!" and then giving him a hard slap on the back, which knocked him over.

Global Grover is a more recent series of segments, in which Grover hosts a trip to a foreign country to learn about their culture and customs.

In 2010, Grover starred in a parody of an [[Old Spice]] Commercial called "Smell Like a Monster" based on "[[The Man Your Man Could Smell Like]]", where a [[clam]] with "two tickets to the thing you love" bit his nose and he rode a [[cow]] rather than a [[horse]].

Grover has a semi-secret superhero identity as the well-meaning but inept ''Super Grover'', sometimes presented as the alter ego of Grover Kent, "ace doorknob salesman for Acme, Inc". Originally his superhero costume consisted of a pink cape and medieval knight's helmet, with a [[Superman]]-style crest on both the cape and his T-shirt, bearing a letter "G" on his chest instead of "S". During the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ran a series of Super Grover sketches spoofing the classic [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]] series (in the opening of these, his name was hyphenated "Super-Grover"). An announcer ([[Jerry Nelson]]) introduced each episode with the lines:

''"Presenting the further adventures of everybody's favorite hero. The man who is faster than lightning, stronger than steel, smarter than a speeding bullet. It's... Super Grover!"''

With that, a fanfare sounds, Super Grover bursts through a paper wall bearing his crest, fruitlessly tries to move his helmet up off his eyes, and adds, "And I am cute, too!"

'''Announcer:'' '''And now, on to our story.''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Super Grover:''' Yes! On to our story!

From there, episodes followed a simple formula: Super Grover is flying somewhere over Metro City when he hears the cries of a Muppet child in some small trouble and immediately sails in to assist. The excited child is quickly disillusioned as Super Grover crash-lands nearby. From there, Grover continues to be enthusiastic but no help whatsoever, his "dramatic" feats of strength or speed serving only to kill time while the child solves the problem on their own and wanders off. By then, Grover's efforts have usually landed him in a comical predicament of his own.

Super Grover has appeared in the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' theatrical films ''[[Follow that Bird]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]'' (1999, where it's revealed he stretches his arms out and spins into his costume in homage to [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]), as well as the 1983 PBS special ''[[Don't Eat the Pictures (special)|Don't Eat the Pictures]]''.

For ''Sesame Street'''s 41st season in 2010, the character was revamped as ''[[Super Grover 2.0]]'', who debuted on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', flying in and crash-landing behind the chair where he was meant to sit. His new costume consists of a helmet reminiscent of a Spartan or Centurion, a red cape, and a black rubber vest resembling bike racing gear. Both the cape and the vest are adorned with his crest, now with a lightning bolt added behind the "G". Of course, the helmet has a hinged visor which ''still'' tends to fall over Grover's eyes.  But now the tagline is ''Super Grover 2.0 - He Shows Up!''

===Mother===
"Grover's Mommy" plays an integral but often unrecognized role on ''[[Sesame Street]]''. She has been seen almost exclusively in print, including the many illustrated books starring Grover. She was also occasionally seen in photographs, as a photo puppet, such as on the cover of Volume 4 of ''The Sesame Street Treasury''. Over the course of time, her appearance has fluctuated greatly.

Her earliest known appearance as a [[The Muppets|Muppet]] is a 1970s sketch in which Grover speaks to the audience about being afraid of the dark. At the end of the sketch, his mom ([[Frank Oz]]) enters his room to kiss him goodnight. Another early appearance (circa 1981) involves his mother ([[Kathryn Mullen]]) coming into the bathroom while Grover is telling the audience about how to take a bath.

She has recently appeared (performed by [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]]) in a brief [[Elmo's World]] sequence (from the "[[Elmo's World: Families|Families]]" episode), with her son as his alter-ego Super Grover, as her own alter-ego, "Super-Mommy". Grover crashlands, screaming "Moooommy!" and his mom follows yelling "Soooonny!" crashing on top of him. They recover, acknowledge each other, and both faint.


==Books==
In the 1971 children's book ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book]]'', Grover goes to great effort to keep the reader from turning the pages of the book, because there is a monster on the final page. Grover nails pages together and builds a brick wall to block access; at the end it is discovered that the monster at the end of the book is Grover himself, who is mortified ("Oh, I am so embarrassed..."). The late 90s saw a sequel to the book where Grover desperately tries to stop [[Elmo]] from reaching the end of the book, eventually directing him to leave the book and enter from the back. Therefore, when both of them reach the end, they wind up scaring each other.

Another popular children's book, ''Would You like to Play Hide &amp; Seek in This Book with Lovable, Furry Old Grover?'', had Grover trying different ways to hide from the reader, eventually getting upset and begging the reader to just say "no" he doesn't see him, even though he was just crouching down in a corner.

In 1974, Grover went on a learning expedition in ''Grover and The Everything In The Whole Wide World Museum''.  He tours rooms such as "The Long Thin Things You Can Write With Room", as well as "The Things That Make So Much Noise You Can't Think Room". Grover wanders through "The Things That are Light Room", returns a rock to "The Things That are Heavy Room", and just when he wonders whether it is possible to have a museum that holds everything in the whole wide world, he comes upon a door labeled "Everything Else", which opens to take him out into the world. As of 1996, Publishers Weekly ranked the book at seventy-nine on their list of best-selling children's paperbacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1996-02-05 |title=All-Time Bestselling Paperback Children’s Books |journal=Publishers Weekly |volume=243 |issue= 6 |pages=30 |publisher=Cahners Publishing Company |location=New York |issn=0000-0019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lou Harry]] of [[Indianapolis Business Journal]] included the book on his list of twelve examples of how muppets have qualified as quality entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibj.com/lou-harrys-ae/2009/11/11/the-muppets-greatest-hits/PARAMS/post/11095 |title=The Muppets' greatest hits |accessdate=2009-11-22 |last=Harry |first=Lou |date=2009-11-11 |publisher=IBJ.com (Powered by Indianapolis Business Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117200005/http://www.ibj.com/lou-harrys-ae/2009/11/11/the-muppets-greatest-hits/PARAMS/post/11095 |archivedate=2009-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by [[Norman Stiles]] and Daniel Wilcox, and illustrated by Joe Mathieu.

[[File:Henri I -Flanders.jpg|200px|thumb|Henry from "[[Guillaume Rouillé|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]"]]

'''Henry''' (1176? – 11 June 1216) was the second emperor of the [[Latin Empire]] of [[Constantinople]].  He was a younger son of [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut]] (later Baldwin VIII, count of [[Flanders]]), and [[Margaret I, Countess of Flanders|Margaret I of Flanders]], sister of [[Philip, Count of Flanders|Philip of Alsace]], [[count of Flanders]].

==Leadership in the Fourth Crusade==
Having joined the [[Fourth Crusade]] in about 1201, he distinguished himself at the sieges of [[Constantinople]] and elsewhere. During the July 1203 siege, Henry was one of eight division generals, the others including [[Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat|Boniface of Montferrat]] (the crusade leader), Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] (leader of the [[Venice|Venetians]]), [[Louis I, Count of Blois|Louis of Blois]] (one of the first nobles to take the cross), and Henry's own brother, [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin of Flanders]], who controlled the largest division. During the 1204 siege, Henry led a [[chevauchée]] expedition to gain supplies and raided a castle in [[Şile|Philia]], near the [[Black Sea]] with, according to [[Robert de Clari]], about 30 knights and an unspecified number of mounted sergeants. An ambush was laid for him by Emperor [[Alexius V Ducas|Alexius V "Murzuphlus" Ducas]], but Henry and his force routed the [[Greeks]] soundly, captured a revered icon supposedly containing relics of Christ, and returned to the crusader camp. He soon became prominent among the princes of the new [[Latin Empire]].

==In the Latin Empire==
When his elder brother, the emperor [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin I]], was captured at the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] in April 1205 by the [[Bulgarians]], Henry was chosen regent of the empire, succeeding to the throne when the news of Baldwin’s death arrived. He was crowned 20 August 1206.

Upon Henry's ascension as Latin Emperor, the Lombard nobles of the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] refused to give him allegiance.{{sfn|Nicol|2002|p=12}} A two-year war ensued and after defeating the [[Knights Templar|Templar]]-supported Lombards, Henry confiscated the Templar castles of [[Ravennika]] and Zetouni ([[Lamia (city)|Lamia]].{{sfn|Coureas|2015|p=175}}

Henry was a wise ruler, whose reign was largely passed in successful struggles with [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]], [[Tsar]] of [[Bulgaria]], and with his rival, [[Theodore I Lascaris]], [[Empire of Nicaea|emperor of Nicaea]]. He later fought against [[Boril of Bulgaria]] (1207–1218) and managed to defeat him in the [[Battle of Philippopolis (1208)|Battle of Philippopolis]]. Henry campaigned against the Nicean Empire, expanding a small holding in Asia Minor (at [[Pegai]]) with campaigns in 1207 (at [[Nicomedia]]) and in 1211–1212  (with the [[Battle of the Rhyndacus (1211)|Battle of the Rhyndacus]]), where he captured important Nicean possessions at Nymphaion. Though [[Theodore I Laskaris]] could not oppose this later campaign, it appears that Henry decided it best to focus on his European problems, for he sought a truce with Theodore I in 1214, and amicably divided Latin from Nicean possessions to the favour of Nicea.{{sfn|Akropolites|2007|p=148-151}}

Domestically, Henry appears to have a different character than many of the other Crusader nobles as seen in his even-handed and pragmatic treatment of the Greeks. [[George Akropolites]], the contemporary 13th century Greek historian, notes that Henry "though a Frank by birth, behaved graciously to the Romans who were natives of the city of Constantine, and ranked many of them among his magnates, others among his soldiers, while the common populace he treated as his own people."{{sfn|Akropolites|2007|p=153}}  Indeed, when a Papal legate ([[Pelagio Galvani]], Cardinal-Bishop of Albano) arrived in Constantinople in 1213 and began to imprison Orthodox clergy and to close churches on the orders of [[Pope Innocent III]], Henry countermanded the orders on the request of the city's Greek clergy.{{sfn|Akropolites|2007|p=155-6}}

Henry appears to have been brave but not cruel, and tolerant but not weak, possessing "the superior courage to oppose, in a superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy." The emperor died, poisoned, it is said, by [[Oberto II of Biandrate]], ex-regent of Thessaloniki, on 11 June 1216.{{sfn|Sturdza|1999|p=477}} Gardner suggests this happened at the instigation of his wife, [[Maria of Bulgaria, Latin Empress|Maria of Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Gardner|1912|p=85-6}}  On his death his brother-in-law Peter Courtenay was crowned emperor in Rome, but never arrived in Constantinople. In the years 1217 to 1219, therefore, the Latin Empire was effectively ruled by [[Yolanda of Flanders|Yolanda]], Henry's sister and Peter's wife, in regency. The last two Latin emperors were Peter and Yolanda's sons; Robert and Baldwin.

==Family==
Henry first married (in 1204) [[Agnes of Montferrat]], daughter of [[Boniface of Montferrat]], the Crusade leader, but she had died (probably in childbirth) before her father's death in 1207. Henry's only child by his first wife Agnes apparently died in childbirth with his mother{{sfn|Joinville and Villehardouin|1963|p=146,148}}

Some contemporary historians say that Henry made a peace with Bulgarians after the death of Kaloyan, and a marriage was arranged in 1213 between Henry and [[Maria of Bulgaria, Latin Empress|Maria of Bulgaria]], daughter of Kaloyan and stepdaughter of Boril, Tsar of Bulgaria.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=81-2}}

Henry had a daughter with an unnamed mistress. This daughter, whose name is not recorded, later married [[Alexius Slav|Alexii Slav]] who established his own state in the Rodophe mountains.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=93-4}} He was later given the title of despot.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=94}}

'''Arthur Nahl''' (1 September 1833 &amp;ndash; 1 April 1889) was a German-born artist, [[daguerreotype]]r, [[engraving|engraver]], [[portraitist]], and [[landscape painting|landscape painter]]. Nahl was a painter known for his [[American Old West]] paintings of [[California]]. He was considered one of California's finest engravers,&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked amongst the best gymnasts in California&lt;ref&gt;Starr, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; for his time.

==Early life==
He was the son of Henriette (Weickh) Nahl (1796–1863). Henriette and her first husband, Georg Valentin Friedrich Nahl, had one son, the American West painter  [[Charles Christian Nahl]].  Henriette and Georg divorced in 1826.  In that year, she began a relationship with Georg's cousin, Alexander Theodor Nahl. After tiring of him, she began a relationship with Alexander's brother, Wilhelm Nahl.  While Wilhelm was Hugo's biological parent, he considered Alexander to be his father.&lt;ref name="Palmquist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmquist|first=Peter E. |author2=Thomas R. Kailbourn|title=Pioneer photographers of the far west: a biographical dictionary, 1840-1865|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2000 |pages=415, 417|isbn=0-8047-3883-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nne4L9h27RsC&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=%22Hugo+Wilhelm+Arthur+Nahl+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a-M_alBq13&amp;sig=mnte5Kgrc3iIf507Di5brqYyWkg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B-vmS4v5MIeQNrLJoIYI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hugo%20Wilhelm%20Arthur%20Nahl%20%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henriette and Wilhelm had one other child, a daughter, Laura.

Nahl was descended from a family of German artists dating to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Driesbach" /&gt;  His great-grandfather was [[Johann August Nahl]], the German sculptor and stuccist.

His early art studies were with Charles and the family friend [[Frederick August Wenderoth]].  He later studied at the [[Kassel Academy]]. Nahl moved with his mother, two brothers, and two sisters to [[Paris]] in 1846. Here, Arthur and Charles studied with [[Emile Jean Horace Vernet]] and [[Hippolyte Delaroche]]. Charles went on to study at the [[Louvre Palace]], [[Palace of Versailles]], and [[Luxembourg Palace]] galleries.&lt;ref name="Driesbach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Driesbach|first=Janice Tolhurst |author2=Harvey Jones |author3=Katherine Church Holland|others=National Museum of American Art (U.S.)|title=Art of the gold rush|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998 |pages=126|isbn=0520214323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14nhfj0ib7cC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=%22Hugo+Wilhelm+Arthur+Nahl+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ni5rr8PMXM&amp;sig=T3c6LMe8MdIFyt5HG0qEChnSxHU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-fzmS82-CIemNqfe3IUI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arthur%20Nahl%20%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first gold medal at age 16.&lt;ref name="Driesbach" /&gt;

Three years later, they moved to [[New York City]], settling in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Driesbach" /&gt;  In 1851, they sailed by way of Panama to California in search of gold. The family bought a mine on Deer Creek near [[Rough and Ready, California]], which fared poorly.  Within a year, the family moved to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] where Nahl worked as a [[woodcarving|woodcarver]].  After the [[1852 Sacramento fire]], they moved to [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="About "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parish-paughhouse.com/about_the_nahl_brothers.htm|title=About The Nahl Brothers|work=parish-paughhouse.com|publisher=Hughes Publishing|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nahl worked in charcoal, crayon, oil, and watercolor.  His subjects included animals, landscapes, portraits, and [[genre works]].&lt;ref name="About " /&gt;

In San Francisco, Charles partnered first with his family friend Wenderoth.  After Wenderoth married one of the Nahl sisters and moved to Philadelphia, Charles began a partnership with Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Driesbach, pps. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nahl brothers worked as commercial artists, daguerreotypers, engravers, and portrait painters. They became San Francisco's leading [[lithography|lithographers]] and specialized in [[souvenir]] stationery.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=James David |title=A companion to California|publisher=University of California Press|year=1987 |pages=344|isbn=0-520-05543-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQpvbaeJQCYC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=Nahl+seal+california&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A1TnS7b8CorEtAOgwtnUCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nahl%20seal%20california&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They created many wood carvings from photograph images.&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; With his brother and William Dieckmann, Nahl formed the partnership of Nahl Brothers and Dieckmann in 1867, an art and photograph gallery at [[121 Montgomery Street]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

When Isaiah West Taber bought out the Nahl's photography department, Nahl worked for him, coloring and retouching the photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; Nahl collaborated with others, including [[Bret Harte]], on the cover design of ''[[Overland Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin |author2=Richard J.

==Personal life==
The Nahl brothers were fine athletes.  At their home in San Francisco's Bush Street, their backyard gymnasium served as the early version of the [[Olympic Club]] and was its headquarters during the period of 1855 to 1860.&lt;ref name="About " /&gt; At Nahl's suggestion, it was named the "San Francisco Olympic Club" and, at the club's inaugural meeting on May 6, 1860, Nahl was elected its leader.&lt;ref name="Janssen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janssen|first=Frederick William |title=A history of American amateur athletics and aquatics: with the records|publisher=Outing Co.|year=1888|edition=Digitized Mar 9, 2010|pages=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7a5MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22Arthur+Nahl+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5lrnS4vIDJvOswObr73dCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arthur%20Nahl%20%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nahl married Annie Sweeney in 1865 and they moved to [[Alameda, California|Alameda]].  One of Nahl's sons, [[Perham Wilhelm Nahl]] (1869–1935), became an artist and art professor at the [[University of California]], and founder of the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]]. Another son, Virgil Theodore Nahl (1876–1930), went to work as a staff artist for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.&lt;ref name="About " /&gt; A third son, Arthur Charles Nahl, was a mining engineer; his daughter, Margery, was an impressionist painter.

Nahl died in 1889 on a ferry in San Francisco Bay en route to Alameda.

Piracy off the [[African horn]] has been a threat to [[Ship transport|international shipping]] since the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|second phase]] of the [[Somali Civil War]] in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Somali war"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sanayo|title= Piracy in Somali Waters: Rising attacks impede delivery of humanitarian assistance|work=[[UN Chronicle]]|publisher=[[United Nations]] Department of Public Information, Outreach, Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, many international organizations have expressed concern over the rise in acts of [[piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/mediacentre/secretarygeneral/speechesbythesecretarygeneral/pages/piracyactionplanlaunch.aspx |title=Piracy: orchestrating the response |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/hijackings-cut-aid-access-south-somalia-lives-risk |title=Hijackings cut aid access to south Somalia, lives at risk |publisher=[[World Food Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses, costing an estimated $6.6 to $6.9 billion a year in global trade according to Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP).&lt;ref name="OBP2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/sites/default/files/attachments/View%20Full%20Report_3.pdf|title=The Economic Cost of Somali Piracy 2011|first=Bowden|last=Anna|publisher=Oceans Beyond Piracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy. [[Insurance]] companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as insurance companies hiked premium rates in response.&lt;ref name="Gerforpol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-foreign-policy.com/en/fulltext/57866 |title=The Advantage of Piracy |publisher=German-foreign-policy.com |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirates have traditionally been wary of tangling with Somalia's powerful businessmen. The ship had not followed the industry's [[Best Management Practices]] that might have prevented a hijacking. It travelled close to the shore at low speed.&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/somali-pirates-release-oil-tanker-and-crew-after-first-hijack-for-five-years Somali pirates release oil tanker and crew after first hijack for five years], The Guardian, 16 March 2017.

'''Luigi Agricola''' (c. 1750 &amp;ndash; 1821 or after) was an Italian painter active in [[Rome]].

He also worked with jewelry. He painted a ''St. Michael the Archangel'' for the [[Academy of St Luke]] in Rome, where he was a professor. He painted an altarpiece of ''St Elizabeth, Queen of Portugal'' for the church of [[Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfQ3AAAAcAAJ   Rome: A Tour of Many Days : in Three Volumes, Volume 1], By George Head (1849).&lt;/ref&gt; Another painter by the same name (1667-1712), originally from [[Ratisbon]], was active in landscape painting in the mid-17th century, settling down in [[Venice]].

'''Margaret of Austria''' (25 December 1584 – 3 October 1611) was Queen consort of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] by her marriage to King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III and II]].

==Life==
Margaret was the daughter of [[Charles II of Austria|Archduke Charles II of Austria]] and [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1551–1608)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]] and thus the paternal granddaughter of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]].  Her elder brother was the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand]], who succeeded as Emperor in 1619.  Two of her sisters, [[Anna of Austria (1573–1598)|Anna]] and [[Constance of Austria|Constance]], through their subsequent marriages to King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], became [[List of Polish consorts|Queens of Poland]].

===Queen of Spain===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Margaret of Austria (1584-1611), Queen Consort of Spain.svg|thumb||160px|Coat of arms of Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain.]]

Margaret married [[Philip III of Spain]], her first-cousin, once-removed, on 18 April 1599. 

She became a very influential figure at her husband's court. Philip had an "affectionate, close relationship" with Margaret, and paid her additional attention after she bore him a son in 1605.&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.100"&gt;Sánchez, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret was also a great patron of the arts. She was considered by contemporaries{{Who|date=May 2010}} to be a very pious Catholic and "astute and very skillful" in her political dealings.&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.98"&gt;Sánchez, p. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Empress Maria]], widow of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], and the latter's daughter Archduchess [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria (1567–1633)|Margaret]], who lived as a nun in Madrid, Queen Margaret formed a circle of women wielding considerable influence over the king.&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.91"&gt;Sánchez, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasised Spain's status as a [[Catholic]] power acting in the interest of Catholic Europe and also highlighted the unity of the [[House of Habsburg]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.91"/&gt; They were successful, for example, in convincing Philip to provide financial support to Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.100"/&gt;

The pro-Austrian camp at the Spanish court was opposed by the [[Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]], the King's chief minister, who argued that Spain should pursue her own course of action independently of religious or dynastic ties. Queen Margaret was "melancholic" and unhappy about the influence of Duke, whom she considered corrupt, over her husband,&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.98"/&gt; and continually fought him for influence over the king. In this conflict, she was supported by her favourite Mariana de San José, prioress of the ''Monasteria la Encarnación'', her husband's [[confessor]] Father Luis de Aliaga, and her daughter [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]]'s confessor, the Franciscan friar Juan de Santa María - who was felt by contemporaries{{Who|date=May 2010}} to have an excessive influence over the King at the end of his life.&lt;ref name="Sánchez, p.97"&gt;Sánchez, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke of Lerma was eventually removed from power in 1618, though only after Margaret's death.

Margaret died while giving birth to her youngest child, Alfonso. Her husband never remarried and died ten years later.

''[[Don (honorific)|Dona]]'' '''Maria&amp;nbsp;II''' (4 April 1819 – 15 November 1853) "the Educator" ({{lang-pt|"a Educadora"}}) or "the Good Mother" ({{lang-pt|"a Boa Mãe"}}), reigned as [[Queen of Portugal]] from 1826 to 1828, and again from 1834 to 1853. Born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], she was the first child of Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] and his first wife, [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Empress Maria Leopoldina]] and thus a member of the [[House of Braganza]]. One of the two surviving children born when Pedro was still [[heir apparent]] to Portugal, she inherited Portuguese titles and was placed in the [[line of succession to the former Portuguese throne]], even after becoming a member of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]], from which she was excluded in 1835 after her definitive ascension to the Portuguese throne.

== Early life ==
===Birth===
Maria II was born ''Maria da Glória Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga''{{sfn|Sousa|1972a|p=112}} at 4 April 1819 in the [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Palace of São Cristóvão]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Kingdom of Brazil]]. She was the eldest daughter of the [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro de Alcântara]], future [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] as Pedro IV and first [[List of Brazilian monarchs|Emperor of Brazil]] as Pedro I, and his first wife [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] (née Archduchess Caroline Josepha Leopoldine of Austria), herself a daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. She was titled [[Princess of Beira]] upon her birth. Born in [[Brazil]], Maria was the only European monarch to have been born outside of Europe, though she was still born in Portuguese territory.

=== Succession crisis ===
The death of Maria's grandfather, [[João VI of Portugal|King João VI]], in March 1826 sparked a succession crisis in Portugal. The king had a male heir, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], but Pedro had proclaimed the independence of [[Brazil]] in 1822 with himself as Emperor. The late king also had a younger son, [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]], but he was exiled to Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.

Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite daughter, [[Infanta Isabel Maria of Portugal|Isabel Maria]], to serve as [[regent]] until "the legitimate heir returned to the kingdom" — but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir: Pedro, the liberal [[Emperor of Brazil]], or Miguel, the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] exiled prince.

Most people considered Pedro to be the legitimate heir, but Brazil did not want him to unite Portugal and Brazil's thrones again. Aware that his brother's supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him on the throne, Pedro decided for a more consensual option: he would renounce his claim to the Portuguese throne in favour of his daughter Maria (who was only seven years old), and that she was to marry her uncle Miguel, who would accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece reached majority.

Miguel pretended to accept, but upon his arrival in Portugal he immediately deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign of terror, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her maternal grandfather's in [[Vienna]], as well as London and Paris.

=== Absolutist uprising ===
[[File:Maria II Portugal 1829.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Maria II at age 10, 1829]]
Maria's first reign was interrupted by the absolutist uprising led by her uncle, fiancé and regent Miguel, who proclaimed himself King of Portugal on 23 June 1828. Then began the [[Liberal Wars]] that lasted until 1834, the year in which Maria was restored to the throne and Miguel exiled to Germany.

The [[Marquis of Barbacena]], arriving in [[Gibraltar]] with the princess on 3 September 1828, was informed by an emissary of what was happening in Portugal. He had the foresight to understand that Miguel had come from Vienna determined to put himself at the head of the absolutist movement, advised by [[Klemens von Metternich|Prince Klemens von Metternich]], who was directing European politics, and so it was dangerous for the young Queen to go to Vienna. Taking responsibility, he changed the direction of the journey, and departed for [[London]], where he arrived on 7 October. English policy was not conducive to its purpose. The [[Duke of Wellington]]'s office openly sponsored Miguel, so the asylum the Marquis had sought was not safe. Maria II was received in court with the honors due to her high hierarchy, but the British prevented their subjects there emigres to go to reinforce the garrison of the island Terceira.

Miguel's coup d'état had not gone unrevealed. On 16 May 1828, the garrison of Porto revolted, and in Lagos an infantry battalion. The revolts were stifled. Saldanha, Palmela, and others, who had come to take charge of the movement in Porto, re-embarked on ''Belfast'' ship, which had brought them; the Porto garrison, reinforced by the academic volunteers of [[Coimbra]] and other liberal troops, emigrated to [[Galiza]] and from there to [[England]]. At the head of a small liberal expedition, the [[Marquis of Saldanha]] attempted to disembark in Terceira, [[Azores]], but was not allowed to take the English cruise, whose vigilance he could not avoid for some time after the Count of Vila Flor, later of Terceira, was able to disembark. In time, because in August 1829 appeared in front of the island a huge Miguelist squad that sent to soil a body of disembarkation. Then there was the Battle of August 11 in the village of Praia, where the miguelists were defeated. When the emigrants in England received the news of the victory, they felt great enthusiasm. They soon lost hope of knowing that the young queen was returning to the [[Brazilian Empire]] to her father. In fact, the situation of Maria II in the English court, next to the ministry in the power, became embarrassing and humiliating. The Queen left London to meet her future stepmother, [[Amélie of Leuchtenberg]]. They left together on 30 August 1829 for [[Rio de Janeiro]], arriving on 16 October.

The constitutional cause was thought to have been lost. The dispersed emigres (France, England and Brazil) were divided into rival factions. Only Terceira Island recognized the constitutional principles, and even there appeared miguelists guerillas. France was ready to recognize Miguel's government when the revolution of July broke out in Paris in 1830, which encouraged the Portuguese liberals.

=== Civil War ===
[[File:A Carta Constitucional e a família real.png|thumb|right|The Constitutional Charter of 1826 and the Royal Family.]]
In 7 April 1831, Pedro I abdicated the imperial crown of Brazil on behalf of his son [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], Maria's younger brother, and came to Europe with his daughter and his second wife, to support his daughter's rights to the crown from Portugal and joined the forces loyal to Maria in the [[Azores]] in their [[Liberal Wars|war against Miguel]]. He took the title of [[Duke of Braganza]], and Regent in her name.

Almost at the same time the regency of the [[Ilha Terceira]], named by Pedro and composed of the [[Marquis of Palmela]], the Count of Vila Flor and José António Guerreiro, prepared an expedition that soon took possession of the [[Azores]]. While extending the constitutional territory, Pedro disembarked in [[France]], being welcomed with sympathy by the new government and by [[Louis Philippe I]]. Miguel's government had defied the immunities of French subjects, had not at once satisfied the complaints of the French government, which had sent a squadron commanded by Admiral Roussin to force the bar of Lisbon and impose humiliating conditions of peace.

Pedro left his daughter in [[Paris]] to finish her education, delivered to her stepmother, [[Amélie of Leuchtenberg|Empress Amélie]], with good masters, and left for the Azores at the head of an expedition organized on the island of Belle Isle, bringing his supporters together. Arriving in the Azores on 3 March 1832, he formed a new ministry, assembled a small army, whose command he gave to the Count of Vila Flor, and carried him aboard a squadron which he delivered to the English officer Sartorius, and departed for mainland Portugal. July 8 at Memória Beach in [[Matosinhos]]. It was followed by the [[Siege of Porto]] and a series of battles until, on 24 July 1833, the [[Duke of Terceira]] entered victorious in Lisbon, having won the [[Battle of Cova da Piedade]] the day before. Porto and Lisbon, the main cities, were in the power of the liberals. Pedro came to Lisbon, and summoned his daughter from Paris, forcing his brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel]] to [[Concession of Evoramonte|abdicate in 1834]]. Maria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal. Soon after her restoration to the throne, her father died from tuberculosis.

On 7 February 1833, in order to protect the Queen, the [[2nd Lancers Regiment (Portugal)|2nd Lancers Regiment]] was created, first known as the ''Regimento de Lanceiros da Rainha'' (Queen's Lancers Regiment), with the motto ''Morte ou Glória'', "Death or Glory" (the same as the 17th Lancers, since Lt. Col. Sir Anthony Bacon was its first commander), a fortunate coincidence since the queen's name was Maria da Glória.

Occupying the Portuguese throne, Maria II was still [[heir presumptive]] to her brother Pedro II as [[Princess Imperial of Brazil]], until her exclusion from the Brazilian line of succession by law no. 91 of 30 October 1835.

=== Reign ===
[[File:Maria II 1852.png|thumb|left|190px|Queen Maria II, around age 33, one year before her death, c. 1852. Painting by Sir [[William Charles Ross]].]]
[[File:500 Réis à l'effigie de Marie II, 1849.jpg|thumb|right|Effigy of Maria II, 1849]]
Maria married [[Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg]], son of [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], and grandson of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Josephine]] on 26 January 1835, at the age of fifteen. However, he died only two months later, on 28 March 1835.

On 9 April 1836, she married the cultured and able [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. In accordance with Portuguese law, Ferdinand received the title of king upon the birth of their first child and heir, [[Pedro V of Portugal|Peter]].

In 1842, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] presented Maria with a [[Golden Rose]].

Maria's reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on 16 May 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on 22 February 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European [[Revolution of 1848]]. Maria's reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of [[cholera]] throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.

===Death===
[[File:São Vicente de Fora (versão colorida de gravura de 1854, Manuel Maria Bordalo Pinheiro).png|thumb|Arrival of the funeral procession of Maria II to the [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]].]]
From her first pregnancy, at the age of eighteen, Maria II faced problems in giving birth, with prolonged and extremely difficult labor. An example of this was her third gestation, whose labor lasted 32 hours, after which a girl was baptized in articulo mortis with the name of Maria (1840).

At 25 years of age and in her fifth gestation, the sovereign became obese and her births became even more complicated. In 1847 the fetal distress that preceded the birth of her eighth son – the [[Infante Augusto, Duke of Coimbra]] – brought to the world a child "quite purple and with little breathing".

The dangerous routine of successive pregnancies, coupled with obesity (which eventually caused her heart problems) and the frequency of dystocic births (worrisome, especially as a multiparous woman) led doctors to warn the queen about the serious risks she would face in future pregnancies. Indifferent to the warnings, Maria II merely replied: "If I die, I die at my post."

On 15 November 1853, thirteen hours after the onset of labor of the stillborn infant Eugenio, her 11th son, Maria II died at the age of 34. The announcement of death was published in the Government Gazette of November 16, 1853:

{{quote|Paço das Necessidades, November 15, 1853, at half an hour after noon.

Her Majesty the Queen began to notice announcements of childbirth at nine-thirty on the night of the day. Difficulties appeared in the progress of the same childbirth, which forced the doctors to resort to operations, for which the extraction of an infant was obtained, of time, which received the baptism before being extracted.

The result of these operations took place at ten o'clock in the morning. Unfortunately, after an hour and a half, Her Majesty, exhausted from all strength, declared "I surrender my soul to God after having received all the sacraments."}}

In a letter dated November 28, 1853, the Duchess of Ficalho, the queen's maid, reported the outcome to her brother, the 2nd Earl of Lavradio:

{{quote|At two o'clock after midnight from the 14th to the 15th, I was ordered to go to the Palace, where I arrived at about three o'clock. I found the Empress in the Queen's room, where I immediately entered, thinking Her Majesty troubled and even little then we left the immediate room and asked Teixeira&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Carlos Teixeira, professor of the Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon and 1st private surgeon of the Royal Chamber (1856), dean of the Royal Hospital of S. José – where he served since 1819. He died in March 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; what he thought, telling us: "Your Majesty is going well, but slowly." I did not like it, and it was like that, until Teixeira called the doctors, who were out and who had not seen the Queen, and as soon as they examined her, the horrible operation was decided: the doctors were Teixeira, Farto,&lt;ref&gt;António Joaquim Farto was a surgeon at the Royal Hospital of St. Joseph (1797), a surgeon who was accorded the honors of the royal surgeon (1827), a nobleman of the Royal House (1827), director of the Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon (1830) and 1st surgeon of the Royal Chamber (1837). He passed away in October 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Friedrich Kessler (1804–1872), Doctor of Medicine and the personal physician to King Fernando II. He was made a partner of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon and 1st Baron of Kessler (1855).&lt;/ref&gt; Elias&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Francisco Elias Rodrigues da Silveira (1778–1864), bachelor of Philosophy and graduate in Medicine, member of [[His Most Faithful Majesty's Council]], member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, 1st physician of the Royal Chamber, publicist and finally 1st Baron of Silveira (1855).&lt;/ref&gt; and Benevides.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Inácio António da Fonseca Benevides (1788–1857), a bachelor of medicine (1813), was director of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon (1817), private physician of the Royal Chamber (1827), physicist of the Royal Navy (1832), chairman of the Naval Health Council, adviser to the Council of His Majesty (1853) and publicist of scientific subjects.&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler immediately dismissed the case as very dangerous. The operation was begun. I climbed onto the bed. On the right side, the Empress, full of tears; the Queen, with no fainting, but with a very bad opinion, and, complaining that she was suffering enough, said in her natural voice: "O Teixeira, if I am in danger, tell me, do not deceive me."}}

Queen Maria II is remembered as a good mother and a kind person who always acted according to her convictions in her attempt to help her country. She was later given the [[List of monarchs by nickname|nickname]] "The Good Mother."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">The '''Marusia massacre''' ({{lang-es|Masacre de Marusia}}) (March, 1925) was the response of the [[Chile]]an government under president [[Arturo Alessandri]] to a [[Strike action|strike]] by the workers of a [[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mine leading to over 500 dead, over ninety percent being strikers or their family members.

== Background ==
The nitrate ''oficina'' (saltpeter mine) of Marusia was located in the foothills of the Andes in the [[región de Tarapacá]], about 4½ miles northwest of the town of [[Huara]]. Its  monthly production was 865 tons of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Risopatrón, Luis|title=Diccionario geográfico de Chile|year=1924|page=532|publisher=Imprenta Universitaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1925, the mine workers went on strike to demand higher pay, a shorter workday, and better working conditions. While the negotiations were taking place between the company executives and the worker's representatives, the British engineer who ran the mine, a man much hated because of his habit of whipping his workers, was found dead near the mine. A Bolivian engineer was accused of the crime and executed without due process by decision of the company owners.

==Events==
The union, under the leadership of Domingo Soto, was afraid of reprisals, and especially of another [[massacre]] like the one that had happened only a few years before in [[San Gregorio massacre|San Gregorio]], so they decided to take several preventive measures. They contacted the other mines, and proposed to blow up the railroad tracks in order to prevent the arrival of strikebreakers. The government, upon being apprised of the unrest, responded by sending forty soldiers under the command of captain [[Gilberto Troncoso]], known as the "''Hyena of San Gregorio''" for his violent behaviour.

The women of Marusia organized themselves under the leadership of [[Selva Saavedra]], and decided to resist the advance of the troops. When the soldiers arrived, they entered the town shooting. A group of workers responded by throwing [[dynamite]] sticks at them, killing several soldiers and seizing their guns. Then the workers mounted a counteroffensive, taking over the explosives depot of the mine and cutting the telegraphic wires. Captain Troncoso was forced to retreat.

The miners proceeded to arm the whole town (about 2,400 people). In an open assembly, the union leaders proposed to negotiate their surrender, while some miners advocated calling upon the help of the workers from other mines. In the end, a motion by Soto that the town priest be asked to mediate was adopted.

The army reinforcements arrived in the form of a 300-man battalion under the command of Colonel [[Pedro Schultz]]. They attacked the town in the middle of the night and machine-gunned everyone in sight. Hundreds died, including women and children &amp;mdash; the exact number was never properly established. A group of workers were able to mount a hasty defense, throwing dynamite sticks at the advancing troops, and they managed to kill 36 soldiers and to injure 64. The surviving miners escaped with their families into the high mountains. This put an end to the immediate strike, but the conflict flared again less than two months later, and led to the [[La Coruña massacre]].

==Popular culture==

The film titled ''[[Letters from Marusia]]'' is based on a [[Patricio Manns]] novel (1974) inspired by these events.

==Murder==
Howe was murdered on the night of 8–9 March 2009.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; He was stabbed twice in the back with a 4-inch blade, one of the wounds puncturing his lung.&lt;ref name=justice/&gt;&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt; Howe may have been alive for up to an hour after he was stabbed.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt; Marshall "skillfully and cleanly" removed Howe's limbs,&lt;ref name=bodies/&gt; which Home Office pathologist Simon Poole estimated would have taken at least 12 hours.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt;

After the murder, Marshall and Bush used Howe's bank account, buying a [[laptop]], shoes, takeaways,&lt;ref name=gangster/&gt; and other consumer goods and food. They set up an account with online retailer [[Littlewoods]], some of the purchases being made on a computer in St. Albans library.&lt;ref name=steal/&gt; They wrote forged cheques to clear his account.&lt;ref name=steal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/4849375.Prosecution___They_killed_him_to_steal_/|title=Prosecution: 'They killed him to steal'|last=Lewis|first=Alex|date=13 January 2010|work=Enfield Independent|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sold some of his belongings, including his mobile phone, furniture, and his [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] car, which was sold on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name=jailed/&gt; They said to Howe's friend Shehrya Khan that he had "packed up and left."&lt;ref name=friends/&gt;&lt;ref name=jailed/&gt; Howe's adopted brother John visited the flat on 28 March and was told by Bush that Howe had not collected rent for a while and had left with his belongings.&lt;ref name=buddy/&gt;

===Discovery of his body===
* '''22 March'''. A left leg with the foot attached was found in a lay-by on the A507 in [[Cottered]], [[Hertfordshire]], wrapped in blue plastic bags.&lt;ref name=justice/&gt; A murder investigation was launched.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5210130/Timeline-of-police-investigation-to-identify-dismembered-man-Jeffrey-Howe.html |title=Timeline of police investigation to identify dismembered man Jeffrey Howe |date=24 April 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2 February 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427170314/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5210130/Timeline-of-police-investigation-to-identify-dismembered-man-Jeffrey-Howe.html |archivedate=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Detective Superintendent Michael Hanlon from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit led the investigation,&lt;ref name=jailed/&gt; named Operation Abnet and involving up to 100 officers.&lt;ref name=quizzed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelondondailynews.com/southgate-jigsaw-flatmates-still-quizzed-p-2781.html|title=Who was Southgate Jigsaw man? – Flatmates still quizzed|date=24 April 2009|work=London Daily News|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To aid the investigation, police revealed that the victim was overweight, suffered from eczema, had bleached skin pigmentation on his legs, a fungal infection on his toenails,&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; and was missing two front teeth.&lt;ref name=solved&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5210489/Identity-of--jigsaw-body-parts-murder-victim-solved.html |title=Identity of 'jigsaw' body parts murder victim solved |last=Irvine |first=Chris |author2=Murray Wardrop |date=24 April 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=3 February 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427125934/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5210489/Identity-of--jigsaw-body-parts-murder-victim-solved.html |archivedate=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They released a picture of the suitcase in which the torso was found.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; The police decided to keep details of the dismemberment from the public to avoid panic.&lt;ref name=recall&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald24.co.uk/news/cops_recall_snaring_jigsaw_killer_1_89430|title=Cops recall snaring ‘jigsaw’ killer|last=Christian|first=Paul|date=1 March 2010|work=East Herts Herald|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend of Howe had visited the flat at the end of January 2009 and found the couple living there. After trying to phone him and hearing he had gone missing, she reported him as a missing person on 15 March.&lt;ref name=friends/&gt; Howe's mother, who usually received calls from him several times a week, rang the incident room some time before 21 April to report Howe missing.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Two police officers went to the flat at 11:30 on the morning of 16 March and forced entry when there was no answer, searching all the rooms. There was no visible sign of blood, and Howe's passport was on a coffee table.&lt;ref name=buddy/&gt; When questioned by police, Marshall and Bush said that as far as they knew he was alive.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt; The police used dental records to identify Howe from his remains,&lt;ref name=money/&gt; and discovered that Marshall had lived close to where the torso was found.&lt;ref name=recall/&gt; Police arrested the couple at the flat in Southgate, north London on 21 April. The arresting officer said that "[Marshall] was very, very nervous, jittery, his leg was shaking. Sarah Bush was uncomfortable, and at that point I knew that Jeffrey Howe was going to be our victim."&lt;ref name=recall/&gt; Taken to a station in Hertfordshire for questioning,&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Bush told police that Marshall suffered "mood swings" and that she had been planning to leave him.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt; Marshall gave "no comment" to police questioning.&lt;ref name=recall/&gt; Howe was publicly named as the victim on 23 April.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

Blood was found in the bedroom and bathroom of the flat and under the carpet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6987050.ece|title=Couple accused of 'jigsaw murder' preyed on victim for money, court hears|last=Fresco|first=Adam|date=14 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=2 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blood was found in Howe's car after it was recovered.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; Green fibres from a T-shirt in Marshall's bedroom matched fibres on duct tape used to wrap Howe’s body parts.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt;&lt;ref name=recall/&gt; The journey of Marshall and Bush to Leicestershire was traced from [[CCTV]] and [[Automatic number plate recognition]].&lt;ref name=steal/&gt;

The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission|IPCC]] is supervising a [[Metropolitan Police Service]] review of procedure of how Howe's missing person case was handled.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt;

==Trial==
The trial began on 12 January 2010&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8454031.stm|title=Man admits dismembering salesman|date=12 January 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was held at [[List of Crown Court venues in England and Wales|St Albans Crown Court]], with Stuart Trimmer QC prosecuting.  Marshall initially denied murdering Howe, claiming that Bush murdered him and that he only helped to dismember and dispose of the body, admitting counts of [[perverting the course of justice]] and intending to prevent a [[coroner]] from holding an [[inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]].&lt;ref name=bodies/&gt; Bush denied all charges.&lt;ref name=trial/&gt; 

The court heard that Marshall previously threatened to "get rid of" Bush's previous partner in Epping Forest, and to "dispose of" another woman. He had boasted to her of having "considerable experience of disposing of bodies".&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; She said the first time he did so he was nauseated and took [[cocaine]] to cope, becoming an addict.&lt;ref name=admits/&gt; A witness said that when working for the [[Clerkenwell crime syndicate|Adams crime family]], Marshall had used a meat cleaver, meat knives, a hacksaw, or a chainsaw to cut up bodies.&lt;ref name=jailed/&gt;

A friend of Bush, Sophie Franklin,&lt;ref name=justice/&gt; told the court that when drunk, Bush confessed to friends that she helped Marshall kill Howe after Marshall stabbed him in the back, placing a pillow over Howe's face to stop the noise.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; Another friend of Bush, Danielle Matthews, said Bush told her she had seen the murder, and that Howe had laughed when Marshall had earlier threatened to kill him unless he left the flat.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt;

On January 29, three weeks into the trial, Marshall changed his plea to guilty of murder.&lt;ref name=admits&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7007851.ece|title=Stephen Marshall admits murder of 'jigsaw man', Jeffrey Howe|last=Fresco|first=Adam|date=30 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=2 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 1 February, for a minimum of 36 years.&lt;ref name=jailed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7011246.ece|title='Jigsaw Man' murderer Stephen Marshall jailed for 36 years|date=1 February 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=2 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge, [[Jeremy Cooke]], said that little credit could be given for the change of plea as the case was so overwhelming.&lt;ref name=albans&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Alex|url=http://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/news/4883741.Dramatic_end_to_St_Albans_body_parts_trial/|title=Dramatic end to St Albans body parts trial|date=1 February 2010|work=St. Albans and Harpenden Review|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed Marshall's claim that he was on the verge of drug-induced suicide when he stabbed his victim in bed.&lt;ref name=albans/&gt;

Bush also changed her plea to guilty on 1 February,&lt;ref name=jailed/&gt; and was sentenced to three years and nine months for perverting the course of justice by helping Marshall take Howe's head to Leicestershire&lt;ref name=albans/&gt; and was given a concurrent sentence of two years and three months for giving false information about Howe's whereabouts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/jigsaw-killer-cut-up-four-other-bodies-1886339.html|title=Jigsaw killer 'cut up four other bodies'|date=2 February 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=2 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she was acquitted of murder.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|last=MacLellan|first=Kylie|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6104Z820100201|title="Jigsaw man" killer jailed for life|date=1 February 2010|work=Reuters|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She will probably serve 18 months.&lt;ref name=herts/&gt;

After the trial it was revealed that Marshall had previous convictions for criminal damage, assault, battery, cocaine possession, and possessing a firearm.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt; He had attacked his first wife in 2003, and was arrested on suspicion of murdering Minesh Nagrecha in 1996 when his burnt body was found. He was never charged, instead appearing as a witness.&lt;ref name=gangster/&gt; Bush had two prior cautions for possession of cannabis and assault.&lt;ref name=butchered/&gt;

Marshall was refused leave to appeal in October 2010.&lt;ref name=herts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hertsad.co.uk/news/body_parts_murderer_denied_appeal_hearing_1_724838|title=Body parts murderer denied appeal hearing|last=Brannen|first=Aimee|date=12 November 2010|work=The Herts Advertiser|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge to the length of his sentence was turned down by two Court of Appeal judges in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/8496363._Horrific__body_parts_murderer_denied_sentence_appeal/|title='Horrific' body parts murderer, Stephen Marshall, of Borehamwood, denied sentence appeal|last=Pears|first=Elizabeth|date=4 November 2010|work=Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous bodies===
Via his lawyer, Peter Doyle, Marshall admitted in court on 1 February to dismembering four more bodies between 1995 and 1998 and disposing of them in Epping Forest,&lt;ref name=bodies&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7011599.ece|title=Jigsaw killer Stephen Marshall to be questioned in jail over four bodies|last=Fresco|first=Adam|date=2 February 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=2 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he worked for the Adams crime family as a doorman for a London nightclub.&lt;ref name=justice/&gt;&lt;ref name=gangster/&gt; This admission was to the surprise of police,&lt;ref name=gangster/&gt; but Marshall refused to give them details of the other victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8561945.stm|title='Jigsaw' killer refuses to name other victims |date=11 March 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative Branch Reservations''' is an emerging phenomenon from [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt|Eliyahu Goldratt]]'s [[Theory of Constraints]]. A Negative Branch Reservation is a cause and effect analysis of a situation. This thinking skill is used to map out what can go wrong in a process of change and help to anticipate any negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Negative Branch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngman|first=K. J.|title=Dr|url=http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/|accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique uses these forms in its analysis [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] of the theory: [[Future Reality Tree]], [[Transition Tree]], or [[Prerequisite Tree]].

'''Obituary poetry''', in the broad sense, includes any [[poetry|poem]] that commemorates a person or group of people's [[death]]: an [[elegy]].  

In its stricter sense, though, it refers to a [[poetic genre|genre]] of popular verse or [[folk poetry]] that had its greatest popularity in the nineteenth century, especially in the [[United States of America]].  The genre consists largely of [[sentimentality|sentimental]] [[narrative verse]] that tells the story of the demise of its typically named subjects and seeks to console their [[mourning|mourners]] with descriptions of their happy [[afterlife]].  The genre achieved its peak of popularity in the decade of the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia A. Moore]], ''Mortal Refrains: The Complete Collected Poetry, Prose, and Songs of Julia A. Moore, The Sweet Singer of Michigan'' Thomas A. Riedlinger, ed. (Michigan State University Press (1998) {{ISBN|0-87013-449-3}}), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  While usually full chiefly of conventional pious sentiments, the obituary poets in one sense continue the program of meditations on death begun by the eighteenth-century [[graveyard poets]], such as [[Edward Young]]'s ''[[Night Thoughts]]'', and as such continue one of the themes that went into literary [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, James Stevens Curl, ''The Victorian Celebration of Death'' (Sutton, 2000: {{ISBN|0-7509-2318-0}}), ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death poetry in the popular press==
Obituary poetry constituted a large portion of the poetry published in American newspapers&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Slason Thomson (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tg1RdndkFFwC&amp;dq=%22the+humbler+poets%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hWVpkPOCd9&amp;sig=53IZtWbket-0un3oZUQV_9cWKSE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3ixmSpiWDZPIMPaO6ZsB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 The Humbler Poets: A Collection of Newspaper and Periodical Verse]'' (Jansen McClug &amp;Co., 1886)&lt;/ref&gt; in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Blair (academic)|Walter Blair]], ''Essays on American humor: Blair through the ages'', Hamlin Lewis Hill, ed. (Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1993; {{ISBN|0-299-13624-8}}), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=v3zxIZ7tPWsC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=%22obituary+poetry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PO7hLRJIHc&amp;sig=2QL4mkzcdFAda8v1yJXd0WgLGsc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pe5lSpzfDpK6NY2P0aYB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 109]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1870, [[Mark Twain]] wrote an essay on "Post-mortem Poetry",&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Twain]], [[s:Post-mortem Poetry|Post-mortem Poetry]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he remarked that:

:In Philadelphia they have a custom which it would be pleasant to see adopted throughout the land. It is that of appending to published death-notices a little verse or two of comforting poetry. Any one who is in the habit of reading the daily Philadelphia LEDGER must frequently be touched by these plaintive tributes to extinguished worth. In Philadelphia, the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not more surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy in the PUBLIC LEDGER. In that city death loses half its terror because the knowledge of its presence comes thus disguised in the sweet drapery of verse.

and collected examples, such as the following, occasioned by the death of Samuel Pervil Worthington Doble, aged 4 days.

:''Our little Sammy's gone,&lt;br&gt;His tiny spirit's fled;&lt;br&gt;Our little boy we loved so dear&lt;br&gt;Lies sleeping with the dead.''

:''A tear within a father's eye,&lt;br&gt;A mother's aching heart,&lt;br&gt;Can only tell the agony&lt;br&gt;How hard it is to part.''

==The obituary poets==
The deaths of children and young adults were particular objects of inspiration to the obituary poets, who memorialized them with sentimental verse.  [[Julia A. Moore]], a [[poet]] from Michigan who published several volumes of poems mostly on obituary subjects, was a well known exponent of the genre.  [[George William Childs|G. Washington Childs]],&lt;ref&gt;"G. Washington Childs" is believed to be a nickname bestowed on [[George William Childs]], editor in chief of the ''Philadelphia Ledger''.  See [[H. P. Blavatsky]], ''The Letters of H. P. Blavatsky'', John Algeo, ed., (Quest, 2003  {{ISBN|0-8356-0836-0}}), vol.1, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called "The [[poet laureate|Laureate]] of Grief", was another well known exponent; he was one of the chief authors of the verse appearing in the ''[[Philadelphia Public Ledger]]'' that was noticed by Twain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cbsrfs.ucr.edu/batches/LSTA_20071030.00_flycatcher/sn84031933/00000000112/1875112801/0121.pdf The Laureate of Grief]", [[Daily Alta California]], Nov. 28, 1875, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lydia Sigourney]],&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs Sigourney", in ''The New Englander'', v 25, p.

&lt;poem&gt;
   ''Ere sin has seared the breast,'' 
   ''Or sorrow waked the tear,'' 
''Rise to thy throne of changeless rest,'' 
   ''In yon celestial sphere!'' 
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Parodies==
Twain's character of "Emmeline Grangerford", appearing in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', was inspired by the genre, and in large measure by Moore's verse.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, above&lt;/ref&gt;  Twain's was by no means the only [[parody]] the genre inspired.  [[Charles Heber Clark|Max Adeler]] mocked the obituary poets in his 1874 ''Out of the Hurly Burly'', and [[Eugene Field]] produced ''The Little Peach'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Field]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/102/227.html The Little Peach]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''John took a bite and Sue a chew,&lt;br&gt;And then the trouble began to brew,—&lt;br&gt;Trouble the doctor could n't subdue.&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;                    Too true!''	 
  
:''Under the turf where the daisies grew&lt;br&gt;They planted John and his sister Sue,&lt;br&gt;And their little souls to the angels flew,—&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;                    Boo hoo!''

The obituary poets were, in the popular stereotype, either women or clergymen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Douglas (academic)|Ann Douglas]], ''[[The Feminization of American Culture]]'' (Macmillan, 1998, {{ISBN|0-374-52558-7}}), ch. 6, "The Domestication of Death"&lt;/ref&gt;  Obituary poetry may be the source of some of the [[murder ballad]]s and other traditional [[narrative verse]] of the United States, and the sentimental tales told by the obituary poets showed their abiding vitality a hundred years later in the genre of [[teenage tragedy song]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Bethke]], "Narrative Obituary Verse and Native American Balladry", in ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 83, No. 327 (Jan. - Mar., 1970), pp. 61-68&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phantoms''''' is a novel  by American writer [[Dean Koontz]], first published in 1983.  The story is a version&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paranormalpeopleonline.com/the-angikuni-mystery-the-case-of-the-missing-village/ The Angikuni Mystery: The Case of the Missing Village] (20 May 2013) Paranormal People.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bubblews.com/news/1650951-what-happened-at-the-anjikuni-village-back-in-1930 What happened at the Anjikuni village, back in 1930?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226213947/http://www.bubblews.com/news/1650951-what-happened-at-the-anjikuni-village-back-in-1930 |date=2014-02-26 }} (November 24th, 2013) BubbleWS&lt;/ref&gt; of the now-debunked&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4371|number=371|date=16 July 2013|title=The Vanishing Village of Angikuni Lake|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[urban legend]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hist/anjikuni-eng.htm Royal Canadian Mounted Police Historical Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; involving a [[Angikuni Lake#Myth of the vanishing village|village mysteriously vanishing]] at [[Angikuni Lake]].

The novel includes many literary tips of the hat to the work of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], including the suggestion that the novel's 'Ancient Enemy' is Lovecraft's god [[Nyarlathotep]], also known as the 'Crawling Chaos'; and the fact that character of the air force specialist in potential contact with non-human intelligence is named 'Captain Arkham' (cf. Lovecraft's invention [[Arkham]]). &lt;ref&gt; Charles P. Mitchell, ''The Complete H. P. Lovecraft Filmography''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 20001, pp. 167-68. &lt;/ref&gt;. Most of these Lovecraftian references were excised from the 1998 film version of Koontz's novel.

==Plot summary==
Jenny and Lisa Paige, two sisters, return to Jenny's hometown of Snowfield, California, a small ski resort village nestled in the Sierra-Nevada Mountains where Jenny works as a doctor, and find no one alive. The few bodies they find are either mutilated, or reveal some strange form of death. Finally, after growing more alarmed by the town's mysterious and alarming situation Jenny manages to call police in a neighboring town to come help.

Together, the girls and the police, led by Sheriff Bryce Hammond, are able to request help from the military Biological Investigations Unit. The police managed to find only one clue as to what was causing the town's disappearances and deaths. A victim of whatever was trying to kill him managed to write the name Timothy Flyte on a mirror moments before he was killed. Flyte is a [[United Kingdom|British]] academic and author of a book, ''The Ancient Enemy''. His book catalogs and describes various mass vanishings of people in different parts of the world over the centuries.

It is discovered that the town was built over the hibernating place of one such Enemy, a creature known as an [[amoeboid]] [[shapeshifter]]. This Ancient Enemy rarely feeds, but when it does, the effects are devastating. It was theorized that the Enemy either caused or aided in the extinction of the dinosaurs, as well as many of the great mysterious mass vanishings: [[Mayan civilization]], [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], ghost ships, etc.

The creature consumes other life forms to increase its mass and is able to perfectly mimic other creatures. It can create small "probes" or "phantoms" imitating consumed life forms to go forth and hunt more prey, obeying the orders of its "hive mind"; in addition the creature absorbs the mental capacity of those it consumes.

Its only vital organ is a nucleus located in the center of its main body.  The creature's cells are similar in molecular structure to [[fossil fuels]]; upon discovering this the scientists use oil-eating bacteria to destroy the Enemy's core or brain. (The genetically modified bacteria are the real-life creations of [[Diamond v. Chakrabarty|Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty]].)

==Court case==
In 1992, Koontz filed suit against Zebra Books for the misappropriation of ''Phantoms'' in two titles Zebra published by author "Pauline Dunn" (in actuality sisters Dawn Pauline Dunn and Susan Hartzell collaborating under a pen name).  Spotted by a reader who informed Koontz's publisher, the two books in question - ''The Crawling Dark'' and ''Demonic Color'' - mimicked ''Phantoms'' extensively and even copied passages word-for-word.  The legal team for Koontz won, resulting in the sisters returning their advances for both books and Zebra placing an ad in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' acknowledging the plagiarism and withdrawing both titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-06-26/news/9206260446_1_dean-koontz-dean-r-phantoms Recycling Is Out Of Bounds This Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{main article|Phantoms (film)}}

''Phantoms'' was adapted into [[Phantoms (film)|a movie]] in 1998 starring [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Ben Affleck]], and [[Joanna Going]].  It was directed by [[Joe Chappelle]], produced by [[Neo Art &amp; Logic]], and released by [[Dimension Films]]. It was filmed in [[Colorado]].

The film is referenced heavily in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', including once by Affleck himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4483">'''Pieter van Aelst''' or '''Pieter van Aelst III''' (c. 1495 &amp;ndash; c. 1560) was a Flemish [[tapestry]] weaver whose workshop commenced by his grandfather was one of the leading weavers of Flanders in the first half of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;Elise L. Smith. "Aelst, Pieter van." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 8 Dec. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Pieter van Edingen Van Aelst - The Miraculous Draught of Fishes - WGA07459.jpg|thumb|''The Miraculous Draught of Fishes'', from the ''Raphael tapestries'']]
He was likely born around 1495 in [[Brussels]] (possibly in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]]) as the son of Pieter van Edingen van Aelst (also referred to as (Pieter van Aelst the Younger').  His father and grandfather were both tapestry weavers. Pieter joined the workshop that his father had set up in Brussels in 1493 and was trained there.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=dic&gt;Paul F. State, ''Historical Dictionary of Brussels'', Scarecrow Press, 27 July 2004, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the purveyor of tapestries to the Spanish king [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the then ruler of Flanders.  This was likely upon the death of Pieter’s grandfather Pieter van Aelst I.&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;
In 1509 he was mentioned as a restorer of the collection of tapestries of [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]], the [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]]. In 1517 he was paid for tapestries of David and John the Baptist made for the English king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;

A tapestry after [[Raphael]]’s ''Bearing of the Cross'' produced by the van Aelst workshop in 1520 played an important role in the introduction of the Italian Renaissance style in Flanders.&lt;ref name=demarcel&gt;Guy Delmarcel, ''Flemish Tapestry from the 15th to the 18th Century'',  Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry, which was part of a series of tapestries, referred to as the ''Raphael tapestries'' helped the van Aelst workshop gain important commissions. In 1520 [[Pope Leo X]] commissioned a series of 20 tapestries of ''Children’s Games and Medici Symbols'' from van Aelst.  The contract required the background of the tapestries to be completely filled with gold.  The price of the gold accounted for 14,000 ducats in the total price of 17,600 ducats (i.e. 80%) payable for the series.  The series of Children’s Games depicted winged spirits with attributes and emblems representing the emblems of the [[House of Medici]] and the Pope himself.&lt;ref name=demarcel/&gt;

In 1547 and 1548 he was still listed as a tapestry maker for the court of Charles V.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;  Around 1550 van Aelst was commissioned by the Polish king [[Sigismund II Augustus]] to make a large and lavish work consisting of 18 tapestries representing various episodes in the [[book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;  These works were made in collaboration with six other Brussels workshops.

As in 1560 his workshop was sold by his heirs to the prominent Brussels weaver [[Willem de Pannemaker]], it is likely that he died not long before.&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;

==Work==
The mark 'pva' of his workshop appears on four tapestry series, which were made in collaboration with others: on five of eight ''History of Noah'' tapestries ([[Wawel Castle]], [[Kraków]]), on seven of 10 ''History of Abraham'' tapestries, after designs from the circle [[Bernard van Orley]] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna), on two of eight ''History of Odysseus'' tapestries (Hardwick Hall, Derbys, NT) and on three of six ''History of Moses'' tapestries ([[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor museum]], San Francisco).&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=102904 Szenen aus dem Buch Tobias (8 Stücke):  1.

In this example, the gene indicated by the white color is inactivated upon insertion of the foreign DNA fragment.]]

'''Recombinant DNA''' ('''rDNA''') molecules are [[DNA]] molecules formed by laboratory methods of [[genetic recombination]] (such as [[molecular cloning]]) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources, creating [[DNA sequence|sequences]] that would not otherwise be found in the [[genome]]. Recombinant DNA in a living organism was first achieved in 1973 by [[Herbert Boyer]], of the [[University of California]] at San Francisco, and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]], at [[Stanford University]], who used [[E. coli]] [[restriction enzyme]]s to insert foreign DNA into plasmids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNN - Genetics and Genomics Timeline|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1973_Boyer.php|website=www.genomenewsnetwork.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by the combination of at least two strands. Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure, and differ only in the [[nucleotide]] sequence within that identical overall structure. Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called '''chimeric DNA''', because they can be made of material from two different species, like the mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]. R-DNA technology uses [[palindromic sequence]]s and leads to the production of [[sticky and blunt ends]].

The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can originate from any [[species]]. For example, plant DNA may be joined to bacterial DNA, or human DNA may be joined with fungal DNA. In addition, DNA sequences that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|chemical synthesis of DNA]], and incorporated into recombinant molecules. Using recombinant DNA technology and synthetic DNA, literally any DNA sequence may be created and introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms.

Proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living cells are termed ''recombinant proteins''. When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism, the recombinant protein is not necessarily produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosano|first=Germán L.|last2=Ceccarelli|first2=Eduardo A.|date=2014-04-17|title=Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli: advances and challenges|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=5|pages=172|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00172|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4029002|pmid=24860555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructuring by
foreign coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoters used to regulate gene expression|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/promoters/818.html|website=www.cambia.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recombinant DNA differs from genetic recombination in that the former results from artificial methods in the test tube, while the latter is a normal biological process that results in the remixing of existing DNA sequences in essentially all organisms.

There are two fundamental differences between the methods. One is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA within a living cell, while PCR replicates DNA in the test tube, free of living cells. The other difference is that cloning involves cutting and pasting DNA sequences, while PCR amplifies by copying an existing sequence.

Formation of recombinant DNA requires a [[Vector (molecular biology)|cloning vector]], a DNA molecule that replicates within a living cell. Vectors are generally derived from [[plasmid]]s or [[virus]]es, and represent relatively small segments of DNA that contain necessary genetic signals for replication, as well as additional elements for convenience in inserting foreign DNA, identifying cells that contain recombinant DNA, and, where appropriate, expressing the foreign DNA. The choice of vector for molecular cloning depends on the choice of host organism, the size of the DNA to be cloned, and whether and how the foreign DNA is to be expressed.&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-576-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, David W. |author2=Sambrook, Joseph |title=Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |location=Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=978-0-87969-576-7 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA segments can be combined by using a variety of methods, such as restriction enzyme/ligase cloning or [[Gibson assembly]].

In standard cloning protocols, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into the host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, and (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-2866-4" /&gt;
''These steps are described in some detail in a related article ([[molecular cloning]]).''

==Expression==
{{main|Protein production}}
Following transplantation into the host organism, the foreign DNA contained within the recombinant DNA construct may or may not be [[Gene expression|expressed]]. That is, the DNA may simply be replicated without expression, or it may be [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] and [[Translation (biology)|translated]] and a recombinant protein is produced. Generally speaking, expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include sequences that are required for producing an [[mRNA]] molecule that can be used by the host's [[Translation (biology)|translational apparatus]] (e.g. [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence|translational initiation signal]], and [[Terminator (genetics)|transcriptional terminator]]).&lt;ref name="pmid9487731"&gt;{{Cite journal

In most cases, organisms containing recombinant DNA have apparently normal [[phenotype]]s. That is, their appearance, behavior and metabolism are usually unchanged, and the only way to demonstrate the presence of recombinant sequences is to examine the DNA itself, typically using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Terry |title=Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis: an Introduction |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4051-1121-8 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant exceptions exist, and are discussed below.

If the rDNA sequences encode a gene that is expressed, then the presence of RNA and/or protein products of the recombinant gene can be detected, typically using [[RT-PCR]] or [[Western blot|western hybridization]] methods.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6"/&gt; Gross phenotypic changes are not the norm, unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to generate biological activity in the host organism.&lt;ref name="pmid|10634784"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional phenotypes that are encountered include toxicity to the host organism induced by the recombinant gene product, especially if it is [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|over-expressed]] or expressed within inappropriate cells or tissues.

In some cases, recombinant DNA can have deleterious effects even if it is not expressed. One mechanism by which this happens is [[Insertion (genetics)|insertional inactivation]], in which the rDNA becomes inserted into a host cell's gene. In some cases, researchers use this phenomenon to "[[Gene knockout|knock out]]" genes to determine their biological function and importance.&lt;ref name="pmid1591000"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism by which rDNA insertion into chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes. This can happen, for example, when a recombinant DNA fragment containing an active promoter becomes located next to a previously silent host cell gene, or when a host cell gene that functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation by recombinant DNA.

==Uses==

Recombinant DNA is widely used in [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]] and [[research]]. Today, recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of DNA technology are found in essentially every western pharmacy, doctor's or veterinarian's office, medical testing laboratory, and biological research laboratory. In addition, organisms that have been manipulated using recombinant DNA technology, as well as products derived from those organisms, have found their way into many farms, [[Genetically modified food|supermarkets]], [[Humulin|home medicine cabinets]], and even pet shops, such as those that sell [[GloFish]] and other genetically modified animals.

The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research, in which the technology is important to most current work in the biological and biomedical sciences.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6" /&gt; Recombinant DNA is used to identify, map and sequence genes, and to determine their function. rDNA probes are employed in analyzing gene expression within individual cells, and throughout the tissues of whole organisms. Recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory experiments and to generate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis within cells and organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3" /&gt;

Many additional practical applications of recombinant DNA are found in industry, food production, human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and bioengineering.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3" /&gt; Some specific examples are identified below.

;Recombinant [[chymosin]] {{not a typo|:}} Found in [[rennet]], chymosin is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese. It was the first genetically engineered food additive used commercially. Traditionally, processors obtained chymosin from rennet, a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves. Scientists engineered a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of ''E. coli'' bacteria for large-scale laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme, costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin. In 1990, FDA granted chymosin "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe.&lt;ref&gt;Donna U. Vogt and Mickey Parish.

==Controversy==
Scientists associated with the initial development of recombinant DNA methods recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing recombinant DNA to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]], these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on recombinant DNA research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the National Institutes of Health (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA work. Today, recombinant DNA molecules and recombinant proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that express recombinant DNA, particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns are discussed in the articles on [[genetically modified organism]]s and [[genetically modified food controversies]]. Furthermore, there are concerns about the by-products in biopharmaceutical production, where recombinant DNA result in specific protein products. The major by-product, termed [[host cell protein]], comes from the host expression system and poses a threat to the patient's health and the overall environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xing|last2=Hunter|first2=Alan K.|last3=Mozier|first3=Ned M.|date=2009-06-15|title=Host cell proteins in biologics development: Identification, quantitation and risk assessment|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=103|issue=3|pages=446–458|doi=10.1002/bit.22304|pmid=19388135|issn=0006-3592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracewell|first=Daniel G.|last2=Francis|first2=Richard|last3=Smales|first3=C.

== Background ==

The RGHQoL was published in 1998 by Galen Research and was funded by [[Glaxo Wellcome]] Research &amp; Development. The content of the measure was taken from qualitative interviews conducted with patients with recurrent genital herpes. The initial interviews were conducted in the UK and then an international panel was assembled in order to translate and validate the measure for the UK, USA, Italy, France, Germany and Denmark. Items were translated and then field tested with up to 20 RGH patients in each country. The test-retest correlations for each language version was found to be in excess of 0.85, meaning every version had good reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doward|first=LC|author2=McKenna, SP |author3=Kohlmann, T |author4=Niero, M |author5=Patrick, D |author6=Spencer, B |author7= Thorsen, H |title=The international development of the RGHQoL: a quality of life measure for recurrent genital herpes.|journal=Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation|date=February 1998|volume=7|issue=2|pages=143–53|pmid=9523496|doi=10.1023/A:1008857426633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Ricardo Ortega Fernandez was born to parents Charo Fernández and José Luis Ortega in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Castilla-La Mancha]], [[Province of Cuenca]], Spain in 1966. As a 7-year old, he moved with his family to [[Alicante]],[[Valencian Community]], along the coast known as [[Costa Blanca]], [[Province of Alicante]]. His studies were at the Primary School in Cervantes and Montgó, as well as the Historiador Chabás in Dénia. At the [[University of Valencia]], Ortega Fernandez earned a bachelor's degree in engineering, and then went to [[Russia]] to pursue studies in nuclear physics. It was while studying in Russia that Ortega was asked by [[EFE]] to report and he turned to a career in journalism.&lt;ref name=elmundo2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/11/comunicacion/1157974479.html |title=Ricardo Ortega, periodista fallecido en Haití, será Hijo Adoptivo de Denia |author=EFE |author-link=EFE |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |access-date=16 March 2017 |date=12 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=formulatv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/47/la-plantilla-de-antena-3-rinde-homenaje-a-ricardo-ortega/ |title=La plantilla de Antena 3 rinde homenaje a Ricardo Ortega |work=Fórmula TV |language=es |date=8 March 2004 |access-date=25 August 2018 |author=Redacción |publisher=Noxvo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elmundo3 /&gt; After his death, he was declared by the city of Dénia as its "Adopted Son."&lt;ref name=elmundo2 /&gt;

== Career ==
Ricardo Ortega started his journalism career in the early 1990s working for the Spanish newswire agency [[EFE]] in [[Moscow]], Russia, where he remained for eight years.&lt;ref name=elmundo2 /&gt; As a foreign correspondent for EFE, he reported from such places as [[Sarajevo]] and [[Chechnya]]. After moving to Antena 3 in 2000, he reported from [[New York City]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. His interview with [[Ahmad Shah Massoud|General Ahmad Shah Massoud]] is well known. He was on a leave in New York City from Antena 3, when they offered that he cover the Haitian crisis after the coup d'état.&lt;ref name=elmundo2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=formulatv /&gt;

}}&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;In late February, President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] was removed from Haiti by the [[US Military]]. On March 7, 2015, Ortega had been on assignment in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, covering street protests for his tenth day when violence erupted around 2 p.m.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/08/broadcasting.internationalnews |title=Spanish journalist killed in Haiti |first=Ciar |last=Byrne |date=March 8, 2004 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=25 August 2018 |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://elpais.com/diario/2004/03/08/internacional/1078700411_850215.html |title=El periodista de Antena 3 Ricardo Ortega muere de dos disparos en Haití |first=Juan Jesús |last=Aznarez |date=8 March 2004 |newspaper=[[El País]] |language=es |access-date=25 August 2018 |location=Puerto Príncipe |publisher=Prisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the initial shots came from anti-Aristide protester but that shots were returned from the other direction. In the crossfire, [[United States|US]] photojournalist Michael Laughlin, ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' of [[Florida]], was wounded.&lt;ref name=theguardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38531-2004Mar7.html |title=Spanish Journalist Killed, Others Wounded in Haiti |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |author=Reuters |author-link=Reuters |date=7 March 2004 |access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two accounts of Ortega's killing. According to US journalist Peter Andrew Bosh of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', Ortega had been in a house, located at Rue Lamarre 41-43, and providing aid with others to his wounded colleague, and when he stepped out of the house, he was shot twice. However, [[Germany|German]] photojournalist Marcel Mettelsiefen said Ortega was in a courtyard when he was shot from above. He could have been shot by either anti-Aristide protesters or by [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], although a Marine spokesperson disputed this assertion at the time. He took two bullets, one to the chest and one to the abdomen, in the accounts.&lt;ref name=elmundo1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais2 /&gt; The group was pinned down by gunfire and had to leave Ortega and others wounded unattended for several minutes.&lt;ref name=elmundo1 /&gt; Witnesses say that one of bullets that hit Ortega in either the chest or abdomen also hit a Haitian citizen Joseph Franois.&lt;ref name=theguardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais2 /&gt; His interpreter was also killed.&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifex.org/haiti/2008/05/16/official_investigation_blames_american/ |title=Official investigation blames American troops for 2004 death of journalist Ricardo Ortega |work=[[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]] |author=Reporters Without Borders |author-link=Reporters Without Borders |date=16 May 2008 |access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjspanish /&gt;

Ortega Ferndandez died while being treated at the [[List of hospitals in Haiti|Hôpital du Canapé Vert]].&lt;ref name=elmundo1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt; His last words before arriving at the hospital were documented as being "I can't breathe."&lt;ref name=democracynow /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-haiti-journalist-idUSL098756420080509 |title=Spanish reporter shot by foreign soldiers in Haiti |date=9 May 2008 |work=[[Reuters]] |first=Teresa |last=Larraz |location=Madrid |access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2010/02/13/actualidad/1266015601_850215.html |title=El callejón donde murió Ricardo Ortega |first=Ramón |last=Lobo |date=13 February 2010 |newspaper=[[El País]] |location=Puerto Príncipe |language=es |publisher=Prisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor told reporters that he was among the 5 or 6 killed along with 20 other people who had been injured by a "high velocity" weapon.&lt;ref name=theguardian /&gt;

Weeks afterwards, a supporter of Aristide and a police inspector were arrested and investigated for their involvement in the crisis. Both have been released since and not charged.&lt;ref name=cpjspanish /&gt; According to journalist and film maker [[Kevin Pina]], the former chief of the police station known as La Ville, police inspector Jean-Michel Gaspard, was arrested but released shortly after his lawyer demanded the US Embassy reveal the identity of a suspected "gunman" US Marines said fired on them and they admitted killing on March 7, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://haitiaction.net/News/HIP/5_15_8/5_15_8.html |title=Ortega killed by U.S. Marines in Haiti: A Reporter's Notes |date=May 15, 2008 |work=Haiti Action |access-date=17 February 2018 |first=Kevin |last=Pina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marines-shot-haiti-protest-gunman/ |title=Marines Shot Haiti Protest Gunman |access-date=18 February 2018 |date=8 March 2004 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]] |work=[[CBS News]] |first=Bootie |last=Cosgrove-Mather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Already in 2004, witnesses claimed that the rounds that killed Ortega were shot by [[United States Marine Corp|US Marines]] and not by pro-Aristide supporters.&lt;ref name=democracynow /&gt; Ortega-Fernandez's parents Jose Luis Ortega and Charo Fernandez called for the investigation of their son's death as well as international attention to further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rsf.org/es/noticias/conclusiones-de-la-investigacion-sobre-la-muerte-del-periodista-ricardo-ortega-en-tela-de-juicio-la |title=Conclusiones de la investigación sobre la muerte del periodista Ricardo Ortega : en tela de juicio la fuerza de interposición norteamericana |work=[[Reporteros Sin Fronteras]] |date=13 May 2008 |access-date=20 January 2016 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, Spanish authorities called on Haiti to create a commission to look more into the case but no commission has been formed. In 2008, a Haitian Judge Bernard Saint-Vil  determined that the shots fired on Ortega most likely originated from the foreign soldiers.&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt; Spanish Judge Pablo Ruz, representing the Central Criminal Court, reopened the case  on June 24, 2008. The criminal court has jurisdiction over violent cases of Spanish citizens that occur in a foreign country.&lt;ref name=cpjspanish&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cpj.org/2008/07/spanish-authorities-restart-haiti-murder-investiga.php |title=Spanish authorities restart Haiti murder investigation |work=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |date=16 July 2008 |access-date=25 August 2018 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
After Ricardo Ortega was killed in Port-au-Prince, Haitian journalists experienced more violence as pro- and anti-Aristide positions hardened. In Haiti, [[Abdias Jean]], [[Robenson Laraque]], and [[Jacques Roche]] were among those killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cepr.net/publications/op-eds-columns/bad-news-from-haiti-us-press-misses-the-story |title=Bad News From Haiti: U.S. Press Misses the Story |first=Dan |last=Beeton |work=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] |date=10 September 2008 |access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[Koïchiro Matsuura]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I deplore the death of Ricardo Ortega, one of at least six people who appear to have been killed in indiscriminate shooting, It is essential that journalists be able to carry out their work in conditions of reasonable safety...and I urge the authorities to seek and prosecute the perpetrators of these attacks in which dozens are reported to have been wounded..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=14683&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Director-General Voices Concern over Safety of Journalists in Haiti |work=[[UNESCO]] |date=10 March 2004 |access-date=15 September 2005 |location=Paris |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20161020121059/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=14683&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his body arrived in Madrid, the employees of Antena 3 paid homage to Ortega-Fernandez and the work he had accomplished on various assignments including support for and coverage of the 9/11 attacks in New York City in 2001.&lt;ref name=formulatv /&gt;

'''Rob Roy''' (1922–1928) was a white male [[collie]] owned by [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Coolidge's favorite pet, he was acquired by [[Grace Coolidge]] in 1922 after she became enamored with collies, having seen one of the breed perform in a circus. He later lived with the family in the White House.

Rob Roy was immortalized in a [[Howard Chandler Christy]] portrait of Grace Coolidge. He died in 1928 after a short illness.

==Life and death==
[[File:Grace Coolidge Official portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The Christy portrait of Rob Roy and Grace Coolidge]] 
Rob Roy was acquired by Calvin Coolidge's wife, Grace Coolidge, in 1922 from Island White Kennels in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="bard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bard|first1=Constance|title=Collies at Astolat|journal=Dog Fancier|date=1933|volume=42|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Coolidge had reportedly become enthralled by collies after seeing one of the breed perform in a circus. During the period in which the Coolidges owned Rob Roy, they also had a female collie named Prudence Prim.&lt;ref name="ruth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldman|first1=Ruth|title=Calvin Coolidge|date=2005|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=0822514966|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4q1qHFpm7iYC&amp;dq=%22rob+roy%22+coolidge&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Rob Roy became ill and was unsuccessfully treated at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]], where he died.&lt;ref name="bard"/&gt; Upon his death Coolidge wistfully remarked,&lt;ref name=natcity/&gt; 

{{quote|His especial delight was to ride with me in the boats when I went fishing. So although I know he would bark for joy as the grim boatman ferried him across the dark waters of the [[Styx]], yet his going left me lonely on the hither shore.}}

==Mannerisms==
Rob Roy was known as Coolidge's "favorite" among a menagerie of pets he kept that included dogs, birds, cats, and [[raccoon]]s.&lt;ref name="ruth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steve|title=Calvin Coolidge|date=2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=0761428364|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge himself described Rob Roy as a "stately gentleman of great courage and fidelity".&lt;ref name=natcity&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Tom|title=Washington: A History of Our National City|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465039219|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5JcCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22rob+roy%22+coolidge&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Roy was known to lead Coolidge to the [[Oval Office]] each morning in a stoic manner with gaze fixed forward.&lt;ref name="truman"/&gt; Rob Roy's stately characteristics aside, Coolidge frequently tried to trick the dog into chasing animals that appeared on screen during the showing of films at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitcomb|first1=John|title=Real Life at the White House|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0415939518|page=278|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1unoHtahSsC&amp;dq=%22rob+roy%22+coolidge&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Harry Truman]], Coolidge once ordered [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Morris Sheppard]] to surrender his sausage to the dog while Coolidge and Sheppard were having breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klara|first1=Robert|title=The Hidden White House: Harry Truman and the Reconstruction of America's Most Famous Residence|date=2013|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1250022932|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdLQkUoCSAC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rowland 'Rowley' Lewis Thomas''' (7 November 1863 – 21 January 1949) was a Welsh international [[rugby union]] forward who played club rugby for [[London Welsh RFC|London Welsh]], of whom he was a founding member, and county rugby for Middlesex. Thomas played international rugby for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and was capped seven times.

==Rugby career==
Thomas played rugby for several teams throughout his playing career, including [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and University College Hospital, but it his time with London Welsh that brought him to the attention of the international selectors. Thomas was part of a group of like-minded Welsh sportsmen, based in London, that decide to create their own club. In 1885 Thomas was one of the founding members of London Welsh, becoming a member of the committee.&lt;ref name="Jones3"&gt;Jones (1985), pg 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year, Thomas was selected as part of the very first London Welsh team against [[London Scottish RFC|London Scottish]], alongside Welsh internationals [[Arthur Gould (rugby player)|Arthur Gould]] and [[Martyn Jordan]].&lt;ref name="Jones6"&gt;Jones (1985), pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1889/90 season, Thomas was given the captaincy of London Welsh and saw the club's first visiting Welsh team, when the club welcomed Llanelli in 1889.&lt;ref name="Jones15"&gt;Jones (1985), pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 Thomas was first selected to represent Wales in a match against Scotland, as part of the [[1889 Home Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]]. Under the captaincy of [[Frank Hill (rugby player)|Frank Hill]], Wales lost the game by two [[try|tries]] to nil. Thomas played in the very next game of the tournament to Ireland which ended in another Welsh loss to an identical score line as the Scotland game. Thomas played just one game in the next year's [[1890 Home Nations Championship|Championship]], an away draw to Ireland. The [[1891 Home Nations Championship|1891 tournament]] saw Thomas selected for all three matches, including his first game against England. During the tournament, Thomas switched from London Welsh to Llanelli, and played his final three international matches while representing the South Wales club. His final game was in 1892 against England which saw Wales beaten comprehensively.

==Personal life==
Thomas was educated at [[Llandovery College]] in Wales but studied medicine in London. He was seen as considerable all-round sportsman,&lt;ref name="Jones6"&gt;Jones (1985), pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and was an excellent shot, proficient horseman and keen [[angling|angler]]. During World War I, Thomas served his country as a medical officer in the Welsh Horse Cavalry Regiment, based in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Jones6"/&gt; Thomas was a medical [[coroner]] for West Carmarthenshire for 24 years.

He was also a leading member of the Carmarthenshire Hunt, and at his funeral his hunting clothes and boots were placed alongside him in his coffin. Thomas was also a descendent of [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]] the Methodist cleric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=John M. |title=Who's Who of Welsh International Rugby Players |year=1991 |publisher=Bridge Books |location=Wrexham|page=155 |isbn=1-872424-10-4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serhiy Dzyndzyruk''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian:]] Сергій Дзиндзирук; born 1 March 1976) is a Ukrainian [[professional boxer]] and a former [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[super welterweight]] champion.

== Amateur ==
As an amateur he won a silver medal at the [[1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] losing in the final to [[Oleg Saitov]]. He also won silver in the European Championship in 1998. He won 195 out of 220 fights.

== Professional ==
His record is 37-1 (23 [[knockout|KOs]]). He won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] world junior middleweight champion title against [[Daniel Santos (boxer)]]. After that bout, he defended his title six times. He used to fight out of Germany before moving to America and signing with promoters Gary Shaw and Artie Pelullo.

On May 14, 2010 on Showtime Championship Boxing, he faced [[Daniel Dawson]] in defense of his WBO World Junior Middleweight Championship. He defeated Dawson by TKO in the 10th round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=019949&amp;cat=boxer Serhiy Dzinziruk – Boxer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dzinziruk vs Martinez===
Dzinziruk moved up in weight to challenge the slick [[Argentina|Argentinian]] boxer [[Sergio Gabriel Martinez|Sergio Martinez]] on March 12, 2011 at the Foxwoods Resort Casino, Mashantucket, Connecticut for the vacant WBC Diamond belt. Martinez dominated the fight, even outjabbing Dzinziruk, and won by TKO in round 8 after knocking his opponent down 5 times in the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Sergio Martinez to fight Sergei Dzinziruk|publisher=ESPN| date = 2011-03-06 | first =Dan|last =Rafael | id = | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=6057408 | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his fight with Martinez, Dzinziruk had never been knocked down in his professional and amateur careers.

{{See also|Sergio Martinez vs. Sergiy Dzinziruk}}

On the 5th Of October 2011, the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] stripped Dzinziruk of the junior middleweight title due to inactivity, with his last title defence being his on May 14, 2010 against Daniel Dawson. This was because Dzinziruk had been battling with a number of injuries, and after pulling out of his scheduled September 30 defence against Lukas Konecny, the interim WBO junior middleweight champion [[Zaurbek Baysangurov]] was promoted to the status of "full champion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sergiy Dzinziruk stripped of WBO title|publisher=Boxing Scene| date = 2011-10-07 | url=http://www.boxingscene.com/dzinziruk-gets-stripped-baysangurov-new-champ--44677 | accessdate = 2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social media and suicide''' is a relatively new phenomenon, which influences [[suicide]]-related behavior. Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the [[World Health Organization]], in the year 2020, approximately 1.53 million people will die from suicide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gvion|first=Yari|last2=Apter|first2=Alan|date=December 2012|title=Suicide and Suicidal Behavior|url=|journal=Public Health Review|volume=34|issue=2|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is increasing evidence that this behavior of using [[social media]] affects and changes people's lives, especially in teenagers. Suicide has been identified not only as an individual phenomenon, but it is influenced by social and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In one of the widely known cases, the [[death of Phoebe Prince]], it is generally believed that her actions of suicide were motivated by cyberbullying. [[Cyberbullying]] is a huge problem linked to increases in suicide rates (Mason, 2008). One explanation that has arisen, is the cause and effect relationship between social media advertised suicides and younger generations being influenced by them. Aside from kids being influenced by suicide tendencies online, there is the psychological explanation behind "[[15 minutes of fame]]". The first person who committed suicide live on today's social media platforms – [[Océane Ebem]], an eighteen-year-old woman from [[Égly]] in the suburbs of [[Paris]] – explicitly said, "I want to communicate a message, and I want it to be passed around, even if it's very shocking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Rana|title=The first social media suicide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/29/the-first-social-media-suicide|accessdate=September 4, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The media tends to popularize videos and social media posts in order to inform the public of the rising trouble, which creates popular appeal to the young and immature minds of teenagers. Social media could provide higher risks with the promotion of different kinds of pro-suicidal sites, message boards, chat rooms and forums. In addition, the Internet not only reports suicide incidents but documents suicide methods (for example, [[suicide pact]]s, an agreement between two or more people to commit suicide at a particular time and often by the same lethal means). The role the Internet plays, particularly social media, in suicide-related behavior is a topic of growing interest.

==Social media risks==
[[Social media]] is a relatively new phenomenon that has swept the world during the past decade. There is increasing evidence that the Internet and social media can influence suicide-related behavior. Internet use can cause more exposure to graphic content and lead to cyberbullying, in many cases over the past ten years cyberbullying has led to self harm and suicide (Marchant 1).&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, Amanda, et al. "A systematic review of the relationship between internet use, self-harm and suicidal behaviour in young people: The good, the bad and the unknown." PLoS ONE, vol. 12, no. 8, 2017, p. e0181722. Academic OneFile, http://libraryproxy.tulsacc.edu:2095/apps/doc/A500760822/AONE?u=odl_tcc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=2274e8d2&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is a considerable [[public health]] problem. More than 30,000 suicide deaths in the United States and nearly 1 million suicide deaths worldwide occur every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide and Self-Inflicted Injury|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Suicide|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case series review of suicide, researchers looked at documentation from [[coroner's inquest]]s for all deaths involving an element of [[self-harm]] between 2011 and 2013. This review's emerging evidence suggests the age group most affected by the association between social media use and suicide is older than has previously been assumed: in one small study of coroner's investigations, it was found social media evidence was more likely to be cited at inquest in cases where the deceased was aged over 45 years than under.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=Simon J |last2=Surtees |first2=Wendy |date=2 February 2016 |title=A case series review of suicides associated with social media use in South Tyneside, England |url=http://shr.sagepub.com/content/7/2/2054270415619322.full |journal=JRSM Open |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=205427041561932 |doi=10.1177/2054270415619322 |pmid=26877880 |pmc=4737974 |access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the findings are unclear and may solely reflect greater use of social media. The findings also show that fewer than 20% of [[Facebook]] users are aged over 45, contrasting with the demographics of the social media subset. Given the ages of cases identified in this review, further research is needed to conclude the age of users. It is very important that more studies are done to find the age range that is most affected by social media and suicide to best address different intervention methods.

==Impact of pro-suicidal sites, message boards, chat rooms and forums==
Social media platforms, such as [[chat rooms]], [[blogging]] Web sites (e.g., [[Tumblr]], [[Reddit]]), video sites (e.g., [[YouTube]]), [[social networking site]]s (e.g., Facebook, [[MySpace]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]]), as well as [[e-mail]], [[text messaging]], and [[video chat]], have transformed traditional methods of communication by allowing the instantaneous and interactive sharing of information created and controlled by individuals, groups, organizations, and governments.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{citation|pmc=3477910|title=Social Media and Suicide: A Public Health Perspective|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S195–S200| author=David D. Luxton, Jennifer D. June and  Jonathan M. Fairall | date=May 2012|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300608|pmid=22401525}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the third quarter of 2015, Facebook had 1.55 billion monthly active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/|title=Number of monthly active Facebook users worldwide as of 3rd quarter 2015 (in millions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; An immense quantity of information on the topic of suicide is available on the Internet and via social media. The information available on social media on the topic of suicide can influence suicidal behavior, both negatively and positively.

Contributors to these social media platforms may also exert [[peer pressure]] to commit suicide, idolize those who have completed suicide, and facilitate [[suicide pact]]s. These pro-suicidal sites reported the following. For example, on a Japanese message board in 2008 it was shared that a person can kill himself/herself using [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Shortly after 220 people attempted suicide in this way, and 208 were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Media and Suicide: A Public Health Perspective|journal = American Journal of Public Health|date = 2012-03-08|issn = 0090-0036|pmc = 3477910|pmid = 22401525|pages = S195–S200|volume = 102|issue = S2|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300608|first = David D.|last = Luxton|first2 = Jennifer D.|last2 = June|first3 = Jonathan M.|last3 = Fairall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biddle et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pmc=2292278|title=Suicide and the Internet|journal=BMJ|volume=336|issue=7648|pages=800–802|vauthors=Biddle L, Donovan J, Hawton K, Kapur N, Gunnell D |year=2008|doi=10.1136/bmj.39525.442674.AD|pmid=18403541}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a systematic Web search of 12 suicide-associated terms (e.g., suicide, suicide methods, how to kill yourself, and best suicide methods) to analyze the search results and found that pro-suicide sites and chat rooms that discussed general issues associated with suicide most often occurred within the first few hits of a search. Recupero et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pmid=18494533|title=surfing for suicide information on the internet. J Clin Psychiatry|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=69|issue=6|pages=878–88|vauthors=Recupero R, Harmss E, Noble JM |year=2008|doi=10.4088/jcp.v69n0601}}&lt;/ref&gt; also conducted a study that examined suicide-related sites that can be found using Internet [[search engine]]s. Of 373 Web site hits, 31% were suicide neutral, 29% were anti-suicide, and 11% were pro-suicide. Together, these studies have shown that obtaining pro-suicide information on the Internet, including detailed information on suicide methods, is very easy.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

Although, the public opinion is that message boards are harmful, the following studies show how they point to suicide prevention and have positive influences. A study using content analysis analyzed all of the postings on the AOL Suicide Bulletin Board over 11 months, and concluded that most contributions contained positive, empathetic and supportive postings (Eichenberg, 2008). Then, a multi-method study was able to demonstrate that the users of such forums experience a great deal of social support and only a small amount of social strain. Lastly, in a survey participants were asked to assess the extent of their suicidal thoughts on a 7-level scale (0, absolutely no suicidal thoughts, to 7, very strong suicidal thoughts) for the time directly before their first forum visit and at the time of the survey (Eichenberg, 2008). The study found significant reduction after using the forum. The study however cannot conclude the forum is the only reason for decrease. Together, these studies show how forums can reduce the number of suicides.

An example of how social media can play a role in suicide is that of a male adolescent who arrived at the [[emergency department]] (ED) with his parents after a suspected medication ingestion in which he attempted to [[overdose]]. Beforehand he had sent an ex-girlfriend a [[Snapchat]] picture of himself holding a bottle of [[acetaminophen]], which was forwarded to the young male's parents. This picture was used by medical experts to establish a time of his ingestion, oral N-acetylcysteine was discovered and he was brought to a pediatric care facility, where he had an uneventful recovery and [[psychiatric evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2016.05.031|pmid=27666358|title=Snapchat Toxicology: Social Media and Suicide|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=68|issue=4|pages=527|year=2016|last1=Chhabra|first1=Neeraj|last2=Bryant|first2=Sean M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, the main cause of nine teen suicides was due to hateful anonymous messages on Ask.fm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=J|date=2013|title=Users On This Web Site Have Successfully Driven Nine Teenagers To Kill Themselves|url=|journal=Business Insider.|volume=|pages=1–2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyberbullicide ==
Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyberbullicide is the term used to define suicide due to having indirect or direct experiences with online aggression (Napolitano, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Napolitano|first=Tonianne|title=Cyberbullying and Middle School Student: Internet Behavior and Perceptions of Internet Risk|date=2013-01-01|publisher=JOHNSON &amp; WALES UNIVERSITY|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/10/10/10106079.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberbullying]] and [[cyber harassment]] are two prevalent ways to lead to pro-suicide behavior. In the past, bullying needed a physical location to harass the victim. Yet, this is not the case in the 21st century. Bullies have additional mediums such as social media to harass victims, often without consequence (Mason, 2008). Cyberbullying typically refers to when a child or adolescent is intentionally and repeatedly targeted by another child or teen in the form of threats or harassments or humiliated or embarrassed by means of cellular phones or Internet technologies such as e-mail, texting, social networking sites, or instant messaging.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, R. M., Limber, S. P., &amp; Agatston, P. W. (2012). Cyberbullying: Bullying in the digital age. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying usually occurs in the form of rumours, embarrassment, gossip, exclusion and attacks on the reputation and relationships of individuals. As a result, the victims may develop problems with their mental health and in some extreme cases, some have become suicidal. Cyber harassment and cyber stalking typically refer to these same actions when they involve adults.&lt;ref name="Luxton" /&gt; Social networking sites, regardless of security measures, can only offer a certain amount of protection to the privacy of the users, and this often overlooked by younger users. By being on sites such as Facebook or Instagram, users are making them open to harassment from online predators. Since there is an enormous amount of information available on these sites, concerns have been raised that sex offenders may access these sites and, using the personal information displayed, attempt to gain the trust of the user, making them vulnerable to online attacks, seduction, or sexual grooming. The offenders may then lure the users into a face to face meeting where they may be molested or sexually assaulted. (Mitchell et al., 2008). A review of data collected between 2004 and 2010 via survey studies indicated that lifetime cyberbullying victimization rates ranged from 20.8% to 40.6% and offending rates ranged from 11.5% to 20.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Hinduja, S., &amp; Patchin, J. W. (2010). Cyberbullying research center. Retrieved February 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
To combat and disuade Cyberbullying, some states are making adjustments to legislature. If found guilty of Cyberbullying, some states such as California will hold the person committing the crime liable by charging fines or even jail time. &lt;ref&gt;https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/cyber-bullying.html&lt;/ref&gt; In one particular case in Florida, two preteens were arressted after they were accused of cyberbullying another female student. The victim killed herself by hanging herself in her closet with a dog leash. The investigators indicated that the suicide was prompted due to the cyberbullying perpetrated by the two girls. The girls were later charged with cyberstalking. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida/articles/2018-01-23/2-12-year-olds-charged-with-cyberstalking-in-girls-suicide&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media contagion effect ==
Suicide contagion can be viewed within the larger context of [[behavioral contagion]], which has been described as a situation in which the same behavior spreads quickly and spontaneously through a group (Gould, Jamieson, &amp; Romer, 2003). Persons most susceptible to suicide contagions are those under 25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Suicide Clusters in Young People|journal = Crisis|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0227-5910|pages = 208–214|volume = 33|issue = 4|doi = 10.1027/0227-5910/a000144|pmid = 22713976|first = Georgina R.|last = Cox|first2 = Jo|last2 = Robinson|first3 = Michelle|last3 = Williamson|first4 = Anne|last4 = Lockley|first5 = Yee Tak Derek|last5 = Cheung|first6 = Jane|last6 = Pirkis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study by Dunlop et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunlop | first1 = S. M. | last2 = More | first2 = E. | last3 = Romer | first3 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Where do youth learn about suicides on the Internet, and what influence does this have on suicidal ideation? | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 52 | issue = 10| pages = 1073–1080 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02416.x| pmid = 21658185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically examined possible contagion effects on suicidal behavior via the Internet and social media. Of 719 individuals aged 14 to 24 years, 79% reported being exposed to suicide-related content through family, friends, and traditional news media such as newspapers, and 59% found such content through Internet sources.&lt;ref name="Luxton"/&gt; These information may pose a hazard for vulnerable groups by influencing decisions to die by suicide. In particular, interactions via chat rooms or discussion forums may foster peer pressure to die by suicide, encourage users to idolize those who have completed suicide, or facilitate suicide pacts.&lt;ref name="Luxton"/&gt; Recently there has been a trend in creating memorial social media pages in honor of a deceased person. In New Zealand, a memorial page was made after a person committed suicide, this resulted in the suicide of 8 other persons thereafter, which further shows the power of the media contagion effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Adolescent Suicide Cluster and the Possible Role of Electronic Communication Technology|journal = Crisis|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0227-5910|pages = 239–245|volume = 33|issue = 4|doi = 10.1027/0227-5910/a000140|pmid = 22562859|first = Lindsay|last = Robertson|first2 = Keren|last2 = Skegg|first3 = Marion|last3 = Poore|first4 = Sheila|last4 = Williams|first5 = Barry|last5 = Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide notes ==
It has generally been found that those who post suicide notes online tend to not receive help.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/200904/can-social-media-help-prevent-suicide|title=Can Social Media Help Prevent Suicide?|publisher=Psychology Today|date=April 6, 2009|author=Elana Premack Sandler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable cases support this argument below:

# [[Kevin Whitrick]] and [[Abraham K. Biggs]] [[webcast]] both of their suicides. "I am going to leave this for whoever stumbles across my bookmarks later on."
# [[Paul Zolezzi]] indicated via a [[Facebook]] update his intent to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/02/20/2009-02-20_facebook_status_update_becomes_suicide_n.html|title=Facebook status update becomes suicide note for aspiring Brooklyn model, actor Paul Zolezzi|author1=Gendar, Alison  |author2=Connor, Tracy |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In 2010, [[John Patrick Bedell]] left a [[Wikipedia]] user page and [[YouTube]] videos interpreted by some as a suicide note; the former was deleted by Wikipedia administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-6269989-504083.html|title=John Patrick Bedell: Rants on Wikipedia and YouTube May Have Foreshadowed Breakdown|publisher=CBS News|author=Carlin DeGuerin Miller|date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Joe Stack]] also posted a suicide note online.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-6220533-504083.html|title=Joe Stack Suicide Note Full Text: "American Zombies Wake Up and Revolt"|author=Neil Katz|publisher=CBS News|date=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Chris McKinstry]], an AI researcher, committed suicide after posting a note to both his blog and the [[Joel on Software]] off-topic forum explaining the reasons for his demise, which was discontinued shortly afterwards.
# A girl who attended a Louisville High School posted a video suicide note and then killed herself back in 2014. The girl did not receive any help leading H. Eric Sparks the director of the American School Counselor Association, to say that troubled students should be directed to help hotlines or to trusted authorities to seek an intervention as quickly as possible (Herold 14).&lt;ref&gt;HEROLD, BENJAMIN. "Louisville Suicide Highlights Role of Social Media in Crisis Response." Education Week, vol. 33, no. 29, 23 Apr. 2014, p. 14. EBSCOhost, 199.245.164.25:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=95759427&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide pacts==
A suicide pact is an agreement between two or more people to die by suicide at a particular time and often by the same lethal means.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajagopal | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Suicide pacts and the internet: Complete strangers may make cyberspace pacts | url = | journal = BMJ: British Medical Journal | volume = 329 | issue = 7478| pages = 1298–9 | doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7478.1298| pmid = 15576715 | pmc = 534825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, M., &amp; Barraclough, B. (1997). Epidemiology of suicide pacts in England and Wales, 1988-92. Bmj, 315(7103), 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide pacts are found to be rare (Gould, Jamieson, &amp; Romer, 2003). Traditional suicide pacts have typically developed among individuals who know each other, such as a couple of friends. A suicide pact that has been formed or developed in some way through the use of the Internet is a cybersuicide pact.&lt;ref&gt;Rajagopal, S. (2009). The Internet and suicide pacts. Internet and Suicide. New York, NY: Nova Science Publishers, 185–196.&lt;/ref&gt; A primary difference between cybersuicide pacts and traditional suicide pacts is that these pacts are usually formed among complete strangers.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal" /&gt; They use online chat rooms and virtual bulletin boards and forums as an unmediated avenue to share their feelings with other like-minded individuals, which can be easier than talking about such thoughts and feelings in person.&lt;ref name="Luxton"&gt;Luxton, D. D., June, J. D., &amp; Fairall, J. M. (2012). Social media and suicide: a public health perspective. American Journal of Public Health, 102(S2), S195-S200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented use of the Internet to form a suicide pact was reported in Japan in 2000. It has now become a more common form of suicide in Japan, where the suicide rate increased from 34 suicides in 2003 to 91 suicides in 2005. South Korea now has one of the world's highest suicide rates (24.7/100 000 in 2005), and evidence exists that cybersuicide pacts may account for almost one third of suicides in that country.&lt;ref name="Luxton" /&gt;

[[Gerald Krein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/12/valentine.suicide/index.html|title=Sheriff: Online suicide pact had sexual overtones|publisher=CNN | date=February 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Francis Melchert-Dinkel]] were accused of arranging [[internet suicide pact]]s.

==Interventions==
There are at least 2 suicide interventions through social media:

# [[Demi Moore]] and her followers intervened to stop a suicide that had been announced on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Demi Moore's Twitter followers help stop a suicide – CNET|url = http://www.cnet.com/news/demi-moores-twitter-followers-help-stop-a-suicide/|website = CNET|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A German was prevented from killing himself after Spanish internet users saw him announcing his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generation-nt.com/internaute-allemand-bremerhaven-menace-suicide-direct-forum-video-webcam-sauve-intervention-internautes-policiers-espagnols-secours-allemand-actualite-22884.html|title=Un Allemand sauvé du suicide grâce à Internet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion and support groups==
Some online groups, such as [[alt.suicide.holiday]], have emerged as discussion and support groups for suicidal individuals. Research indicates that providing more online support for suicidal people would be more effective than shutting down [[pro-suicide]] websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online suicide support needed|url = http://www.sciencealert.com/news/20090308-19499.html|website = ScienceAlert|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury|Defense Centers of Excellence]] have expressed interest in using social media for [[suicide prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dcoe.health.mil/blog/article.aspx?id=1&amp;postid=63|title=Harnessing New and Social Media to Prevent Suicide|publisher=Defense Centers of Excellence|date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook groups have sometimes been set up for suicide prevention purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201006/suicide-prevention-in-cyberspace|title=Suicide prevention in cyberspace|date=June 16, 2010|author=Elana Premack Sandler|publisher=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; including one that attracted 47,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Anti+suicide+Facebook+group+elicits+positive+messages/3151586/story.html|title=Anti-suicide Facebook group elicits positive messages|author=Minsky, Amy|publisher=The Vancouver Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many teens and preteens encounter suicide-related posts from peers on different social media apps, they also encounter suicide prevention hotlines and website links as well (Martin 2).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Florence, et al. "Middle School Students' Social Media Use." Educational Technology &amp; Society, vol. 21, no. 1, 2018, p. 213+.

[[SAMHSA]]'s Suicide Prevention Lifeline operates on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/samhsaNewsletter/Volume_18_Number_2/SuicidePreventionLifeline.aspx|title=Suicide Prevention Lifeline Update|author=SAMHSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[https://www.afsp.org/ AFSP] (American Foundation For Suicide Prevention) is trying to understanding and preventing suicide through research, education, and advocacy.

Recently, Reidenberg, the executive director of the United States-based prevention organization Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE), has become very involved in responding to suicidal messages. Facebook, the world's largest social network, has now implemented a direct intervention method. 25 of the 50 American states, when a user posts a message on Facebook containing a phrase that its algorithms flag as indicating suicidal thoughts or intentions, a banner pops up on the user's page (Eggertson, 2015). If the user's page is flagged the user is provided with the number of the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]] and given tips and links to support videos aligned with best prevention practices.

'''''Stuck in Neutral''''' is a young adult novel by [[Terry Trueman]]. It focuses deeply on the subject of [[cerebral palsy]], [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]], and [[euthanasia]]. The main character is Shawn McDaniel who has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The story, told from Shawn's perspective, also focuses on how his family copes with the condition. Shawn's mother, brother, sister, and father are all talked about in the book. Stuck in Neutral received recognition as an Honor Book for the [[Michael L. Printz Award]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Library Association|year=2010|title=Michael L. Printz Winners and Honor Books|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/yalsa/booklistsawards/printzaward/previouswinners/winners.cfm|accessdate=2011-02-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208112010/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/yalsa/booklistsawards/printzaward/previouswinners/winners.cfm|archivedate=2011-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trueman wrote the novel because his own son has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrytrueman.com/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and he wanted to educate young readers both about the condition and about showing [[Toleration|tolerance]] for those with severe disabilities.

==Plot summary==

The book follows Shawn McDaniel's first-person [[Narrative mode|point of view]]. He is a 14-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder, affecting motor control. In Shawn's case, his entire body is affected; he has absolutely no control over any of his bodily functions. Shawn's condition is a major part of the story

In the first few chapters, Shawn McDaniel explains to the reader his condition. He includes what he feels to be positive sides of his condition, such as his perfect [[memory]]. Shawn remembers every experience, every sensation, and everything he's ever learned from school or television. Unfortunately due to his complete lack of motor control Shawn is unable to talk or make contact with his family in any way, it is believed by those around him that Shawn's mind has no higher functional skills. A running theme throughout the book is Shawn's  desire to be truly known by someone.                Shawn introduces his family to the reader. His mother is his main caretaker and his father is a writer who has won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for a poem about Shawn.

The main story is about euthanasia. Shawn feels that his father Sydney McDaniel is trying to kill him. Sydney constantly talks about euthanasia. On an interview during a [[Jerry Springer]]-style show Sydney interviews a man who killed his son with a similar condition, who reveals that he just wanted to end his son's pain. In the end, the reader is left to wonder if Sydney follows the other man's example, or allowed Shawn to continue his life. Shawn frequently expresses that he dislikes being talked down to as if he were a baby. He stresses throughout the novel that he is just as intelligent, or more intelligent, than others around him. We are also introduced to his school life in the middle of the novel.

==Reception==

''Stuck in Neutral'' caused some [[controversy]] at a school in Evansville, [[Wisconsin]], where the book was required reading. Parents felt the subject matter was too sad and violent. Trueman strongly defended his book and school officials in Wisconsin eventually agreed. Stuck in Neutral remains required reading in Special Education classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Forward; "Stuck in Neutral" {{ISBN|0-7362-3179-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Author http://www.terrytrueman.com/about_E-mailsLetters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Toshiaki Nishioka'''|西岡 利晃|Nishioka Toshiaki|extra=born July 25, 1976}} is a Japanese former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1994 to 2012. He held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[super bantamweight]] title from 2008 to 2012, and challenged for the [[lineal championship|lineal]] super bantamweight title in his final fight. Nishioka is known for his series of fights against [[Veeraphol Sahaprom|Veeraphol Nakonluang-Promotion]], with two of their four encounters ending in draws. Unlike many of Japan's other world champions, Nishioka willingly fought outside of his own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7053474/sergio-martinez-gets-job-done-once-again|title=Martinez gets the job done – Toshiaki Nishioka W12 Rafael Marquez|author=Dan Rafael|date=October 3, 2011|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Nishioka was born in [[Kakogawa, Hyōgo|Kakogawa]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]], Japan, in July 1976, and has one younger sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/tokushu/nisioka/sports15.html|script-title=ja:不安だけど…休養は必要|date=April 28, 1999|publisher=''[[Kobe Shimbun]]''|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722092939/http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/tokushu/nisioka/sports15.html|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started boxing at age ten&lt;ref name="miyazaki201004-18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Masahiro Miyazaki|2010|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was in the fifth grade of elementary school on the recommendation of his father&lt;ref name="miyazaki201004-17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Masahiro Miyazaki|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; who runs a [[izakaya|tavern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/tokushu/nisioka/sports11.html|script-title=ja:西岡先輩　頑張って|date=March 17, 1999|publisher=''Kobe Shimbun''|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722092944/http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/tokushu/nisioka/sports11.html|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compiled an amateur record of 10–2.{{Sfn|Baseball Magazine Sha|2004|p=223}} Since before his professional debut, Nishioka had served as a sparring partner of the reigning WBC bantamweight champion [[Yasuei Yakushiji]].&lt;ref name="worldboxing199904"&gt;{{Harvnb|Toshiki Sunohara|1999|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed "Speed King",&lt;ref name="maxboxing201109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eastsideboxing201010" /&gt; Nishioka won his professional debut by a first-round knockout in [[Himeji, Hyōgo]], on December 11, 1994. But he was knocked out in the fourth round of the next fight at the [[Korakuen Hall]], and was carried out on a stretcher.&lt;ref name="miyazaki201004-17" /&gt; Nishioka won the annual Japanese boxing series, West Japan Rookie King Tournament in the super bantamweight division at the [[Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium]] in September 1995. Winning over the Central Japan rookie king in the next fight at the [[Nagoya Civic Assembly Hall]], he fought against the rookie king of the Western part of Japan in [[Fukuoka]] in December of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wowow.co.jp/sports/excite_sp/column35.html|script-title=ja:世界チャンピオン・西岡利晃の軌跡 (1) – 天才少年の挫折|author=Isao Hara|date=September 3, 2011|publisher=[[WOWOW]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Nishioka was convinced of his victory, the judges were in favor of his opponent.&lt;ref name="hara20111110"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wpb.shueisha.co.jp/2011/11/10/7892/|title=WBC世界スーパーバンタム級王者　西岡利晃「20代の自分と戦ったら?　今の僕が勝つのは間違いない」|author=Isao Hara|date=November 10, 2011|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|accessdate=May 20, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry with Sahaprom, injuries===
In June 2000, Nishioka challenged the WBC bantamweight champion [[Veeraphol Sahaprom|Veeraphol Nakonluang-Promotion]] in [[Takasago, Hyōgo]], and lost via a [[unanimous decision]]. He had belonged to the JM Kakogawa Gym until that fight, and has been managed by the [[Teiken Boxing Gym]] in [[Tokyo]] under [[Akihiko Honda]]'s supervision&lt;ref name="hochi201012"&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=ja:西岡、「来年、日本で最初の統一王者になる」…2010報知プロスポーツ大賞|url=http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/sports/box/news/20101216-OHT1T00031.htm|publisher=''[[Sports Hochi]]''|date=December 16, 2010|accessdate=January 6, 2012|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722101618/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/sports/box/news/20101216-OHT1T00031.htm|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Yūichi Kasai]]'s guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninomiyasports.com/sc/modules/bulletin02/article.php?storyid=4324|script-title=ja:西岡の左はミットの上からでも骨を砕く　〜トレーナーが明かす世界王者の強さ〜|date=August 19, 2010|publisher=Sports Communications|language=Japanese|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since September 2000.

The second world title shot was watched by 12,000 spectators{{Sfn|Baseball Magazine Sha|2002|p=170}} at the [[Yokohama Arena]] in September 2001, and was a very close fight in which the scores were 115–113 for Nishioka, 116–113 for Veeraphol, and 114–114 even.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 1, 2001|url=http://a.espncdn.com/boxing/news/2001/0901/1246734.html|title=Veeraphol holds onto title|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishioka suffered an [[Achilles tendon rupture]] twice&lt;ref name="miyazaki201004-17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=なお進化を遂げる西岡、30代世界王者の充実度。〜Sバンタム級6度目の防衛へ〜|author=Makoto Maeda|url=http://number.bunshun.jp/articles/-/78346|publisher=[[Bungeishunjū]]|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=February 26, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; during that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=December 26, 2001|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sp20011226a2.html|title=Nishioka pulls out of boxing doubleheader|publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]''|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002, he returned to the ring for the first time in fifteen months to gain a first-round knockout victory at the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. However his style was totally different from the previous one.&lt;ref name="miyazaki201004-17" /&gt; He challenged Veeraphol for the third time at the [[Ryōgoku Kokugikan]] in October 2003, but the result was a draw&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 6, 2003|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292468683.html|title=Holyfield downed, nearly out|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a hometown decision.&lt;ref name="kyodo201009" /&gt; In his fourth world title shot against Veeraphol in March 2004, he lost via a unanimous decision by a wide margin of points at the [[Saitama Super Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=March 6, 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/3539019.stm|title=Larios sees off Nakazato|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that defeat in 2004, Nishioka received a [[greeting card]], with the Japanese message {{Nihongo||この道より生きる道なし|Kono michi yori ikiru michi nashi}} written by painter Atsumu Yamamoto; the phrase can be interpreted as: "No way to live other than this way", which encouraged him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=ja:西岡恩人の画家山本集氏にベルト奪取誓う|author=Jun Taguchi|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20080911-407134.html|publisher=''[[Nikkan Sports]]''|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 16, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Honda advised him to retire, and set subsequent matches to convince him,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=ja:西岡5度目で世界の頂点|author=Jun Taguchi|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20080916-409058.html?style=print|publisher=''Nikkan Sports''|date=September 16, 2008|accessdate=February 26, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishioka, who had remained aloof and proud as a boxer and had not trained with gym mates, decided to run with younger fellow boxers to strengthen his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=ja:西岡"5度目の正直"で世界獲った|url=http://www.sponichi.co.jp/battle/special/boxing/2008_boxing_09/KFullNormal20080916084.html|publisher=''[[Sports Nippon]]''|date=September 16, 2008|accessdate=February 26, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended [[Marco Antonio Barrera]]'s training camp on the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name="kyodo201009" /&gt;

===Marriage and recovery===
Nishioka got married in January 2005,&lt;ref name="boxingjp200501"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxing.jp/cgi/news/news.cgi?mode=view&amp;no=145|script-title=ja:西岡が結婚|date=January 11, 2005|publisher=boxing.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have a daughter born in 2006. Nishioka went back to the super bantamweight division,&lt;ref name="boxingjp200501" /&gt; and continued fighting mainly in Japan, besides a second-round technical knockout victory at the Palais des Sports in [[Marseille]], [[France]], in April 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxeomundial.net/boxeo.php?category=NOTICIAS&amp;id=1794|title=Noticias del boxeo japonés|author=Hisao Adachi|date=May 9, 2005|publisher=BoxeoMundial.net|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fourth-round knockout victory (with a left-hand punch to the body) at [[The Joint (music venue)|The Joint]] in Las Vegas, Nevada, in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles/4647-bobby-pacquiao-loses-by-dq-against-hector-velazquez-in-las-vegas|title=Bobby Pacquiao Loses by DQ Against Hector Velazquez in Las Vegas|author=David A.

After the fight in December 2007, Nishioka stayed at his wife's parents' home in [[Amagasaki]], Hyōgo. With the consent of his wife and her father, he decided to live separate from his wife and daughter to focus on boxing alone. When he returned to Tokyo and told Honda about it, he was told that the possibility that his fifth world title was determined to be less than ten percent and that he should bring her back immediately.&lt;ref name="miyazaki201004-16" /&gt; The discomfort in his foot completely disappeared in the beginning of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=ja:西岡5度目の挑戦で世界をつかむ|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20080701-378306.html|publisher=''Nikkan Sports''|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=February 29, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that year, he is registered as a resident in Amagasaki where his own house has been completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=西岡快挙!　ベガスでV7|author=Eiji Fujinaka|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20111003-844339.html|publisher=''Nikkan Sports''|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, Nishioka trains while living a solo life in Tokyo, and his wife and daughter live in Amagasaki.

===WBC super bantamweight champion===
Nishioka captured the WBC [[super bantamweight]] interim title against [[Thai people|Thai]]'s Napapol Kiatisakchokchai at the [[Pacifico Yokohama]] on September 15, 2008. Just after the fight, Veeraphol whom he fought four times, and who served as Napapol's special coach, climbed into the ring to congratulate Nishioka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Hisao Adachi|date=September 15, 2008|url=http://www.notifight.com/artman2/publish/Resultado_2/Nishioka_captura_la_diadema_interina_supergallo.php|title=¡Nishioka captura la diadema interina supergallo!|publisher=Notifight.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishioka inherited the fullversion of the WBC super bantamweight title on December 18 of that year, when its previous holder, [[Israel Vázquez]], was stripped for medical reasons.

The two [[Viking program|Viking lander]]s each carried four types of [[biological]] [[experiment]]s to the surface of [[Mars]] in 1976. These were the first Mars landers to carry out experiments to look for [[biosignature]]s of microbial [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The landers used a robotic arm to put soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface, [[Viking 1]] near the equator and [[Viking 2]] further north.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-7137-2747-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The experiments ==
Four experiments are presented here in the order in which they were carried out by the two Viking landers. The biology team leader for the Viking program was [[Harold P. Klein]] (NASA Ames).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4212/ch11-5.html |title=ch11-5 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2014-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sara |last=Acevedo |display-authors=etal |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1013387122386.pdf#page-1 |format=PDF |title=In Memoriam Dr. Harold P.

=== Gas chromatograph — mass spectrometer ===
A [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatograph — mass spectrometer]] ('''GCMS''') is a device that separates vapor components chemically via a [[gas chromatograph]] and then feeds the result into a [[mass spectrometer]], which measures the [[molecular weight]] of each chemical.  As a result, it can separate, identify, and quantify a large number of different chemicals.  The GCMS (PI: [[Klaus Biemann]], MIT) was used to analyze the components of untreated Martian soil, and particularly those components that are released as the soil is heated to different temperatures. It could measure molecules present at a level of a few parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mars |work=Space Science Series |publisher=University of Arizona Press |date=1992-10-01 |first=Hugh H. |last=Kieffer |first2=Bruce M. |last2=Jakosky |first3=Conway W. |last3=Snyder |first4=Mildred |last4=Matthews |isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GCMS measured no significant amount of [[natural organic matter|organic molecules]] in the Martian soil.  In fact, Martian soils were found to contain less carbon than lifeless lunar soils returned by the [[Apollo program]]. This result was difficult to explain if Martian bacterial metabolism was responsible for the positive results seen by the Labeled Release experiment (see below). A 2011 [[astrobiology]] textbook notes that this was the decisive factor due to which "For most of the Viking scientists, the final conclusion was that the ''Viking'' missions failed to detect life in the Martian soil."&lt;ref name="PlaxcoGross2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kevin W. |last=Plaxco |first2=Michael |last2=Gross |title=Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x83omgI5pGQC&amp;pg=PA282 |date=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0194-2 |pages=282–283 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments conducted in 2008 by the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]] discovered the presence of [[perchlorate]] in Martian soil. The 2011 astrobiology textbook discusses the importance of this finding with respect to the results obtained by ''Viking'' as "while perchlorate is too poor an oxidizer to reproduce the LR results (under the conditions of that experiment perchlorate does not oxidize organics), it does oxidize, and thus destroy, organics at the higher temperatures used in the Viking GCMS experiment. NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay has estimated, in fact, that if Phoenix-like levels of perchlorates were present in the Viking samples, the organic content of the Martian soil could have been as high as 0.1% and still would have produced the (false) negative result that the GCMS returned. Thus, while conventional wisdom regarding the ''Viking'' biology experiments still points to "no evidence of life", recent years have seen at least a small shift toward "inconclusive evidence"."&lt;ref name="PlaxcoGross2011_2"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kevin W. |last=Plaxco |first2=Michael |last2=Gross |title=Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x83omgI5pGQC&amp;pg=PA285 |date=2011-08-12 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0194-2 |pages=285–286 |accessdate=2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 NASA press release: "The only organic chemicals identified when the Viking landers heated samples of Martian soil were [[chloromethane]] and [[dichloromethane]] -- chlorine compounds interpreted at the time as likely contaminants from cleaning fluids." According to a paper authored by a team led by [[Rafael Navarro-González]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], "those chemicals are exactly what [their] new study found when a little perchlorate -- the surprise finding from Phoenix -- was added to desert soil from Chile containing organics and analyzed in the manner of the Viking tests." However, the 2010 NASA press release also noted that: "One reason the chlorinated organics found by Viking were interpreted as contaminants from Earth was that the ratio of two isotopes of chlorine in them matched the three-to-one ratio for those isotopes on Earth. The ratio for them on Mars has not been clearly determined yet. If it is found to be much different than Earth's, that would support the 1970s interpretation."&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |last2=Hoover |first2=Rachel |last3=Marlaire |first3=Ruth |last4=Frias |first4=Gabriela |date=2010-09-03 |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-286 |title=Missing Piece Inspires New Look at Mars Puzzle |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=2010-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biemann has written a commentary critical of the Navarro-González and McKay paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2011JE003869 | bibcode=2011JGRE..11612001B | volume=116 | issue=E12 | pages=E12001 | title=Comment on "Reanalysis of the Viking results suggests perchlorate and organics at midlatitudes on Mars" by Rafael Navarro-González et al. | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research| last1=Biemann | first1=Klaus | last2=Bada | first2=Jeffrey L. | year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to which the latter have replied;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2011JE003880 | bibcode=2011JGRE..11612002N | volume=116 | issue=E12 | pages=E12002 | title=Reply to comment by Biemann and Bada on "Reanalysis of the Viking results suggests perchlorate and organics at midlatitudes on Mars" | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research| last1=Navarro-González | first1=Rafael | last2=McKay | first2=Christopher P. | year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exchange was published in December 2011.

=== Gas exchange ===
The gas exchange ('''GEX''') experiment (PI: [[Vance Oyama]], NASA Ames) looked for gases given off by an incubated soil sample by first replacing the Martian atmosphere with the inert gas [[helium]].  It applied a liquid complex of organic and inorganic nutrients and supplements to a soil sample, first with just nutrients added, then with water added too.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; Periodically, the instrument sampled the atmosphere of the incubation chamber and used a [[gas chromatograph]] to measure the concentrations of several gases, including [[oxygen]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], and [[methane]].  The scientists hypothesized that metabolizing organisms would either consume or release at least one of the gases being measured. The result was negative.

=== Labeled release ===
The labeled release ('''LR''') experiment (PI: [[Gilbert Levin]], Biospherics Inc.) gave the most promise for [[exobiologist]]s. In the LR experiment, a sample of Martian soil was inoculated with a drop of very dilute aqueous nutrient solution. The nutrients (7 molecules that were [[Miller-Urey]] products) were tagged with radioactive &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C.  The air above the soil was monitored for the evolution of radioactive &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas as evidence that microorganisms in the soil had [[metabolism|metabolized]] one or more of the nutrients. Such a result was to be followed with the control part of the experiment as described for the PR below. The result was quite a surprise, considering the negative results of the first two tests, with a steady stream of radioactive gases being given off by the soil immediately following the first injection. The experiment was done by both Viking probes, the first using a sample from the surface exposed to sunlight and the second probe taking the sample from underneath a rock; both initial injections came back positive.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; Subsequent injections a week later did not, however, elicit the same reaction, and according to a 1976 paper by Levin and Patricia Ann Straat the results were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.194.4271.1322 |pages=1322–1329 |title=Viking Labeled Release Biology Experiment: Interim Results |date=1976 |last=Levin |first=G.

A. |journal=Science |volume=194 |issue=4271 |pmid=17797094 |bibcode=1976Sci...194.1322L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01732376 |title=Completion of the Viking labeled release experiment on Mars |date=1979 |last=Levin |first=Gilbert V. |last2=Straat |first2=Patricia Ann |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=14 |pages=167–83 |pmid=522152 |issue=1–3 |bibcode=1979JMolE..14..167L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Levin, Straat and [[Barry DiGregorio]] co-authored a book on the issue, titled ''Mars: The Living Planet''.&lt;ref name="DiGregorioLevin1997"&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry E. |last=DiGregorio |first2=Gilbert V. |last2=Levin |first3=Patricia Ann |last3=Straat |date=1997 |publisher=Frog Books |isbn=978-1-883319-58-8 |title=Mars: The Living Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[CNN]] article from 2000 noted that "Though most of his peers concluded otherwise, Levin still holds that the robot tests he coordinated on the 1976 Viking lander indicated the presence of living organisms on Mars."&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Stenger |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/TECH/space/11/07/mars.sample/ |title=Mars sample return plan carries microbial risk, group warns |work=CNN |date=2000-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[astrobiology]] textbook noted that "With unsterilized Terrestrial samples, though, the addition of more nutrients after the initial incubation would then produce still more radioactive gas as the dormant bacteria sprang into action to consume the new dose of food. This was not true of the Martian soil; on Mars, the second and third nutrient injections did not produce any further release of labeled gas."&lt;ref name="Plaxco2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kevin W. |last=Plaxco |first2=Michael |last2=Gross |title=Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjYSAA5oHdcC&amp;pg=PA223 |date=2006 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8366-8 |page=223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 edition of the same textbook noted that "Albet Yen of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has shown that, under extremely cold and dry conditions and in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, ultraviolet light (remember: Mars lacks an ozone layer, so the surface is bathed in ultraviolet) can cause carbon dioxide to react with soils to produce various oxidizers, including highly reactive [[superoxide]]s (salts containing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) When mixed with small organic molecules, superoxidizers readily oxidize them to carbon dioxide, which may account for the LR result. Superoxide chemistry can also account for the puzzling results seen when more nutrients were added to the soil in the LR experiment; because life multiplies, the amount of gas should have increased when a second or third batch of nutrients was added, but if the effect was due to a chemical being consumed in the first reaction, no new gas would be expected.

In a 2002 paper published by Joseph Miller, he speculates that recorded delays in the system's chemical reactions point to biological activity similar to the [[circadian rhythm]] previously observed in terrestrial [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gillevin.com/Mars/Reprint119-Miller-Straat-Levin-FINAL_files/Reprint119-Miller-Straat-Levin-FINAL.htm Periodic Analysis of the Viking Lander Labeled Release Experiment], Proc.

=== Pyrolytic release ===
The pyrolytic release ('''PR''') experiment (PI: [[Norman Horowitz]], Caltech) consisted of the use of light, water, and a carbon-containing [[atmosphere of Mars|atmosphere]] of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), simulating that on Mars.  The carbon-bearing gases were made with [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), a  heavy, [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] of carbon.  If there were [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms present, it was believed that they would incorporate some of the carbon as [[biomass]] through the process of [[carbon fixation]], just as plants and [[cyanobacteria]] on earth do.  After several days of incubation, the experiment removed the gases, baked the remaining soil at 650&amp;nbsp;°C (1200&amp;nbsp;°F), and collected the products in a device which counted radioactivity.  If any of the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C had been converted to biomass, it would be vaporized during heating and the radioactivity counter would detect it as evidence for life.  Should a positive response be obtained, a duplicate sample of the same soil would be heated to "sterilize" it.  It would then be tested as a control and should it still show activity similar to the first response, that was evidence that the activity was chemical in nature.  However, a nil, or greatly diminished response, was evidence for biology. This same control was to be used for any of the three life detection experiments that showed a positive initial result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horowitz |first=N. |last2=Hobby |first2=G.

== Scientific conclusions ==
Organic compounds seem to be common, for example, on asteroids, meteorites, comets and the icy bodies orbiting the Sun, so detecting no trace of any organic compound on the surface of Mars came as a surprise. The GC-MS was definitely working, because the controls were effective and it was able to detect traces of the cleaning solvents that had been used to sterilize it prior to launch.&lt;ref name="Caplinger"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Caplinger |title=Life on Mars |date=April 1995 |publisher=Malin Space Science Systems |url=http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527182311/http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html |archivedate=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the total absence of organic material on the surface made the results of the biology experiments moot, since [[metabolism]] involving organic compounds were what those experiments were designed to detect. However, the general scientific community surmise that the Viking's biological tests remain inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Viking Biological Investigation: Preliminary Results |journal=Science |date=1976-10-01 |first=Harold P. |last=Klein |last2=Levin |first2=Gilbert V. |last3=Levin |first3=Gilbert V. |last4=Oyama |first4=Vance I. |last5=Lederberg |first5=Joshua |last6=Rich |first6=Alexander |last7=Hubbard |first7=Jerry S. |last8=Hobby |first8=George L. |last9=Straat |first9=Patricia A. |last10=Berdahl |first10=Bonnie J. |last11=Carle |first11=Glenn C. |last12=Brown |first12=Frederick S. |last13=Johnson |first13=Richard D. |volume=194 |issue=4260 |pages=99–105 |doi=10.1126/science.194.4260.99 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4260/99 |pmid=17793090 |bibcode=1976Sci...194...99K |accessdate=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beegle"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Concept for NASA's Mars 2016 Astrobiology Field Laboratory |journal=Astrobiology |date=August 2007 |last=Beegle |first=Luther W. |last2=Wilson |first2=Michael G.|volume=7 |issue=4 |pmid=17723090 |pages=545–577 |doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0153 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..545B |last3=Abilleira |first3=Fernando |last4=Jordan |first4=James F. |last5=Wilson |first5=Gregory R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ExoMars/SEMK39JJX7F_0.html |title=ExoMars rover |publisher=ESA |accessdate=2014-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers surmise that the results of the Viking biology experiments can be explained by purely chemical processes that do not require the presence of life, and the GC-MS results rule out life.

Despite the positive result from the Labeled Release experiment, a general assessment is that the results seen in the four experiments are best explained by oxidative chemical reactions with the Martian soil. One of the current conclusions is that the Martian soil, being continuously exposed to [[ultraviolet|UV light]] from the Sun (Mars has no protective [[ozone layer]]), has built up a thin layer of a very strong [[oxidant]]. A sufficiently strong oxidizing molecule would react with the added water to produce oxygen and hydrogen, and with the nutrients to produce [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

On August 2008, the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]] detected [[perchlorate]], a strong oxidizer when heated above 200&amp;nbsp;°C. This was initially thought to be the cause of a false positive LR result.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-sci-phoenix6-2008aug06,0,4986721.story |title=Perchlorate found in Martian soil |date=2008-08-06 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |last=Johnson |first=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080805192122.htm |publisher=Science Daily |date=2008-08-06 |title=Martian Life Or Not?

The study's authors found that perchlorate can destroy organics when heated and produce [[chloromethane]] and [[dichloromethane]] as byproduct, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars. Because perchlorate would have broken down any Martian organics, the question of whether or not Viking found organic compounds is still wide open, as alternative chemical and biological interpretations are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Did Viking Mars Landers Find Life's Building Blocks?

== Controversy ==
Before the discovery of the oxidizer [[perchlorate]] on Mars in 2008, some theories remained opposed to the general scientific conclusion. An investigator suggested that the biological explanation of the lack of detected organics by GC-MS could be that the oxidizing inventory of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent well exceeded the reducing power of the organic compounds of the organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It has also been argued that the Labeled Release (LR) experiment detected so few metabolising organisms in the Martian soil, that it would have been impossible for the gas chromatograph to detect them.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; This view has been put forward by the designer of the LR experiment, [[Gilbert Levin]], who believes the positive LR results are diagnostic for life on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1117/2.3201403.03| title = Gilbert Levin: Mars microbes -- proof from the Viking missions?| journal = SPIE Newsroom| year = 2014| last1 = Spie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and others have conducted ongoing experiments attempting to reproduce the Viking data, either with biological or non-biological materials on Earth.  While no experiment has ever precisely duplicated the Mars LR test and control results, experiments with [[hydrogen peroxide]]-saturated [[titanium dioxide]] have produced similar results.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quinn |first=R.C. |last2=Zent |first2=A.P. |title=Peroxide-Modified Titanium Dioxide: a Chemical Analog of Putative Martian Soil Oxidants |journal=Journal Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |date=1999 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=59–72 |doi=10.1023/A:1006506022182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of astrobiologists still conclude that the Viking biological experiments were inconclusive or negative, [[Gilbert Levin]] is not alone in believing otherwise. The current claim for life on Mars is grounded on old evidence reinterpreted in the light of recent developments.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levin |first=Gilbert |title=Analysis of evidence of Mars life |journal=Electroneurobiología |date=2007 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=39–47 |issn=1850-1826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navarro"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Navarro-González |first=Rafael |last2=Navarro |first2=Karina F. |last3=de la Rosa |first3=José |last4=Iñiguez |first4=Enrique |last5=Molina |first5=Paola |last6=Miranda |first6=Luis D. |last7=Morales |first7=Pedro |last8=Cienfuegos |first8=Edith |last9=Coll |first9=Patrice |last10=Raulin |first10=François |last11=Amils |first11=Ricardo |last12=McKay |first12=Christopher P. |date=2006 |title=The limitations on organic detection in Mars-like soils by thermal volatilization-gas chromatography-MS and their implications for the Viking results |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=44 |pages=16089–16094 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604210103 |pmid=17060639 |pmc=1621051 |bibcode=2006PNAS..10316089N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paepe"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Red Soil on Mars as a proof for water and vegetation |journal=Geophysical Research Abstracts |date=2007 |first=Ronald |last=Paepe |volume=9 |issue=1794 |url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2007/01794/EGU2007-J-01794.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2006, scientist Rafael Navarro demonstrated that the Viking biological experiments likely lacked  sensitivity to detect trace amounts of organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The limitations on organic detection in Mars-like soils by thermal volatilization–gas chromatography–MS and their implications for the Viking results |first1=Rafael |last1=Navarro-González |first2=Karina F. |last2=Navarro |first3=José |last3=de la Rosa |first4=Enrique |last4=Iñiguez |first5=Paola |last5=Molina |first6=Luis D. |last6=Miranda |first7=Pedro |last7=Morales |first8=Edith |last8=Cienfuegos |first9=Patrice |last9=Coll |first10=François |last10=Raulin |first11=Ricardo |last11=Amils |first12=Christopher P. |last12=McKay |journal=Proc.

On 2006, [[:es:Mario Crocco|Mario Crocco]] went as far as proposing the creation of a new [[Taxonomy (biology)|nomenclatural rank]] that classified some Viking results as '[[metabolism|metabolic]]' and therefore representative of a new form of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contactincontext.org/Crocco_nomenclature_CIC.htm |title=Science works through Mars lander life controversy |publisher=Contactincontext.org |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2014-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxonomy proposed by Crocco has not been accepted by the scientific community, and the validity of Crocco's interpretation hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the Martian soil.

== Critiques ==
[[James Lovelock]] argued that the Viking mission would have done better to examine the Martian atmosphere than look at the soil. He theorised that all life tends to expel waste gases into the atmosphere, and as such it would be possible to theorise the existence of life on a planet by detecting an atmosphere that was not in chemical equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/feature/2000/08/17/lovelock/ |title=James Lovelock, Gaia's grand old man |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |date=2000-08-17 |publisher=Salon |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408145043/http://archive.salon.com/people/feature/2000/08/17/lovelock/ |archivedate=2009-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that there was enough information about Mars' atmosphere at that time to discount the possibility of life there. Since then, [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane has been discovered in Mars]]' atmosphere at 10ppb, thus reopening this debate.

The planned [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]], launched on March 2016, will implement this approach and will focus on detection, characterization of spatial and temporal variation, and localization of sources for a broad suite of atmospheric trace gases on Mars and help determine if their formation is of biological or geological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Rincon |title=Agencies outline Mars initiative |date=2009-07-09 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8130393.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA orbiter to hunt for source of Martian methane in 2016 |date=2009-03-06 |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/nasa-orbiter-to-hunt-for-source-of-martian-methane-in-2016_100163335.html |work=Thaindian News |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] is also attempting —since late 2014— to detect and map methane on Mars' atmosphere.

[[Mars Pathfinder]]'s ''Sojourner'' rover and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s each used this landing technique successfully.  The [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix Scout]] lander descended to the surface with retro-rockets, however, their fuel was [[hydrazine]], and the end products of the plume (water, nitrogen, and ammonia) were not found to have affected the soils at the landing site.

The question of [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] will probably not be resolved entirely until future missions to Mars either conclusively demonstrate the presence of life on the planet, identify the chemical(s) responsible for the Viking results, or both. The [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission landed the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'' rover]] on August 6, 2012, and its goals include investigation of the Martian [[climate of Mars|climate]], [[geology of Mars|geology]], and whether Mars could have ever supported [[life on Mars (planet)|life]], including investigation of the [[Water on Mars|role of water]] and [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/objectives/ |title=Overview |publisher=JPL, NASA |accessdate=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goals&gt;{{cite web |author=JPL, NASA |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/goals/ |title=MSL Goals |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2014-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Astrobiology research on Mars will continue with the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] in 2016, [[ExoMars]] rover on 2018, and the [[Mars 2020]] rover in 2020.

In 2008, the [[Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer]] was operated at Mars, which could chemically analyze 8 samples.

The [[Urey instrument]] was a funded study for sensitive organic compound detector, but has not been sent to Mars but was considered for [[ExoMars]] program of the 2000s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">'''Viveza criolla''' is a [[Spanish language]] phrase literally meaning "[[creole peoples|creole]]' cleverness" and may be translated as "creoles' cunning",{{cn|date=August 2015}} describing a way of life in [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], among other [[Latin America|Latin American]] countries. It is a philosophy of progress along the [[line of least resistance]] and ignoring rules, a lack of sense of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] and consideration for others, and it extends to all social groups and throughout the whole country, although it predominates in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; Viveza criolla has been called "the principal cause of a moral, cultural, [[Economy of Argentina|economic]], social and [[Politics of Argentina|political]] [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|crisis]]".&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a similar concept to [[jeitinho brasileiro]] in [[Brazil]].

==Characteristics== 
Viveza criolla includes:
*Lack of [[respect]] for others and indifference to the [[common good]] in a framework of individual interests.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; 
*[[Political corruption]], which extends in all institutions, in the form of [[Employee benefit|perk]]s, direct appropriation of [[public funds]], [[Cronyism|favoritism]], [[nepotism]], misallocation of state resources, etc.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; 
*Extreme [[individualism]], with [[Trust (social sciences)|mistrust]] of others.  This includes having little ability to partner and cooperate in community goals.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; (Interpersonal trust is a key component of [[social capital]], which is crucial for economic development and proper functioning of democratic institutions.)&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt; 
*[[Anomie]] or weakening of the common [[morality]], and social deviance as behavior that departs from generally accepted standards in [[society]].&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt;  
*The habit of blaming problems on others, thereby encouraging [[paranoia]] and granting a permit to self-indulgence.
*The tendency to take advantage of or cheat others in favor of one's own self-interests, partially for reasons of self-protection and mistrust, but also to assert one's superiority and "quick-wittedness" over another. &lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies" /&gt;

==Phrases==
*''Hecha la ley, hecha la trampa.'' -- "Made the law, made the loophole."
*''Total, si no robo yo, robará otro.'' -- "In the end, if I do not steal, someone else will."
*''El vivo vive del zonzo y el zonzo de su trabajo'' -- "The cunning lives off the sucker, and the sucker lives off his job"
