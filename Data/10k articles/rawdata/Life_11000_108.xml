The book's 100 chapters each cover in a couple of pages one of the 100 things that the author suggests successful people do. A reviewer writes: "the book, subtitled Little Exercises For Successful Living, is easily digestible (perhaps even as a tip a day), with each spread over two pages – the first explaining the concept and the second featuring practical exercises and activities to apply it to your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/the-life/book-review-unlearn-it-all-to-move-ahead |title=Book review: Unlearn it all to move ahead &amp;#124; The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2016-09-06 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adds: "each secret to success is a powerful reminder of the ways you can make your life – and other's – more satisfied, at work, at home and in your relationships, with your health, wealth and in retirement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/successful-leaders-little-secrets-659239.html |title=Successful leaders' little secrets - Business - Arabian- Business -.com |publisher=Arabianbusiness.com |date=2017-01-17 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2wenty''' is an American [[Mixed media|mixed-media]] artist and [[photographer]] from [[Los Angeles]]. He is known for using light as the central theme in his work. 2wenty comes from a background in lighting television and film which gives him an intimate understanding of how light works. The sources of light he utilizes for his light paintings are handmade, as well as creating the LED paintings by hand. His works can be viewed both nationally and internationally in Los Angeles, [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and [[London, England|London]].

== Art career ==
 [[File:Facebook Cigarettes poster by 2wenty.png|thumb|right|Facebook Social Cigarettes poster by 2wenty, 2011]]
2wenty first emerged in 2011, when his ''Facebook Social Cigarettes'' posters started appearing in technology blogs all over the internet and on the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetartsf.com/interview/artist-interview-2wenty/|title=2Wenty  Street Art SF|work=Street Art SF|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posters featured a pack of cigarettes with the [[Facebook]] logo and a tag that read, "Social Cigarettes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2011/04/06/social_cigarettes_street_artist_adm.php|title='Social Cigarettes' Street Artist Admits Facebook Addiction|work=LAist|accessdate=29 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803150238/http://laist.com/2011/04/06/social_cigarettes_street_artist_adm.php|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created over one hundred of the posters, comparing [[Facebook]] consumption with that of "cancer sticks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/facebook-street-art-2wenty-forbes-kashmir-hill_b26020|title=FishbowlLA|work=mediabistro.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2wenty also created three-dimensional versions of the posters, complete with a surgeon general warning, "[[Facebook]] may cause loss of time, poor work ethic, obesity, social disorder and possible interference of destiny. Use at your own risk."

2wenty has had multiple collaborations with fellow aritst, [[Gregory Siff]],  in addition to This Means Mar. In December 2013, 2wenty was invited by Mar to show and create one of his "signature" light paintings at his solo show 'I Crave Love',  which was held at Lab Art Gallery in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shophex.com/blog/events/hex-x-i-crave-love-a-solo-show-by-this-means-mar-at-lab-art/ |title=I Crave Love: A Solo Show At Lab Art LA, Shop Hex Blog, December 2013 |access-date=2015-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130424/http://www.shophex.com/blog/events/hex-x-i-crave-love-a-solo-show-by-this-means-mar-at-lab-art/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labartgallery.com/blog/2011/12/21/this-means-mar/ This Means Mar]&lt;/ref&gt;

2wenty expands his oeuvre into [[Light painting|light painting photography]]. Through long exposures, the camera captures not only the subject, but also the source of light the artist moves across his "canvas". Within these detailed images," There is a depth and other worldliness that records both place and passage of time", says 2wenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaklandartmurmur.org/events/between-paint-and-light-2wenty-and-gregory-siff-at-loakal-2013-06-01/|title=Between Paint and Light: 2wenty and Gregory Siff at Loakal|work=oaklandartmurmur.org|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leveledmag.com/2012/09/light-drawing-photography-by-2wenty/ Light Drawing Photography by 2wenty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schroeder took revenge in the doubles final where he teamed up with seasoned player [[Jacques Brugnon]] of the [[The Four Musketeers (tennis)|Four Musketeers]] to stop the Baworowski-von Metaxa duo in a five set match.{{sfn|Le Figaro 1938; Cannes L.T.C. finals}}

At the [[French Open|French Championships]], Baworowski reached the fourth round in 1937 and 1938. At Wimbledon, he lost his initial match on three occasions (1933, 1936, 1939). After the "[[Anschluss]]", the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany, in March 1938, Baworowski decided to join the Polish Davis Cup team as he didn't want to lose his family's estates in Poland.{{sfn|sportowahistoria.pl website}}

Upon arrival in Poland he gave a few interviews, condemning the "Anschluss" and the policy of the Nazi authorities. His statements were widely covered in the Western media. He joined the [[Legia Warsaw]] and on 3 May 1938 he participated in a friendly match between Poland and Germany, and a few days later played in a match in a Legia Warsaw-Stockholm meeting. He quickly moved up to second place on the list of [[Polish Tennis Association]] right behind [[Ignacy Tłoczyński]]. He was victorious again in the doubles at the [[Katowice]] tournament partnering Tłoczyński and the duo represented Poland in the Central European Cup and claimed the trophy after beating [[Yugoslavia Davis Cup team|Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia Davis Cup team|Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|sportowahistoria.pl website}}

The last peaceful season in 1939 kicked off well for him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sponsored Baworowski [[French Riviera]] tour and it paid off well. At [[Cannes]] he was only beaten in the final by [[Yvon Petra]]. In [[Juan-les-Pins]] he proved to be unstoppable and defeated [[Robert Abdesselam]] for the title and carried on this streak at [[Nice]] through the final against [[Antoine Gentien]]. After this great season opener he suffered injury, which affected his Davis Cup tie against [[Germany Davis Cup team|Germany]] and in the [[1939 French Championships (tennis)|French Championships]]. However he was a doubles semifinalist along with [[Ignacy Tłoczyński]] at Roland Garros. Despite his bad shape he still secured the Polish National Doubles championship alongside Tłoczyński.{{sfn|sportowahistoria.pl website}}

=== World War II and death ===
At the outbreak of [[World War II]], after returning from [[Monaco]] with a silver medal of the [[1939 International University Games]] Baworowski was residing in Paris where his family lived. When he heard about the outbreak of the war he was determined to join the [[Polish army]] although his parents begged him to stay. When he arrived to the East Railway Station of Warsaw, The German [[Luftwaffe]] was already bombarding the area. The passengers fled from the trains to nearby trenches. Apparently he was successfully enlisted.{{sfn|sportowahistoria.pl website}} The next time he met his cousin Eugene Paul Baworowski in the streets of Warsaw in the first days of [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|occupation]] he was about to get in touch with the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish Resistance]]. As the 6 September 1939 decree issued by the Wehrmacht command pursued every Polish citizen who reached the military age to be sent to a [[POW]] camp the [[Gestapo]] soon arrested and sent him to a camp. Only his ties to the Chorynsky noble family and to the former [[Austrian Tennis Federation]] saved him from further reprisals.{{sfn|sportowahistoria.pl website}}

In 1941, he took part in the German war championships at [[Braunschweig]] and reached the final which he lost to [[Kurt Gies]] in five sets.{{Gillmeister, pp. 60 and 72-74, notes 60-62}} He was practising in the [[Rot-Weiss Tennis Club]] of [[Berlin]]. He further represented Germany in the Danube Cup, which was a wartime substitute for the Central European Cup. Baworowski later joined the German [[Wehrmacht]] and was killed in action in the beginning of 1943 during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].{{sfn|sportowahistoria.pl website}} He served as a [[Hauptmann]]. On December 21, 1942, when the Luftwaffe evacuated his troops he ceded his place on the last flight to a heavily injured soldier and decided to stay in the trenches with his subordinates. He was hit by the Soviets and died in agony without receiving any medical help. {{sfn|Konecki|2003}}

[[File:Inês de Aquitânia, Rainha de Aragão -The Portuguese Genealogy (Genealogia dos Reis de Portugal).png|thumb|Agnes of Aquitaine, taken from ''Genealogia dos Reis de Portugal'' by Antonio de Hollanda.]]
'''Agnes''' ({{lang-fr|Agnès}}, {{lang-es|Inés}}; ''c''.1105–''c''.1159){{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}} was [[Queen consort of Aragon|Queen of Aragon]] during her brief marriage to [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II]], a former monk. The couple separated after the birth of their only child, [[Petronilla of Aragon|Queen Petronilla]], and retired to monasteries. Agnes chose the [[Abbey of Fontevraud]], from where she continued to take part in the affairs of her sons from her first marriage to [[Aimery V, Viscount of Thouars]].

==First marriage==
Agnes was the daughter of [[William IX, Duke of Aquitaine|William IX, Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers]], and [[Philippa, Countess of Toulouse]]. She was the namesake of her aunt [[Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre|Agnes]], wife of King [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre]]. Her first marriage, to [[Aimery V, Viscount of Thouars|Aimery V]], the [[viscount of Thouars]], was celebrated some time prior to 9 January 1117, when the couple confirmed the possessions of the abbey of [[Saint-Laon de Thouars]].{{sfn|Imbert|1876|p=11, no. 8}} Before Aimery's death in 1127, Agnes bore him three sons:{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=53}}
#William I (died 1151), succeeded his father{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}}
#Guy (died c. 1149), lord of [[Oiron]]{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}}
#Geoffrey IV (died 1173), succeeded William{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}}

==Second marriage==
On 13 November 1135 in the cathedral of [[Jaca]], the ancient capital of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], Agnes married King [[Ramiro II of Aragon|Ramiro II]], a monk who had resigned the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Barbastro-Monzón|bishopric of Roda]] in order to succeed his childless brother [[Alfonso the Battler]].{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=53}} The anonymous contemporary author of the ''[[Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris]]'' attributes the initiative in Ramiro's marriage to the Aragonese:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They elected Alfonso's brother king. This man was a monk, and his name was Ramiro. They gave him the sister of the Count of Poitiers for a wife. Even though this was a great sin, the Aragonese did it, for they had lost their king and hoped that there would be an offspring from the royal family. . . King Ramiro went to his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to a daughter. . . He transferred the kingdom to his daughter and acknowledged his sins. He then did penance.{{sfn|Lipskey|1972|p=84 (book I, §62)}}&lt;!--According to the ''[[Gesta comitum Barcinonensium]]'', Ramiro married "a sister of the count of Poitiers" (''sororem comitis Pictaviensis'').--&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Agnes' age (approximately thirty) and proven fertility in her prior marriage were probably the main reasons the Aragonese sought her out.{{sfn|Lourie|1975|p=640}} Agnes' brother, [[William X of Aquitaine|Duke William X]], was also one of the few regional supporters of [[Antipope Anacletus II]], who, as the weaker claimant to the papacy, might be persuaded to support Ramiro's irregular (and uncanonical) accession.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=53}} Agnes' dowry was a church at [[Loscertales]].

In a document from the same month as his marriage, Ramiro declares that he "took a wife not out of carnal lust, but for the restoration of the blood and the lineage" (''uxorem quoque non carnis libidine, set sanguinis ac proienici restauratione duxi'').{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}} Later medieval and early modern historians, embarrassed by the disregard for [[canon law]], invented explanations to reconcile the marriage of a bishop with what was current in their own day. The fourteenth-century ''[[Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña]]'' records that messengers were sent to the pope to obtain the proper dispensation.{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}} The Aragonese translation of the same chronicle places Ramiro's religious status in doubt ("some chronicles say that he was not in holy orders", ''algunas cronónicas dizen que no era en sacres órdenes'').{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}} At the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139, the church, perhaps influenced by the case of Ramiro and Agnes, declared the marriages of clerics to be null and void. Prior to this, they were legitimate, but illegal, marriages.{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128–32}}

==Queenship==
The first known royal diploma in which Agnes appears as queen is an original dated 29 January 1136.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=53}} By August Agnes had born a daughter, [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronilla]]. Agnes' last appearance in an Aragonese document is from October 1136: a joint donation with her husband of a mill and a horse at Loscertales to the monastery of [[San Pedro de Antefruenzo]].{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|pp=137–38}} She and Ramiro may have separated shortly after this. Her brother died on a [[Way of Saint James|pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela]] on 3 April 1137. It was probably during his passage through Iberia that his consent to the proposed marriage of the infant Petronilla was obtained; there is no evidence that Agnes took any part in arranging the future of her daughter.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|pp=137–38}}

In a series of acts between 11 August and 13 November 1137, Ramiro betrothed his daughter to the powerful Count [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona]], made his subjects swear an oath of allegiance to the count and then handed over the royal power to him.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=61}} The transfer of power done, Ramiro returned to religious life and Agnes retired to the [[Abbey of Fontevraud]], where her mother had lived. She is recorded there between 1141 and 1147, and there she died around 1159.{{sfn|Fletcher|1984|p=272}}{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|pp=137–38}}

'''Amy Duggan''' "'''Sister'''" '''Archer-Gilligan''' (October 1873&lt;ref name= aaol&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/01/17/2010-01-17_comedy_and_killing_truth_to_arsenic__old_lace.html |first= Mara| last= Bovsun| title= True crime story behind classic comedy, 'Arsenic &amp; Old Lace'| website= NYDailyNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; – April 23, 1962)&lt;ref name= courant&gt;{{cite news| work= [[The Hartford Courant]]| title= Archer-Gilligan obituary| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Windsor, Connecticut]], [[nursing home]] proprietor and serial killer. She murdered at least five people by poisoning them. One of her victims was her second husband, Michael Gilligan; the others were residents of her nursing home.

It is possible that she was involved in more deaths. The authorities counted 48 deaths in her nursing home, the "Archer Home for the Elderly and Infirm."

The case attracted wide publicity at the time and has been cited as an inspiration for the play ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' and for [[Frank Capra]]'s later [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|film of the same name]].

==Childhood and marriages==
Amy E. Duggan was born in October 1868 to James Duggan and Mary Kennedy in [[Milton Center Historic District|Milton, Connecticut]], the eighth of ten children.&lt;ref name= conndeaths&gt;{{cite |work= Connecticut Death Records| title= Mary Kennedy Duggan, 1838-1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= censusrecs&gt;''1870 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut, p. 73''; ''1880 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut''; ''1900 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut'', sheet 18B''; ''1900 US Census of Litchfield, Connecticut'', sheet 24A''; ''1910 US Census of Windsor, Connecticut'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the Milton School and the New Britain Normal School in 1890.&lt;ref name= milton&gt;{{cite book| title= Chronicles of Milton: Village Left Behind by Time |publisher= Milton Women's Club| location= Milton, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Duggan married James Archer in 1897. A daughter, Mary J. Archer, was born in December 1897.&lt;ref name= censusrecs /&gt; The Archers first became caretakers in 1901, hired to care for John Seymour, an elderly widower. They moved into his home in [[Newington, Connecticut]]. Seymour died in 1904. His heirs converted the residence into a [[boarding house]] for the elderly, and the Archers remained to provide care for the elderly for a fee. They paid rent to Seymour's family.&lt;ref name= aaol/&gt; They ran the boarding house as Sister Amy's Nursing Home for the Elderly.

In 1907, Seymour's heirs decided to sell the house. The Archers moved to [[Windsor, Connecticut]], and used their savings to purchase their own residence on Prospect Street in Windsor Center. They soon converted it into a business, Archer Home for the Elderly and Infirm.

James Archer died in 1910,&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt; apparently of natural causes. The official cause of his death was [[Bright's disease]], a generic term for [[Nephrology|kidney diseases]].&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt; Amy Archer had taken out an insurance policy on him a few weeks before his death. The policy benefit enabled her to continue operating Archer Home.

In 1913, Amy married Michael W. Gilligan, a widower with four adult sons.&lt;ref name= census2&gt;''1900 US Census of Windsor, Connecticut'', sheet 8A; ''1910 US Census of Windsor, Connecticut'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly wealthy and interested in both Amy and in investing in the Archer Home. However, on February 20, 1914,&lt;ref name= mwgsdeath&gt;{{cite web| url= https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.2/MDV2-1MM/p1| title= Connecticut Deaths and Burials record|deadurl= yes| website= familysearch.org}}{{dead link|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after only three months married to Amy, Michael died.&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt;  The official cause of death was "acute bilious attack" (in other words, [[Indigestion|severe indigestion]]).&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt; Amy was once again financially secure because during their short marriage her new husband had drawn up a [[will (law)|will]] which left his entire estate to her. The will would later be determined a [[forgery]] as it was apparently written in handwriting matching Amy Archer-Gilligan.&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt;

==Murders==
Between 1907 and 1917, there were 60 deaths in the Archer Home. Relatives of her clients grew suspicious as they tallied the large number of deaths. Only 12 residents died between 1907 and 1910, but 48 residents died between 1911 and 1916. Among them was Franklin R. Andrews, an apparently healthy man. On the morning of May 29, 1914, Andrews was doing some gardening in the Archer house. His robust physical condition deteriorated in a single day and he was dead by evening. The official cause of death was [[Peptic ulcer|gastric ulcer]].

After Andrews' siblings (including Nellie Pierce) came into possession of some of his letters, they noted occasions where Amy Archer-Gilligan was pressing their brother for money.&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt; Amy's clients showed a pattern of dying not long after giving her a large sum of money.

As the deaths continued, Nellie Pierce reported her suspicions to the local [[district attorney]], but he mostly ignored her.&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt; So she took her story to ''[[The Hartford Courant]]''. On May 9, 1916, the first of several articles on the "Murder Factory" was published.&lt;ref name= factory&gt;{{cite news| url= | title= Police Believe Archer Home for Aged a Murder Factory | work= The Hartford Courant| date= May 9, 1916| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, the police started to seriously investigate the case. The investigation took almost a year to complete.

The bodies of Gilligan, Andrews, and three other boarders were exhumed. All five had died of poisoning, either [[arsenic]] or [[strychnine]]. Local merchants were able to testify that Amy had been purchasing large quantities of arsenic, supposedly to "kill rats". A look into Gilligan's will established that it was actually a forgery written by Amy.&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt;

According to [[M. William Phelps]], author of ''The Devil's Rooming House'', investigation appeared to show that Amy was buying the arsenic to kill large numbers of rats. However, it appears that she did not buy all of the arsenic which killed her patients. The doctor and some of the patients had signed off to purchase it. The investigation pursued Dr. King because more evidence was piling up against him, but suspicions were focused back on Amy when someone suggested to clearly check all records of arsenic purchases.

When evidence was found of Amy sending her patients to the drugstore to buy quantities of arsenic, the police were able to arrest and convict her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Phelps| first= M. William |year= 2010| title= The Devil's Rooming House| location= Guilford, Connecticut| publisher= Lyons Press| pages= 166–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trials ==
Archer-Gilligan was arrested and tried for murder, originally on five counts. Ultimately her lawyer managed to have the charges reduced to a single count, the murder of Franklin R. Andrews. On June 18, 1917, a jury found her guilty, and she was sentenced to death.

Archer-Gilligan appealed and was granted a new trial in 1919. At this trial, she pleaded [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Mary Archer testified that her mother was addicted to [[morphine]]. Archer-Gilligan was again found guilty of murder and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt;

== Death ==
In 1924, Archer-Gilligan was declared to be temporarily insane and was transferred to the [[Connecticut Valley Hospital|Connecticut Hospital for the Insane]] in Middletown, where she remained until her death on April 23, 1962.&lt;ref name= courant /&gt;&lt;ref name= aaol /&gt;

[[Pim Fortuyn]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician, was assassinated by [[Volkert van der Graaf]] in [[Hilversum]], [[North Holland]] on 6 May 2002, nine days before the [[Dutch general election, 2002|Dutch general election of 2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.elsevier.nl/web/1028847/Nieuws/Politiek/Kok-Fortuyn-had-verkiezingen-gewonnen.htm Kok: Fortuyn had verkiezingen gewonnen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2824/Politiek/article/detail/670503/2005/04/27/Kok-Fortuyn-had-beslist-gewonnen.dhtml Kok: Fortuyn had beslist gewonnen]&lt;/ref&gt;

On a few occasions, Fortuyn had expressed his fear of being murdered: after being [[Pieing|pied]] at the official release of his book ''[[De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villamedia.nl/journalist/n/dossiers/fortuynmediadag.shtm |title=De Journalist |publisher=Villamedia.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, most notably, on the talk show ''[[Jensen!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrkdiEKLIU |title=Fortuyn te gast bij Jensen |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-09-15 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
Fortuyn was 54 years old when he was assassinated by [[Volkert van der Graaf]] in a car park outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview to [[Ruud de Wild]] at [[3FM]]. The attacker was pursued by Fortuyn's driver, [[Hans Smolders]], and was arrested shortly afterwards while still in possession of the handgun used to assassinate Fortuyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-farright-leader-shot-dead-650464.html|title=Dutch far-right leader shot dead|work=The Independent|date=7 May 2002|accessdate=13 June 2010|location=London|first=Isobel|last=Conway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbE-f10b__I Moord op Pim Fortuyn] ''YouTube'', original [[RTL Nieuws]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as "Volkert van der G.", in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on websites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.

The details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.

Van der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally; a semi-automatic [[Star Firestar M43]] pistol in a café in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon.
On the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work.

He had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.
Fortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away, or that a bullet would mistakenly hit somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than 1.5 metres from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.
Running away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arms length at Smolders. He had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a petrol station, Van der Graaf gave up when police pointed their pistols at him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbbiKz-fU8c A Democracy In Shock], ''YouTube'', documentary about the murder of Pim Fortuyn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The assassination shocked many in the Netherlands and exposed cultural clashes within the country. Riots broke out on the [[Binnenhof]] on the evening following the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/16-05-2002/boetes-na-rellen-pim-fortuyn |title=Boetes na rellen Pim Fortuyn |trans-title=Fines after Pim Fortuyn riots |date=16 May 2002 |website=RTV Rijnmond}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians from all political parties suspended campaigning, but the elections were not postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simons |first=Marlise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/08/world/elections-to-proceed-in-the-netherlands-despite-killing.html |title=Elections to Proceed in the Netherlands, Despite Killing |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-05-08 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Law of the Netherlands|Dutch law]], it was not possible to modify the ballots, so Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. Pim Fortuyn List went on to make an unprecedented debut in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). This success was short-lived. In the elections the following year, Pim Fortuyn seats dropped to eight. After the 2006 elections, the party had no seats in the House of Representatives.

On 15 April 2003, [[Volkert van der Graaf]] was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison.&lt;ref name="sentencing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Andrew|title='Light' sentence enrages Fortuyn's followers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/16/andrewosborn|accessdate=6 May 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on [[parole]] in May 2014 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system.&lt;ref name="parole"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pim Fortuyn: Politician's Killer Is Freed Early|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1253915/pim-fortuyn-politicians-killer-is-freed-early|accessdate=6 May 2016|work=[[Sky News]]|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pim Fortuyn is credited with changing the Dutch political landscape and culture with his ideology, which came to be known as Fortuynism. The 2002 elections were marked by large losses for the liberal [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and the social democratic [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]. Both parties replaced their leaders shortly after the election. The Pim Fortuyn List and the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] made significant gains. There have been others{{who|date=October 2013}} that speculate Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom may have played in favor of Pim Fortuyn List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simons |first=Marlise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/international/europe/07DUTC.html |title=Rightist in Netherlands Is Slain, and the Nation Is Stunned |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-05-07 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition cabinet which formed after the election of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], Pim Fortuyn List and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy fell after three months, due to conflicts between Pim Fortuyn List members. In the following elections, the Pim Fortuyn List returned eight seats in the House of Representatives (out of 150) and did not form part of the new government. However, political commentators{{who|date=October 2013}} speculated{{vague|date=October 2013}} that there was still a sizable number of discontented voters who might have voted for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was available. In recent times, the right-wing [[Party for Freedom]], which has a strong stance on immigration and integration, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and 24 in the 2010 elections.

In a 2004 TV show election, Fortuyn was chosen as [[De Grootste Nederlander]] ("Greatest Dutchman of All Time"), followed by [[William the Silent]], the leader of the war for independence that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands. The validity of this election, where votes were cast online and over the phone, was questioned and dismissed as being easily influenced by Fortuyn's supporters. The murder of film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] for comments critical of Islam had occurred a few days before the election and many votes for Fortuyn were attributed to this event.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} It later turned out that William the Silent had received more votes, many of which were not counted before Fortuyn was declared the winner, due to technical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Artikel/175018/Pim-Fortuyn-Erfenis.htm Pim Fortuyn: Erfenis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153806/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Artikel/175018/Pim-Fortuyn-Erfenis.htm |date=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Fortuyn's death, the Netherlands' right-wing politicians, including former Minister for Integration and Immigration [[Rita Verdonk]] and [[Geert Wilders]], increased in profile and prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.ekudos.nl/artikel/37762/verdonk_en_wilders_strijden_om_nalatenschap_pim_fortuyn Verdonk en Wilders strijden om nalatenschap Pim Fortuyn]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bias based on handedness''' is bias or design that is usually unfavorable against people who are [[Handedness|left-handed]]. Part of this is due to design in the world which is often right-hand biased. Handwriting is one of the biggest sources of actual disadvantage for left-handed people, other than for those forced to work with certain machinery. About ten percent of the world's population is left-handed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hardyck C, Petrinovich LF |title=Left-handedness |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=385–404 |year=1977 |pmid=859955|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.84.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet many common articles are designed for efficient use by right-handed people, and may be inconvenient, painful, or even dangerous for left-handed people to use.  These may include school desks, kitchen implements, and tools ranging from simple [[scissors]] to hazardous machinery such as [[Saw#Mechanically powered saws|power saws]].&lt;ref name="tools" /&gt;

Beyond being inherently disadvantaged by a right-handed bias in the design of tools, left-handed people have been subjected to deliberate discrimination and discouragement.  In certain societies, they may be considered unlucky or even malicious by the right-handed majority. Many languages still contain references to left-handedness to convey awkwardness, dishonesty, stupidity, or other undesirable qualities.  Even in relatively advanced societies, left-handed people were historically (and in some cases still are) forced as children to use their right hands for tasks which they would naturally perform with the left, such as eating or writing.&lt;ref name="Susumu" /&gt;

==Favorable perceptions==
[[File:Inca lloque yupanqui.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Lloque Yupanqui]], the third [[Sapa Inca]], whose name means "the glorified lefthander"]]
Among [[Inca civilization|Incas]] left-handers were called (and now are called among the indigenous peoples of the [[Andes]]) ''lloq'e'' ({{lang-qu|lluq'i}}) which has positive value. Peoples of the Andes consider left-handers to possess special spiritual abilities, including [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[healing]].

The Third [[Sapa Inca]]—[[Lloque Yupanqui]]—was left-handed. His name, when translated from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], means "the glorified lefthander."

In the Chinese language, the character for "left", {{lang|zh|{{linktext|左}}}},  depicts a left hand attending to its work. In contrast, the character for "right", {{lang|zh|{{linktext|右}}}} (''yòu''), depicts a right hand in relation to the mouth, suggesting the act of eating.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In tantra [[Buddhism]], the left hand represents wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beer|first=Robert|title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs|year=2004|isbn=1-93247-610-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early Roman times, the left side retained a positive connotation, as the [[Augures]] proceeded from the eastern side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etimo.it/?term=sinistro|title=Sinistro|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative meaning was subsequently borrowed into Latin from Greek, and ever since in all Roman languages.

In Russian, "levsha" (lefty, lefthander) became a common noun for skilled craftsman, after the title character from "[[The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea]]" written in 1881 by [[Nikolai Leskov]].

==Unfavorable perceptions==
The unfavorable associations and connotations of the use of the left hand among cultures are varied. In some areas, in order to preserve cleanliness where sanitation was an issue, the right hand, as the dominant hand of most individuals, was used for eating, handling food, and social interactions. The left hand would then be used for personal hygiene, specifically after urination and defecation. These rules were imposed on all, no matter their dominant hand. Through these practices, the left hand became known as the "unclean" hand.&lt;ref name="Coren"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROYoKoUn1jUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA195|title=Left-handedness: behavioral implications and anomalies|first=Stanley|last=Coren|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers B.V|year=1990|isbn=0-444-88438-6|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, amongst Muslims and in some societies including [[Nepal]] and India it is still customary to use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating. The right hand is commonly known in contradistinction from the left, as the hand used for eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfMjhRAkn_kC|title=Islam: Questions and Answers – Manners (Part 1)|publisher=MSA Publication Ltd|location=London|oclc=58477120|isbn=1-86179-336-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film [[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|''Lawrence of Arabia'']] there is no insult taken when the guide offers his food to Lawrence and he takes it to his mouth with his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;The scene on the first day of travel to Feisal's camp.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many religions, including Christianity, the [[right hand of God]] is the favored hand. For example, Jesus sits at God's right side. God's left hand, however, is the hand of [[Divine judgment|judgement]]. The [[Archangel Gabriel]] is sometimes called "God's left hand", sits at God's left side, and is one of six [[Destroying angel (Bible)|angels of death]]. Those who fall from favor with God are sent to left, as described in Matthew 25: 32–33, in which sheep represent the righteous and goats represent the fallen: "And he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left." In 19th-century Europe, homosexuals were referred to as "left-handed".&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Dave|year=2007|title=The History of British Magick after Crowley|publisher=Hidden Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Protestant-majority parts of the United Kingdom, Catholics were called "left-footers", and vice versa in Catholic-majority parts of Ireland and [[Irish American|Irish America]].&lt;ref name="Dolan2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dolan|first=T.

Various innocuous activities and experiences become rude or even signs of bad luck when the left hand becomes involved. In some parts of [[Scotland]], it is considered bad luck to meet a left-handed person at the start of a journey.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEkLAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The right hand: left-handedness|first=Sir Daniel|last=Wilson|publisher=MacMillan and Co|year=1891|location=London|isbn=0-665-25982-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ghana]], pointing, gesturing, giving or receiving items with the left hand is considered taboo or rude. A person giving directions will put their left hand behind them and even physically strain to point with their right hand if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1075/gest.1.1.06kit|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/gest/2001/00000001/00000001/art00005|title=Pointing left in Ghana: How a taboo on the use of the left hand influences gestural practice|journal=Gesture|volume=1|issue=1|author1=Kita, S. |author2=Essegbey, J. |pages=73–95|year=2001|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Asian countries, holding eating utensils in the left hand is considered impolite.&lt;ref name="Binns" /&gt;

===Forced use of the right hand===
Due to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were encouraged or forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing left-handed child, including [[learning disorders]], [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orton|first=S.T|year=1937|title=Reading, writing, and speech problems in children|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=0-89079-179-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stuttering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1591462|title=THE PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE PRESCHOOL STUTTERER|first=Ruth|last=Lewis|publisher=Canad.

Successful shifters are more likely to become ambihanded than unsuccessful ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Porac |first1=C |last2=Buller |first2=T |title=Overt attempts to change hand preference: a study of group and individual characteristics. |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=512–21 |year=1990 |pmid=2292088 |doi=10.1037/h0084268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversions can be successful with consistent daily practice in a variety of manual activities, but though activity in the non-dominant left-hemisphere of the brain will increase during tasks, so too will activity in the dominant right-hemisphere. Consistent left-handers have no higher activity in these task centers than converted left-handers, so it may be inferred that "attempts to switch handedness by educational training far from weakening the functional expression of lefthandedness in higher-order motor areas of the (dominant) right hemisphere in fact enhance it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kloppel |first1=S. |last2=Vongerichten |first2=A. |last3=Eimeren |first3=T. v. |last4=Frackowiak |first4=R.

Many Asian countries encourage or force their children to become right-handed due to cultural perceptions of bad luck associated with the left hand. In India and Indonesia, it is considered rude to eat with the left hand.&lt;ref name="Binns" /&gt; In a 2007 study in [[Taiwan]], about 59.3% of children studied had been forced to convert from left-handedness to right-handedness. The study took into account economic status of the children's families and found that children whose parents had less education were more likely to be forced to convert. Even among children whose parents had higher levels of education, the conversion rate was 45.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meng |first1=LF |title=The rate of handedness conversion and related factors in left-handed children. |journal=Laterality |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17365629 |doi=10.1080/13576500601005727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among naturally left-handed Japanese senior high school students, only 0.7% and 1.7% of individuals used their left hand for writing and eating, respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shimizu A, Endo M|lastauthoramp=yes |year=1983|title=Handedness and familial sinistrality in a Japanese student population|journal=Cortex|volume=19|issue=2|pages=265–272|pmid=6884043|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(83)80020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though young Japanese are more likely to convert to using chopsticks right-handed than forks or spoons (29.3% to 4.6%). The proportion of females subjected to forced conversion is significantly higher compared to males (95.1% to 81.0%).&lt;ref name="Susumu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sato |first1=Susumu |last2=Demura |first2=Shinichi |last3=Sugano |first3=Noriaki |last4=Mikami |first4=Hajime |last5=Ohuchi |first5=Tetsuhiko |title=Characteristics of Handedness in Japanese Adults: Influence of Left-handed Relatives and Forced Conversion |journal=International Journal of Sport and Health Science |volume=6 |pages=113–9 |year=2008 |doi=10.5432/ijshs.IJSHS20070298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western countries{{which|date=December 2014}} have also attempted to convert left-handed children due to cultural, social and religious biases. Schools{{where?|date=December 2014}} tend to urge children to use their right hands, sometimes against the wishes of the child's parents. In America{{when|date=December 2014}} some students have been [[school corporal punishment|physically punished]] for writing with their left hands (though nowadays left-handedness is more widely accepted):&lt;ref name="Binns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060321_left_hand.html|title=What Makes a Lefty: Myths and Mysteries Persist|first=Corey|last=Binns|publisher=Live Science|date=March 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I was educated in the USA in Catholic school in the 60s. My left hand was beaten until it was swollen, so I would use my right right [sic] hand" ... "I had a teacher who would smack my left hand with a yardstick every time she caught me writing with my left hand" ... "My fourth grade teacher [...] would force me to use my right hand to perform all of my school work. If she caught me using my left hand, I was hit in the head with a dictionary.

[[Malawi]]ans cite their views that "the left hand is less skilled and less powerful than the right one" as main reasons for forcing left-handers to convert. Among students, teachers and parents, 75% said the left hand should not be used to perform habitual activities, and 87.6% of these believed left-handers should be forced to switch dominant hands. Parents and close relatives are most responsible for impressing these beliefs upon their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zverev |first1=YP |title=Cultural and environmental pressure against left-hand preference in urban and semi-urban Malawi. |journal=Brain and cognition |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=295–303 |year=2006 |pmid=16481084 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2005.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise in acceptance of left-handedness===

On March 8, 1971, ''The Florence Times—Tri-Cities Daily'' reported that left-handed people "are becoming increasingly accepted and enabled to find their right (or left) place in the world."&lt;ref name=Dawns&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=New Day Dawns For Southpaws |work=[[TimesDaily|The Florence Times—Tri-Cities Daily]] |date=March 8, 1971 |accessdate=June 22, 2018 |page=4 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19710308&amp;id=-gAsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3McEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=739,1203077}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Florence Times—Tri-Cities Daily'' also wrote "we still have a long way to go before the last vestiges of discrimination against left-handedness are uprooted, however."&lt;ref name=Dawns /&gt; The frequency of left-handed writing in the United States, which was only 2.1 percent in 1932, had risen to over 11 percent by 1972.&lt;ref name=Restak /&gt; According to an article by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' from August 13, 1979, a psychologist from University of Chicago named Jerre Levy said: "In 1939, 2 percent of the population wrote with the left hand. By 1946, it was up to 7 1/2 percent. In 1968, 9 percent. By 1972, 12 percent. It's leveling off, and I expect the real number of left-handers will turn out to be about 14 percent."&lt;ref name=OtherHand&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/08/13/on-the-other-hand-consider-whos-left/6c2c854c-42eb-44fa-b4c8-f2a04a740049/ |title=On the Other Hand, Consider Who's Left |work=[[The Washington Post]] |last=Tracy |first=Lisa |date=August 13, 1979 |accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article by ''The Washington Post'' from August 13, 1979, "a University of Michigan study points out that left-handers may not be taking over the world but...7 percent of the men and 6 percent of the women over 40 who were interviewed were lefties, but the percentages jumped to well above 10 percent in the 18-to-39 age group."&lt;ref name=OtherHand /&gt; According to the article by ''The Washington Post'' from August 13, 1979, Dr. Bernard McKenna of the National Education Association said: "There was recognition by medical authorities that left-handedness was normal and that tying the hand up in a child often caused stuttering."&lt;ref name=OtherHand /&gt; In Japan, Tokyo psychiatrist Soicki Hakozaki coped with such deep-seated discrimination against left-handed people that he wrote ''The World of Left-Handers''. Hakozaki reported finding situations in which women were afraid their husbands would divorce them for being left-handed.&lt;ref name=OtherHand /&gt; According to the article by ''The Washington Post'' from August 13, 1979, an official at the Japanese Embassy said: "Before the war, there was discrimination against left-handers," said the official at the Japanese Embassy. "Children were not trained to use their left hand while eating or writing. I used to throw a baseball left-handed, but my grandparents wanted me to throw right-handed. I can throw either way. Today, in some local areas, discrimination may still remain, but on the whole, it seems to be over. There are many left-handers in Japan."&lt;ref name=OtherHand /&gt; In an article by ''The Washington Post'' from December 11, 1988, Richard M. Restak wrote that left-handedness became more accepted and people decided to leave southpaws alone and decided to quit working against left-handedness.&lt;ref name=Restak&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1988/12/11/do-we-want-a-left-handed-president/1a6c49dc-0e40-4ea3-ab4b-e3956dc04208/ |title=Do We Want a Left-Handed President? |work=[[The Washington Post]] |last=Restak |first=Richard M. |date=December 11, 1988 |accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article by ''[[The Gadsden Times]]'' from October 3, 1993, the newspaper mentioned a 5-year-old named Daniel, writing: "the advantage that little Daniel does have of going to school in the '90s is that he will be allowed to be left-hander. That wasn't always the case in years past."&lt;ref name=Gadsden&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Southpaws tough it out in a right-handed world |work=[[The Gadsden Times]] |last=Pritchett |first=Leigh Bailey |date=October 3, 1993 |accessdate=June 22, 2018 |pages=D8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 survey, 24 percent of younger-generation left-handed people reported some attempts to switch their handedness.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book |title=The Left Stuff: How the Left-Handed Have Survived and Thrived in a Right-Handed World |publisher=Government Institutes |last=Roth |first=Melissa |date=July 25, 2005 |isbn=9781590771518 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the vast majority of the world population is right-handed, most everyday items are mass-produced for ease of use with the right hand. Tools, game equipment, musical instruments and other items must be specially ordered for left-handed use, if they are even produced and are usually more expensive than their right-handed counterparts.

===Household items===
Right-handed tools can be difficult, uncomfortable, or dangerous for left-handed people to use.

====Scissors====
For example [[Scissors#'Handed' scissors|(right-handed) scissors]] are arranged so that, in the right hand, fingers and thumb push the blades together laterally, creating the shearing action essential to scissors' utility. In the left hand, however, fingers and thumb tend to force right-handed blades apart, so that, rather than being sheared, the work-material is merely hacked, as by a knife, or slips between the blades uncut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xqbrm_left-handed-scissors-and-cutting_school|title=Lefthanded scissors explained|publisher=dailymotion.com (video)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-handers using right-handed scissors will often try to compensate by forcing the handles apart laterally, causing discomfort or injury to the first knuckle of the thumb.&lt;ref name=howscissors&gt;{{cite web|title=How Scissors are Left-Handed|url=http://www.anythinglefthanded.co.uk/acatalog/scissors-how-left-handed.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131030185511/http://www.anythinglefthanded.co.uk/acatalog/scissors-how-left-handed.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 October 2013|work=Anything Left-Handed|publisher=Anything Left-Handed Ltd.|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a right-handed person using right-handed scissors can easily see the cutting line, but for a left-handed user the upper blade obscures the view.&lt;ref name=Lefthandersday&gt;{{cite web|title=Left-Handed Products|url=http://www.lefthandersday.com/tour10.html|publisher=Lefthandersday.com|accessdate=30 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031013722/http://www.lefthandersday.com/tour10.html|archivedate=October 31, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scissors are offered as "ambidextrous" or "suitable for right- or left-handed use."  Typically, these are merely right-handed scissors with modified handles to permit use in the left hand with less discomfort, but because the blades are still arranged for right-handed use, they still won't perform quite as well in the left hand.&lt;ref name=Lefthandersday /&gt;

====Computer input devices====
Input devices for computers can present obstacles to left-handed operation if intended for right-handed use. Some computer set-ups have the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button —under the index finger of a right-handed person— is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15833/make-your-mouse-pointers-left-hand-friendly/|title=Make Your Mouse Pointers Left-hand Friendly|publisher=How-To Geek|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trackball]]s and [[trackpad]]s are often shaped for right-handed use. Even with the ability to change the functionality of buttons, these devices may be difficult for left-handed use. For a left handed person there are computer mice designed for left handed use, but they are a much smaller segment of the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ergonomicallyspeaking.net/best-left-handed-mouse/|title=Best Left Handed Mouse Rankings|publisher=Ergonomically Speaking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game controllers often have the action buttons on the right with the directional controls on the left. In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon. Certain systems' layouts, such as Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS, have games in which right-handed stylus use is assumed and can cause difficulty for left-handed players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/shigeru-miyamoto-hears-this-left-handed-gamers-pain-1592285438/ | title=Shigeru Miyamoto Hears this Left-Handed Gamer's Pain |publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trackman marble wheel.JPG|thumb|A right-handed trackball is difficult to use with the left hand.]]

====Knives====
While European-style [[kitchen knife|kitchen knives]] are usually symmetrical, [[Japanese kitchen knives]] have the cutting edge ground asymmetrically, having the cutting edge closer to the user's body{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} with ratios{{clarify|reason=The ratio between what?|date=February 2012}} ranging from 70–30 for the average chef's knife, to 90–10 for professional [[sushi]] chef knives; left-handed models are rare, and usually must be specially ordered or custom made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/business/23pursuits.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=How to Succeed at Knife-Sharpening Without Losing a Thumb|work=New York Times|date=September 23, 2006|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the majority of "flat ground" general-purpose knives typically have the cutting edge on the right, as with a left-handed knife, for aesthetic reasons rather than practical.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====Cameras====
One of the few cameras ever produced for left-handers was the half-frame [[Yashica]] Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Musical instruments===
Left-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed [[string instrument]]s are produced, including [[guitar]]s and [[violin]]s. Inverted [[trumpet]]s are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The [[French horn]], for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed [[drum]]mers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] on the right, bass pedal under left foot, [[ride cymbal]] to the drummer's left, etc.).

===Sports===
A left-handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context. It is widely accepted that the term originated in the United States, in the game of [[baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightbeat.com/article_detail.php?AT=57|title=Southpaws: Doing It Right the Wrong Way|publisher=fightbeat.com|accessdate=August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324215110/http://www.fightbeat.com/article_detail.php?AT=57|archivedate=March 24, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ballpark]]s are often designed so that batters are facing east, so that the afternoon or evening sun does not shine in their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Rules of Major League Baseball, Section 1.04|publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that left-handed [[pitchers]] are throwing with their south-side arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olmert|first=Michael|year=1996|title=Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History|page=108|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' lists a non-baseball citation for "south paw", meaning a punch with the left hand, as early as 1848,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Evan|year=1995|url=http://www.word-detective.com/093098.html|title=Word detective research|accessdate=June 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060628213442/http://www.word-detective.com/093098.html| archivedate= June 28, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; just three years after the first organized baseball game, with the note "(orig. U.S., in Baseball)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition for "southpaw"|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness.

In baseball, due to the direction in which [[curveball]]s and [[slider]]s break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a [[left-handed specialist]] pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the counterclockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness.

Left-handed [[Bowler (ten-pin)|bowlers]] are usually at an advantage during [[ten-pin bowling]] competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers.

In [[boxing]], someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a [[southpaw stance]]. Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage. [[Manny Pacquiao]] is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series ''[[Rocky]]'', the main character [[Rocky Balboa]] is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage.

Fencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Although commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.

The game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one-handed players. Professional golfer [[Phil Mickelson]] plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/r/?/00/18/10/media|title=Personal section of PGA Tour official media guide|publisher=PGA Tour|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092928/http://www.pgatour.com/players/r/?%2F00%2F18%2F10%2Fmedia|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left-handed tennis players include [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Marcelo Ríos]], [[Goran Ivanišević]]  and [[Rafael Nadal]].

Often the [[Playing card|playing cards]] have their [[Pip (counting)|pips]] printed only in the upper left corner assuming holding them with right hand. Such design may be uncomfortable for left-handed people who may prefer all four corners of the card to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leftyslefthanded.com/Lefty_s_Left_Handed_Playing_Cards_p/607414.htm|title=Lefty's "Always right" double deck of playing cards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/craigertiger/sinister-deck-the-left-handed-card-deck-with-famou|title=Sinister Deck: The Left-Handed Card Deck With Famous Lefties|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons===
[[File:US Navy 071019-N-6552M-190 SEAL trainees scan the room for possible threats as part of a SEAL qualification training exercise.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEALs]] left-handed shooter]]
The vast majority of [[firearm]]s are designed for right-handed shooters, with the operating handle, magazine release, or safety mechanisms set up for manipulation by the right hand, and fired cartridge cases ejected to the right. Also, scopes and sights may be mounted in such a way as to require the shooter to place the rifle against the right shoulder. A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left-handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or "natural"). A related issue is [[ocular dominance]], due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a rule in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun.

Some modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch P7]]), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36]] and [[Steyr AUG]]). [[Bullpup]] rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the [[FN F2000]] and the [[Kel-Tec RFB]]. The British [[SA80|L85 Assault Rifle]] must be fired right-handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the [[Steyr AUG]] is of a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The [[M16 rifle|M-16]] and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional (i.e. not bullpup) design the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.

[[Lever action]] and [[pump action]] firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than [[bolt action]] weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye.

===Machinery===
[[Power tools]], machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations.&lt;ref name="tools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greathomeimprovements.com/Mar07_niche_theme/power-tools/finding-power-tools-for-left-handed-people.php|title=Finding Power Tools for Left Handed People|publisher=Great Home Improvements|accessdate=January 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123652/http://www.greathomeimprovements.com/Mar07_niche_theme/power-tools/finding-power-tools-for-left-handed-people.php|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Table saw]]s, whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On [[bandsaw]]s, the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.

Handheld [[circular saw]]s are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting. Tool manufacturer [[Porter-Cable]] produces a left-handed circular saw that can be purchased relatively inexpensively.&lt;ref name="tools" /&gt;

==Language==
Historically, the left side, and subsequently left-handedness, was considered negative. The word "left" itself derives from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] word ''lyft'', "weak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/hurley/Ling102web/mod5_Llearning/mod5docs/handedness.pdf|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111025105045/http://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/hurley/ling102web/mod5_Llearning/mod5docs/handedness.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-10-25|title=Encyclopedia of Childhood and Adolescence|first=Zoran|last=Minderovic|publisher=Gale Research|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Greek]] both words meaning "left" were [[euphemism]]s: the word [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29ristero%2Fs ἀριστερός], ''aristerós'' (the standard word in [[Modern Greek]] as well) is derived from ἂριστος, ''áristos'', "best", and the word [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=eu%29w%2Fnumos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=eu%29w%2Fnumos0&amp;prior=a%29/ristos&amp;d=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a%29ristero/s&amp;i=1#lexicon εὺώνυμος], ''euōnymos'', "of good name", is another [[euphemism]] used in lieu of "ill-named".  The [[Latin language|Latin]] adjective ''sinister/sinistra/sinistrum'' originally meant "left" but took on meanings of "evil" or "unlucky" by the [[Classical Latin]] era, and this double meaning survives in [[Romance languages|European derivatives of Latin]], and in the English word "sinister". Alternatively, ''sinister'' comes from the Latin word ''sinus'' meaning "pocket": a traditional Roman [[toga]] had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is ''dexter'', as in "dexterity", meaning manual skill. Even the word "[[ambidexterity]]" reflects the [[bias]]. Its intended meaning is "skillful on both sides". However, since it keeps the Latin root ''dexter'', which means "right", it ends up conveying the idea of being "right-handed on both sides". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known [[antonym]] "ambisinistrous", which means "left-handed [''i.e.'', clumsy] on both sides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=ambisinistrous|title=Ambisinistrous|publisher=YourDictionary.com|accessdate=November 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more technical contexts, "sinistral" may be used in place of "left-handed" and "sinistrality" in place of "left-handedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=sinistral|title=Sinistral|publisher=YourDictionary.com|accessdate=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both [[Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], [[auspice]]s (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or ''[[augur]]'') were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the [[Amarna correspondence]], in which a king of [[Alashiya]], i.e. [[Cyprus]], requests an eagle-diviner from the [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt).

Meanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper", and also stands for authority and justice.

In Sanskrit, the word "वाम" (waama)
stands for both "left" and "wicked."
 
In most [[Slavic language]]s the root ''prav'' (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word ''левый (levyĭ)'' "left" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word ''prawo'' means "right" as well as "law", ''prawy'' means: lawful; the word ''lewy'' means "left" (opposite of right), and colloquially "illegal" (opposite of legal).

In French, ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'') means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right", while ''gauche'' means "left" and is also a synonym of ''maladroit'', literally "not right", meaning "clumsy". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term ''diestro'' and the Italian term ''destro'' mean both "right-handed" and "skillful". The contemporary Italian word ''sinistra'' has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being ''sinistro''), and ''maldestro'' means "clumsy". The Spanish ''siniestra'' has both, too, although the "left" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by ''izquierda'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etimologias.dechile.net/?izquierda|title=Etimología de izquierda|publisher=deChile.com|accessdate=June 2006|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060619201838/http://etimologias.dechile.net/?izquierda| archivedate= June 19, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well. In some Spanish-speaking countries, to do something ''por izquierda'' means to engage in corrupt conduct or employ illegitimate means, whereas ''por derecha'' or ''a derechas'' means to do it the right (legitimate) way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=1295427|title=Word Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Spanish, to tell someone "Eres tan zurdo" means that they are being clumsy, though the literal meaning is "You're so lefty." In Portuguese, the most common word for left-handed person, ''canhoto'', was once used to identify [[the devil]], and ''canhestro'', a related word, means "clumsy".

In Romanian ''drept/dreaptă'' (coming from Latin ''directus'') means both "right" and "straight". The word for "left" is ''stâng/stângă'' coming from Latin ''stancus'' (= ''stanticus'') meaning "tired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dexonline.ro/definitie/stanga|title=stanga - definiție - dexonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, ''recht'' means "right" in both the adjectival sense (correct) and the nominal (legal entitlement). The word for "left" is ''links'', and is closely related to both ''link'' (underhand, questionable), and ''linkisch'' (clumsy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=link|editor1-last=Clark|editor1-first=M.|title=Oxford German Dictionary|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954568-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Die Deutsche Sprache'', "link" (Berlin: Duden 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch words for "left" (''links, linker'') and "right" (''recht, rechts, rechter'') have much the same meanings and connotations as in English.  The adjective ''link'' means "cunning, shifty" or "risky". A ''linkerd'' is a "crafty devil".  To look at someone over the left shoulder (''iemand over de linkerschouder aanzien'') is to regard him or her as insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;W. Martin and G. A. J. Tops, eds., ''Van Dale groot woordenboek Nederlands-Engels'', 2d ed. (Utrecht, Antwerp: Van Dale, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Irish, ''deas'' means "right side" and "nice". ''Ciotóg'' is the left hand and is related to ''ciotach'' meaning "awkward";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/thekingdom/2003/07/24/story10018.asp|title=My Left Foot|publisher=The Kingdom|date=July 24, 2003|accessdate=June 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523133146/http://archives.tcm.ie/thekingdom/2003/07/24/story10018.asp|archivedate=May 23, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ciotógach'' (kyut-OH-goch) is the term for left-handed. In Welsh, the word ''chwith'' means "left", but can also mean "strange", "awkward", or "wrong". The Scots term for left-handedness is ''corrie fistit''. The term can be used to convey clumsiness.

In Finnish, the word ''oikea'' means both "right" (okay, correct) and "right" (the opposite of left).

In Swedish, ''att göra något med vänsterhanden'' (literally "to do something with your left hand") means "to do something badly". In Swedish, ''vänster'' means "left". The term ''vänsterprassel'' means "infidelity", "adultery" and "cheating". From this term the verb ''vänstra'' is derived.

In Hungarian, the word for right is ''jobb'', which also means "better". The word for left is ''bal'', which also means "bad". In Estonian, the word ''pahem'' stands for both "left" and "worse" and the word ''parem'' stands for both "right" and "better".

In Turkish, the word for right is ''sağ'', which means "alive". The word for left is ''sol'', which means "discolor", "die", "ill".

In Chinese culture, the adjective "left" ([[Chinese character]]: {{lang|zh|{{linktext|左}}}}, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: ''zuǒ'') sometimes means "improper" or "out of accord". For instance, the phrase "left path" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|左|道}}}}, ''zuǒdào'') stands for unorthodox or immoral means.

In Korean, the word for right is ''oreun'' (오른), to be compared to the word meaning morally proper, ''orheun'' (옳은) which shares the same pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=YBM, Korea|year=2002|title=Si-sa Elite Korean-English Dictionary|isbn=978-89-17-07460-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hebrew, as well as in other ancient [[Semitic language|Semitic]] and [[Mesopotamian]] languages, the term "left" was a symbol of power or custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffries|last=Hamilton|title=Social Justice and Deuteronomy: the Case of Deuteronomy 15|location=Atlanta|publisher=Scholar's Press|year=1992|page=145|isbn=1-55540-748-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also examples of left-handed assassins in the Old Testament (Ehud killing the Moabite king). The left hand symbolized the power to shame society, and was used as a metaphor for misfortune, [[natural evil]], or punishment from the gods. This metaphor survived ancient culture and was integrated into mainstream Christianity by early Catholic [[theologians]], such as [[Ambrose of Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ambrose of Milan: political letters and speeches / translated with an introduction and notes by J.H.W.G. Liebeschuetz|location=Liverpool, England|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-85323-829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to modern Protestant theologians, such as [[Karl Barth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rosemary Radford|last=Ruether|title=The Left Hand of God in the Theology of Karl Barth—Karl Barth as a Mythopoeic Theologian|work=The Journal of Religious Thought|year=1968–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute [[natural evil]] to God in explaining God's [[omnipotence]] over the universe.

===Expressions and colloquialisms===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
The left side is often associated with awkwardness and clumsiness. The Spanish expression "''tener dos pies izquierdos''", in English, the expression "to have two left feet", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression "''mieć dwie lewe ręce''", Dutch "''twee linkerhanden hebben''", German "''zwei linke Hände haben''", the Bulgarian expression "''dve levi ratse''", French "''avoir deux mains gauches''", Hungarian ''kétbalkezes'' and Czech "''Mít obě ruce levé''" all mean "to have two left hands"—that one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is "to be all thumbs". Moreover, the German idiom "''mit dem linken Fuß aufgestanden sein''", the Spanish expression "''levantarse con el pie izquierdo''", the French expression "''s'être levé du pied gauche''" and the Hungarian expression "''bal lábbal kelt fel''" (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression "to get up on the wrong side of the bed". The Welsh phrase "''tu chwith allan''" (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/~gpcwww/pdf/GPC0018-03.pdf |title=Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru |page=1735 |accessdate=2008-07-28|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, the use of the term ''nalyevo'' means "on the left", but can also connote taking bribes or "sneaky" behavior. ''Balszerencse'' (lit. "left luck") is Hungarian for "bad luck".

There are many [[colloquial]] terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. "southpaw" (USA).  Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, "cack-handed" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin ''cacare'', in reference to the habit of performing [[Washing|ablutions]] with the left hand, leaving the right hand "clean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cac1.htm|title=Cack-handed|publisher=world wide words}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cack-handed|title=Definition of "cack-handed"|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word ''keikr'', meaning "bent backwards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cack%20handed|title=Cack-handed|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australians frequently use "cacky-handed". A less common Australian slang word for a left-handed individual is the term ''Molly-Dooker'', whose origins cannot be determined with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|year=2003|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mol2.htm|publisher=World Wide Words|title=Mollydooker|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handwriting===
Left-handed people who speak [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hebrew]] or any other right-to-left script do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right-to-left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the [[Latin alphabet]] with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible [[Chinese language|Chinese characters]] with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right – and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Left-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper "forward slant" with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do [[calligraphy]] in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century [[copperplate script|copperplate]] hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.

==Civic life==

===Schooling===
As the majority of students in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for the right-handed, from [[pencil sharpener]]s to scissors to [[school desk|desks]]. The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all.&lt;ref name="flower"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/culture/article/left-over-left-out-left-behind/|title=Left Over, Left Out, Left Behind: The Daily Discrimination against Left-Handed Students|first=Mei|last=Flower|publisher=blog critics|date=July 28, 2005|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many classrooms and [[lecture hall]]s, desks are designed so that the writing surface is attached to the chair instead of separate from it. In this design, the desk is attached on the right side, offering an armrest for right-handed people to use while writing. In some of these desks, the writing surface does not extend fully to the left, necessitating a left-handed user to turn their body in order to write properly, sometimes causing back, neck and shoulder problems.&lt;ref name="flower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gaucheschool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/lspeak2.html#let'sfixit|title=Common school problems|publisher=gauche! Left-Handers in Society|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contorted posture may also cause the student to be accused of [[Academic dishonesty#Cheating|cheating]].&lt;ref name="gauchedesks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/lspeak2.html#desks|title=School desk plague|publisher=gauche! Left-Handers in Society|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101212091224/http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/lspeak2.html| archivedate= December 12, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, however, large lecture halls will use left-handed desks on the left-most column of each section so that left-handed people can comfortably write without bumping against a neighbor.

This right-handed bias is reflected in [[standardized test]]s as well. [[Multiple-choice]] tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers. The time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work.&lt;ref name="flower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gaucheschool" /&gt;

In [[Vietnam]], schools officially require students to write with their right hands, and some teachers of Grade 1 (when writing is taught) would implement that rule by deducting points from tests written by the left hand. The Civic Education textbook for grade 6 mentions a student thanking her old teacher for helping her write with her right hand, and stopping her from using her left hand to write.

===Employment===
In research done on the relations of handedness and employment, researchers may start their experiments believing left-handers earn lower wages than their right-handed counterparts, due to effects like difficulty using right-handed tools and increased rate of illness among left-handed people.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2147842|title=Sinister and Rich: The evidence that lefties earn more|first=Joel|last=Waldfogel|publisher=Slate|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=2010-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100112084036/http://www.slate.com/id/2147842| archivedate= January 12, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}} However, their findings are more complex. In studies in the United States and United Kingdom, it was found that left-handed men earn more than right-handed men; about 5% more in the UK. Conversely, left-handed women earn about 7.5% less than right-handed women.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/economics/research/papers/2004/WP04.22.pdf|title=The Economic Consequences of being Left-handed: Some Sinister Results|first1=Kevin|last1=Denny|first2=Vincent|last2=O’Sullivan|publisher=University College Dublin|date=July 2, 2004|accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Jake''' was a famous lobster caught off the coast of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] that was sold to Jeffrey Pyska of [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]] who requested a large lobster. Big Jake was a popular due to his large size and weight, at 25 pounds, to Pyska's customers. Big Jake was being sold for $212 and was handled to such an extent that he became sick and ill. It was later decided that the lobster would be shipped back to Boston to be rehabilitated, but upon arrival to [[Logan International Airport]], Big Jake was dying. The lobster was later flown back to Anchorage, where his owner is reported to have Jake [[taxidermied]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1984/01/11/page/9/article/jake-couldnt-take-lobster-shift|title=Jake couldn't take lobster shift|date=1984-01-11|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lobster gained even more popularity due to [[Associated Press]] stories throughout January 1984.

Various organizations of practicing [[chiropractor]]s have outlined formal codes of '''professional ethics'''. Actual practice has revealed a wide range of behaviors which may or may not conform to these standards.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Official positions ==

The [[American Chiropractic Association]] (ACA) has a "Code of Ethics"&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Staff|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=[[American Chiropractic Association]]|url=http://www.acatoday.org/content_css.cfm?CID=719}}&lt;/ref&gt; "based upon the acknowledgement that the social contract dictates the profession’s responsibilities to the patient, the public, and the profession; and upholds the fundamental principle that the paramount purpose of the chiropractic doctor's professional services shall be to benefit the patient." The smaller [[International Chiropractor's Association]] (ICA) also has a detailed set of professional canons.&lt;ref name="ICA"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Staff|title=ICA code of Ethics|publisher=[[International Chiropractor's Association]]|url=http://www.chiropractic.org/ica/ethics.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405120410/http://www.chiropractic.org/ica/ethics.htm|archivedate=2014-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reports of actual practice ==

Various situations have occurred in which the ethics of chiropractors and chiropractic organizations have been called into question.

A 2008 commentary proposed that the chiropractic profession actively regulate itself to combat abuse, fraud, and [[quackery]], which are more prevalent in chiropractic than in other health care professions, violating the [[social contract]] between patients and physicians.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt;

Gleberzon ''et al.'' identify "deliberate fraud" as a notably harmful element of the chiropractic profession, finding that dubious practice techniques can translate into "outlandish billing and utilization rates".&lt;ref name="Gleberzon2005"/&gt; Those at the "fringe of ethical behavior" present the profession with a challenge, they believe, and must be weeded out.&lt;ref name="Gleberzon2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brian J. |last1=Gleberzon |first2=Robert |last2=Cooperstein |first3=Stephen M. |last3=Perle |journal=Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |title=Can chiropractic survive its chimerical nature? |pmid=17549192 |pmc=1840015 |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of California disciplinary statistics during 1997–2000 reported 4.5 disciplinary actions per 1000 chiropractors per year, compared to 2.27 for medical doctors, and the incident rate for fraud was nine times greater among chiropractors (1.99 per 1000 chiropractors per year) than among medical doctors (0.20).&lt;ref name=Foreman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foreman SM, Stahl MJ |title=Chiropractors disciplined by a state chiropractic board and a comparison with disciplined medical physicians |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=472–7 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15389179 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2004.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, when asked how they would "rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields", chiropractic compared unfavorably with mainstream medicine. When chiropractic was rated, it "rated dead last amongst healthcare professions". While 84% of respondents considered nurses' ethics "very high" or "high," only 36% felt that way about chiropractors. Other healthcare professions ranged from 38% for psychiatrists, to 62% for dentists, 69% for medical doctors, 71% for veterinarians, and 73% for druggists or pharmacists.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18759966|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-16-10|url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/pdf/1746-1340-16-10.pdf|date=Aug 2008 |last1=Murphy |first1=DR |last2=Schneider |last3=Seaman |last4=Perle|last5=Nelson|title=How can chiropractic become a respected mainstream profession?

[[Gallup Poll]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the largest chiropractic associations in the U.S. and Canada were reported to have distributed patient brochures which contained unsubstantiated claims.&lt;ref name=Unsubstantiated&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grod JP, Sikorski D, Keating JC |title=Unsubstantiated claims in patient brochures from the largest state, provincial, and national chiropractic associations and research agencies |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=514–9 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11677551 |doi=10.1067/mmt.2001.118205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors, especially in America, have a reputation for unnecessarily treating patients.

Although in the vast majority of US States [[chiropractors]] are considered [[physicians]] pursuant to statute{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} (exceptions are ''inter alia'', [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]]). The Joint Commission recognizes chiropractors as physicians as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Joint Commission Perspectives|url=http://www.acatoday.org/content_css.cfm?CID=4038|title=The Joint Commission Now Recognizes Chiropractors as Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, like New Zealand, chiropractors appeared to have used the title 'doctor' in a New Zealand yellow pages telephone directory in a way that implied they are registered medical practitioners, when no evidence was presented it was true.&lt;ref name=Gilbey&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbey A |title=Use of inappropriate titles by New Zealand practitioners of acupuncture, chiropractic, and osteopathy |journal=N. Z. Med. J. |volume=121 |issue=1278 |pages=15–20 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18670471}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, chiropractors are allowed to use the title 'doctor' when it is qualified to show that the title refers to their chiropractic role. A representative from the NZ Chiropractic Board states that entries in the yellow pages under the heading of 'Chiropractors' fulfills this obligation when suitably qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bale K |title=Chiropractic Board New Zealand response to "Dr Who?" editorial |journal=N. Z. Med. J. |volume=121 |issue=1280 |pages=78–9 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18791634}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a chiropractor is not a registered medical practitioner, then the misuse of the title 'doctor' while working in healthcare will not comply with the [[Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003]].&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt;

UK chiropractic organizations and their members make numerous claims which are not supported by scientific evidence. Many chiropractors adhere to ideas which are against science and most seemingly violate important principles of ethical behaviour on a regular basis. The advice chiropractors gave to their patients is often misleading and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=UK chiropractic: regulated but unruly |journal=J Health Serv Res Policy |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=186–7 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19541879 |doi=10.1258/jhsrp.2009.008183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to the [[Simon Singh#Chiropractic lawsuit|libel suit filed by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) against Simon Singh]], has inspired the filing of formal complaints of false advertising against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period,&lt;ref name=withdraw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/06/chiropractic_group_advises_mem_1.html |title=The Great Beyond: Chiropractic group advises members to 'withdraw from the battleground' |publisher=Nature.com |author=Lucas Laursen |accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/06/chiropractic_complainers_ident.html |title=The Great Beyond: Complaints converge on chiropractors |publisher=Nature.com |author=Lucas Laursen |accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the McTimoney Chiropractic Association to write to its members advising them to remove leaflets that make claims about whiplash and colic from their practice, to be wary of new patients and telephone inquiries, and telling their members: "If you have a website, take it down NOW." and "Finally, we strongly suggest you do NOT discuss this with others, especially patients."&lt;ref name=withdraw/&gt; An editorial in ''Nature'' has suggested that the BCA may be trying to suppress debate and that this use of British libel law is a burden on the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unjust burdens of proof |journal=Nature|volume=459 |issue=7248 |page=751 |date=June 2009  |pmid=19516290|doi=10.1038/459751a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libel case ended with the BCA withdrawing its suit in 2010.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Case dropped against Simon Singh|author=Pallab Ghosh|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8621880.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark Henderson"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Times Online|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article7098157.ece|title=Science writer Simon Singh wins bitter libel battle|author=Mark Henderson|location=London|date=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capt. Christopher Levett''' (15 April 1586 – 1630) was an English writer, explorer and naval captain, born at [[York]], England.&lt;ref&gt;The Levett family from which Christopher Levett derived came from Bolton Percy, Yorkshire. But this York family shared a coat-of-arms with the Levetts of Normanton and High Melton, Yorkshire, sort of an early DNA assay, indicating that the two families had common roots. Christopher Levett's coat-of-arms appeared in an early survey of Sherborne, Dorset, where was residing.

Levett left behind a group of settlers at his Maine plantation in [[Casco Bay]], but they were never heard from again. Their fate is unknown. As a member of the [[Plymouth Council for New England]], Levett was named the Governor of Plymouth&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hs_28mtwTroC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=%22christopher+levet%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JxMXzlkB2q&amp;sig=g-Yjg9Xr6ktc26XBJL25hBlg2rc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fXS8SrGrFoKysgO_8azcBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levet%22&amp;f=false New-England's Memorial, Nathaniel Morton, William Bradford, Thomas Prince, Edward Winslow, Congregational Board of Publication, Boston, 1855]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1623 and a close adviser to Capt. [[Robert Gorges]] in his attempt to found an early English colony at [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], which also failed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uVIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22christopher+levite%22&amp;ei=rQu8SpCNAarakQSfqumTDw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levite%22&amp;f=false Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation, 1606–1646, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The length of Levett's service as Governor of Plymouth is unknown, but he returned to England the year following his appointment (1624), and during his time in New England seems to have been constantly on the move. Also unclear are what Levett's duties were as Governor of Plymouth, in which capacity he is referred to as the 'chief judicial officer,' with 'Esquire' appended to his name.[https://books.google.com/books?id=mqBdpS-IkbMC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22christopher+levet%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nqQ2MpkI2J&amp;sig=at5snaErmQQDiapeE7cwp1VPeY4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cXa8SrfkAY3QtAP46IG7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levet%22&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=QKETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA206&amp;lpg=RA1-PA206&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+governor+general+new+england&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=heCmIO6tJw&amp;sig=QVLXQAIB1bHLZUDVzDKsMAmxQO8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0Wu8So4qguqxA8aX4NwF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levett%22%20governor%20general%20new%20england&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=nH7-nOInwJgC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22christopher+levite%22&amp;ei=IBC8SouiPJ2slQSBmdnsDg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levite%22&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=mGcOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=levett&amp;lr=&amp;ei=gFG7SvjpOJnUkgSHvoGNDA#v=onepage&amp;q=levett&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=JD8OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+governor+general+new+england&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FkxJrhAKrd&amp;sig=LCGROgZ_U3-5QpQjGVe4BZMTmsU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KYm8SqisGYfUtgOxqvS6BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levett%22%20governor%20general%20new%20england&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=BA_jC9qnxzMC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=%22christopher+levitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=AYu8SuqFCZv8lATL0_X0Dg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levitt%22&amp;f=false] Governor [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] of the [[Plymouth Colony]] refers to the explorer as "Christoper Levite." Nathaniel Morton, Bradford's nephew and the colony's secretary, calls him "Christopher Levet." Record-keeping in the early days of the colony was sometimes sporadic.&lt;/ref&gt; Levett was also named an early governor of Virginia in 1628, according to Parliamentary records at [[Whitehall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BtEJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+virginia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bp2TFhjwVN&amp;sig=yND95fnJ1bluN-2mvdhwInFMHfA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1KS8SoyIGo2csgPUqYS7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levett%22%20virginia&amp;f=false Calendar of State Papers, Great Britain Public Record Office, Vol. 6, Colonial Series, William Noel Sainsbury, John William Fortescue, Cecil Headlam (eds.), Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[Levett]] was the son of Elizabeth and [[Percival Levett]], a York merchant and innkeeper, and was admitted a freeman of York as a merchant himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=48281 Xpoferus Levett, marcer, fil. Percivalli Levett, gent., Admissions to the freedom of York, Temp. James I (1603–1625), British History Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Levett was also admitted to the [[Merchant Adventurers' Hall|Company of Merchant Adventurers in the City of York]], along with his brother Percival.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |title=The Company of Merchant Adventurers in the City of York: Register of Admissions 1581–1835 |last=Smith|first=David M.|publisher=[[University of York]]|year=1996|place=York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTJVUxZuwxMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=levett+knaresborough&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XDHkTd-gAaLiiAL28tGXBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=levett%20knaresborough&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the English attempts to colonise North America caught Levett's interest even while a York merchant. Rev. [[Alexander Whitaker]], an early Anglican minister and English immigrant to the [[Virginia Colony]] made note in his will of 1610 that he owed a debt of some £5 to "Christopher Levite, a linen draper of the city of York."

Perhaps Levett's contact with Whitaker and other Englishmen stoked his zeal to become an explorer. Levett apparently grew restless, and instead turned his sights towards a career as an explorer. He served as His Majesty's Woodward of [[Somerset]]shire to King [[James I of England|James I]], and wrote a tract on [[logging|timber harvesting]] that became the standard for selection of trees for the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yETLcuNxk18C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=levett+dorsetshire&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xAJYagEOQB&amp;sig=TDVfgBYiBqsa7N8n_u2ZAgXmp9o&amp;hl=en Collections of the Maine Historical Society, Second Series, Vol. IV, Published by the Society, Portland, 1893]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, operating from his adopted home in [[Sherborne]], Dorset, in the shadow of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] and other adventurers, Levett became interested in the colonisation of [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bYohAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA8&amp;lpg=RA2-PA8&amp;dq=levett+sherburne+dorset&amp;source=web&amp;ots=yEhe5M1LoV&amp;sig=ysjRLQ1PPfbY9RfJyHx2UL9cTzc&amp;hl=en#PRA2-PA9,M1 Historical Addresses, James Baxter Phinney, 1831–1921, Portland, Maine]&lt;/ref&gt; Levett became associated with Sir [[Ferdinando Gorges]] and was appointed to the [[Plymouth Council for New England|Council for New England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nec7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA667&amp;lpg=PA667&amp;dq=%22his+majesty's+woodward%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xux5Nc9Htk&amp;sig=ZwNXPOawHYBH7s19tdEauJ6M1nM&amp;hl=en Provincial and State Papers, New Hampshire Colony Probate Court, 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} of land by King [[James I of England]] for a settlement in present-day [[Maine]], which Levett proposed to call "York" after his birth city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U2nDKCqyoYAC&amp;pg=PA605&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+sherborne&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Lt0bSZbOEI_gswObs4zbCA Forerunners and Competitors of the Pilgrims and Puritans Or, Narratives of Voyages Made by Persons Other Than the Pilgrims and Puritans of the Bay Colony to the Shores of New England During the First Quarter of the Seventeenth Century, 1601–1625, with Especial Reference to the Labors of Captain John Smith, Vol. 2, Charles Herbert Levermore, New England Society of Brooklyn, N.Y., Published by The Society, New York, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1623, records for the Council on New England say, "Christopher Levett to be a principal patentee; and to have a grant of {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} of land." The next month, on 26 June 1623, the records note "the King judges well of the undertaking in New England, and more particularly of a design of Christopher Levett, one of the Council for settling that plantation, to build a city and call it York."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h4Wy3OQQDioC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22capt+christopher+levett%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=H5fcbNR846&amp;sig=y4CNFkGXNl_MscU01XkvjsKlR4U&amp;hl=en#PPA62,M1 History of Boothbay, Southport and Boothbay Harbor, Maine, 1623–1905, Francis Byron Greene, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; The King proclaimed that [[Anglican]] churches across England should take up collections to add Levett in his settlement attempts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zc2iPZ4jN2AC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=levett&amp;lr=&amp;ei=sTa7SrulL5CqkATa0cz4Dw#v=onepage&amp;q=levett&amp;f=false Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century, David Cressy, Cambridge University Press, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levett was helped with his settlement ambitions, according to some historians, thanks to a deepening friendship with [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], the favoured courtier who acted as advocate for the young Yorkshireman. Levett's alliance to a powerful patron probably accounted for Levett's move to Sherborne and his appointment in the Royal forest in Somersetshire, putting him closer to Gorges and other early adventurers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yETLcuNxk18C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=levett+sherborne+dorset&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xALRibJONJ&amp;sig=gX-fL_P0GQCW8f7WRBRRF3-WCdw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA174,M1 Christopher Levett: The First Owner of the Soil of Portland, James Phinney Baxter, read before the Maine Historical Society, 26 February 1891, Collections of the Maine Historical Society, Brown Thurston Company, Portland, Me., 1893]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 1623, [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] [[Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway|Lord Conway]] wrote to [[Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland|Lord Scrope]], President of the [[Council of the North]], urging him to assist Levett in his plan to settle a plantation in New England with a company of Yorkshiremen and found "a Citty and call it by the name of Yorke." Noted the historian Charles Herbert Levermore: "So the first New York that was planned for America was to be located in Portland harbor."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U2nDKCqyoYAC&amp;pg=PA605&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+sherborne&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Lt0bSZbOEI_gswObs4zbCA Forerunners and Competitors of the Pilgrims and Puritans: Or, Narratives of Voyages Made by Persons Other Than the Pilgrims and Puritans of the Bay Colony to the Shores of New England During the First Quarter of the Seventeenth Century, 1601–1625, with Especial Reference to the Labors of Captain John Smith, Vol. 2, Charles Herbert Levermore, New England Society of Brooklyn, N.Y., 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oblivious to the high-flying spiritual message of early Puritan founders of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], Sir Ferdinando Gorges, his partner John Mason and other merchant adventurers zeroed in on profit.&lt;ref&gt;Many historians point to the efforts of Gorges and Mason, as well as their fellow Council member Levett, as attempts to plant the [[Church of England]] on the northern border of the Puritan [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXNdcKf22YoC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22virginia+colony%22+levett&amp;ei=Y4kfSe-FAZHakASI6czADw]&lt;/ref&gt; From what we know of Levett, he seems more nuanced: his dealings with Native Americans seem solicitous, especially given the era, and his first wife was the daughter of a prominent Puritan rector.

Nevertheless, either out of an explorer's zeal or a businessman's gimlet eye, Levett forged ahead. To further his plans, the Naval captain embarked from England on a trip to explore the coast of New England, paying particular attention to present-day Maine and [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iucc3Hmio-UC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22capt+christopher+levett%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DAr6fJqKfE&amp;sig=KydRg_Cq9Pj4T1duwFsX9mB_J00&amp;hl=en The Isles of Shoals, John Scribner Jenness, 1873]&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to England, he wrote a book called "A Voyage into New England, Begun in 1623, and Ended in 1624, Performed by Christopher Levett, His Majesty's Woodward of Somersetshire, and One of the Council of New England."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/database/great_migration/L.asp#CHRISTOPHER_LEVETT New England Ancestors, New England Historic Genealogical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwKwEbZhv3cC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=%22a+voyage+into+new+england%22+levett&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UQCWNF5RD2&amp;sig=-i0t2SROIrUOLkSDt6Hob1bx1X8&amp;hl=en#PPA79,M1 Christopher Levett of York: The Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay, James Phinney Baxter, 1893]&lt;/ref&gt; It was Levett's hope to stir settlement in the New World, and he hoped as the principal patentee (and first settler) of present-day [[Portland, Maine]], to benefit financially from the arrangement.
[[Image:All Saints Pavement 3.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[All Saints' Church, Pavement, York]], baptism of Christopher Levett, 5 April 1586]]
On the surface, Capt. Levett seemed ideally placed to push such settlement. "When ''[[A Description of New England]]'' was published in London in 1616," write Charles and Samuella Shain of Capt. John Smith's book, "it was only a question of time before another enterprising spirit would arrive who would realize Captain John Smith's plans for founding a permanent settlement on the Maine coast.... Better placed socially and therefore politically than John Smith, Levett was also richer."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LB6jYtB3vlIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+%22john+smith%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=1VZ7182KhT&amp;sig=ZvQoQWOMwpLJtZ-vNeqyU8OSmDw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result The Maine Reader, Charles Shain, Samuella Shain, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levett apparently had his eye on New England's thriving fisheries, which English merchants had exploited for years. The naval captain reported to Gorges that with the region's best fishing in the winter months, settling a permanent colony would enable the merchant adventurers to double their profits, by enabling the ships to fish yearround.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nfDUSwHvQiUC&amp;pg=PA332&amp;dq=%22virginia+colony%22+christopher+levett&amp;lr=&amp;ei=oI4fSa2gE4_QkwS23JXhDw#PPA265,M1 Fish on Fridays: Feasting, Fasting, and the Discovery of the New World, Brian M. Fagan, Basic Books, 2006, SBN 0465022847]&lt;/ref&gt;

But despite his better connections, the tide of history was not in his favour. His salesmanship fell short. Public interest waned, as new settlements in Virginia and elsewhere took center stage. King Charles I's growing problems ate away at interest in colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3sQMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=levett+royal&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ftGgKXqhOp&amp;sig=1J1UKdYjMsNxSazkxuFTR7pLXH8&amp;hl=en Collections of the Maine Historical Society, Published by the Society, Portland, 1904]&lt;/ref&gt; The King's appeal for money in Yorkshire parishes to support the Levett scheme never yielded much. The gathering storm of Roundhead rebellion put Levett's benefactors under strain.

In the meantime Levett was assigned to more pressing matters in England. On 5 October 1625, Capt. Levett was at the helm of [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''Susan and Ellen'' as part of [[Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon|Lord Wimbledon]]'s fleet of 80 English and 16 Dutch vessels sailing against the Spanish fleet at [[Cadiz]]. The expedition, mounted by [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]] who pressured his subjects to fund it, was an abject failure, and the fleet returned to England in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwKwEbZhv3cC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22virginia+colony%22+christopher+levett&amp;lr=&amp;ei=1YofSf7xMZ-OkAS-mLD7Dw#PPA32,M1 Christopher Levett, of York, the Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay, James Phinney Baxter, The Gorges Society, Portland, Me., 1893]&lt;/ref&gt; Levett later complained bitterly of the experience, claiming that even as a [[Royal Navy]] captain, he'd been treated "no better than a meare slave" by those in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGcOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=levett&amp;lr=&amp;ei=gFG7SvjpOJnUkgSHvoGNDA#v=onepage&amp;q=levett&amp;f=false History of Plymouth Plantation, 1620n–1647, Vol. 1, William Bradford, Worthington Chauncey Ford (ed.), Massachusetts Historical Society, Published for the Society by Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levett never returned to Maine, and the small group of men he left behind in a stone house were never heard from again. Levett's patented lands eventually passed to a group of [[Plymouth]] merchants as Levett's attention was diverted to more pressing Naval matters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3LGHsjNVBUC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=sandys+levett&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8JBWrUj6Z6&amp;sig=CFyBj0GHwqTQ7BEya2EHIvS1tyQ&amp;hl=en Maine Pioneer Settlements, Herbert Milton Sylvester, W.B.

Levett's death, his wife Frances (Lottisham) Levett appealed to her good friend, the mother-in-law of [[John Winthrop the Younger]], for help in recovering her late husband's effects. Winthrop's father-in-law Henry Payner then wrote to Winthrop in Massachusetts, "sollicting him to call for [[John Endicott|Captayne Endicott]] and [[Roger Conant (Salem)|Mr. Conant]] to examine them aboute it, and to doe for her what he can to helpe her to right."[https://books.google.com/books?id=Unc5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=christopher+levet&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Yse1SqrnOYi0kATi1XQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christopher%20levet&amp;f=false]. Winthrop's father-in-law's letter, combined with the fact that Capt. Levett was carrying letters with him to England written by the colonists and critical of the English church, may indicate that Levett himself was experiencing a change of heart towards the ongoing conflict between the King and the Puritan cause.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FortLevett.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Fort Levett]] and Ram Island Ledge, [[Cushing Island, Maine]], 1909]]
[[Fort Levett]] on [[Cushing Island, Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;There is some question whether Levett's settlement was located on House Island or on nearby Cushing Island in Casco Bay. Historian James Phinney Baxter seems to suggest that Levett may have left his men behind on House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwKwEbZhv3cC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+%22house+island%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UQEUNx1VCW&amp;sig=NR_lNkz_2tbl7r6I8jppeDvGsIE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt; in Portland Harbor is named for this early explorer. Present-day [[York County, Maine]], derives its name from Capt. Levett's early appellation for his Maine settlement.

Even in death, Capt. Levett could not avoid the controversies roiling the age. Letters he carried aboard the vessel'' Porcupine'', addressed by John Winthrop and other leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to sympathetic friends in England, fell into the hands of Puritan foes in England, apparently after Levett's possessions were searched after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AxLVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22a+voyage+into+new+england%22+levet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uoSqN6sZkp&amp;sig=H8ciJMsFM53fRgANvfxQYFPvCaU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lVK0Som8DIH8tAPl1YTSDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20voyage%20into%20new%20england%22%20levet&amp;f=false The Winthrop Papers, Adam Winthrop, John Winthrop, Wait Still Winthrop, Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol. 1, Fifth Series, Published by the Society, Boston, Mass., 1871]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters stirred up some measure of controversy in England for the unfavorable stance the writers took toward the English church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ihFsfyXwYXoC&amp;pg=PA605&amp;lpg=PA605&amp;dq=%22christopher+levett%22+%22robert+more%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4iHEWbiB-Z&amp;sig=2dOuj6jqVzJAg2UDfZmZIvXZc1c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UmGzSuLeF5PWtgPyqaWeDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20levett%22%20%22robert%20more%22&amp;f=false Forerunners and Competitors of the Pilgrims and Puritans, Vol. 2, Charles Herbert Levermore, Reprinted by BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwKwEbZhv3cC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=%22john+endicott%22+christopher+levett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UQHUHC8YAY&amp;sig=qsu2xNXfG7V-wHIqC3d67AcatZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v1mzSrPiAoO0sgOBpvXRDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20endicott%22%20christopher%20levett&amp;f=false Christopher Levett of York: The Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay, James Phinney Baxter, Printed for the Gorges Society, Portland, Me., 1893]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The origins of DAH can be traced back to a 1955 study by [[Philip L. Townes]] and [[Johannes Holtfreter]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt; In this study Townes and Holtfreter placed the three [[germ layer]]s of an amphibian into an alkaline solution, allowing them to dissociate into individual cells, and mixed these different types of cells together. Cells of different species were used to be able to visually observe and follow their movements. Cells of similar types migrated to their correct location and reaggregated to form germ layers in their developmentally correct positions. This experiment demonstrated that tissue organization can occur independent of the path taken, implying that it is mediated by forces that are persistently present and doesn't arise solely from the chronological sequence of developmental events preceding it.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

From these results Holtfreter developed his concept of [[selective affinity]], and hypothesized that well-timed changes to selective affinity of cells to one another throughout development guided morphogenesis.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; Several hypotheses were introduced to explain these results including the "timing hypothesis" and the "differential surface contraction hypothesis".&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; In 1964 [[Malcolm Steinberg]] introduced the "differential adhesion hypothesis" which uses thermodynamic principles to describe and explain patterns of cell sorting and arrangement observed.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

==Overview==
According to DAH, cellular movement and [[Cell sorting|assortment]] is governed by the spontaneous rearrangement of cells—in much the same way as a liquid—to a more thermodynamically stable equilibrium. This is achieved by maximizing the amount of energy that is utilized adhering the cells together, which decreases the free energy available in the system. As cells with similar strengths of surface adhesion bond to one another, bonding energy in the overall system increases, and interfacial free energy decreases causing the system to be more thermodynamically stable. Liquids behave in a comparable manner, but with molecules moving around due to [[kinetic energy]] instead of motile cells moving around due to a combination of their kinetics and active movement.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

This allows examples of tissue arrangement to be corresponded to the behavior of liquids, such as one tissue spreading across another being corresponded to oil spreading across water; the oil spreads across the water to minimize weak oil-water interactions and maximize stronger water-water and oil-oil interactions, the cells similarly sort themselves to be near other cells of similar adhesive strength and bond with them.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; Other tissue interactions that DAH offers an explanation for includes tissue hierarchy, where tissues with weaker surface adhesion surround tissues with stronger surface adhesion, the rounding of irregular cell masses to become spherical, and the cell sorting and construction of anatomical structures that occurs independent of the path taken.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

DAH does not rely on qualitative differences in cell adhesion, only on quantitative differences in the strength of their surface adhesion.&lt;ref name=Forgacs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgacs|first=Gabor|author2=Foty, Ramsey A.|author3=Shafrir, Yinon|author4=Steinberg, Malcolm S.|title=Viscoelastic Properties of Living Embryonic Tissues: a Quantitative Study|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=May 1998|volume=74|issue=5|pages=2227–2234|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349598779329|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77932-9|bibcode=1998BpJ....74.2227F}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAH has been supported experimentally and by computational models.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

==Applications==
Since its original formulation in the context of vertebrate embryogenesis, DAH has been utilized to offer an explanation for several other morphogenic phenomena including [[wound healing]], and [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] in cancer progression and [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

A dispersal vector is an agent of [[biological dispersal]] that moves a dispersal unit, or [[organism]], away from its birth population to another location or population in which the individual will reproduce&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/causes-and-consequences-of-dispersal-in-plants-15927714|title=Causes and Consequences of Dispersal in Plants and Animals|last=Croteau|first=Emily K|date=2010|website=Nature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schurr2"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzu4SVKg1PcC&amp;pg=PA206|title=Fruit development and seed dispersal|author1=Frank M.

These dispersal units can range from pollen to seeds to fungi to entire organisms. 

There are two types of dispersal vector, those that are active and those that are passive. Active dispersal involves organisms that are capable of movement under their own energy. In passive dispersal, the organisms have evolved dispersal units, or propagules, that use the kinetic energy of the environment for movement. In plants, some dispersal units have tissue that assists with dispersal and are called "[[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]". Some dispersal is self-driven (autochory), such as using gravity (barochory), and does not rely on external vectors. Other types of dispersal are due to external vectors, which can be [[wiktionary:biotic|biotic]] vectors, such as animals (zoochory), or [[Abiotic component|abiotic vectors]], such as the wind (anemochory) or water (hydrochory).&lt;ref name="Schurr2" /&gt;

In many cases, organisms will be dispersed by more than one vector before reaching it's final destination. It is often a combination of two or more modes of dispersal that act together to maximize dispersal distance, such as wind blowing a seed into a nearby river, that will carry it farther down stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merritt|first=David M.|last2=Wohl|first2=Ellen E.|date=August 2002|title=PROCESSES GOVERNING HYDROCHORY ALONG RIVERS: HYDRAULICS, HYDROLOGY, AND DISPERSAL PHENOLOGY|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1071–1087|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1071:pgharh]2.0.co;2|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Main article:'' [[Seed dispersal]] 

Autochory is the dispersal of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]], which are dispersal units consisting of seeds or spores, using only the energy provided by the diaspore or the parent plant&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;. The plant of origin is the dispersal vector itself, instead of an external vector&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://definedterm.com/a/definition/183431|title=DefinedTerm: Autochory|work=Defined Term|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are four main types of autochory that act on [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]: ballochory, or violent ejection by the parent organism; blastochory, where a diaspore crawls along the ground using [[Stolon|stolons]]; barochory, the use of [[gravity]] for dispersal; and herpochory, crawling using hygroscopic hairs called [[Trichome|trichomes]] &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vegetation Ecology|last=|first=|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Van der Maarel|editor-first=Eddy|edition=2|location=UK|pages=168, 171, 173|editor-last2=Franklin|editor-first2=Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In some cases, ballochory can be more effective when utilizing a [[Diplochory|secondary dispersal vector]]&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;: ejecting the seeds in order for them to use wind or water for longer distance dispersal.   

== Animals (Zoochory) ==
Animal-mediated dispersal is called zoochory&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Zoochory can be further described by which animal is acting as a dispersal vector. Animals are an important dispersal vector because they provide the ability to transfer dispersal units longer distances than their parent organism can. The main groups include dispersal by [[Bird|birds]] (Ornithochory), dispersal by [[Ant|ants]] ([[Myrmecochory|Myrmekochory]]), dispersal by [[Mammal|mammals]] (Mammaliochory), dispersal by [[Amphibian|amphibians]] or [[Reptile|reptiles]], and dispersal by [[Insect|insects]], such as [[Bee|bees]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.   

Animals are also a large contributor to [[pollination]] via [[Zoophily]]. Flowering plants overwhelmingly are pollinated by animals, and while [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]] are involved in the majority of that pollination, birds and mammals also play a role&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150514-extraordinary-pollinators|title=Animals you might not know pollinate flowers|last=Douglass|first=Michelle|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

=== Ornithochory ===
[[File:Owl_Pellet_-_Flickr_-_gailhampshire.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Owl_Pellet_-_Flickr_-_gailhampshire.jpg|alt=|thumb|Barn owl pellets containing pouched mouse remains have been found to contain germinating seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=W. R. J.|last2=Milton|first2=Suzanne J.|date=1988|title=Dispersal of seeds by raptors|journal=African Journal of Ecology|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=173–176|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1988.tb00967.x|issn=0141-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Bird|Birds]] contribute to [[seed dispersal]] in several ways that are unique from general vectors. Birds often cache, or store, the seeds of trees and shrubs for later consumption; only some of these seeds are later recovered and eaten, so many of the seeds are able to utilize the behavior of seed caching to allow them to [[Germination|germinate]] away from the mother tree &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

Long-distance dispersal, which is rare for a parent plant to achieve alone, could be mediated by migratory movements of birds. Long-distance dispersal operates over spatial areas that span thousands of kilometers, which allow it to promote rapid range shifts and determine species distributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(16)30113-6|title=Migratory Birds as Global Dispersal Vectors|last=Viana|first=Duarte S.|date=July 5, 2016|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=31|issue=10|pages=763–775|archive-url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(16)30113-6|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2016.07.005|pmid=27507683|hdl=10261/138397}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In [[seed dispersal]], [[ingestion]] of seeds that are capable of resisting digestive juices allows the [[Seed|seeds]] to be scattered in [[feces]] and dispersed far from the parent organism&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. For these seeds, gut passage enhances [[germination]] ability when the seeds are ingested by [[Bird|birds]] and [[Mammal|mammals]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Finally, ingestion of [[Herbivore|herbivores]] by [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] animals may help disperse seeds by preying on primary seed dispersers such as herbivores or [[Omnivore|omnivores]] &lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;. When a bird is eaten by a cat or another carnivore, that animal will inadvertently consume the seeds that the prey species consumed. These seeds may then be later deposited in a process called [[diplochory]], where a seed is moved by more than one dispersal vector, which is important for seed dispersal outcomes as carnivores range widely and enhance the genetic connectivity of dispersed populations&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hämäläinen|first=Anni|last2=Broadley|first2=Kate|last3=Droghini|first3=Amanda|last4=Haines|first4=Jessica A.|last5=Lamb|first5=Clayton T.|last6=Boutin|first6=Stan|last7=Gilbert|first7=Sophie|date=2017-02|title=The ecological significance of secondary seed dispersal by carnivores|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e01685|doi=10.1002/ecs2.1685|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Birds act as dispersal vectors for non-seed dispersal units as well. Hummingbirds spread pollen on their beaks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linhart|first=Yan B.|date=1973|title=Ecological and Behavioral Determinants of Pollen Dispersal in Hummingbird- Pollinated Heliconia|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=107|issue=956|pages=511–523|jstor=2459823}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and fungal spores may stick to the bottom of birds’ feet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Raymond N.|last2=Prusso|first2=Don C.|date=1969|title=Spore Dispersal by Birds|journal=Mycologia|volume=61|issue=4|pages=832–835|doi=10.2307/3757475|jstor=3757475}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Water birds may also help to disperse aquatic invertebrates, specifically [[Brachiopod|branchiopods]], [[Ostracod|ostracods]], and [[Bryozoa|bryozoans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brochet|first=A.

=== [[Myrmecochory]] ===
''Main article:'' [[Myrmecochory]]

This includes all of the dispersal caused by [[Ant|ants]], including seed dispersal and the dispersal of leaf matter from trees.  

=== Mammaliochory ===
Similarly to birds, dispersal by [[Mammal|mammals]] allows for long distance dispersal, especially via carnivores. The act of carnivores eating primary dispersal vectors (herbivores) can lead to long distance dispersal and connection between different populations of the same species because of large predator ranges in comparison to smaller herbivore ranges&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Mammals have been shown to act as dispersal vectors for seeds, spores, and [[Parasitism|parasites]].

Just as in ornithocory, ingestion by herbivores acts as a dispersal vector for seeds, and gut passage increases the rate of [[germination]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anne Bråthen|first=Kari|last2=T.

Non-flying mammals have been identified as acting as pollinators in Australia, Africa, South and Central America. Some plants may have traits that coevolved to utilize mammals as dispersal vectors, such as being extremely pungent in odor, nocturnal nectar production, and robust flowers that can handle rough feeders &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;.

Mammals contribute to [[bryophyte]] and [[fern]] spore dispersal by carrying [[Spore|spores]] on their fur. Small mammals acting as dispersal vectors may have advantages for the dispersing organism compared to wind transport, as the mammals share similar [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] to the parent plant, while wind transport is random. Additionally, mammals can transport spores that have qualities such as low production and non-wind adapted morphology that wouldn't be conducive for wind transport&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;.

Once consumed, the eggs are spread to a new area via the defecation of small mounds of dung&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;. 

=== Dispersal by Amphibians or Reptiles ===
[[Frog|Frogs]] and [[Lizard|lizards]] have been found to be dispersal vectors for [[Crustacean|crustaceans]] and [[ring worms]], specifically [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliad]] [[Ostracod|ostracods]] (''Elpidium bromeliarum)'' and [[Annelid|annelids]] (''Dero superterrenus''). Annelids showed a strong chemical orientation towards moist frog skin that may have developed to diminish risk of dehydration during transport in the environment. The ostracods have frequently been found to be attached to frogs in order to colonize new areas&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;. Both ostracods and annelids will attach themselves to lizards as well, but they prefer to attach themselves to frogs.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez|first=Luiz Carlos Serramo|last2=Filizola|first2=Bruno|last3=Deiss|first3=Isabela|last4=Rios|first4=Ricardo Iglesias|date=2005|title=Phoretic Behaviour of Bromeliad Annelids (Dero) and Ostracods (Elpidium) using Frogs and Lizards as Dispersal Vectors|journal=Hydrobiologia|language=en|volume=549|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s10750-005-1701-4|issn=0018-8158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispersal by Invertebrates ===
''Main article:'' [[Pollination]] and [[Pollinator|Pollinators]]

One of the most important examples of dispersal via [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]] are pollinators such as bees, flies, wasps, beetles, and butterflies&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Invertebrates may also act as dispersal vectors for the spores of ferns and bryophytes via [[endozoochory]], or the ingestion of the plant&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;.

== Wind (Anemochory) ==
Anemochory is dispersal of units by wind.

=== Adaptive Morphology ===
Many species have evolved morphological adaptations to maximize wind dispersal potential. Common examples include plumed, winged, and balloon-like [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores.]]&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt;

Plumed diaspores have thin hair-like projections that allow easier wind uplift.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; One of the most common plumed species is the dandelion, ''Taraxacum officinale''. The wind dispersal potential of plumed species are directly correlated to the total mass and total surface area of the projected plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casseau|first=Vincent|last2=De Croon|first2=Guido|last3=Izzo|first3=Dario|last4=Pandolfi|first4=Camilla|date=2015-05-04|title=Morphologic and Aerodynamic Considerations Regarding the Plumed Seeds of Tragopogon pratensis and Their Implications for Seed Dispersal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418730/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0125040|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125040|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4418730|pmid=25938765}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Picea_abies_seeds_with_wings.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Picea_abies_seeds_with_wings.jpg|left|thumb|Winged seeds of the Norway spruce, ''Picea abies.'']]
Winged diaspores have fibrous tissue that develops on the wall of the seed and projects outward&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; . Seed wings are generally thought to co-evolve with the evolution of larger seeds, in order to increase dispersal and offset the weight of the larger seeds.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telenius|first=Anders|last2=Torstensson|first2=Peter|date=1991|title=Seed Wings in Relation to Seed Size in the Genus Spergularia|journal=Oikos|volume=61|issue=2|pages=216–222|doi=10.2307/3545339|jstor=3545339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common examples include [[pine]] and [[Spruce|spruce trees]].

Balloon-like seeds are a phenomenon where the [[calyx (botany)|calyx]], a kind of protective pouch or covering the plant uses to guard the seeds, is light and swollen.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; This ballon-like structure allows the entire pouch of seeds to be dispersed by gusts of wind.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; A common example of the balloon-like diaspore is the ''Trifolium fragiferum,'' or strawberry clover.

=== Human Effects on Anemochory ===
Wind dispersal of a particular species can also be affected by human actions.&lt;ref name=":162"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can affect anemochory in three major ways: habitat fragmentation, chemical runoff, and climate change.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; 

Clearing land for development and building roads through forests can lead to [[habitat fragmentation]]. [[Habitat fragmentation]] reduces the number and size of the effected populations, which reduces the amount of seeds that are dispersed.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt;This lowers the probability that dispersed seeds with germinate and take root.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt;

Chemical runoff from fertilizer, leakages of sewage, and carbon emissions from [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] can also lead to [[eutrophication]], a build up of nutrients that often leads to excess algae and non-native plant growth.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; Eutrophication can lead to decreased long distance dispersal because the lack of nutrients to native plants causes a decrease in seed release height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/03-0398|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the lowered release height, eutrophication can sometimes lead to an increase in short distance dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/03-0398|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change effects on wind patterns have the potential increase average wind velocity.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; However, it can also lead to lower levels of wind dispersal for each individual plant or organism because of the effects [[climate change]] has on the normal conditions needed for plant growth, such as temperature and rainfall.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt;

== Water (Hydrochory) ==
Hydrochory is dispersal using water, including oceans, rivers, streams, and rain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It affects many different dispersal units, such as seeds, [[Fern sports|fern spores]], [[zooplankton]], and [[plankton]].  

Terrestrial water sources tend to be more restricted in their ability to disperse units&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=L. M.|date=November 2011|title=Pushing the limits in marine species distribution modelling: lessons from the land present challenges and opportunities|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=20|issue=6|pages=789–802|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Barriers such as mountain ranges, farm land, and urban centers prevent the relatively free movement of dispersal units seen in open bodies of water&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. [[Oceanic dispersal]] can move individuals or reproductive propagules anywhere from a meter to hundreds of kilometers from the original point depending on the size of the individual&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

=== Marine Dispersal ===
''Related Article:'' [[Oceanic dispersal|Ocean dispersal]].

A majority of marine organisms utilize [[Ocean current|ocean currents]] and movement within the [[water column]] to reproduce&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaylord|first=Brian|date=May 2002|title=A physically based model of macroalgal spore dispersal in the wave and current-dominated nearshore|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=83|issue=5|pages=1239–1251|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Mark F.|date=2016|title=Multiple dispersal vectors drive range expansion in an invasive marine species|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=25|issue=20|pages=5001–5014|via=|pmid=27552100|doi=10.1111/mec.13817}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The process of releasing reproductive propagules into the water is called broadcast [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. While broadcast spawning requires parents to be relatively close to each other for fertilization, the fertilized [[zygote]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be moved extreme distances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobday|first=Alistair J.|date=2001|title=Over-exploitation of a broadcast spawning marine invertebrate: Decline of the white abalone|url=|journal=Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries|volume=10|pages=493–514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of marine invertebrates require ocean currents to connect their gametes once broadcast spawning has occurred &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morita|first=Masaya|date=May 2009|title=Ocean acidification reduces sperm flagellar motility in broadcast spawning reef invertebrates|url=|journal=Zygote|volume=18|pages=103–107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Kelp]], an important group of sea plants, primarily utilize ocean currents to distribute their spores and larvae&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Daniel C.|last2=Amsler|first2=Charles D.|last3=Ebeling|first3=Alfred W.|date=October 1992|title=Dispersal in kelps: Factors affecting spore swimming and competency|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=73|issue=5|pages=1577–1585|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Many coral species reproduce by releasing gametes into the water column with hopes that other local corals will also release gametes before these units are dispersed by ocean currents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Negri|first=A. P.|last2=Webster|first2=N. S.|last3=Hill|first3=R. T.|last4=Heyward|first4=A. J.|date=November 2001|title=Metamorphosis of broadcast spawning corals in response to bacteria isolated from crustose algae|url=|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=223|pages=121–131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some non-submerged aquatic plant species, like palm trees and mangroves, have developed fruits that float in sea water in order to utilize ocean currents as a form of dispersal&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathan|first=Ran|date=2008|title=Mechanisms of long-distance seed dispersal|url=|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=23|pages=638–647|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Coconuts have been found to travel up to thousands of miles away from their parent tree due to their [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] nature&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howe|first=Henry F.|last2=Smallwood|first2=Judith|date=1982|title=Ecology of Seed Dispersal|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=13|pages=201–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A variety of over 100 species of vascular plants utilize this dispersal method for their fruit&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  

Many plants have evolved with specific adaptations to maximize the distance that seeds, fruits, or propagules are dispersed in the ocean. For an increased protection against sinking in the [[water column]], seeds have developed hair or slime on their outer [[Seed-coat|seed coats]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Seeds with filled with air, cork, or oil are better prepared to float for farther distances&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

Another aspect of dispersal comes from wave and tidal action&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McMahon|first=Kathryn|date=November 2014|title=The movement ecology of seagrass|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=281|pages=1–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Organisms in shallower waters, such as seagrasses, become displaced and dispersed by waves crashing upon them and tides pulling them out into the open ocean&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Gary A.|date=January 2012|title=The central role of dispersal in the maintenance and persistence of seagrass populations|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=62|pages=56–65|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
[[File:Table iceberg west of Sjuøyane, Arctic ocean.jpg|thumb|An iceberg that may act as a raft for arctic invertebrates. ]]
Some smaller marine organisms maximize their own dispersal by attaching to a raft - a biotic or abiotic object that is being moved by the ocean’s currents&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winston|first=Judith E.|date=October 2012|title=Dispersal in marine organisms without a pelagic larval phase|url=|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=52|pages=447–457|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Biotic rafts can be floating seeds or fruits, leaves, or other propagules&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. Abiotic rafts are usually floating woods or plastics, including buoys and discarded trash&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;.  

[[Sea ice]] is also an important dispersal vector. Some arctic species rely on sea ice to disperse their eggs, like ''Daphnia pulex''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havel|first=John E.|last2=Shurin|first2=Jonathan B.|date=July 2004|title=Mechanisms, effects, and scales of dispersal in freshwater zooplankton|url=|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=49|pages=1229–1238|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Drifting, as discussed above, can be an effective dispersal vector for marine mammals. It has been shown that intertidal [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates will utilize sea ice as a raft to travel up to multiple kilometers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macfarlane|first=Colin B. A.|date=January 2013|title=Dispersal of marine benthic invertebrates through ice rafting|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=94|pages=250–256|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Freshwater Dispersal ===
Freshwater dispersal primarily occurs through flowing water transporting dispersal units&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Permanent aquatic environments require outside forms of dispersal to retain biodiversity, so hydrochory via freshwater is vital for the success of terrestrial water sources&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vanschoenwinkel|first=Bram|date=2008|title=Relative importance of different dispersal vectors for small aquatic invertebrates in a rock pool metacommunity|url=|journal=Ecography|volume=31|pages=567–577|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lakes remain genetically diverse thanks to rivers that connect lakes to new sources of biodiversity&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. In lakes that lack connecting rivers, some organisms have developed adaptations that utilize the wind, while in an aquatic environment, to disperse reproductive units&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Incagnone|first=Giulia|date=2015|title=How do freshwater organisms cross the "dry ocean"? A review on passive dispersal and colonization processes with a special focus on temporary ponds|url=|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=750|pages=103–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cases, the dispersal units are moved to new aquatic habitats by utilizing the wind instead of the water in their habitat. 
[[File:The Flowing River.jpg|thumb|Flowing rivers can act as dispersal vectors for plant matter and invertebrates. ]]
Running water is the only form of long distance dispersal present in freshwater sources, so rivers act as the main aquatic terrestrial dispersal vector&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battauz|first=Yamila S.|date=2017|title=Macrophytes as dispersal vectors of zooplankton resting stages in a subtropical riverine floodplain|url=|journal=Aquatic Ecology|volume=51|pages=191–201|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Like in marine ecosystems, organisms take advantage of flowing water via passive transport of drifting along on a raft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bilton|first=David T.|date=2001|title=Dispersal in freshwater invertebrates|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=32|pages=159–181|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The distance traveled by floating or drifting organisms and propagules is determined primarily on the amount of time that organism or unit is able to retain [[buoyancy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Melinda J.|last2=Walters|first2=Linda J.|date=November 2008|title=Water and boating activity as dispersal vectors for Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper) seeds in freshwater and estuarine habitats|url=|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|volume=31|pages=960–968|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. &amp;nbsp;

Freshwater is important for dispersal of non-aquatic terrestrial organisms as well. [[Bryophyte|Bryophytes]] require an external source of water in order to sexually reproduce. Some bryophytes also utilize falling rain drops to maximize their spore dispersal distances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundberg|first=Sebastian|date=January 2005|title=Larger capsules enhance short-range spore dispersal in Sphagnum, but what happens further away?|url=|journal=Oikos|volume=108|pages=115–124|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitt|first=B. D. L.|date=1987|title=Spore dispersal and plant disease gradients; a comparison between two empirical models|url=|journal=Journal of Phytopathology|volume=118|pages=227–242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Extreme Weather ===
Extreme weather events ([[Tropical cyclone|tropical cyclones]], floods and heavy rains, hurricanes, and thunderstorms) are the most intense examples of water functioning as a vector&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The high intensity and high volume of rain that comes with these events facilitate long distance dispersal&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. 

Overflow is traditionally a side effect of heavy rains impacting one specific area&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. Overflows have been shown to be effective in transmitting [[biodiversity]] between temporary lakes and ponds&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. The overflow of pool water acts as an important passive form of [[Seed dispersal|hydrochory]] in which water acts as a vector&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=L.|last2=Kolasa|first2=J.|date=2012|title=Linking local community structure to the dispersal of aquatic invertebrate species in a rock pool metacommunity|url=|journal=Community Ecology|volume=13|pages=203–212|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Floods displace plants and organisms, whether or not overflow occurs&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;. [[Macrophytes]] and organisms as small as [[zooplankton]] can be transported via flood pulses&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;.

Hurricanes can also act as dispersal vectors. After the 2004 [[Hurricane Charley]] struck Florida, there was a higher reported dispersal of the propagules of red mangrove trees&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proffitt|first=C. Edward|date=December 2006|title=Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) reproduction and seedling colonization after Hurricane Charley: Comparisons of Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay|url=|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|volume=29|pages=972–978|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If a hurricane strikes in the later summer months, there is an expected increase in the dispersal of propagules, while early storms can wash out immature propagules and decrease the dispersal of mature propagules for that season&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;.

When extreme weather events occur over an open body of water, they can create intense waves.&amp;nbsp; These waves can create large dispersal within the water column by changing local water movement, but tend to constrict the actual dispersal distance for smaller organisms&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. 

=== Human-Created Hydrochory ===
The [[fishing]] industry has introduced new forms in which water acts as a dispersal vector. The water in bait buckets transfers bait everywhere a fisherman takes it, and this can introduce non-native species into areas should this bait water be spilt&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. This idea is applied on a much larger scale to the ballast tanks of ships&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. A study done by James Carlton of Williams College reports that more than 3000 species are moving across the ocean in [[Ballast tank|ballast tanks]] on any given day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=James T.|date=1996|title=Pattern, process, and prediction in marine invasion ecology|url=|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=78|pages=97–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Artificial waterways created by humans have also spurred new forms of hydrochory. [[Amphipoda|Amphipods]] were found to be able to cross previously uncrossable areas to enter into new drainage pipe thanks to the construction of a canal&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;.

Artificial waterways not only connect communities that are geographically close, but they also allow for the transmission of invasive species from distant communities&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. The distribution of invasive species is, in part, regulated by local ocean conditions and currents&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. 

The introduction of human-generated waste, like wood planks and plastic bags, into water sources has increased the amount of viable rafts for dispersal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiessling|first=Tim|date=2015|title=Marine litter as habitat and dispersal vector|url=|journal=Marine Anthropogenic Litter|volume=|pages=141–181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Human Mediated Dispersal ==
Humans have been acting as dispersal vectors since we began moving around the planet, bringing non-native plants and animals with us. As trends in [[urbanization]] have increased, urban environments can act as staging grounds for species dispersal and invasion. Many non-native species exist in urban environments and the high rate of movement in an out of urban areas leads to a high level of dispersal to neighboring environments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von der Lippe|first=Moritz|date=Spring 2017|title=Do cities export biodiversity?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">The '''''dégradation nationale''''' ("National stripping of rank") was a sentence introduced in France after the [[Military history of France during World War II#Liberation of France|Liberation]].

'''Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)''' is a type of [[ischemic stroke]] with an unknown origin, defined as a non-[[Lacunar stroke|lacunar]] [[Cerebral infarction|brain infarct]] without proximal [[Artery|arterial]] [[stenosis]] or [[Emboly|cardioembolic]] sources.&lt;ref name="Hart et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart RG, Diener HC, Coutts SB, Easton JD, Granger CB, O'Donnell MJ, Sacco RL, Connolly SJ | title = Embolic strokes of undetermined source: the case for a new clinical construct | journal = The Lancet.

* Stroke detected by [[Computer tomography|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] that is not [[Lacunar stroke|lacunar]]
* No major-risk cardioembolic source of [[embolism]]
* Absence of extracranial or intracranial [[atherosclerosis]] causing 50% luminal stenosis in arteries supplying the area of [[ischaemia]]
* No other specific cause of stroke identified (e.g., [[arteritis]], [[dissection]], [[migraine]]/[[vasospasm]], [[drug misuse]])

== Causes ==
The following factors are suggested as [[pathogenesis]] of ESUS:&lt;ref name="Nouh et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nouh A, Hussain M, Mehta T, Yaghi S | title = Embolic Strokes of Unknown Source and Cryptogenic Stroke: Implications in Clinical Practice | journal = Frontiers in Neurology | volume = 7 | pages = 37 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27047443 | doi = 10.3389/fneur.2016.00037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Further [[Cardiopathy|cardiopathies]]: the risk of ischaemic stroke is increased by [[supraventricular tachycardia]]s. This also applies to patients with elevated [[NT-proBNP]] levels and patients with [[atrial enlargement]] in [[echocardiogram|cardiac ultrasound]].

[[Varicella zoster virus]]), [[thrombophilia]], [[cancer]]-related thrombosis, migraine, [[Fabry disease]] and other [[Genetic disorder|genetic]], [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] or [[Rheumatism|rheumatic]] causes.

== Diagnosis ==
ESUS is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] based on [[Radiology|radiological]] and [[Cardiology|cardiological]] examinations. For exclusion of haemorrhagic or lacunar strokes CT or MRI imaging is needed. Both procedures also allow detection of embolic pattern of ischemic lesions. 12-lead ECG and cardiac monitoring for at least 24 h with automated rhythm detection are mandated to exclude atrial fibrillation; echocardiography (TTE and/or TEE) is used to detect other major-risk cardioembolic sources (e.g., intracardiac thrombi, or [[ejection fraction]] &lt;30%). For imaging of both the extracranial and intracranial arteries supplying the area of brain ischaemia, examination methods like [[catheter]], MR/CT angiography or cervical duplex plus transcranial [[Doppler ultrasonography]] are required. They allow an exclusion of large vessel stenosis (≥ 50%).&lt;ref name="Hart et al. 2014" /&gt;

=== Cryptogenic stroke vs ESUS ===
Cryptogenic stroke is also an ischemic stroke with more than one probable cause or strokes with incomplete diagnostic workup.&lt;ref name="Adams et al. 1993" /&gt; ESUS has a clearer definition, with an established minimum diagnostic requirements; this is not required in defining a cryptogenic stroke. ESUS is an embolic stroke for which no probable cause can be identified after a standard diagnostic evaluation.

== Management ==
Due to the lack of data, there are no specific [[treatment guidelines]] for ESUS. Current guidelines recommend [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet therapy]] for patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((European Stroke Organisation (ESO) Executive Committee)), Kernan WN, Ovbiagele B, Black HR, Bravata DM, Chimowitz MI, Ezekowitz MD, Fang MC, Fisher M, Furie KL, Heck DV, Johnston SC, Kasner SE, Kittner SJ, Mitchell PH, Rich MW, Richardson D, Schwamm LH, Wilson JA | display-authors = 6 | title = Guidelines for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association | journal = Stroke | volume = 45 | issue = 7 | pages = 2160–236 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24788967 | doi = 10.1161/STR.0000000000000024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lansberg MG, O'Donnell MJ, Khatri P, Lang ES, Nguyen-Huynh MN, Schwartz NE, Sonnenberg FA, Schulman S, Vandvik PO, Spencer FA, Alonso-Coello P, Guyatt GH, Akl EA | display-authors = 6 | title = Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines | journal = Chest | volume = 141 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = e601S-e636S | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22315273 | pmc = 3278065 | doi = 10.1378/chest.11-2302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((European Stroke Organisation (ESO) Executive Committee; ESO Writing Committee)), Ringleb PA, Bousser MG, Ford G, Bath P, Brainin M, Caso V, Cervera A, Chamorro A, Cordonnier C, Csiba L, Davalos A, Diener HC, Ferro J, Hacke W, Hennerici M, Kaste M, Langhorne P, Lees K, Leys D, Lodder J, Markus HS, Mas JL, Mattle HP, Muir K, Norrving B, Obach V, Paolucci S, Ringelstein EB, Schellinger PD, Sivenius J, Skvortsova V, Sunnerhagen KS, Thomassen L, Toni D, von Kummer R, Wahlgren NG, Walker MF, Wardlaw J | display-authors = 6  | title = Guidelines for management of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack 2008 | journal = Cerebrovascular Diseases | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 457–507 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18477843 | doi = 10.1159/000131083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is widely believed that there is a substantial overlap between ESUS and cardioembolic stroke so there may be a rationale for [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulation]].&lt;ref name="Hart et al. 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamel H, Healey JS | title = Cardioembolic Stroke | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | pages = 514–526 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28154101 | pmc = 5312810 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is currently tested in [[clinical trial]]s.

== Epidemiology ==
On average, ESUS accounts for about 1 in 6 ischemic strokes (17% (range 9 – 25%)) according to a systematic literature review of 9 studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart RG, Catanese L, Perera KS, Ntaios G, Connolly SJ | title = Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source: A Systematic Review and Clinical Update | journal = Stroke | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 867–872 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28265016 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.016414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient]]s with ESUS tend to be relatively young and experience mild strokes. However, ESUS is associated with high [[relapse|recurrence]] rates. Of 2045 ESUS patients (identified by 8 studies)

* 58% were [[male]],
* the mean age was 65 years,
* the average annualized rate of stroke recurrence was 4.5%
* mean [[NIHSS]] at stroke onset was 5.

The stroke recurrence rate was 29.0% over 5 years in patients with ESUS, which is similar to patients with cardioembolic stroke (26.8%), but significantly higher than all types of non-cardioembolic stroke. However, [[mortality rate|mortality]] was significantly lower in patients with ESUS than cardioembolic stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ntaios G, Papavasileiou V, Milionis H, Makaritsis K, Manios E, Spengos K, Michel P, Vemmos K | title = Embolic strokes of undetermined source in the Athens stroke registry: a descriptive analysis | journal = Stroke | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–81 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25378429 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.007240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ntaios G, Papavasileiou V, Milionis H, Makaritsis K, Vemmou A, Koroboki E, Manios E, Spengos K, Michel P, Vemmos K | display-authors = 6 | title = Embolic Strokes of Undetermined Source in the Athens Stroke Registry: An Outcome Analysis | journal = Stroke | volume = 46 | issue = 8 | pages = 2087–93 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26159795 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.009334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16603">'''Emil Calmanovici''' (March 1896 – March 12, 1956) was a [[Romania]]n engineer, businessman, and [[communism|communist]] militant. Known for the financial support he gave to the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he became a [[political prisoner]] of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] after being implicated in the [[show trial]] of his collaborator [[Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu]]. Calmanovici died in mysterious circumstances in [[Aiud prison]], while on recovery from a [[hunger strike]].

==Biography==

=== Early life and financial success ===
Born to a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family in [[Piatra Neamţ]], he was the son of Mendel and his wife Ana, who ran a business in the town.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt; A graduate of the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], where he was confronted with the establishment of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]&lt;ref name="Betea, Procese politice"&gt;Betea, "Procese politice"&lt;/ref&gt; and became an avid reader of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]],&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; he also amassed a fortune in his youth, owing to his [[real estate]] investments.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Calmanovici decided to dedicate his wealth to the PCR cause, at a time when the party was outlawed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința...", "Testamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of [[World War II]], when they were [[nationalization|nationalized]], his properties included two construction enterprises, additional shares in a [[logging]] company centered in his native town, seven apartments, and over 18,000 m² in [[Bucharest]] real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "procese politice", "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party financier===
According to Calmanovici's statements, he had contributed massive sums to various PCR enterprises between 1937 (the year when he joined the group) and 1944, being responsible for the purchase of a [[printing press]], the renovation of the [[Central Committee]] seat in Bucharest, a clandestine radio station, and a kindergarten for children of party members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Calmanovici, in Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that his investments totaled 30 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in 1942 currency, which he argued was over 75% of his total income.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Calmanovici took pride in noting that this contribution was by far the highest of all those recorded (including that of [[Jacques Berman]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In addition, he contended, nationalization of his wealth had brought the state over 1 billion lei in 1947 currency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Inside the PCR, he kept only sporadic contacts with the "prison faction", a group led by [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] (according to one account, during the time when Gheorghiu-Dej was held in [[Doftana prison]], Calmanovici sent him a jacket as a gift).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Instead, he was close to Pătrășcanu's maverick group (later known as the "Secretariat faction"), a fact which, in time, contributed to his arrest and imprisonment (both of which were instigated by members of the "prison faction").&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

===Late 1940s===
During the war, when Romania joined the [[Axis Powers]] and participated in [[Operation Barbarossa]], he was among those charged with establishing contacts between the Communists and other opposition groups.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; At the time, his relation with the pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] financier Alexandru Ștefănescu helped him gain intimate knowledge of various negotiations between the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) on one side and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s dictatorial government on the other, as well as of the latter's tentative moves to withdraw Romania from its alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] through a compromise with the Western Allies (the 1943 unsuccessful mission of [[Barbu Ştirbey]] to [[Cairo]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; note to Calmanovici's letter, in ''Sfera Politicii''&lt;/ref&gt; Calmanovici forwarded his information to the PCR's [[Remus Koffler]], which helped the group approach and influence the PNȚ leader [[Iuliu Maniu]] to form an alliance against Antonescu (one which enlisted support from the [[Soviet Union]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

After the fall of Antonescu's regime and the onset of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] in August 1944, when the PCR first entered government, Calmanovici became an esteemed party member and officially endorsed industrialist.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; In the spring of 1945, his Bucharest house served as a meeting place for PCR and pro-Communist forces who planned and succeeded in toppling [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Nicolae Rădescu]]&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; (after a series of street clashes, Rădescu was replaced with the [[Ploughmen's Front]] leader [[Petru Groza]], whose cabinet was controlled by the PCR). Following this, he was appointed a technical director of the Bucharest Constructions Institute and was involved in enforcing Soviet standards and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Procese politice", "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest===
Relations between Calmanovici and the PCR degenerated abruptly toward the end of the 1940s, and he was arrested by the [[Securitate]] on May 26, 1951.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Several days earlier, Calmanovici had met with [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]]. At this meeting, Calmanovici asked Pîrvulescu to use his status as head of the Party Control Commission to grant him a decoration (Calmanovici was stiffly refused, on the grounds that such self-promotion was unprecedented).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Documents involving the 1943–1944 contacts between Calmanovici, Pătrășcanu, Koffler, and Maniu (who was already imprisoned on such charges following the [[Tămădău Affair]]) were interpreted as evidence that the former two had been spying for the Western Allies.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; In full, the accusation read: "as an agent of the [[United Kingdom|English]] espionage services he forwarded information about the PCR, taking part in the criminal action to destroy the party and support the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Rendered in Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Calmanovici stated that, early on, authorities had presented him with the claim that he was kept in custody in order to aid in the process of compiling a history of the PCR.&lt;ref&gt;Calmanovici, in Betea, "Procese politice", "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in summer 1951, he was subject to a series of Securitate interrogations, which concluded that he had not contributed to hostile activities and that he was able to support his case with "sufficient guarantees".&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

In December, Calmanovici, who had devoted his spare time to learning [[Russian language|Russian]],&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; was supposed to be released from custody.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Instead, his case was reviewed by a new group of Securitate officials, who obeyed Gheorghiu-Dej and alleged that the latter's rival, [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] [[Teohari Georgescu]], was not enforcing party doctrine (Georgescu was to be himself ousted in 1952).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; On orders from [[Alexandru Drăghici]] and [[Vladimir Mazuru]], under the supervision of several Soviet envoys,&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Securitate cadres were to induce Calmanovici to confess having spied in Romania during and after the World War.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; The officer who had originally argued in favor of his release was criticized for having displayed "lack of vigilance", and ordered to resume interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Golopenția&lt;/ref&gt;

In several appeals to the PCR leadership (Gheorghiu-Dej, Pîrvulescu, [[Chivu Stoica]], [[Emil Bodnăraş]] and others) Calmanovici repeatedly stated his innocence and dismissed accusations that he was a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] figure with insufficient political education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In another personal letter, he compared allegations of espionage with those made by [[Alexander Kerensky]] about [[Vladimir Lenin]] prior to the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;Calmanovici, in ''Sfera Politicii''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession and trial===
In February 1953, Calmanovici gave in to Securitate violence and presented operatives with a fabricated account, stating that he had been part of a network of spies presided over by Milton (a name he came up with after recalling the 17th-century poet [[John Milton]]).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; His inquisitors soon rejected the story, and argued that it was additional proof of "provocation" on Calmanovici's part.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Eventually, he agreed to sign his name to a confession drawn up by the PCR, in return for a promise that he was to be given at most a four-year sentence.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; It has been argued that the document endorsed by Calmanovici was directly inspired from the similar one handed over by [[Nikolai Bukharin]] during the 1938 [[Moscow]] [[Trial of the Twenty One]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; In its final form, it also incriminated Calmanovici of [[Zionism]] and spying in favor of the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] (the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Betea, Procese politice"/&gt; or, alternatively, the [[United Kingdom]]).&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"&gt;Introduction to Calmgram&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, Calmanovici was indicted in Pătrășcanu's 1954 trial, where, despite early promises, the court ultimately sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] and [[Penal labour|forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Levy, p.152; Tismăneanu, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was given on counts of [[crime against peace]] and [[high treason]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"/&gt; As Pătrășcanu and Koffler were being swiftly executed in [[Jilava]], he and the other persons sentenced (including Alexandru Ștefănescu, [[Petre Pandrea]], [[Harry Brauner]], [[Lena Constante]], and Pătrășcanu's wife Elena) were dispatched to the infamous [[Aiud prison]], on their way to various facilities.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

===Imprisonment and death===
Calmanovici, who was kept in almost complete isolation, managed to contact other inmates, an infraction which was added to his criminal record.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

As a consequence, the Securitate decided to stage a set of circumstances which were to incriminate him further: in 1955, Calmanovici was escorted out of Aiud and into a villa in [[Săftica]], where he received a humane treatment while being interrogated by [[Vasile Posteucă]].&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Calmanovici, in ''Sfera Politicii''&lt;/ref&gt; A guard was instructed to approach him and earn his confidence, to the point where Calmanovici trusted him with carrying out a message he had written on linens; addressed to his former employees and meant to be forwarded to Jewish communists in the [[Western world]], these exposed the fallacies and major irregularities of his trial.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; (In similar appeals, Calmanovici had also meant to bring his case to the attention of the [[Cominform]].)&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; After the guard handed the letters over to his superiors, Calmanovici was chained and moved back into Aiud.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

He decided to publicize his innocence by beginning a [[hunger strike]], which eventually led physicians on duty to [[Force-feeding|force-feed]] him.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; His diet at the time went against medical guidelines for people with [[malnutrition]], and was the most likely cause of his death by [[gastrointestinal perforation]] &amp;mdash; two prison staff members later attested that this was done on purpose, as a method of assassination.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; It has also been noted that Calmanovici's signed statement according to which he was abandoning the hunger strike and was accepting the treatment, extracted only hours before his death, was immediately communicated to higher authority (unlike any other such statement of the time).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Of his group, Calmanovici was the only one to die in custody (all others were released ca. 1964, when they benefited from an [[amnesty]]).&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation and legacy==
Like all defendants in the Pătrășcanu trial, Calmanovici was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in April 1968 by [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], following a change in policy which was meant to discredit his deceased predecessor Gheorghiu-Dej and the former Securitate chief [[Alexandru Drăghici]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The new inquiry, overseen by [[Ion Popescu-Puţuri]], found that Calmanovici had been the victim of systematic abuse. Among others, it was established that Calmanovici's arrest had been operated on the basis of Gheorghiu-Dej's personal views, that the charges had for long not been communicated to Calmanovici, that Soviet agents had openly intervened in interrogations, and that, like virtually all other defendants, he had been repeatedly beaten and otherwise [[torture]]d to ensure a [[forced confession]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

Calmanovici's son became a resident and later a citizen of [[Sweden]], becoming known under the name Gad Calmgran.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"/&gt; He worked as a journalist, and was a collaborator for the newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"/&gt;

:''Not to be confused are [[UFO religion]]s or [[ancient astronaut]] theories that posit that historical religious scripture or mythology was inspired by visits from extraterrestrials.''
:''"Exotheism" is a fictional denomination in the [[Vampire: The Requiem]] role-playing game.''

The term "'''exotheology'''" was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;An early attestation is the title "A Jewish Exotheology" in Norman Lamm, ''Faith and Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought'', Ktav Pub. House, 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; for the examination of [[theology|theological]] issues as they pertain to [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial intelligence]]. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies have been or will be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.

One of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a [[soul]],  as a [[thought experiment]] to the examination of a given theology, mostly [[Christian theology]], occasionally also [[Jewish theology]].

==Christianity==
A Christian writer early to address the question was [[C. S. Lewis]] (1898–1963) who in a 1950s article  in the  ''Christian Herald'' contemplated the possibility of the [[Son of God]] incarnating in other, extraterrestrial, worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one applicable to humans.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web

Lutheran theologian [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] (2003) asserts that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are by no means new to Christian theology and by no means pose, as asserted by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters points out that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of "what if God had created many worlds?", as early as the discussion of the [[Antipodes]] by the  [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Science, theology, and ethics'', Ashgate science and religion series, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0825-7}}, chapter 6: "Exotheology: Speculations on Extraterrestrial Life"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Holy See|Vatican]] theologian [[Corrado Balducci]] often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement ''UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?''.
In a 2008 statement, [[José Gabriel Funes]], head of the Vatican Observatory, said
"Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can't put limits on God's creative freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/technology/science/science/story.html?id=fa0c5620-4d7f-44e6-9436-5cd4cb7153ac Vatican scientist says belief in God and aliens is OK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220145808/http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/technology/science/science/story.html?id=fa0c5620-4d7f-44e6-9436-5cd4cb7153ac |date=20 February 2009 }} Reuters, May 14, 2008
[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/popes-astronomer-insists-alien-life-would-be-part-of-gods-creation-828303.html Pope's astronomer insists alien life 'would be part of God's creation'], ''The Independent'', 15 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: [[Christian Science]] and the [[A Course in Miracles|Course in Miracles]] treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, "The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings,...",&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy|Eddy, Mary Baker]], [[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]], p. 264:32.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] wrote, "Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

While other [[Protestant]] denominations have tended to be somewhat terracentric, much as [[Roman Catholicism]] was until more recent times, receptivity to the idea of extraterrestrial civilizations likely depends on the degree of associated [[biblical literalism]].  Those of more fundamentalist leanings as interviewed occasionally on UFO- and paranormal-themed radio shows like [[Coast to Coast AM]] often try to fit extraterrestrial beings into the mold of [[demon]]s or [[Nephilim]], lacking much better category in which to place them, whereas schools of less literal persuasion would be more open to alternative perspectives.  These would include either fundamental reexamination of traditional assumptions, some reconsideration of extraterrestrials as in some sense [[angels]], or at least wider interpretations possible in the saying ascribed to [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]], "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.",&lt;ref&gt;The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] ([[King James Version]]), [[Gospel of John|John]] 10:16&lt;/ref&gt; which while probably quite presumptuous-sounding in the very large cosmic perspective could potentially lend itself to a reading in some more impersonal sense as well better befitting the larger magnitude of exotheology.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

==Judaism==
Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing various classic Jewish authorities. Among them are the medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). After presenting his sources, Rabbi Kaplan remarks, "We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility"—at least in the same sense as human beings.&lt;ref&gt;
[Aryeh Kaplan. "On Extraterrestrial Life."] The Aryeh Kaplan Reader, Artscroll/Mesorah Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
Rabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 ("Cursed is Meroz..."), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator remarks, "Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene]." (The basis of Rashi's comment is a Talmudic discussion in tractate Moed Katan 16a. However, the verse in Judges is more commonly understood as a literary usage by Deborah the Prophetess and not an affirmation of possible intelligent life on another planet.)

Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], former chancellor of [[Yeshiva University]], has also written on this subject, asserting that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.&lt;ref&gt;
"A Jewish Exotheology," published as Chapter 5 in Norman Lamm, ''Faith and doubt: studies in traditional Jewish thought'', Ktav Pub. House, 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], an eminent 20th century Talmudic authority and rabbinical leader, is cited as having been open-minded about extraterrestrial life. He is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God's greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God's will here on earth.&lt;ref&gt;
David Holzer, ''The Rav: Thinking Aloud'', HolzerSeforim, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Depending on the [[sura]]s cited, the [[Quran]] of [[Islam]] appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on a par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a [[heaven]] or [[hell]] as reward or punishment for the deeds of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Finn Mertens''' (also known as '''Finn''' and '''Finn the Human''') is a fictional character and the [[main protagonist]] of the American [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[Adventure Time]]'' created by [[Pendleton Ward]]. He is voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]] in most appearances. The character made his debut in [[Adventure Time (pilot)|the original pilot]], where he was named '''Pen''' and voiced by [[Zack Shada]], Jeremy's older brother.

The character has been met with largely positive critical reception.

==Biography==
Finn debuted at age 12 but aged over the course of the show, and was 17 by the series finale. Finn sets off on magical random quests around the Land of Ooo. He would gladly fight or beat up anything evil, but would not harm anything good or "neutral" as shown in "The Enchiridion!" when he refused to squash an innocent ant. Having a strong moral code, Finn swore that he would help anyone in need and often performs heroic feats to save the day; however,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetworkhq.net/show/adventure-time/characters/finn-the-human-boy|title=Adventure Time – Free online games and video – Cartoon Network|website=Cartoon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finn's enthusiastic nature becomes more toned down as the series progresses, suggesting he is both maturing and developing as a character as he ages. As shown in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain", Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He reveals that he had made "boom boom"—a euphemism for defecation—on a large leaf, fallen on it, and lay there crying until Joshua and Margaret, Jake's parents, rescued him from the wilderness and took him in to raise him alongside Jake, who became like a brother to him. As such, Jake is also Finn's adoptive brother. In "Henchman", when Finn is asked about his parents, he says [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] told him that he came from a cabbage, in jest. In the episode "Susan Strong", Finn states that he knows nothing of his human parents or any other humans. He is one of the few characters in the series (along with [[Flame Princess]]) who ages regularly. According to the episode "The Vault", Finn has had a number of past lives. In "Red Starved" it is revealed that Finn is [[Color blindness|color blind]], believing that an [[emerald]] was a [[ruby]].

In the Season 6 opener "Escape From the Citadel", Finn has lost half of his right arm, up to his elbow, from which a flower protruded. He later regains his arm, now as a prosthetic, in the episode "Breezy", only to lose it once more in the episode "Reboot" when his grass arm transforms itself into a humanoid, sentient being. In the following episode "Two Swords", Finn gets fitted with a new robotic arm by Princess Bubblegum, to replace the missing arm. In the Season 9 finale "Three Buckets" it is revealed that this arm can transform into many different weapons.
In the series final episode, "Come Along With Me", Finn loses his robotic arm while entering GOLB's mouth, the entity biting it off and making it fall to the ground. 1000 years on the future, a pair called Shermy and Beth finds that robotic arm after it fell from a Prize Ball Guardian's feet.

===Age===
Finn is currently 17 years old as revealed in the season 10 episode "Seventeen". At the beginning of the series, Finn was a 12-year-old boy who is supposedly the only known human in the Land of Ooo. During the episode "Mystery Train", Finn turned 13; it has been stated that the episode first airing date ([[Pi Day|March 14]]) is Finn's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.spring.me/#!/MrMuto/q/280948569731509816&lt;/ref&gt; After season 3 ended, [[Pendleton Ward]] stated in an interview that Finn was 14. Finn was 15 years old in the second half of Season 5, according to Adam Muto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=Hi Mr Muto, I have a question: How old is Finn actually?|url=http://spring.me/MrMuto/q/503021942991775379|publisher=[[Formspring]]|accessdate=September 14, 2013|date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Season 6 finale, "The Comet", Finn reveals that he has reached 16 years of age. And finally, during the episode "Seventeen", Finn turned 17 years old. This means that unlike in many other cartoons where characters [[floating timeline|stay the same age]] or age through time skips, in ''Adventure Time'', time passes mostly regularly (from Seasons 1 to around 5). However, at some point, the rate time passed in the show became slower and it stopped being in real-time, as Finn is only 17 by the ending instead of 20.

===Status as the last human===
Until the episode "[[Betty (Adventure Time)|Betty]]", Finn was the only known human in the Land of Ooo. A common theory explaining the etymology of his name includes the French word "fin", meaning "end". Another possibility is that his name is Irish, Finn being a name of a [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|mythological Irish hero]], whose name is derived from "fionn", the Irish language word for blond; Finn the Human is blond as well.

The cause for him being the last human is alluded to by Finn and many other characters as "[[Nuclear holocaust|The Great Mushroom War]]", which was a nuclear war that wiped out the majority of humanity. Up until the character "Susan Strong" is introduced, Finn believes that he has never met another human. When Finn encounters Susan Strong, the other members of Susan's tribe of "Hyoomen" are revealed to be mutants, and Susan's identity as a human or mutant was left ambiguous. In the episode "Beautopia", it was hinted upon that Susan may also be human, but was not confirmed at the time. 

However, in the Season Six episode, "Dark Purple", Susan's hat was taken off, revealing that she is indeed human, but with a cybernetic implant on the left side of her head, which meant she was a cyborg. The businessmen that Finn meets in the "Business Time" episode were once human, though they had mutated over time. In the episode "Her Parents", Lady Rainicorn's parents (Bob and Ethel) attempt to eat Finn because they thought they would never get the chance to eat one, as they believed humans were extinct. Finn's female counterpart [[Fiona#Fictional characters|Fionna the Human]] is a human living in the Land of Aaa, though it has no official name; however, she does not actually exist. Fiona exists only in a fictuitous [[Adventure Time (season 3)#Production|parallel universe]] conceived by the [[Ice King]], when he wrote a [[fan fiction]] based upon his life and experiences with Finn and Jake. There are many other characters in the show that appear to be human but have been confirmed to be humanoids or mutants. In the episode ''Be More'', the character Moseph "Moe" Mastro Giovanni, who is the creator of BMO, was once a human, but to ensure his immortality, he has replaced most of his body parts (except the skin) with artificial ones, which makes him virtually a [[cyborg]]. In the episode "Betty," Betty Grof (known as Simon Petrikov's former fiancee) was brought from the past into Ooo, and later in "[[Wake Up / Escape from the Citadel|Escape From the Citadel]]" Finn's father, Martin, is introduced, making Finn no longer the last human.

However, during the Season Six finale event, two episodes and their events bring a return to Finn's status as the last human on Ooo. In "You Forgot Your Floaties", Betty Grof becomes Magic Man's apprentice and in return for helping Magic Man, he promised her a cure for her [[Ice King|fiance]]. Things go awry and at the end of the episode, where Betty takes Magic Man's hat, thus becoming a wizard and losing her status as a human. Additionally, in the season finale episode, "The Comet", after Finn learns of his past and declines an offer to become a higher being, his father, Martin, takes the offer and ascends to another level of being, likely bringing an end to his human form. In the episode, "Preboot", it is revealed there are other humans outside of Ooo, and at the end of "Reboot", Finn destroys Susan's cybernetic implant, making her fully human in the process.

During the miniseries "[[Islands (miniseries)|Islands]]", Finn's status as the last human is completely dispelled. It is revealed that centuries after the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Great Mushroom War]], a group of surviving humans left Ooo and moved to a [[archipelago|chain of islands]]. After many generations, there are still humans living there. Finn's mother, named Minerva, lives on one of the islands known as Founders' Island, and was a medic in service to her society, until she [[mind upload|uploaded her mind to a network of robots]] after the island was ravaged by an illness. In addition to meeting his biological mother, Finn meets an entire population of humans. Although Finn requests that the humans of the archipelago may venture out of the islands and back to Ooo, they refuse to emigrate. However, in the episode "Come Along With Me", the humans return to the land of Ooo in several ships, bringing Minerva with them on a computer screen.

==Physical appearance==
Finn is a 5-foot tall teenage human. He has [[blond]] hair, of which the length differs due to occasional haircuts. His eyes and eyebrows appear black from a distance, but according to lead character designer Andy Ristaino, they are blue. Although, originally dots, his eyes are ovals by Season 7. He wears a white bear hat, short blue pants, and a light blue T-shirt. He also has a green backpack, black shoes, and socks rolled down to his ankles. Finn has peach color skin.
Finn is a teenage boy who is average height and weight. His arms and legs are very thin, but he has a wide torso. He is missing several teeth because they often face monsters that hit him in the face, also he often bites rocks and other hard objects. These teeth are sometimes round or pointed and constantly changing place, depending on the occasion. In the episode "The Enchiridion!" it can be seen for a moment that his left eye is green while his right eye is blue as if he has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]. However, Andy Ristaino confirmed that this was a "special occasion" and that in fact, both eyes are light blue, which is not visible to the naked eye. He also points out in that episode that Finn had a small round nose but this is considered more of an error or humorous scene.

In "[[Escape from the Citadel]]", Finn had lost a right arm after it was pulled off after an attempt to reach his father, which was then coated by the blood of a Citadel Guardian that made it grow into a small flower. He later got his arm back in the episode, "Breezy," where the flower stub matured into a tree and broke away like a cocoon, revealing a new limb. In the seventh season finale, "Reboot", Finn lost it once more when his grass arm tries to attack a savage Susan and transforms into a sentient grass being called Fern the Human. Starting with the eighth season premiere, "Two Swords", Finn has been fitted with a new robotic arm by Princess Bubblegum, who fastened it in his amputated part since his old arm was no longer part of his body.

According to Jake, Finn is about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall. This is revealed in the episode "Dungeon Train", in the second half of the [[Adventure Time (season 5)|fifth season]]. In the 23rd episode of the [[Adventure Time (season 6)|sixth season]], The Pajama War, it is seen that he has grown considerably, being almost as tall as [[Princess Bubblegum]], who, biologically, is many years older than Finn. In "Elements, Part Five: Slime Central" Finn states that his shoe size is size 10.

===Costuming===
Finn typically wears a Munsell blue T-shirt, short blue pants, a two-toned lime green circular backpack, rolled-down white socks, and a pair of black shoes. Finn's most prominent attire is a white hat with two "ears" sticking out on top that covers his entire head minus his face. The hat is inspired by a character called Bueno, a bear from a Pendleton Ward comics. Finn can occasionally be seen in variations of his standard outfit. In "Ocean of Fear," his footwear appears to be black booties with white cuffs. In "[[It Came from the Nightosphere]]", Finn has a small pocket sewn onto his shirt that he carries Jake in. This appears again in "Davey" where he uses it to hide Jake while Finn steals the keys from the guards as he breaks the former out of jail. During "In Your Footsteps," the Bear wears Finn's clothes, which suggests that Finn has multiple sets of the same outfit, including his hat. However, in "Little Dude," when Finn's hat comes to life and is set free, Jake tells Finn that they should go skin an evil bear, which implies that Finn only had one hat.

Aside from his normal outfit, Finn can be seen wearing a cream-yellow sweater in colder areas such as the Ice Kingdom but currently wears his pink sweater made by Princess Bubblegum. In "Holly Jolly Secrets Part II," he wears a dark blue sweater with Christmas decorations on it and a green scarf. Finn also wears white briefs that make their first appearance in "City of Thieves". In "Who Would Win," he was shown to wear a different pair with red elastic. Finn sleeps in red [[footed pajamas]] that appear in many episodes, but in the animated short, he sleeps in a red [[sleeping bag]] in his regular clothes. In the series, the sleeping bag is beige.

'''Italian submarine ''Dessiè''''' was an {{sclass-|Adua|submarine}} built for the [[Royal Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') during the 1930s. It was named after a town of [[Dessie]] in north-central [[Ethiopia]].

==Design and description==
The ''Adua''-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding {{sclass-|Perla|submarine|4}}. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|680|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|844|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|60.18|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.45|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, pp. 309–10&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|400|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7.5|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Adua'' class had a range of {{convert|3180|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10.5|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|74|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]]  machine guns.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;

==Construction and career==

''Dessiè'' was built at the [[Cantieri navali Tosi di Taranto|Tosi]] shipyard in [[Taranto]]. She was laid down on 20 April 1936, launched on 22 November of the same year, and commissioned on 14 April 1937. Upon commission, she was assigned to 43rd Submarine Squadron in [[Taranto]]. During August and September of 1937 she performed several missions during the [[Spanish Civil War]] but without any success &lt;ref name=g5&gt;Giorgerini, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1938 she was reassigned to [[Tobruk]], and in 1940 she returned to Italy, and was assigned to 46th Squadron (IV Submarine Group) based first at [[Taranto]] and then at [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]].

At the beginning of the [[World War II]] from 8 to 16 August 1940, ''Dessiè'', under command of captain Fausto Sestini, patrolled the waters between [[Gavdos|Gaudo]] and [[Antikythera|Cerigotto]], just off the coast of [[Crete]]. In the evening of August 13 she sighted a fast transport moving east. An attack was attempted but was unsuccessful because of the speed of the target.

Between late October and early November ''Dessiè'' was part of a group of four submarines sent to patrol an area between the [[Ionian Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], but no sightings were made, even though the British Fleet was in that area at the time &lt;ref name=g4&gt;Giorgerini, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;.

At the end of the month she was again deployed, now under command of captain Adriano Pini, this time off [[Malta]] with the task of intercepting the ships of British Operation "Collar". At 3:05 on November 28, she sighted a naval column consisting of three capital ships. ''Dessiè'' launched two stern torpedoes from 3,500 meters against a middle target, and disengaged by diving. An explosion was heard, but British official documents mention no attack by ''Dessié'' or any damage inflicted &lt;ref name=g3&gt;Giorgerini, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;. The Royal Navy's 3rd Cruise Division, consisting of heavy cruiser {{HMS|York|90|6}} and light cruisers {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} and {{HMS|Gloucester|62|6}} was indeed passing through the area at the time of the attack.

Between December 16-25, 1940 ''Dessiè'' together with submarines {{ship|Italian submarine|Serpente||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Fratelli Bandiera||2}} patrolled around [[Malta]]. In January 1941 she was deployed off [[Derna, Libya|Derna]]. Both patrols were uneventful.

On May 20, 1941 ''Dessiè'' together with numerous other submarines was deployed to an area between [[Crete]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Sollum]], to support the German invasion of Crete ([[Operation Merkur]]).

On July 21 and 22, 1941, ''Dessiè'' along with three other submarines was deployed to area between [[Pantelleria]] and [[Malta]]. Her task was to intercept a British convoy, part of the Operation "Substance", but she did not sight any enemy ships &lt;ref name=g2&gt;Giorgerini, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;.

On January 3, 1942 ''Dessiè'' was sent to patrol an area south off [[Malta]] with the task of detecting and attacking any British naval forces that would attempt to intercept an Italian convoy "M 43" bringing supplies to [[Libya]]. No ships were detected.

In mid-June 1942 she was sent along with four other submarines, including {{ship|Italian submarine|Aradam||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Ascianghi||2}} to patrol between [[Malta]], [[Pantelleria]] and [[Lampedusa]] with a task of intercepting a British convoy, part of Operation "Harpoon", however, the submarine did not sight any enemy ships.

On August 11, 1942 ''Dessiè'', now under command of captain Renato Scandola, was among eleven submarines deployed off the coast [[Tunisia]], between [[Scoglio Due Fratelli]] and [[Skerki Banks]]. Her task was to intercept a British convoy for Malta, part of [[Operation Pedestal|Operation "Pedestal"]]. Around 19:00 on August 12 ''Dessiè'' sighted the convoy, counting 14 merchants and ten destroyers. At 19:10 she closed in to within 1,800 meters and at 19:38 she launched four torpedoes. After one minute and forty seconds a loud explosion was heard, as SS ''Brisbane Star'' (12,791 GRT) was hit. However, the steamship succeeded in restarting her engines and reaching [[Malta]] on August 14 after a short stop in [[Sousse|Soussa]], even though she was further damaged by German torpedo bombers &lt;ref name=g6&gt;Giorgerini, pp. 333,336,337&lt;/ref&gt;. At 19:56 ''Dessiè'', while preparing to launch her stern torpedoes, was attacked by enemy destroyers, who continued their attacks until 21:27, without causing any damage to the submarine. ''Dessiè'' surfaced at 22:12 and continued her patrol. In the evening of August 13 she was bombed by an aircraft, that killed one crew member and wounded several others and caused damage to her batteries which forced her to return to the base.

On November 2, 1942 ''Dessiè'' left [[Messina]] at 21:15 carrying 20 tons of ammunition to [[Tobruk]]. She arrived in [[Tobruk]] around 5 or 6 November 1942
unloaded her cargo and departed at 16:10 to return to [[Messina]] where she arrived on November 11, 1942.

On November 18, 1942 ''Dessiè'' sailed from [[Messina]], under command of captain Alberto Gorini, to patrol an area off the coast of [[Annaba|Bona]] and to attack enemy traffic around the ports of [[Skikda|Philippeville]] and [[Béjaïa|Bougie]]. At 19:12 on November 27, 1942 captain Gorini communicated with the base for the last time. Only after the end of [[World War II]] it was learned that ''Dessiè'' was detected on the surface by airplanes at 14:05 on November 28, 1942 about 10 miles off [[Annaba|Bona]]. A pilot radioed in her coordinates and destroyers {{HMAS|Quiberon|G81|6}} and {{HMS|Quentin|G78|6}} were sent to search for the submarine. Detected and hit hard by depth charges, ''Dessiè'' had to surface with a noticeable stern list, and before any crew could leave the boat, she went down and finally sunk stern first with all hands &lt;ref name=g1&gt;Giorgerini, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Jayne Furlong''', also referred to as '''Jane Furlong''', was a [[New Zealand]] girl from [[Auckland]] who disappeared from a street in Auckland on 26 May 1993 while working in the [[sex trade]]. She had been [[kidnapping|abducted]] and [[murdered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/31943|accessdate=20 October 2016|title=Long wait ends with sunrise at Sunset Beach|date=20 June 2012|publisher=NZ Police}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Disappearance==
Her remains were found south west of Auckland at Sunset Beach, [[Port Waikato]], on 19 May 2012 after being exposed by erosion of a sandbank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11281709|title=Police close Jane Furlong murder mystery case|date=2014-06-25|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were positively identified by [[DNA]]. At the time of her disappearance, Furlong was due to testify as a witness for the prosecution in two separate legal cases - one involving gang members accused of an assault, and the other relating to a businessman charged with brutal attacks on sex workers. A year after the remains were found, Detective Inspector Mark Benefield said that Furlong's ex-partner, who reported her missing on 28 May 1993, some of her former associates and some of those involved in the court cases, had declined to speak to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8543343/Surprising-new-leads-in-Furlong-death-case|accessdate=20 October 2016|title='Surprising' new leads in Furlong death case|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In 2012, after the remains were found, police released a film made in 1993 for the ''Crimewatch'' TV-program. The film shows a re-enactment of street scenes at the time Furlong went missing, with her boyfriend playing himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/7154612/Jane-Furlong-re-enactment-footage-released|accessdate=2 April 2017|title=Jane Furlong re-enactment footage released|date=22 June 2012|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and narrated by the show's host, broadcaster [[Ian Johnstone (broadcaster)|Ian Johnstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/person/ian-johnstone/biography|accessdate=4 August 2017|title=Ian Johnstone – Presenter|publisher=NZ On Air – nzonscreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her murder investigation is ongoing and police are still probing old information. They set up a [[Facebook]] page in 2012 to help with their inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/family-feared-the-worst-for-jane-furlong-2012062017|accessdate=23 October 2016|title=Family feared the worst for Jane Furlong|date=20 June 2012|publisher=Newshub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two witnesses claim to have overheard a confession to the killing of Furlong by a career criminal during 2003; the police said their information contained factually incorrect information - so their potential leads were not further investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10911050|accessdate=20 October 2016|title=Crim 'saw murder'|date=11 August 2013|publisher=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Furlong's mother urged anyone who knew what happened to her daughter to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10814436|title=Jane's mother: Help us solve case|date=2012-06-21|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A funeral service was held at St George's Anglican Church in [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]], Auckland in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/7317610/Mourners-farewell-Jane-Furlong|accessdate=20 October 2016|title=Mourners farewell Jane Furlong|date=20 July 2012|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid to rest at St George's Anglican Church in Epsom on Friday 20 July 2012.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 2007 her case was featured on the television series [[Sensing Murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/76073573/Sensing-Murder-episode-reruns-questioned|accessdate=20 October 2016|title=Sensing Murder episode reruns questioned|date=20 January 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain '''John Conn''' (c. 5 August 1764 – 4 May 1810) was a senior captain in the [[Royal Navy]], whose career, which included service at the battles of [[battle of the Saintes|the Saintes]], the [[Glorious First of June]], [[battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Copenhagen]] and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], ended in a shipboard accident before he could reap the rewards of his long service. Conn could also claim membership of [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson's]] "[[Nelson's Band of Brothers|Band of Brothers]]", a clique of dashing naval officers who participated in Nelson's campaigns during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], as well as a close friendship with the admiral himself, who once said: "A better or more zealous officer than Captain Conn is not in His Majesty's service."

==Biography==
Born to a Royal Navy [[Warrant officer (United Kingdom)|warrant officer]] of Irish extraction, also named John Conn, he was [[Infant baptism|baptised]] at [[Stoke, Plymouth|Stoke Damerel]], [[Devon]], on 5 August 1764.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~aldo75da/devon.html |title=Conn family of Devon/Cornwall |first1=David |last1=Conn |first2=Martin |last2=Willcocks |work=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |year=2013  |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conn first went to sea in 1778, aged thirteen, aboard on his father's ship {{HMS|Weazel|1745|2}}, before securing a place on {{HMS|Arrogant|1761|2}} as a [[midshipman]], and in which he saw action at the [[battle of the Saintes]] in April 1782. In 1788 he was made a lieutenant, but had to wait five years before being given a good position,&lt;ref&gt;1 June 1793&lt;/ref&gt; using the intervening time to get married to Margaret Nelson, a vicar's daughter. Serving aboard the flagship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|2}} at the [[Glorious First of June]], he came to the attention of [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Lord Howe]]. He commissioned the 12-gun gun vessel {{HMS|Staunch|1797|2}} in June 1797 but left her a year later. He then further distinguished himself in October 1798 in {{HMS|Foudroyant|1798|2}} at the [[Battle of Tory Island|battle of Donegal]], which resulted in the destruction of a French invasion fleet headed for [[Ireland]]. He was promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] on 11 August 1800 and took command of the [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}}. At the first [[battle of Copenhagen (1801)|battle of Copenhagen]] his expertise caused terrible damage to the Danish fleet. Next, he participated in Nelson's bold but disastrous [[Raids on Boulogne|attack on the French invasion force]] in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] shortly afterwards, commanding the division of gun-boats, and gaining his commanding officer's attention and respect.

Conn received promotion to [[post-captain]] on 29 August 1802 and took command of {{HMS|Culloden|1783|2}}. His nine-year-old son Henry joined him on ''Culloden''. Conn then transferred to the French prize {{HMS|Canopus|1798|2}} and joined Nelson in the [[Mediterranean]] at Nelson's request. In 1805 Conn was given temporary command of the [[first rate]] flagship {{HMS|Victory||2}} and his old ship ''Royal Sovereign'' whilst their commanders were on leave; his performance further contributed to his reputation as a reliable and steady officer. On 10 October he returned the ''Royal Sovereign'' to [[Cuthbert Collingwood|Admiral Collingwood]] and took command of the fast new [[second rate]] {{HMS|Dreadnought|1801|2}}.

Eleven days later Conn and his crew were thrown into battle as the Franco-Spanish fleet attempted to break out of [[Cadiz]]. Situated halfway down Collingwood's division, Conn struggled to reach the action, only getting there around the time Nelson was mortally wounded in the northern division. Making up for the delay, ''Dreadnought'' tangled with the {{Ship|Spanish ship|San Juan Nepomuceno||2|up=yes}}, rescuing the battered {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|2}}, killing the Spanish captain [[Cosme Damián de Churruca y Elorza|Cosmé Damián Churruca]] and forcing his ship to surrender. Charging on from this victory, the ''Dreadnought'' engaged the Spanish flagship {{Ship|Spanish ship|Principe de Asturias|1794|2}}, mortally wounding the Spanish admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y Nápoli|Gravina]], but being unable to defeat the enemy, which succeeded in escaping back to Cadiz. Conn even managed to rescue his prize, the ''San Juan Nepomuceno'' being one of only four captured enemy ships to survive the storm.

Following the battle, in which ''Dreadnought'' suffered 33 casualties, Conn continued in service taking over the massive 112 gun {{HMS|San Josef||2}} and then the 120 gun {{HMS|Hibernia|1804|2}} as flag captain before moving as a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] to the [[West Indies]] in {{HMS|Swiftsure|1804|2}} in 1810. Admiral's rank and the honours which came with it were surely not far away when tragedy struck on 4 May when during the chase of a small French ship near [[Bermuda]], Conn became over-eager, slipped and fell overboard. ''Swiftsure'' was halted and a search was conducted, but Conn had drowned before help arrived. His passing was mourned in Britain and especially in the Navy where he was a popular and respected figure. Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], an old commander and friend, expressed regret at the death of "so deserving an officer as Captain Conn."

'''Lee Boyd Malvo''' (born February 18, 1985), also known as '''John Lee Malvo''', is a convicted murderer&lt;!-- NOTE: Putting "serial killer" or "spree killer" is debatable, per discussion at the [[John Allen Muhammad]] talk page, and is addressed later in this paragraph neutrally.--&gt; who, along with [[John Allen Muhammad]], committed murders in connection with the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]] over a three-week period in October 2002.

The Beltway sniper attacks turned out to be the last of a series of shootings across the United States connected to these individuals which began on the [[United States West Coast|West Coast]]. Muhammad had befriended the juvenile Malvo and enlisted him in the attacks. According to Craig Cooley, one of Malvo's defense attorneys, Malvo believed Muhammad when he told him that the $10 million [[ransom]] sought from the US government to stop the sniper killings would be used to establish a [[Utopia]]n society for one hundred and forty homeless black children on a [[Canada|Canadian]] compound.&lt;ref name="SadSinister"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Andrea F.|last2=Wilson|first2=Kimberly A.C.|title=Malvo depicted as sad, sinister|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-te.md.malvo14nov14-story.html|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=14 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joining John Allen Muhammad ==
Malvo and his mother, Una Sceon James, first met John Allen Muhammad in [[Antigua|Antigua and Barbuda]] around 1999, where James and Muhammad developed a strong friendship. Later, James left Antigua for [[Fort Myers, Florida]], using false documents. She left her son with Muhammad, reportedly planning to have him follow her later. Malvo arrived illegally in [[Miami]] in 2001, and in December of that year, he and his mother were apprehended by the Border Patrol in [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref name=gibs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Dirk C.|title=Clues from Killers: Serial Murder and Crime Scene Messages|date=October 30, 2004|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0275983609|pages=41–42|edition=First |url=https://www.amazon.com/Clues-Killers-Serial-Murder-Messages/dp/0275983609|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Una James was deported to Jamaica on December 15, 2002 in the aftermath of the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-403583.html|title=Suspect's Mother Is Taken Back To Jamaica|last=|date=December 15, 2002|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In January 2002, Malvo was released on a $1,500 bond.&lt;ref name=gibs /&gt; Malvo traveled to Bellingham, Washington, where he lived in a homeless shelter with Muhammad. Malvo enrolled in [[Bellingham High School (Washington)|Bellingham High School]] with Muhammad falsely listed as his father, but he did not make any friends, according to his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Under federal laws, neither Muhammad nor Malvo was legally allowed to purchase or possess guns, with both classified as prohibited persons under the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].&lt;ref name="ATF_Prohibited"&gt;{{cite web|title=Identify Prohibited Persons|url=https://www.atf.gov/firearms/identify-prohibited-persons|website=ATF.gov|publisher=ATF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal prosecutions==
Malvo was initially arrested under federal charges, but they were dropped. He was transferred to Virginia custody and sent to jail in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]. He was charged by the Commonwealth of Virginia for two capital crimes: the murder of [[FBI]] analyst Linda Franklin "in the commission of an act of terrorism" (an addendum to Virginia law that was added after the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]]) and the murder of more than one person in a three-year period. He was also charged with the unlawful use of a firearm in the murder of Franklin. Initially, a Fairfax attorney, Michael Arif, was appointed to represent him, along with Thomas B. Walsh and Mark J. Petrovich. Later, prominent Richmond attorney Craig Cooley was appointed to the team and assumed a leadership role.&lt;ref name="StartTrial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Andrea F.|title=Murder trial for Malvo set to start in November|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.md.malvo29jan29-story.html|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in jail, Malvo made a recorded confession to Detective Samuel Walker in which he stated that he ''"intended to kill them all"''.&lt;ref name="TeenageKiller"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenage sniper accused 'a smart, clever killer' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/teenage-sniper-accused-a-smart-clever-killer-1-494084|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=14 November 2003|location=Edinburgh, Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a [[change of venue]], the trial was moved over 150 miles away to the city of [[Chesapeake, Virginia]]. Malvo pleaded [[insanity plea|not guilty by reason of insanity]] to all charges on the grounds that he was under Muhammad's complete control. One of Malvo's psychiatric witnesses testified that Muhammad, a member of [[Nation of Islam]], had indoctrinated Malvo into believing that the proceeds of an extortion attempt would be used to begin a new nation of only pure black young persons somewhere in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During the trial, Cooley said that violent video games had contributed significantly to Malvo's state of mind and his willingness to commit murder. Cooley said, "He's trained and desensitized with video games, computer games, to train him to shoot human forms over and over."&lt;ref&gt;Liptak, Adam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/23/us/defense-portrays-different-sides-of-sniper-suspect.html?src=pm Defense Portrays Different Sides of Sniper Suspect]". November 23, 2003. The ''New York Times''. Accessed on July 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists [[Lawrence Kutner (psychologist)|Lawrence Kutner]] and Cheryl K. Olson, however, argue in their book ''Grand Theft Childhood'' that other factors were much more significant. "In court, Lee Malvo admitted that he trained by shooting a real gun at paper plates that represented human heads. Also, Malvo had a long history of antisocial and criminal behavior, including torturing small animals, one of the best [[Macdonald triad|predictors of future violent criminal behavior]]."&lt;ref name="GrandTheft"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kutner|first1=Lawrence|last2=Olson|first2=Cheryl K.|title=Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth about Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-7432-9951-5|page=8|url=https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Childhood-Surprising-Violent/dp/0743299515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2003, after nearly 14 hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Malvo of both charges. On December 23, the jury recommended a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of Franklin. On March 10, 2004, Malvo was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

On October 26, 2004, under a [[plea bargain]] to avoid a possible [[death penalty]], Malvo entered an [[Alford plea]] to the charges of murdering Kenneth Bridges and attempting to murder Caroline Seawell while Malvo was in [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia]]. He also pleaded guilty to two firearms charges and agreed not to [[appeal]] his conviction for the murder of Franklin. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole for murder, plus eight years imprisonment for the weapons charges.

One Virginia prosecutor in [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]] had stated he would wait to decide whether to try Malvo on additional capital charges in his jurisdiction until the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled on whether juveniles may be subject to the penalty of [[execution (legal)|execution]]. However, in light of the March 1, 2005 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] prohibits execution for crimes committed when under the age of 18, the prosecutors in [[Prince William County]] decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. However, prosecutors in [[Maryland]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Alabama]] were still interested in putting both Malvo and Muhammad on trial.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

As Malvo was 17 when he committed the crimes, he cannot face the death penalty, but still may be [[extradition|extradited]] to Alabama, Louisiana and other states for prosecution. At the outset of the Beltway sniper prosecutions, the primary reason for extraditing the two suspects from Maryland, where they were arrested, to Virginia was the differences in how the two states deal with the death penalty. While the death penalty was allowed in Maryland, it only applied to persons who were adults at the time of their crimes, whereas Virginia had also allowed the death penalty for offenders who had been juveniles when their crimes were committed. A death sentence was more likely to result in execution in Virginia than in Maryland, which abolished its death penalty in 2013.  
{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In May 2005, Virginia and Maryland reached an agreement to allow Maryland to begin prosecuting some of the pending charges there, and Malvo was extradited to [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] under heavy security.

On June 16, 2006, Malvo told authorities that he and Muhammad were guilty of four additional shootings. The four most recently linked victims were also shot in 2002: a man killed in [[Los Angeles]] during a [[robbery]] in February or March; a 76-year-old man who survived a shooting on May 18 at a golf course in [[Clearwater, Florida]]; a man shot to death while doing yard work in [[Denton, Texas]], May 27; and 54-year-old John Gaeta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/03/04/malvo.sniper.confession/|title=Sniper's apology brings closure, no justice|publisher=[[CNN]]|first=Eliott C.|last=McLaughlin| date=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who survived being shot on August 1 during a robbery outside a shopping mall near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="Malvo reportedly details 4 new shootings"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/640187548/Sniper-reportedly-gives-details-of-4-new-shootings.html |title=Sniper reportedly details 4 new shootings| website=Deseret News|publisher=Associated Press  |date=16 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2006, Malvo pleaded guilty to the six murders he was charged with in Maryland. On October 26, he told police that he and Muhammad had killed Jerry Taylor, 60, as Taylor practiced chip shots at a [[Tucson, Arizona]] golf course in March 2002. Tucson detectives interviewed  Malvo about Taylor, who died from a single gunshot fired at long range, but did not disclose their findings.&lt;ref name="TucsonGolfer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Stephen|title=Tucson police question DC sniper about golf course murder|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2006/10/26/30626-tucson-police-question-dc-sniper-about-golf-course-murder/|accessdate=19 June 2015|work=Tucson Citizen|date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 8, Malvo was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences without possibility of parole.&lt;ref name=Sentence&gt;{{cite news|title= Malvo Apologizes at Md.

== Civil lawsuit ==
In 2003, Malvo and Muhammad were named in a major [[civil lawsuit]] by the Legal Action Project of the [[Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence]] on behalf of two of their victims who were seriously wounded and the families of some of those murdered. Co-defendants Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and [[Bushmaster Firearms International, LLC|Bushmaster Firearms]] contributed to a landmark $2.5 million out-of-court settlement in late 2004.

== The "real plan", as told by Lee Boyd Malvo ==

In Muhammad's May 2006 trial in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], Malvo took the stand and confessed to a more detailed version of the pair's plans. Malvo, after extensive counseling, admitted that he had been lying in the statement he made after his arrest when he admitted to being the triggerman for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this in order to protect Muhammad from the death penalty because it was more difficult to achieve the death penalty for a minor. Malvo stated, "I'm not proud of myself. I'm just trying to make amends", expressing his regret in the shootings.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/05/23/sniper.trial/index.html |title=Malvo: Muhammad 'made me a monster'|work=CNN |date= May 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.

Part of his testimony concerned Muhammad's complete plan, which consisted of three phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase One consisted of meticulously planning, mapping and practicing their locations around the D.C. area so that after each shooting they could quickly leave the area on a predetermined path and move to the next location. Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill six white people a day for 30 days. Malvo went on to describe how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway at different locations.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibd/&gt;

Phase Two was meant to take place in Baltimore. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented, but was never carried out. Phase Two was intended to begin by killing a pregnant woman by shooting her in the abdomen. The next step would have been to shoot and kill a Baltimore police officer. At the officer's funeral, they would plant several [[improvised explosive device]]s. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of police since many police would attend another officer's funeral. More bombs were then to be detonated as ambulances arrived at the scene.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news

The last phase was to take place very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. The third phase was to extort several million dollars from the U.S. government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan to travel north into Canada and recruit other effectively orphaned boys to use weapons and stealth and send them out to commit shootings across the country.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news

Greenberg wrote, "The six consecutive life-without-parole sentences were imposed after a full consideration of Defendant's physical, mental and emotional state".

In [[baseball]], the '''lefty-righty switch''' is a maneuver by which a player that struggles against left- or right-handed players is replaced by a player who excels in the situation, usually only for the duration of the situation in question. For instance, a right-handed [[pitcher]] who is weak against left-handed hitting and is facing a left-handed hitter would be replaced with a pitcher, usually left-handed, who does a superior job of getting a left-handed hitter out. Similarly, a batter who has difficulty hitting against a left-handed pitcher will sometimes be [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]] for by a batter who does well, even if the original player is superior in other respects.

Conventional baseball wisdom suggests that, when a pitcher and a hitter pitch or bat with the same hand, the pitcher typically has the advantage. This especially holds true for left-handed pitchers, as lefties are less common in a major-league lineup than righties. As a result, the most common use of the lefty-righty switch is when a right-handed pitcher is facing a left-handed batter. The manager of the defensive team will sometimes go to the [[bullpen]], especially in close games where a reliever has already entered the game, and pull out a [[left-handed specialist]] to face the left-handed batter. The new pitcher will then attempt to get the batter out. Whether he succeeds or fails, the pitcher will often be replaced after the at-bat.

The lefty-righty switch can also be used against [[switch hitter]]s who are noticeably poorer from one side of the plate than the other, or in the somewhat rarer instance of a batter who does poorly against ''opposite''-handed pitchers. The basic principle in these cases remains the same.

It is less common, although still frequent, for a batter to be replaced to gain a handedness advantage over a pitcher. For instance, with a left-handed pitcher in and a left-handed batter due up, a right-handed bat may be called in from the bench. The righty may not be as strong an all-round player as the player he replaced (thus, his absence from the everyday lineup), but he is a superior tactical choice for the purpose of getting on base in one at bat with a favorable matchup. Such a batter can be [[pinch runner|pinch run]] for if he gets on, replaced with a better defensive player for the next half-inning, or simply left in for the duration of the game.

The two maneuvers sometimes occur in sequence. For instance, a manager may be faced with the situation of a right-handed reliever facing a strong left-handed bat late in a close game. In such a situation, the manager will often call for his left-handed specialist. However, if the opposing manager has an adequate right-handed bat on his bench, he may pinch hit for the left-handed batter, thus restoring his matchup advantage. The rules of baseball dictate that a pitcher must face at least one batter once he has entered a game, therefore the defensive manager will find himself in the unpleasant situation of having his left-handed specialist (who likely seldom sees right-handers in game action and may struggle badly against them) against a right-handed hitter. The defensive manager, however, may consider this an acceptable tradeoff versus facing the original left-handed batter with his right-handed pitcher.

[[Starting pitcher]]s, and sometimes [[long reliever]]s, will often face batters who hit from both sides of the plate as a matter of course. This is considered a part of their job, and the ability to retire batters from either side of the plate is an important asset for any starting pitcher. Most starters, especially those who rely on ball movement rather than power, are still stronger throwing against one side of the plate, however, the difference is often less pronounced than that for pitchers in the bullpen. Late in close games, when the starter is tiring and baserunners become more important, a starter may be lifted for a specialist, but a starting pitcher is ''very'' seldom replaced with a specialist without having first worked deep into a close ballgame.

Similarly, position players must accept facing both left-handed and right-handed pitching as part of their job. Managers will usually juggle batters who are exceptionally weak against one sort of pitcher so that they only face starting pitchers who offer favorable matchups, but it is impossible to shield a batter from every instance in which he will face a pitcher who has him at a disadvantage. As a result, a position player must be prepared at all times to face a lefty-righty switch in a situation where his team cannot afford to pinch hit for him.

This tactical maneuvering has led to the statistical oddity of a pitcher pitching in a game without throwing a single pitch. On June 29, 2018, the [[Cleveland Indians]] visited the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In the bottom of the seventh inning with two outs and two runners on base, the A's were leading 2-0 with left-handed hitters [[Dustin Fowler]] and [[Matt Joyce (baseball)|Matt Joyce]] coming up. Indians manager [[Terry Francona]] replaced his right-handed starter [[Trevor Bauer]] with left-handed specialist [[Oliver Perez]]. The A's countered by pinch-hitting [[Mark Canha]] for Fowler, whom Perez intentionally walked by holding out four fingers to the home plate umpire (a newly implemented option for the 2018 season). But this loaded the bases for [[Chad Pinder]], who pinch-hit for Joyce. Francona did not want Perez to face a righty and had no base to put the batter onto, so he removed Perez in favor of right-handed reliever [[Zach McAllister]]. Perez was therefore credited with zero innings pitched, one batter faced, one walk, and zero pitches thrown.

{{main|Polish–Swedish union|War against Sigismund|Battle of Stångebro}}

The '''Linköping Bloodbath''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish:]] ''Linköpings blodbad'') on 20 March 1600 was the [[public execution]] by [[Decapitation|beheading]] of five Swedish nobles in the aftermath of the [[War against Sigismund]] (1598–1599), which resulted in the ''de facto'' deposition of the [[Polish–Swedish union|Polish and Swedish]] King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] as [[List of Swedish monarchs|king of Sweden]]. The five were advisors to Catholic Sigismund or political opponents of the latter's uncle and adversary, the Swedish regent [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Charles]].

==Detention, trial and execution==

King Sigismund, eldest son to King [[John III of Sweden|John III]], had inherited the crown from his father and been crowned the rightful king of Sweden after giving assurances that he would not act to aid the Catholic cause in Sweden during the mounting religious turmoil of the [[counter-reformation]] in the late 16th century. He violated the agreement, setting off civil war in Sweden. After trying to manage the Swedish situation from afar, Sigismund invaded with a mercenary army after receiving permission from the Polish legislature, and initially was successful. The turning point of his Swedish campaign was the [[Battle of Stångebro]] on 25 September 1598, also known as the Battle of Linköping, where Sigismund became trapped in an unfavourable position and had to agree to a truce with Charles.&lt;ref name=Peterson106&gt;Peterson (2007), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Charles' conditions for the truce was the handing over of [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish privy counsellors]] from Sigismund's camp.&lt;ref name=Peterson106/&gt; Sigismund complied.&lt;ref name=Peterson106/&gt;

Most prominent among these Swedish senators was the [[Chancellor of Sweden]], Erik Sparre.&lt;ref name=Peterson106/&gt; While Charles did not detain Sigismund as well, he forced him to agree to the [[Treaty of Linköping]] and to agree that their dispute would be settled by a future [[Riksdag of the Estates]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=Peterson106/&gt; Sigismund retreated to the port of [[Kalmar]], but instead of sailing to Stockholm, he took his sister [[Anna Vasa of Sweden|Anna]], left for [[Danzig]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and never returned to Sweden again.&lt;ref name=Peterson106/&gt; Charles then crushed the remaining military opposition from forces loyal to Sigismund and those nobles who had previously taken control of Finland in the [[Cudgel War]].&lt;ref name=Peterson106107&gt;Peterson (2007), pp. 106&amp;ndash;107.&lt;/ref&gt; During these campaigns, some nobles were tried, executed or detained.&lt;ref name=Peterson107&gt;Peterson (2007), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Executions, including the so-called [[Åbo Bloodbath]], were carried out through [[decapitation]] or [[impalement]], Charles himself executed a son of his adversary [[Klaus Fleming|Clas Fleming]].&lt;ref name=Roberts386&gt;Roberts (1968), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in March 1600 a riksdag met in [[Linköping]], Charles, who was meanwhile created omnipotent ruler of Sweden and had repeatedly been offered the Swedish crown, set up a court to try his remaining prisoners.&lt;ref name=Peterson107/&gt; The court, headed by [[Axel Leijonhufvud]] and [[Erik Brahe]], consisted of 155 members, with Charles himself being the prosecutor.&lt;ref name=Peterson107/&gt; Tried were six nobles captured in Stångebro and two Finnish nobles captured later, including [[Arvid Stålarm the Younger|Arvid Stålarm]],&lt;ref name=Peterson107/&gt; who in 1598 had intended to aid Sigismund in Stångebro, but aborted the action when his army had reached Stockholm from Finland only after Sigismund had accepted the aforementioned truce.&lt;ref name=Peterson106/&gt; The other Finnish noble, [[Axel Kurck]], was sentenced to death along with Stålarm in Finland already, but the verdict had been suspended to again try them in Linköping.&lt;ref name=Roberts386/&gt; These eight noblemen were eventually sentenced to death, but three of them were pardoned.

The noblemen publicly executed on the Linköping market square on 20 March 1600&lt;ref name=Peterson107/&gt; were:
# Erik Sparre&lt;ref name=Peterson107/&gt;&lt;ref name=Samuelson134&gt;Samuelson (1993), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; — the [[Lord High Chancellor of Sweden|Chancellor of Sweden]] and a [[senator]] in the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksens ständer]]
# Ture Nilsson Bielke&lt;ref name=Samuelson134/&gt; — a senator in the ''Riksens ständer''
# [[Gustaf Banér]]&lt;ref name=Samuelson134/&gt; —  a senator in the ''Riksens ständer'' and father of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus II Adolphus the Great's]] Swedish [[Field Marshal]] [[Johan Banér]]
# Sten Banér&lt;ref name=Samuelson134/&gt; — a senator in the ''Riksens ständer''
# Bengt Falck — a senator in the ''Riksens ständer''

==Aftermath==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2018}}
Sigismund, who was allowed to return to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not relinquish his desire to regain the throne of Sweden. This attitude led to a series of [[Polish–Swedish wars]], that culminated during the reign of his son, [[John II Casimir of Poland]], with the giant Swedish invasion of Poland known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]], ending the golden age of the Commonwealth. On 24 July 1599, the ''Riksens ständer'' (''[[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]'') in Stockholm officially dethroned Sigismund and named Charles IX Vasa as regent, and the Polish–Swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence. Subsequently, [[Charles IX of Sweden]] was named by the ''Riksens ständer'' as the new [[King of Sweden]] in 1604, and the crown would pass to [[Gustavus the Great]], who established his early reputation as an outstanding military leader in campaigns during the early years of the [[Polish–Swedish wars]]. Indirectly, the religious conflict in Sweden led to the [[Swedish Empire]] as Gustavus and his generals became militant in the cause of Protestants in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

'''Léonie Gilmour''' (June 17, 1873 - December 31, 1933) was an American educator, editor, and journalist. She was the lover and editor of the writer [[Yone Noguchi]] and the mother of sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi]] and dancer [[Ailes Gilmour]].  She is the subject of the feature film ''[[Leonie (film)|Leonie]]'' (2010) and the book ''Leonie Gilmour: When East Weds West'' (2013).

==Life==
Léonie Gilmour was born in [[New York City]] on June 17, 1873, and grew up in the [[East Village, Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 12. Masayo Duus, ''The Life of Isamu Noguchi'', 20-21, erroneously gives her birth year as 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her birth, her father, Andrew Gilmour, a clerk, and mother, Albiana Gilmour (née Smith, daughter of one of the co-founders of the ''[[Brooklyn Times-Union]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'',  16.&lt;/ref&gt; were living "in one room in a rear house"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', ''Leonie Gilmour'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; in St. Bridget's Place, the alley behind [[St. Brigid Roman Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Brigid's Church]] on the east side of [[Tompkins Square Park]]. Léonie was among the first students at the Free Kindergarten organized by [[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]]'s [[Ethical Culture Society]] and became a member of the first class of the Workingman's School (later [[Ethical Culture School]]). After her graduation in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler found a place for her at the recently opened [[Bryn Mawr School]] in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the few students to pass the Bryn Mawr School's rigorous graduation requirements, she was awarded its first four-year college scholarship, funded by school president [[Mary Garrett]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 34-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

As was expected, Gilmour enrolled at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in the fall of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an early interest in [[Chemistry]], she eventually chose to major in [[History]] and [[Political Science]] as her major fields.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In her third year, following the example of many students preparing for the school's rigorous foreign language exams (which required students to translate on sight from Greek, Latin, French and German), Léonie decided to spend a year abroad studying at the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 40&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her return in the fall of 1894, she was assigned to the same residence hall dining table as incoming student Catharine Bunnell (niece of future Yale benefactor [[John William Sterling]]), and the two became lifelong friends.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1895, an illness leading to hospitalization led to Gilmour's withdrawal from the college, her transcript citing "reasons of health," although Gilmour's biographer speculates that the expiration of her four-year scholarship the previous year may have been a contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 52&lt;/ref&gt; She never completed her degree. Her friend Catharine Bunnell also withdrew from the college at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Bryn Mawr College in 1896, she taught at [[Academy of St. Aloysius]] in [[New Jersey]] and worked at various editing jobs. In 1901, she answered a classified advertisement placed by [[Yone Noguchi]], a 25-year-old Japanese writer who had recently arrived in New York. Noguchi had spent seven years in [[California]] and had published two books of English poetry, but his mastery of English was insecure. Gilmour agreed to become his editor. The relationship proved successful, and with Gilmour's assistance, Noguchi resumed work on a fictional diary of a Japanese girl published in 1902 as ''[[The American Diary of a Japanese Girl]]''.

Following Noguchi's return from [[England]] in 1903, the relationship took an amorous turn, and on November 18, Noguchi wrote out a declaration of questionable legality stating that "Leonie Gilmour is my Lawful wife."&lt;ref&gt;Yone Noguchi to Leonie Gilmour, 18 Nov. 1903, in Noguchi, ''Collected English Letters'', #254.&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage remained secret and the two continued to maintain separate residences.  When the arrangement proved less than successful, it appeared that the experiment would simply be brought to an end in the early months of 1904 with no one being the wiser. Noguchi resumed his relationship with [[Washington, D.C.]] journalist [[Ethel Armes]]&lt;ref&gt;Noguchi to Charles Warren Stoddard, (1904) in Noguchi, ''Collected English Letters'' #353.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the onset of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], began making plans to return to Japan in the fall.

Trouble developed, however, when Gilmour discovered she had become pregnant during the waning days of the relationship.  Rather than pressing Noguchi for a reconciliation, she chose to join her mother in [[Los Angeles]], and gave birth to [[Isamu Noguchi]] on November 18, 1904.

The birth was publicized when a ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'' reporter visited Léonie in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botchanmedia.com/YN/articles/herald-babe.htm "Yone Noguchi's Babe Pride of Hospital: White Wife of Author Presents Husband With Son," ''Los Angeles Herald'', 27 Nov. 1904, p. 8. ]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ethel Armes]] confirmed the truth of the story and canceled her engagement to Noguchi, Noguchi began attempting to persuade Gilmour to come to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Yone, Noguchi to Leonie Gilmour, 6 Apr. 1905, in Noguchi, ''Collected English Letters'', #366.&lt;/ref&gt; Léonie resisted for some months before finally agreeing. By the time she arrived in March 1907 Noguchi had become involved with a Japanese woman, Takeda Matsuko.&lt;ref&gt;Duus 2004, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tokyo]], Gilmour worked primarily as a teacher and resumed her helpful role as Noguchi's editorial assistant. Unable to use her [[alma mater]] connection with [[Tsuda Umeko]] to secure a position at [[Tsuda College]] as she hoped, Léonie worked at a [[Yokohama]] school and privately tutored the children of the late [[Lafcadio Hearn]], among others.

Domestic arrangements proved strained even before Léonie belatedly learned of the existence of Takeda Matsuko, around the time of Matsuko's second pregnancy by Noguchi. Léonie separated from Noguchi in 1909, taking Isamu, and living in a series of residences in [[Ōmori]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Chigasaki]].  In 1912 as a result of a relationship with a man whose identity remains mysterious (Isamu Noguchi biographer Masayo Duus speculates that he was one of Léonie's students&lt;ref&gt;Duus 2004, 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;) she gave birth to a daughter, [[Ailes Gilmour]].

Gilmour sent Isamu back to the United States to attend an experimental school in 1918. She and Ailes continued to reside in Japan until 1920 when they returned to the United States, settling in [[San Francisco]], and later moving to New York, where she successfully dissuaded Isamu from his plan to attend medical school and redirected him to the artist's vocation she had chosen for him when he was still an infant.&lt;ref&gt;Duus 2004, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ailes was sent to a progressive school in [[Connecticut]].

Gilmour herself made ends meet through a small import/export business and various other jobs. In December 1933 she was admitted to New York's [[Bellevue Hospital]] with [[pneumonia]] and died on [[New Year's Eve]] of [[coronary thrombosis]] with [[arteriosclerosis]] as a contributory factor.&lt;ref&gt;Duus 2004, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary works===
Although Gilmour harbored literary aspirations, her achievements as a writer were limited.  Much of her literary energy was channeled into her editorial projects, particularly those of her partner, [[Yone Noguchi]].  It has been speculated that she may have co-authored or authored some works attributed to him, such as ''[[The American Diary of a Japanese Girl]]'', and there is little doubt that much of Noguchi's best writing was accomplished with her editorial assistance.

As an author in her own right, Gilmour's most successful pieces were short [[autobiographical]] essays for newspapers and magazines chronicling unfortunate events with a wry ironic humor, In a [[picaresque]], matter-of-fact style, Gilmour described the unusual situations in which she found herself as a result of her unconventional attitudes and lifestyle.  Gilmour's "Founding a Tent-Home in California," for example, shows turn-of-the-century [[Los Angeles]] from the perspective of a hapless, idealistic new arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 125-32.&lt;/ref&gt; "Dorobo, or the Japanese Burglar" portrays the experience of being burglarized with a humorous perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"Dorobo, or the Japanese Burglar," ''New York Times'', 17 Jul. 1921, p.&amp;nbsp;44.{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of her life, at the request of her son, Gilmour had begun writing a memoir which she referred to as "the book."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 389.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidently included the brief account of her childhood entitled "St. Bridget's Child,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, "St. Bridget's Child," in Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "The Kid Chronicle that Was Not Written" (describing her meeting and correspondence with [[Charles Warren Stoddard]])&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 390-1.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Inside Looking On: When East Weds West."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 315-20.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these were unpublished at the time of her death, as was her story about [[Ailes Gilmour|Ailes]]' arrival in San Francisco, "Ai-chan Goes to Frisco."&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, "Ai-Chan Goes to Frisco: (A little Eurasian girl writes to her friend in Japan)" in Marx, ''Leonie Gilmour'', 304-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest in Gilmour===
Gilmour's unconventional life and perspectives have made her the subject of interest among scholars and a Japanese filmmaker.  In 2009, Japanese filmmaker {{nihongo|[[Matsui Hisako]]|松井久子|}} began production of ''[[Leonie (film)|Leonie]]'', a film based on Gilmour's life. Actress [[Emily Mortimer]] played the role of Gilmour in the film. A book, ''Leonie Gilmour: When East Weds West'', including a biography of Gilmour by Edward Marx, along with Gilmour's collected writings, was published in 2013.

'''Maria Stefania Bohuszewiczówna''' (1865–1887) was a Polish revolutionary and a leader of the [[First Proletariat]] party.

Bohuszewiczówna was born on January 4, 1865 in the village of Ceperce (near [[Slutsk]] in what is now [[Belarus]]). She moved to Warsaw in 1874. In 1882 and 1883 she attended courses at the [[Flying University]]. From 1882 she was active in the [[Political Red Cross]]. After a wave of arrests in July 1884, Bohuszewiczówna was elected to the central committee of the First Proletariat party. 

On March 2, 1885, Bohuszewiczówna organized a demonstration for the unemployed at [[Castle Square, Warsaw|Castle Square]]. For this activity she was arrested on September 29, 1885, and imprisoned in the [[Warsaw Citadel]], where she was placed in a cell with [[Julia Razumiejczyk]] and [[Rozalia Felsenhardt]]. On May 12, 1887, she was sentenced to [[exile|internal exile]] in [[Siberia]]. She died in 1887 in [[Krasnoyarsk]] while on the way to her assigned location.

'''Medial inferior pontine syndrome''' is a condition associated with a [[contralateral]] [[hemiplegia]].

"Medial inferior pontine syndrome" has been described as equivalent to [[Foville's syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid9023501"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hubloue I, Laureys S, Michotte A |title=A rare case of diplopia: medial inferior pontine syndrome or Foville's syndrome |journal=Eur J Emerg Med |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=194–8 |date=September 1996 |pmid=9023501 |doi= 10.1097/00063110-199609000-00011|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Although medial pontine syndrome  has many similarities to [[medial medullary syndrome]], because it is located higher up the [[brainstem]] in the [[pons]], it affects a different set of cranial nuclei.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure affected
! Presentation
|-
| [[Corticospinal tract]]
| Contralateral spastic [[hemiparesis]]
|-
| [[Medial lemniscus]]
| Contralateral [[Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway|PCML]] (aka DCML) pathway loss (tactile, vibration, and stereognosis)
|-
| [[Abducens nerve]]
| [[Strabismus]] (ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle paralysis - the affected eye looks down and towards the nose). Abducens nerve lesion localizes the lesion to inferior pons.
|}

Depending upon the size of the infarct, it can also involve the [[facial nerve]].

==Cause==
[[Image:Human brainstem blood supply description.JPG|thumb|Human brainstem blood supply description. [[Basilar artery]] is #7, and [[pons]] is visible below it.]]
Medial pontine syndrome results from occlusion of paramedian branches of the [[basilar artery]].

'''August Joseph Norbert Burgmüller''' (8 February 1810{{spaced ndash}}7 May 1836) was a German composer.

==Life==
Burgmüller was born in [[Düsseldorf]], the youngest son in a musical family. His father, August Burgmüller, was the director of a theatre. His mother, Therese von Zandt, was a singer and piano teacher. He had two brothers, Franz and [[Johann Friedrich Franz Burgmüller|Friedrich]]. Friedrich was also a composer. After the death of their father, the family had financial troubles. They were given support from Count [[Franz von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven]].

Burgmüller studied with [[Joseph Kreutzer]] in Düsseldorf, and [[Louis Spohr]] and Spohr's pupil [[Moritz Hauptmann]] in [[Kassel]]. After his study he became their piano teacher. He became engaged to [[Sophia Roland]], but in 1830 the relationship ended, to Norbert's distress. He became [[seizure|epileptic]] and began to drink excessively.

In the same year he returned to Düsseldorf to live with his mother. There he befriended [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. He became engaged to [[Josephine Collin]], but this relationship ended too. After Mendelssohn left for [[Leipzig]] in 1835, Burgmüller made plans to leave for Paris, where his brother Friedrich had gone. In 1836 he went to a [[destination spa|spa]] in [[Aachen]], where he drowned during an epileptic seizure.

[[Robert Schumann]], who arranged for the posthumous publication of Burgmüller's two symphonies, and completed the orchestration of the [[scherzo]] of the unfinished Symphony No. 2, wrote in a memorial notice that no death was more deplorable than that of Norbert Burgmüller since the early death of [[Franz Schubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. 1954, [[Eric Blom]], ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nothomyrmecia''''', also known as the '''dinosaur ant''' or '''dawn ant''', is a rare [[genus]] of [[ant]]s consisting of a single [[species]], '''''Nothomyrmecia macrops'''''. It lives in South Australia, nesting in old-growth [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] woodland and ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' woodland. The full distribution of ''Nothomyrmecia'' has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread it really is; its potential range may be wider if it does favour [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] mallee woodland. Possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and climate change. ''Nothomyrmecia'' is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as ''[[carpenter ant|Camponotus]]'' and ''[[Iridomyrmex]]'', and it also increases hunting success. Thus, the increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for the ant to live in. As a result, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] lists the ant as [[Critically Endangered]].

A medium-sized ant, ''Nothomyrmecia'' measures {{convert|9.7-11|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Workers are [[Polymorphism (biology)|monomorphic]], showing little morphological differentiation among one another. Mature colonies are very small, with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest. Workers are strictly [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] (active mainly at night) and are solitary foragers, collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] from [[scale insect]]s and other [[Hemiptera]]. They rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that the species use chemicals to communicate when foraging, but they do use chemical alarm signals. A queen ant will mate with one or more males and, during colony foundation, she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. Queens are [[Voltinism|univoltine]] (i.e. they produce just one generation of ants each year). Two queens may establish a colony together, but only one will remain once the first generation of workers has been reared.

''Nothomyrmecia'' was first [[species description|described]] by Australian entomologist [[John S. Clark]] in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants. These were reportedly collected in 1931 near the Russell Range, inland from [[Israelite Bay, Western Australia|Israelite Bay]] in Western Australia. After its initial discovery, the ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977, {{convert|1300|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the original reported site. Dubbed as the '[[Holy Grail]]' of [[myrmecology]], the ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery, attracting scientists from around the world.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUCN_1983/&gt; In [[Poochera, South Australia|Poochera]] (the rediscovery site), pictures of the ant are stenciled on the streets, and it is perhaps the only town in the world that thrives off ant-based tourism. Some entomologists have suggested a relationship to the [[Baltic amber|Baltic Eocene fossil]] ant genus ''[[Prionomyrmex]]'' based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities, but this interpretation is not widely accepted by the entomological community. Owing to its body structure, ''Nothomyrmecia'' is regarded to be the most primitive ant alive and a '[[living fossil]]', stimulating studies on its morphology, behaviour, ecology, and chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Nothomyrmecia macrops casent0172003 head 1.jpg|thumbnail|Closeup view of a worker's head|alt=Head of worker dinosaur ant with large eyes and long mandibles]]
 
''Nothomyrmecia'' is a medium-sized ant, measuring {{convert|9.7-11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. Workers are [[Polymorphism (biology)|monomorphic]], meaning that there is little morphological differentiation among one another.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor_2014"/&gt; The mandibles, [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]] (one of the [[sclerite]]s that make up the "face" of an arthropod or insect), antennae and legs are pale yellow. The hairs on the body are yellow, erect and long and abundant, but on the antennae and legs they are shorter and suberect (standing almost in an erect position). Though it shows similar characteristics to ''[[Myrmecia (ant)|Myrmecia]]'', ''Nothomyrmecia'' somewhat resembles ''[[Oecophylla]]'', commonly known as weaver ants. Workers are strictly [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] (active mainly at night) but navigate by vision, relying on large [[Eye#Compound eyes|compound eyes]].&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_Wilson_1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown |first1=W.L. Jr. |last2=Wilson |first2=E.O. |title=The search for ''Nothomyrmecia'' |journal=Western Australian Naturalist |date=1959 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=25–30 |url=http://52.0.117.255/ants/publications/6780/6780.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dIig4RBX?url=http://52.0.117.255/ants/publications/6780/6780.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandibles are shorter than the head. They have 10 to 15 intermeshing teeth and are less specialised than those of ''Myrmecia'' and ''[[Prionomyrmex]]'', being elongate and triangular. The head is longer than it is wide and broader towards the back. The sides of the head are convex around the eyes. The long antennal [[Antenna (biology)#Structure|scape]]s (the base of the antenna) extend beyond the occipital border, and the second [[Segmentation (biology)|segment]] of the [[Pedicel (antenna)|funiculus]] (a series of segments between the base and [[Antenna (biology)#Structure|club]]) is slightly longer than the first, third and fourth segment. The node, [[pronotum]], [[propodeum|epinotum]] and thorax are longer than broad, and the [[mesonotum]] is just as long as it is wide. The first segment of the [[Gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]] (the bulbous posterior portion of the [[metasoma]]) is broader than long by a third and broader at the back than the front with strongly convex sides.&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name='"Heterick_2009"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heterick|first1=B.E.|title=A guide to the ants of South-western Australia|journal=Records of the Western Australian Museum, Supplement|date=2009|volume=76|pages=1–206|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/1.%20Heterick.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long and retractable [[stinger]] is present at the rear of the abdomen. It has been described as "prominent and effective" and is capable of inflicting a painful sting to humans.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt; A 'sting bulb gland' is also present in ''Nothomyrmecia''; this is a small [[exocrine gland]] of unknown function, first discovered and named in 1990. It is situated in the basal part of the insect's sting, and is located between the two ducts of the venom gland and the [[Dufour's gland]].&lt;ref name="Billen_1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Billen|first1=J.|title=The sting bulb gland in ''Myrmecia'' and ''Nothomyrmecia'' (Hymenoptera : Formicidae): new exocrine gland in ants|journal=International Journal of Insect Morphology and Embryology|date=1990|volume=19|issue=2|pages=133–139|doi=10.1016/0020-7322(90)90023-I|url=http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/images/e/eb/Billen_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its many [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] features, the [[Stinger#Arthropods|sting apparatus]] of ''Nothomyrmecia'' is considered less primitive than those found in other ants such as ''[[Stigmatomma pallipes]]''.&lt;ref name="Kugler_1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kugler|first1=C.|title=The sting apparatus in the primitive ants ''Nothomyrmecia'' and ''Myrmecia''|journal=Australian Journal of Entomology|date=1980|volume=19|issue=4|pages=263–267|doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.1980.tb00983.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only known species of ant that contains both a sting and a 'waist' (i.e. it has no [[Petiole (insect anatomy)|postpetiole]] between the first and second gastral segments).&lt;ref name="Clarke_Spier-Ashcroft"/&gt;

[[File:Nothomyrmecia macrops casent0902784 p 1 high.jpg|thumbnail|left|''N. macrops'', winged male|alt=Male dinosaur ant with long, functional wings]]
Queens look similar to workers, but several morphological features distinguish the two castes from each other. Although their body structure is similar to that of workers, the queens are usually larger. [[Ocelli]] are highly developed, but the eyes on the queen are not enlarged. The structure of the pterothorax (the wing-bearing area of the thorax) is consistent with other reproductive ants, although it does not occupy as much of its mesosomal bulk. The wings of the queens are reduced to the point that they are not functional (they are [[Brachyptery|brachypterous]]).&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;{{sfn|Hölldobler|Wilson|1990|p=302}} Their wings are noticeably rudimentary and stubby, barely overlapping the first gastral segment. Males resemble those of ''Myrmecia'', but ''Nothomyrmecia'' males bear a single waist node. The wings on the male ant are not stubby like a queen's; rather they are long and fully developed, exhibiting a primitive [[wikt:venation|venational complement]],  They have a jugal anal lobe (a portion of the hindwing), a feature found in many primitive ants, and basal [[Hamulus#Arthropoda|hamuli]] (hook-like projections that link the forewings and hindwings). Most male specimens collected have two [[Arthropod leg#Tibia|tibial spur]]s (spines located on the distal end of the tibia); the first spur is a long [[calcar]] while the second spur is short and thick. Adults have a [[Stridulation|stridulatory]] organ on the ventral side of the abdomen – unlike all other [[hymenoptera]]ns in which such organs are located dorsally.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

In all castes, these ants have six maxillary [[Pedipalp|palp]]s (palps that serve as organs of touch and taste in feeding) and four labial palps (sensory structures on the [[Insect mouthparts#Labium|labium]]), a highly primitive feature. The females have a 12-segmented antenna, whereas males have 13 segments. Other features include paired calcariae found on both the hind and middle tibiae, and the claws have a median tooth. The unspecialised nature of the [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] (outer exoskeleton of the body) is similar to ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'', a member of the subfamily [[Pseudomyrmecinae]]. Many of the features known in ''Nothomyrmecia'' are found in Ponerinae and Pseudomyrmecinae.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

[[File:ANTWEB1008555 Nothomyrmecia macrops.jpg|thumb|Stinger of ''N. macrops''|alt=Microscopic image of the stinger of Nothomyrmecia macrops, appearing needle-like]]
The eggs of ''Nothomyrmecia'' are similar to those of ''Myrmecia'', being subspherical and non-adhesive. The larvae bear a primitive body structure with no specialised [[tubercle]]s, sharing similar characteristics with the subfamily Ponerinae, but the [[Sensillum|sensilla]] are more abundant on the mouthparts. The larvae are characterised into three stages: very young, young, and mature, measuring {{convert|2.8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|6.3|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="Wheeler_Wheeler_Taylor_1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=G.C.|last2=Wheeler|first2=J.|last3=Taylor|first3=R.W.|title=The larval and egg stages of the primitive ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' Clark (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|journal=Australian Journal of Entomology|date=1980|volume=19|issue=2|pages=131–137|doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.1980.tb00974.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cocoons have thin walls and produce meconium (a metabolic waste product expelled through the anal opening after an insect emerges from its pupal stage).&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt; The cuticular [[hydrocarbon]]s have internally branched [[alkenes]], a feature rarely found in ants and most insects.&lt;ref name="Brown_Jaisson_Taylor_Lacey_1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=W.V.|last2=Jaisson|first2=P.|last3=Taylor|first3=R.W.|last4=Lacey|first4=M.J.|title=Novel internally branched, internal alkenes as major components of the cuticular hydrocarbons of the primitive Australian ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' Clark (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=1990|volume=16|issue=9|pages=2623–2635|doi=10.1007/BF00988074|pmid=24264318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the body structure of all ''Nothomyrmecia'' castes demonstrates the primitive nature of the species.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt; Notable [[Synapomorphy|derived features]] include vestigal ocelli on workers, brachypterous queens, and the [[Mesothorax|mesoscutal structure]] on males. The morphology of the abdomen, mandibles, gonoforceps (a sclerite, serving as the base of the [[ovipositor]]s sheath) and basal hamuli show it is more primitive than ''Myrmecia''. The structure of the abdominal region can separate it from other Myrmeciinae relatives (the fourth abdominal segment of ''Myrmecia'' is tubulate, whereas ''Nothomyrmecia'' has a non-tubulated abdominal segment). The appearance of the fourth abdominal segment is consistent with almost all [[Aculeata|aculeate]] insects, and possibly ''[[Sphecomyrma]]''.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

The feature of non-functional, vestigial wings may have evolved in this species relatively recently, as wings might otherwise have long-since disappeared completely had they no function for dispersal. Wing-reduction could somehow relate to population structure or some other specialised ecological pressure. Equally, wing-reduction might be a feature that only forms in drought-stressed colonies, as has been observed in several ''[[Monomorium]]'' ant species found throughout semi-arid regions of Australia. As yet, scientists do not fully understand how the feature of non-functional, vestigial wings arose in ''Nothomyrmecia macrops''.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

===Discovery===
[[File:Nothomyrmecia macrops casent0172002 profile 1.jpg|thumbnail|''N. macrops'' worker specimen collected by Taylor|alt=Side view of worker dinosaur ant]]
The first collection of ''Nothomyrmecia'' was made in December 1931 by amateur entomologist, Amy Crocker,{{efn|Referred to as Miss. A.&amp;nbsp;E. Baesjou in Clark's article.}} whose colleagues had collected a range of insect samples for her during a field excursion, including specimens of two worker ants, reportedly near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=J.S.|year=1934 |title=Notes on Australian ants, with descriptions of new species and a new genus |journal=Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria|volume=8 |pages=5–20|url=http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/images/4/41/Clark_1934a.pdf|doi=10.5281/zenodo.26629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crocker then passed the ants to Australian entomologist [[John S. Clark]]. Recognised shortly afterwards as a new species, these specimens became the [[syntype]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt; Entomologist Robert W. Taylor subsequently expressed doubt about the accuracy of recording of the original discovery site, stating the specimens were probably collected from the western end of the [[Great Australian Bight]], south from [[Balladonia, Western Australia|Balladonia]].&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt; The discovery of ''Nothomyrmecia'' and the appearance of its unique body structure led scientists in 1951 to initiate a series of searches to find the ant in Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Brown_Wilson_1959"/&gt; Over three decades, teams of Australian and American collectors failed to re-find it; entomologists such as [[E.

===Naming===
In 1934 entomologist John S. Clark published a formal [[species description|description]] of ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' as a new species and within a completely new genus and tribe (Nothomyrmecii) of the [[Ponerinae]].&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt; He did so because the two specimens (which then became the syntypes) bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of, although they did share similar morphological characteristics with the extinct genus ''Prionomyrmex''. Clark notes that the head and mandibles of ''Nothomyrmecia'' and ''Prionomyrmex'' are somewhat similar, but the two can be distinguished by the appearance of the node (a segment between the [[mesosoma]] and gaster).&lt;ref name="Clark_1934"/&gt; In 1951, Clark proposed the new ant subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae for his ''Nothomyrmecia'', based on morphological differences with other ponerine ants.&lt;ref name="Clark1951"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Clark |first1=J.S. |title=The Formicidae of Australia (Volume 1).

This proposal would place the ant into its own subfamily, despite many familiar morphological characteristics between the two genera. This separation from ''Myrmecia'' was retained until 2000.&lt;ref name="Dlussky_Fedoseeva"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaisson/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton_1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolton|first1=B.|title=Army ants reassessed: the phylogeny and classification of the doryline section (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)|journal=Journal of Natural History|date=1990|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1339–1364|doi=10.1080/00222939000770811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Urbani2000/&gt;

In 2000, entomologist Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new Baltic fossil ''Prionomyrmex'' species (''P. janzeni''). After examining specimens of ''Nothomyrmecia'', Baroni Urbani stated that his new species and ''N. macrops'' were so morphologically similar that they belonged to the same genus. He proposed that the name ''Prionomyrmex'' should replace the name ''Nothomyrmecia'' (which would then be just a synonym), and also that the subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae should be called Prionomyrmeciinae.&lt;ref name=Urbani2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baroni Urbani|first1=C.|title=Rediscovery of the Baltic amber ant genus ''Prionomyrmex'' (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) and its taxonomic consequences|journal=Eclogae geologicae Helveticae|date=2000|volume=93|issue=3|pages=471–480|url=http://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=egh-001:2000:93::628#507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Russian palaeoentomologists G.&amp;nbsp;M. Dlussky and E.&amp;nbsp;B.

===Genetics and phylogeny===
Studies show that all [[hymenoptera]]n insects that have a [[Ploidy|diploid]] (2n) chromosome count above 52 are themselves all ants; ''Nothomyrmecia'' and another Ponerinae ant, ''[[Platythyrea tricuspidata]]'', share the highest number of chromosomes within all the Hymenoptera, having a diploid chromosome number of 92–94.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Imai|first1=H.T.|last2=Taylor|first2=R.W.|last3=Kubota|first3=M.|last4=Ogata|first4=K.|last5=Wada|first5=M.Y.|title=Notes on the remarkable karyology of the primitive ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'', and of the related genus ''Myrmecia'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology|date=1990|volume=97|issue=3–4|pages=133–140|doi=10.1155/1990/91237|url=http://antwiki.org/wiki/images/4/41/Taylor_et_al_1991.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic evidence suggests that the age of the [[most recent common ancestor]] for ''Nothomyrmecia'' and ''Myrmecia'' is approximately 74 million years old, giving a likely origin in the [[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref name="Ward2003"/&gt; There are two hypotheses of the internal phylogeny of ''Nothomyrmecia'': subfamily [[Formicinae]] is more closely related to ''Nothomyrmecia'' than it is to ''Myrmecia'', evolving from ''Nothomyrmecia''-like ancestors. Alternatively, ''Nothomyrmecia'' and [[Aneuretinae]] may have shared a common ancestor; the two most likely separated from each other, and the first formicines evolved from the Aneuretinae instead. Currently, scientists agree that ''Nothomyrmecia'' most likely evolved from ancestors to the Ponerinae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veeresh|first1=G.K.|last2=Mallik|first2=B.|last3=Viraktamath|first3=C.A.|title=Social Insects and the Environment|date=1990|publisher=E.J.

[[File:Nothomyrmecia macrops occurrence map.png|thumbnail|Reported occurrences of ''Nothomyrmecia'' according to the [[Atlas of Living Australia]]|alt=Map of Australia showing reported occurrences of ''Nothomyrmecia''.]]
''Nothomyrmecia'' is present in the cool regions of [[South Australia]] within [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] woodland and especially [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] areas populated with various ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' species, including ''[[Eucalyptus brachycalyx]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus gracilis|E. gracilis]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus oleosa|E. oleosa]]''.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; It is possible that it also occurs in Western Australia, from where it was first collected.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/nothomyrmecia-macrops.html |title=Dinosaur Ant, Fossil Ant (''Nothomyrmecia macrops'')

If it does favour old-growth mallee woodland, it could have the potential for a wider range than is currently known from surveys and museum specimens. In 1998, ''Nothomyrmecia'' colonies were located in 18 areas along the [[Eyre Peninsula]] by a team of entomologists, a stretch of {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster_1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=C.H.S.|last2=McArthur|first2=A.J.|last3=Foster|first3=R.|title=Notes on the distribution of the dinosaur ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' Clark (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in South Australia|journal=Australian Entomologist|date=1998|volume=25|issue=1|pages=29–31|issn=1320-6133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foraging, diet and predators===
[[File:Nothomyrmecia macrops feeding on honey bait.jpg|thumb|left|Workers feeding on honey bait|alt=Foraging workers feeding on experimental honey on a tree.]]

Workers are able to lay unfertilised eggs specifically to feed the larvae; these are known as [[trophic egg]]s. Sometimes the adults, including the queen and other sexually active ants, consume these eggs. Workers [[Trophallaxis|transfer food]] to other nestmates, including winged adults and larvae; the anal droplets are exuded by the larvae, which are taken up by the workers.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

Age caste polyethism does not occur in ''Nothomyrmecia'', where the younger workers act as nurses and tend to the brood and the older workers go out and forage. The only ant known other than ''Nothomyrmecia'' which does not exhibit age caste polyethism is ''Stigmatomma pallipes''.&lt;ref name="Taylor_2014"/&gt; Workers are strictly [[nocturnality|nocturnal]], and only emerge from their nests on cold nights.&lt;ref name="Taylor_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=R.W.|title=Evidence for the absence of worker behavioral subcastes in the sociobiologically primitive Australian ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' Clark (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmeciinae)|journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology|date=2014|volume=2014|issue=4707|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2014/232057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster_1998"/&gt;  They are most active at temperatures of {{convert|5–10|C|0|abbr=on}}, and are much more difficult to locate on warmer nights. Workers are possibly most active when it is cold because at these times they encounter fewer and less aggressive competitors, including other more dominant diurnal ant species that are sometimes found foraging during warm nights. Cold temperatures may also hamper the escape of prey items, so increasing the ants' hunting success.&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt; Unless a forager has captured prey, workers stay on trees for the remainder of the night until dawn, possibly relying on sunlight to navigate back to their nest.&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt; There is no evidence that they use chemical trails when foraging; instead, workers rely on visual cues to navigate around. However, chemical markers may play an important role in recognising nest entrances. The ants are solitary foragers.&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt; Waste material, such as dead nestmates, cocoon shells, and food remnants, are disposed of far away from the nest.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

Workers from different ''Nothomyrmecia'' colonies are not antagonistic towards one another, so they can forage together on a single tree, although they do attack if an outsider tries to enter an underground colony.&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt; Ants such as ''[[Carpenter ant|Camponotus]]'' and ''[[Iridomyrmex]]'' may pose a threat to foragers or to a colony if they try to enter; foraging workers that encounter ''Iridomyrmex'' ants are vigorously attacked and killed. ''Nothomyrmecia'' workers counter this by secreting alarm [[pheromone]]s from the mandibular gland and Dufour's gland.&lt;ref name=Taylorconv/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt; Foraging workers also engage in alternative methods to protect themselves from predators. Adopting a posture by opening the jaws in a threatening stance or deliberately falling onto the ground and remaining motionless until the threat subsides are two known methods. With that said, ''Nothomyrmecia'' is a timid and shy species that retreats if exposed.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

===Life cycle and reproduction===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 347 Dinosaur or Fossil Ants INothomyrmecia macropsI.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Two queens showing their vestigial wings, as well as a wingless worker and several cocoons|alt=Two queens showing their short, stubby wings. A similar looking worker is nearby, along with some pupae.]]
[[Nuptial flight]] (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) does not occur in ''Nothomyrmecia''. Instead, they engage in long-range dispersal (they walk away from the colony for some distance and mate) which presumably begins by late summer or autumn, with the winged adults emerging around March and April, but sometimes a colony may [[Overwintering|overwinter]] (a process by which an organism waits out the winter season). These winged adults, born around January, are usually quite young when they begin to mate. Queens are seen around vegetation trying to flutter their vestigial wings – a behaviour seen in some brachypterous ''Myrmecia'' queens.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt; Due to the queen's brachypterous wings, it is likely that the winged adults mate near their parent nest and release sex pheromones, or instead climb on vegetation far away from their nests and attract fully winged males.&lt;ref name="Hölldobler_Taylor_1983"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=P.S.|last2=Taylor|first2=R.W.|title=Allozyme variation, colony structure and genetic relatedness in the primitive ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' Clark (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|journal=Australian Journal of Entomology|date=1981|volume=20|issue=3|pages=177–183|doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.1981.tb01026.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hölldobler|Wilson|1990|pp=145–146}} ''Nothomyrmecia'' is a [[Polyandry in nature|polyandrous]] ant, in which queens mate with one or more males.

Queens are semi-claustral, meaning that during the initial establishment of the new colony the queen will forage among the worker ants so that she can ensure sufficient food to raise her brood. Sometimes a queen will leave her nest at night with the sole purpose of finding food or water for herself.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;

Eggs are not seen in nests from April to September. They are laid by late December and develop into adults by mid-February, although pupation does not occur until March. However, ''Nothomyrmecia'' is univoltine, meaning that the queen produces a single generation of eggs per season, and it sometimes may take as many as 12 months for an egg to develop into an adult. Adults are defined as either juveniles or post-juveniles: juveniles are too young (perhaps several months old) to have experienced overwintering whereas post-juveniles have. The pupae generally overwinter and begin to hatch by the time a new generation of eggs is laid.&lt;ref name="Taylor_2014"/&gt; Workers are capable of laying reproductive eggs, although it is not known if these develop into males, females or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trager |first1=J.C. |title=Advances in Myrmecology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aavw-aWxeMIC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq|date=1988 |publisher=E.J.

The larvae are capable of crawling around the nest. When the larvae are ready to spin their cocoons, they swell up and are later buried by workers in the ground to allow cocoon formation. Small non-aggressive workers that act as nurses provide assistance for newborns to hatch from their cocoons. At maturity, a nest may only contain 50 to 100 adults.&lt;ref name="Taylor_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Choe/&gt;{{sfn|Hölldobler|Wilson|1990|p=161}} In some nests, colony founding can occur within a colony itself: when a queen dies, the colony may be taken over by one of her daughters, or it may adopt a newly mated queen, restricting reproduction among workers; this method of founding extends the lifespan of the colony almost indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanetra|first1=M.|last2=Crozier|first2=R.H.|title=Daughters inherit colonies from mothers in the 'living-fossil' ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops''|journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|date=2002|volume=89|issue=2|pages=71–74|doi=10.1007/s00114-001-0288-5|pmid=12046624|bibcode=2002NW.....89...71S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dietemann2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietemann|first1=V.|last2=Peeters|first2=C.|last3=Hölldobler|first3=B.|date=2004|title=Gamergates in the Australian ant subfamily Myrmeciinae|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=91|issue=9|pages=432–435|bibcode=2004NW.....91..432D|doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0549-1|pmid=15278223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Big Ant.JPG|thumb|left|Sculpture of a ''Nothomyrmecia'' ant in Poochera|alt=A large yellow sculpture of Nothomyrmecia is located in Poochera]]

This is because there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that populations are declining. Colonies are also naturally depauperate (lacking in numbers of ants), and their distribution is potentially quite extensive across southern Australia, due to the ants' preference for old-growth mallee woodland.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; With 18 sites known for this species, and the potential for many more being discovered, there seems little immediate possibility of extinction.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanetra_Crozier_2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanetra|first1=M.|last2=Crozier|first2=R.H.|title=Patterns of population subdivision and gene flow in the ant ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' reflected in microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=2003|volume=12|issue=9|pages=2281–2295|doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01900.x|pmid=12919468}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this said, it is unknown how widespread it actually is, and scientists are not yet clear what, if any, threats affect it.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Although threats are not known for certain, suspected [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] threats that can significantly affect ''Nothomyrmecia'' include [[habitat destruction]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] by railway lines, roads and wheat fields.&lt;ref name=IUCN_1983&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=S.M.|last2=Pyle|first2=R.M.|last3=Collins|first3=N.M.|title=The IUCN Invertebrate Red Data Book|date=1983|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|location=Gland, Switzerland|page=508|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.45441|oclc=134558581|url=https://archive.org/details/iucninvertebrate83well}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; In the town of Ceduna, west of Poochera, local populations of the ant were almost eliminated after the area was bulldozed and burned during the installation of an underground telephone line, although nearby sites had larger populations than those found in the destroyed site. Colonies may not survive tree-clearing, as they depend on overhead [[Canopy (biology)|canopies]] to navigate.&lt;ref name=IUCN_1983/&gt; [[Wildfire|Bushfire]]s are another major threat to the survival of ''Nothomyrmecia'', potentially destroying valuable food sources, including the trees they forage on, and reducing the population of a colony. Although these ants may have recovered from previous bushfires, larger, more frequent fires may devastate the population. However, ''Nothomyrmecia'' ants can be safe from fires if they remain inside their nests.&lt;ref name=IUCN_1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylorconv&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=R.W.|title=Australian endangered species: Dinosaur Ant|url=https://theconversation.com/australian-endangered-species-dinosaur-ant-21603|publisher=The Conversation|date=9 January 2014|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]] could be a threat to their survival, as they depend on cold temperatures to forage and collect food. An increase in the temperature will prevent workers from foraging, and very few areas would be suitable for the species to live in. The cold winds blowing off the [[Southern Ocean]] allow ''Nothomyrmecia'' to benefit from the cool temperatures they need for night-time foraging, so an increase in sea temperature could also potentially threaten it.&lt;ref name=Taylorconv/&gt;

Conservationists suggest that conducting surveys, maintaining known populations through habitat protection and fighting climate change may ensure the survival of ''Nothomyrmecia''.&lt;ref name="Clarke_Spier-Ashcroft"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylorconv/&gt; They also advocate protection of remaining mallee habitat from degradation, and for management actions to improve tree and understorey structure. Because most known populations are found outside protected areas in vegetation alongside roads, a species management plan is required to identify other key actions, including making local councils aware of the presence, conservation status and habitat requirement of ''Nothomyrmecia''. This could result in future land use and management being decided more appropriately at the local level. Not all colonies are found in unprotected areas; some have been discovered in the [[Lake Gilles Conservation Park]] and the [[Chadinga Conservation Reserve]]. More research is needed to know the true extent of the ant's geographical distribution.&lt;ref name="Clarke_Spier-Ashcroft"/&gt;

===Significance===
''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' is widely regarded as the most primitive living ant and, as such, has aroused considerable interest among the entomological community.&lt;ref name=IUCN_1983/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canberra Times_1977"/&gt; Following its rediscovery it was the subject of a prolonged and rigorous series of studies involving Australian, American and European ant specialists and it soon became one of the most studied ant species on the planet.&lt;ref name="Schultz_2000"/&gt; ''Nothomyrmecia'' can be cultured with ease, and could potentially prove a useful subject for research into learning in insects as well as the physiology of nocturnal vision.&lt;ref name=IUCN_1983/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canberra Times_1977"/&gt; Since its chance discovery at Poochera, the town has become of international interest to myrmecologists, and it is possibly the only town in the world with ant-based tourism.

'''Precipitate delivery''' refers to [[childbirth]] after an unusually rapid labor (combined 1st stage and second stage duration is under two hours) and culminates in the rapid, spontaneous expulsion of the infant. Delivery often occurs without the benefit of [[asepsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Precipitate and Emergency Delivery, http://www.sweethaven02.com/PDF_Health/922les03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predisposing factors==
There are common factors which may cause a woman to deliver rapidly. These factors include:
# A [[multipara]] with relaxed [[pelvic floor|pelvic]] or [[perineum|perineal]] floor muscles may have an extremely short period of expulsion.
# A multipara with unusually strong, forceful contractions. Two to three powerful contractions may cause the baby to appear with considerable rapidity.
# Inadequate warning of imminent birth due to absence of painful sensations during labor.

==Danger of precipitate delivery==
There are several misfortunes associated with precipitate delivery for both the mother and the infant. They are classified as maternal and neonatal.&lt;ref&gt;Precipitate and Emergency Delivery, http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/Obstetric_and_Newborn_Care_II/lesson_3_Section_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal===
Precipitate delivery may cause lacerations of the [[cervix]], [[vagina]], and/or [[perineum]]. Rapid descent and delivery of an infant does not allow maternal tissues adequate time to stretch and accommodate the passage of the infant.
There may be [[hemorrhage|hemorrhaging]] originating from lacerations and/or [[hematoma]]s of the cervix, vagina, or perineum. There may also be hemorrhaging from the uterus. [[uterus|Uterine]] [[atony]] may result from muscular exhaustion after unusually strong and rapid labor.
There may be infection as a result of unsterile delivery.

===Neonatal===
Precipitate delivery may cause [[intracranial hemorrhage]] resulting from a sudden change in pressure on the fetal head during rapid expulsion.
It may cause [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] of [[amniotic fluid]], if unattended at or immediately following delivery.
There may be infection as a result of unsterile delivery.

'''Reactive oxygen species''' ('''ROS''') are chemically reactive [[chemical species]] containing oxygen. Examples include [[peroxide]]s, [[superoxide]], [[hydroxyl radical]], [[singlet oxygen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Hayyan M, Hashim MA, AlNashef IM |title= Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications |journal= Chemical Reviews |volume= 116 |issue= 5 |pages= 3029–85 |date= March 2016 |pmid= 26875845 |doi= 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[alpha-oxygen]].

In a biological context, ROS are formed as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of [[oxygen]] and have important roles in [[cell signaling]] and [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Devasagayam 2004 796"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Devasagayam TP, Tilak JC, Boloor KK, Sane KS, Ghaskadbi SS, Lele RD |title= Free radicals and antioxidants in human health: current status and future prospects |journal= The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India |volume= 52 |pages= 794–804 |date= October 2004 |pmid= 15909857}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during times of environmental stress (e.g., [[ultraviolet light|UV]] or heat exposure), ROS levels can increase dramatically.&lt;ref name="Devasagayam 2004 796"/&gt; This may result in significant damage to cell structures. Cumulatively, this is known as [[oxidative stress]]. The production of ROS is strongly influenced by stress factor responses in plants, these factors that increase ROS production include, drought, salinity, chilling, nutrient deficiency, metal toxicity and UV-B radiation. ROS are also generated by exogenous sources such as [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Martha E. |last1= Sosa Torres |first2= Juan P. |last2= Saucedo-Vázquez |first3= Peter M.H. |last3= Kroneck |editor-first1= Peter M.H. |editor-last1= Kroneck |editor-first2= Martha E.

The reduction of molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produces [[superoxide]] (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|−}}) and is the precursor of most other reactive oxygen species:&lt;ref name="Turrens_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Turrens JF |title= Mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species |journal= The Journal of Physiology |volume= 552 |issue= Pt 2 |pages= 335–44 |date= October 2003 |pmid= 14561818 |pmc= 2343396 |doi= 10.1113/jphysiol.2003.049478}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|−}}

[[Dismutation]] of superoxide produces [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;ref name="Turrens_2003"/&gt;
:2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|−}} + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|−}} → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Hydrogen peroxide in turn may be partially reduced to hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH) or fully reduced to water:&lt;ref name="Turrens_2003"/&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH
:2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Exogenous ROS===
Exogenous ROS can be produced from pollutants, tobacco, smoke, drugs, [[xenobiotics]], or radiation.

Ionizing radiation can generate damaging intermediates through the interaction with water, a process termed [[radiolysis]]. Since water comprises 55–60% of the human body, the probability of radiolysis is quite high under the presence of ionizing radiation. In the process, water loses an electron and becomes highly reactive. Then through a three-step chain reaction, water is sequentially converted to [[hydroxyl radical]] (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH), [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[superoxide radical]] (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|−}}), and ultimately [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

The hydroxyl radical is extremely reactive and immediately removes electrons from any molecule in its path, turning that molecule into a free radical and thus propagating a chain reaction. However, hydrogen peroxide is actually more damaging to DNA than the hydroxyl radical, since the lower reactivity of hydrogen peroxide provides enough time for the molecule to travel into the nucleus of the cell, subsequently reacting with macromolecules such as DNA.

===Endogenous ROS===
ROS are produced intracellularly through multiple mechanisms and depending on the cell and tissue types, the major sources being the "professional" producers of ROS: [[NADPH oxidase]] (NOX) complexes (7 distinct isoforms) in cell membranes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref name=Muller2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Muller F |title= The nature and mechanism of superoxide production by the electron transport chain: Its relevance to aging |journal= Journal of the American Aging Association |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 227–53 |date= October 2000 |pmid= 23604868 |pmc= 3455268 |doi= 10.1007/s11357-000-0022-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11139407"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Han D, Williams E, Cadenas E |title= Mitochondrial respiratory chain-dependent generation of superoxide anion and its release into the intermembrane space |journal= The Biochemical Journal |volume= 353 |issue= Pt 2 |pages= 411–6 |date= January 2001 |pmid= 11139407 |pmc= 1221585 |doi= 10.1042/0264-6021:3530411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form, [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). The process in which ATP is produced, called [[oxidative phosphorylation]], involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane by means of the [[electron transport chain]]. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of [[protein]]s via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the [[superoxide radical]] (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|−}}), most well documented for [[Complex I]] and [[Complex III]].&lt;ref name="pmid23442817"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Li X, Fang P, Mai J, Choi ET, Wang H, Yang XF |title= Targeting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species as novel therapy for inflammatory diseases and cancers |journal= Journal of Hematology &amp; Oncology |volume= 6 |issue= 19 |pages= 19 |date= February 2013 |pmid= 23442817 |pmc= 3599349 |doi= 10.1186/1756-8722-6-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superoxide is not particularly reactive by itself, but can inactivate specific enzymes or initiate [[lipid peroxidation]] in its protonated form, hydroperoxyl [[hydroperoxyl|HO{{su|b=2|p=•}}]]. The p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of hydroperoxyl is 4.8. Thus, at physiological pH, the majority will exist as superoxide anion.

If too much damage is present in mitochondria, a cell undergoes [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtin|first=James F|last2=Donovan|first2=Maryanne|last3=Cotter|first3=Thomas G|date=July 2002|title=Regulation and measurement of oxidative stress in apoptosis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022175902000704|journal=Journal of Immunological Methods|volume=265|issue=1-2|pages=49–72|doi=10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00070-4|issn=0022-1759|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Morgan |first4=David |last5=Raff |first5=Martin |last6=Roberts |first6=Keith |last7=Walter |first7=Peter |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |date=2014 |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8153-4432-2 |pages=1025 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bcl-2 proteins are layered on the surface of the mitochondria, detect damage, and activate a class of proteins called Bax, which punch holes in the mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome C to leak out. This cytochrome C binds to Apaf-1, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1, which is free-floating in the cell's cytoplasm. Using energy from the ATPs in the mitochondrion, the Apaf-1 and cytochrome C bind together to form apoptosomes. The [[apoptosome]]s bind to and activate caspase-9, another free-floating protein. The caspase-9 then cleaves the proteins of the mitochondrial membrane, causing it to break down and start a chain reaction of protein denaturation and eventually [[phagocytosis]] of the cell.

===Superoxide dismutase===
{{Main|Superoxide dismutase}}
[[Superoxide dismutase]]s (SOD) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important [[antioxidant]] defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. In mammals and most chordates, three forms of superoxide dismutase are present. SOD1 is located primarily in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), while the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc ions, while SOD2 has a manganese ion in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).

The SOD-catalysed [[dismutation]] of [[superoxide]] may be written with the following half-reactions:
*M&lt;sup&gt;(''n''+1)+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;SOD + {{chem|O|2|−}} → M&lt;sup&gt;''n''+&lt;/sup&gt; − SOD + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*M&lt;sup&gt;''n''+&lt;/sup&gt; − SOD + {{chem|O|2|−}} + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → M&lt;sup&gt;(''n''+1)+&lt;/sup&gt; − SOD + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

where M&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[Copper|Cu]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1); [[manganese|Mn]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2); [[iron|Fe]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2); [[nickel|Ni]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2). In this reaction the [[oxidation state]] of the metal cation oscillates between ''n'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

[[Catalase]], which is concentrated in [[peroxisomes]] located next to mitochondria, reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the formation of water and oxygen. [[Glutathione peroxidase]] reduces hydrogen peroxide by transferring the energy of the reactive peroxides to a very small sulfur-containing protein called [[glutathione]]. The sulfur contained in these enzymes acts as the reactive center, carrying reactive electrons from the peroxide to the glutathione. [[Peroxiredoxins]] also degrade H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, within the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus.

*2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{spaces|5}} ''(catalase)''
*2GSH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → GS–SG + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{spaces|5}} ''(glutathione peroxidase)''

===Singlet oxygen===
Another type of reactive oxygen species is [[singlet oxygen]] (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which is produced for example as byproduct of [[photosynthesis]] in plants. In the presence of light and oxygen, [[photosensitizer]]s such as [[chlorophyll]] may convert triplet (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to singlet oxygen:&lt;ref name="Laloi_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Laloi C, Havaux M |title= Key players of singlet oxygen-induced cell death in plants |journal= Frontiers in Plant Science |volume= 6 |issue= |pages= 39 |year= 2015 |pmid= 25699067 |pmc= 4316694 |doi= 10.3389/fpls.2015.00039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^3O2 -&gt;[\ce{light}][\ce{photosensitizer}] ^1O2&lt;/chem&gt;
Singlet oxygen is highly reactive, especially with organic compounds that contain double bonds. The resulting damage caused by singlet oxygen reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of [[chloroplast]]s. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of singlet oxygen can result in cell death.&lt;ref name="Laloi_2015"/&gt; Various substances such as [[carotenoid]]s, [[tocopherol]]s and [[plastoquinone]]s contained in chloroplasts quench singlet oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, singlet oxygen acts a [[signal transduction|signaling]] molecule.&lt;ref name="Laloi_2015"/&gt; Oxidized products of [[β-carotene]] arising from the presence of singlet oxygen act as [[Second messenger system|second messenger]]s that can either protect against singlet oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of [[jasmonate]] play a key role in the decision between cell acclimation or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref name="Laloi_2015"/&gt;

==Damaging effects==
Effects of ROS on cell metabolism are well documented in a variety of species. These include not only roles in [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death) but also positive effects such as the induction of host defence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Rada B, Leto TL |title= Oxidative innate immune defenses by Nox/Duox family NADPH oxidases |journal= Contributions to Microbiology |volume= 15 |issue= |pages= 164–87 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18511861 |pmc= 2776633 |doi= 10.1159/000136357 |isbn= 978-3-8055-8548-4 |series= Contributions to Microbiology |format= PDF}} — Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Conner GE, Salathe M, Forteza R |title= Lactoperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide metabolism in the airway |journal= American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |volume= 166 |issue= 12 Pt 2 |pages= S57-61 |date= December 2002 |pmid= 12471090 |doi= 10.1164/rccm.2206018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[genes]] and mobilization of ion transport systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This implicates them in control of cellular function. In particular, [[platelets]] involved in [[wound]] repair and [[blood]] [[homeostasis]] release ROS to recruit additional platelets to sites of [[injury]]. These also provide a link to the adaptive [[immune system]] via the recruitment of [[leukocyte]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in cellular activity to a variety of inflammatory responses including [[cardiovascular disease]]. They may also be involved in [[hearing impairment]] via [[cochlea]]r damage induced by [[noise health effects|elevated sound levels]], in ototoxicity of drugs such as [[cisplatin]], and in congenital deafness in both animals and humans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} ROS are also implicated in mediation of [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death and [[ischaemic]] injury. Specific examples include [[stroke]] and [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In general, harmful effects of reactive oxygen species on the cell are most often:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brooker |first= Robert J. |title= Genetics: analysis and principles |edition= 4th |publisher= McGraw-Hill Science |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0-07-352528-0 |name-list-format= vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# damage of DNA or RNA
# oxidations of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids ([[lipid peroxidation]])
# oxidations of amino acids in proteins
# oxidative deactivation of specific enzymes by oxidation of co-factors

===Pathogen response===
When a plant recognizes an attacking pathogen, one of the first induced reactions is to rapidly produce [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}) or [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) to strengthen the cell wall. This prevents the spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant, essentially forming a net around the pathogen to restrict movement and reproduction.

In the mammalian host, ROS is induced as an antimicrobial defense. To highlight the importance of this defense, individuals with chronic granulomatous disease who have deficiencies in generating ROS, are highly susceptible to infection by a broad range of microbes including ''Salmonella enterica'', ''Staphylococcus aureus'', ''Serratia marcescens'', and ''Aspergillus'' spp.

The exact manner in which ROS defends the host from invading microbe is not fully understood. One of the more likely modes of defense is damage to microbial DNA. Studies using Salmonella demonstrated that DNA repair mechanisms were required to resist killing by ROS. More recently, a role for ROS in antiviral defense mechanisms has been demonstrated via Rig-like helicase-1 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Increased levels of ROS potentiate signaling through this mitochondria-associated antiviral receptor to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in an antiviral state.&lt;ref&gt;West AP et al 2011 Nature Reviews Immunology 11, 389-402&lt;/ref&gt; Respiratory epithelial cells were recently demonstrated to induce mitrochondrial ROS in response to influenza infection. This induction of ROS led to the induction of type III interferon and the induction of an antiviral state, limiting viral replication.&lt;ref name="pmid23786562"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Kim HJ, Kim CH, Ryu JH, Kim MJ, Park CY, Lee JM, Holtzman MJ, Yoon JH |title= Reactive oxygen species induce antiviral innate immune response through IFN-λ regulation in human nasal epithelial cells |journal= American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology |volume= 49 |issue= 5 |pages= 855–65 |date= November 2013 |pmid= 23786562 |doi= 10.1165/rcmb.2013-0003OC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In host defense against mycobacteria, ROS play a role, although direct killing is likely not the key mechanism; rather, ROS likely affect ROS-dependent signalling controls, such as cytokine production, autophagy, and granuloma formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Deffert C, Cachat J, Krause KH |title= Phagocyte NADPH oxidase, chronic granulomatous disease and mycobacterial infections |journal= Cellular Microbiology |volume= 16 |issue= 8 |pages= 1168–78 |date= August 2014 |pmid= 24916152 |doi= 10.1111/cmi.12322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactive oxygen species are also implicated in activation, anergy and apoptosis of [[T cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Belikov AV, Schraven B, Simeoni L |title= T cells and reactive oxygen species |journal= Journal of Biomedical Science |volume= 22 |pages= 85 |date= October 2015 |pmid= 26471060 |pmc= 4608155 |doi= 10.1186/s12929-015-0194-3 |url= https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-015-0194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidative damage===
In [[aerobic organism]]s the energy needed to fuel biological functions is produced in the [[mitochondria]] via the [[electron transport chain]]. In addition to energy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the potential to cause [[cell (biology)|cellular]] damage are produced. ROS can damage lipid, [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and proteins, which, in theory, contributes to the [[physiology]] of [[aging]].

ROS are produced as a normal product of [[cellular metabolism]]. In particular, one major contributor to oxidative damage is [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is converted from [[superoxide]] that leaks from the mitochondria. [[Catalase]] and [[superoxide dismutase]] ameliorate the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively, by converting these compounds into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] (which is later converted to water), resulting in the production of [[benign]] [[molecule]]s. However, this conversion is not 100% efficient, and residual peroxides persist in the cell. While ROS are produced as a product of normal cellular functioning, excessive amounts can cause deleterious effects.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-1723-6"&gt;{{cite book |veditors= Packer L, Cadenas E |title= Understanding the process of aging: the roles of mitochondria, free radicals, and antioxidants |publisher= Marcel Dekker |location= New York, NY |year= 1999 |chapter= The biochemistry of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite: implications for mitochondrial function |pages= 39–56 |isbn= 0-8247-1723-6 |vauthors= Patel RP, T Cornwell T, Darley-Usmar VM |authorlink3= Victor Darley-Usmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Memory capabilities decline with age, evident in human degenerative diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's [[physical fitness|fitness]] because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial [[metabolite]]s and then given [[cognitive tests]]. Results showed that the [[rat]]s performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function.&lt;ref name="pmid11854529"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Liu J, Head E, Gharib AM, Yuan W, Ingersoll RT, Hagen TM, Cotman CW, Ames BN |title= Memory loss in old rats is associated with brain mitochondrial decay and RNA/DNA oxidation: partial reversal by feeding acetyl-L-carnitine and/or R-alpha -lipoic acid |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 99 |issue= 4 |pages= 2356–61 |date= February 2002 |pmid= 11854529 |pmc= 122369 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.261709299 |bibcode= 2002PNAS...99.2356L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production.&lt;ref name="pmid1355616"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Stadtman ER |title= Protein oxidation and aging |journal= Science |volume= 257 |issue= 5074 |pages= 1220–4 |date= August 1992 |pmid= 1355616 |doi= 10.1126/science.1355616 |bibcode= 1992Sci...257.1220S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of oxidative damage and its implications for aging depends on the particular [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in [[brain]] functioning. Older [[gerbil]]s were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young [[mice]] with a [[spin trapping]] compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.&lt;ref name="CarneyStarke-Reed1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Carney JM, Starke-Reed PE, Oliver CN, Landum RW, Cheng MS, Wu JF, Floyd RA |title= Reversal of age-related increase in brain protein oxidation, decrease in enzyme activity, and loss in temporal and spatial memory by chronic administration of the spin-trapping compound N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 88 |issue= 9 |pages= 3633–6 |date= May 1991 |pmid= 1673789 |pmc= 51506 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.88.9.3633 |bibcode= 1991PNAS...88.3633C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of aging==
According to the [[free radical theory of aging]], oxidative damage initiated by reactive oxygen species is a major contributor to the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one would expect from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in ''[[Drosophila]]'' do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid19197346"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Van Raamsdonk JM, Hekimi S |title= Deletion of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase sod-2 extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans |journal= PLoS Genetics |volume= 5 |issue= 2 |pages= e1000361 |date= February 2009 |pmid= 19197346 |pmc= 2628729 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mice, the story is somewhat similar. Deleting antioxidant enzymes, in general, yields shorter lifespan, though overexpression studies have not (with some recent exceptions) consistently extended lifespan.&lt;ref name="pmid17640558"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Muller FL, Lustgarten MS, Jang Y, Richardson A, Van Remmen H |title= Trends in oxidative aging theories |journal= Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine |volume= 43 |issue= 4 |pages= 477–503 |date= August 2007 |pmid= 17640558 |doi= 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.03.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of a rat model of premature [[ageing|aging]] found increased [[oxidative stress]], reduced [[antioxidant]] enzyme activity and substantially greater [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] in the brain [[neocortex]] and [[hippocampus]] of the prematurely aged rats than in normally aging control rats.&lt;ref name="pmid24709042"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Sinha JK, Ghosh S, Swain U, Giridharan NV, Raghunath M |title= Increased macromolecular damage due to oxidative stress in the neocortex and hippocampus of WNIN/Ob, a novel rat model of premature aging |journal= Neuroscience |volume= 269 |issue= |pages= 256–64 |date= June 2014 |pmid= 24709042 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.03.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA damage [[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-OHdG]] is a product of ROS interaction with DNA.

==Cancer==
ROS are constantly generated and eliminated in the biological system and are required to drive regulatory pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Dickinson BC, Chang CJ |title= Chemistry and biology of reactive oxygen species in signaling or stress responses |journal= Nature Chemical Biology |volume= 7 |issue= 8 |pages= 504–11 |date= July 2011 |pmid= 21769097 |pmc= 3390228 |doi= 10.1038/nchembio.607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal physiological conditions, cells control ROS levels by balancing the generation of ROS with their elimination by scavenging system. But under oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins, lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in cell that contribute to carcinogenesis.

Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress than normal cells do, partly due to oncogenic stimulation, increased metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is a double-edged sword. On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Irani K, Xia Y, Zweier JL, Sollott SJ, Der CJ, Fearon ER, Sundaresan M, Finkel T, Goldschmidt-Clermont PJ |title= Mitogenic signaling mediated by oxidants in Ras-transformed fibroblasts |journal= Science |volume= 275 |issue= 5306 |pages= 1649–52 |date= March 1997 |pmid= 9054359 |doi= 10.1126/science.275.5306.1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, a high level of ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Ramsey MR, Sharpless NE |title= ROS as a tumour suppressor? |journal= Nature Cell Biology |volume= 8 |issue= 11 |pages= 1213–5 |date= November 2006 |pmid= 17077852 |doi= 10.1038/ncb1106-1213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Takahashi A, Ohtani N, Yamakoshi K, Iida S, Tahara H, Nakayama K, Nakayama KI, Ide T, Saya H, Hara E |title= Mitogenic signalling and the p16INK4a-Rb pathway cooperate to enforce irreversible cellular senescence |journal= Nature Cell Biology |volume= 8 |issue= 11 |pages= 1291–7 |date= November 2006 |pmid= 17028578 |doi= 10.1038/ncb1491}}&lt;/ref&gt; and induction of cell death as well as senescence by damaging macromolecules.

Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.

Metabolic adaptation in tumours balances the cells' need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks and tighter control of redox balance. As a result, production of [[NADPH]] is greatly enhanced, which functions as a cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis and at the same time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Cairns RA, Harris IS, Mak TW |title= Regulation of cancer cell metabolism |journal= Nature Reviews.

Most risk factors associated with cancer interact with cells through the generation of ROS. ROS then activate various transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), leading to expression of proteins that control inflammation; cellular transformation; tumor cell survival; tumor cell proliferation; and invasion, agiogenesis as well as metastasis. And ROS also control the expression of various tumor suppressor genes such as p53, retinoblastoma gene (Rb), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Gupta SC, Hevia D, Patchva S, Park B, Koh W, Aggarwal BB |title= Upsides and downsides of reactive oxygen species for cancer: the roles of reactive oxygen species in tumorigenesis, prevention, and therapy |journal= Antioxidants &amp; Redox Signaling |volume= 16 |issue= 11 |pages= 1295–322 |date= June 2012 |pmid= 22117137 |pmc= 3324815 |doi= 10.1089/ars.2011.4414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carcinogenesis===
ROS-related oxidation of DNA is one of the main causes of mutations, which can produce several types of DNA damage, including non-bulky (8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine) and bulky (cyclopurine and etheno adducts) base modifications, abasic sites, non-conventional single-strand breaks, protein-DNA adducts, and intra/interstrand DNA crosslinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Waris G, Ahsan H |title= Reactive oxygen species: role in the development of cancer and various chronic conditions |journal= Journal of Carcinogenesis |volume= 5 |issue= |pages= 14 |date= May 2006 |pmid= 16689993 |pmc= 1479806 |doi= 10.1186/1477-3163-5-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that endogenous ROS produced via normal cell metabolism modify approximately 20,000 bases of DNA per day in a single cell. 8-oxoguanine is the most abundant among various oxidized nitrogeneous bases observed. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase mispairs 8-oxoguanine with adenine, leading to a G→T transversion mutation. The resulting genomic instability directly contributes to carcinogenesis. Cellular transformation leads to cancer and interaction of atypical PKC-ζ isoform with p47phox controls ROS production and transformation from apoptotic cancer stem cells through [[blebbishield emergency program]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Jinesh GG, Taoka R, Zhang Q, Gorantla S, Kamat AM |title= Novel PKC-ζ to p47 phox interaction is necessary for transformation from blebbishields |journal= Scientific Reports |volume= 6 |issue= |pages= 23965 |date= April 2016 |pmid= 27040869 |doi= 10.1038/srep23965 |url= http://rdcu.be/g8KW |bibcode= 2016NatSR...623965J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinesh GG, Kamat AM.

===Cell proliferation===
Uncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Both exogenous and endogenous ROS have been shown to enhance proliferation of cancer cells. The role of ROS in promoting tumor proliferation is further supported by the observation that agents with potential to inhibit ROS generation can also inhibit cancer cell proliferation.&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt; Although ROS can promote tumor cell proliferation, a great increase in ROS has been associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest; increased phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1), Chk 2; and reduced cell division cycle 25 homolog c (CDC25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Ames BN |title= Dietary carcinogens and anticarcinogens.

===Cell death===
A cancer cell can die in three ways: [[apoptosis]], [[necrosis]], and [[autophagy]]. Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Ozben T |title= Oxidative stress and apoptosis: impact on cancer therapy |journal= Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences |volume= 96 |issue= 9 |pages= 2181–96 |date= September 2007 |pmid= 17593552 |doi= 10.1002/jps.20874}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which is necessary for subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as apoptosis induction.&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt; In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Martindale JL, Holbrook NJ |title= Cellular response to oxidative stress: signaling for suicide and survival |journal= Journal of Cellular Physiology |volume= 192 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–15 |date= July 2002 |pmid= 12115731 |doi= 10.1002/jcp.10119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intrinsic pathway is also known as the caspase cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating apoptosis.&lt;ref name="pmid17717517"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Maiuri MC, Zalckvar E, Kimchi A, Kroemer G |title= Self-eating and self-killing: crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis |journal= Nature Reviews.

Drug Discovery |volume= 9 |issue= 6 |pages= 447–64 |date= June 2010 |pmid= 20467424 |doi= 10.1038/nrd3137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cytotoxic nature of ROS is a driving force behind apoptosis, but in even higher amounts, ROS can result in both apoptosis and necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death, in cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Hampton MB, Orrenius S |title= Dual regulation of caspase activity by hydrogen peroxide: implications for apoptosis |journal= FEBS Letters |volume= 414 |issue= 3 |pages= 552–6 |date= September 1997 |pmid= 9323034 |doi= 10.1016/s0014-5793(97)01068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have shown the pathways and associations between ROS levels and apoptosis, but a newer line of study has connected ROS levels and autophagy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Gibson SB |title= A matter of balance between life and death: targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced autophagy for cancer therapy |journal= Autophagy |volume= 6 |issue= 7 |pages= 835–7 |date= October 2010 |pmid= 20818163 |doi= 10.4161/auto.6.7.13335}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS can also induce cell death through autophagy, which is a self-catabolic process involving sequestration of cytoplasmic contents (exhausted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates) for degradation in lysosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Shrivastava A, Kuzontkoski PM, Groopman JE, Prasad A |title= Cannabidiol induces programmed cell death in breast cancer cells by coordinating the cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy |journal= Molecular Cancer Therapeutics |volume= 10 |issue= 7 |pages= 1161–72 |date= July 2011 |pmid= 21566064 |doi= 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, autophagy can also regulate the cell’s health in times of oxidative stress. Autophagy can be induced by ROS levels through many different pathways in the cell in an attempt to dispose of harmful organelles and prevent damage, such as carcinogens, without inducing apoptosis.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Scherz-Shouval R, Elazar Z |title= ROS, mitochondria and the regulation of autophagy |journal= Trends in Cell Biology |volume= 17 |issue= 9 |pages= 422–7 |date= September 2007 |pmid= 17804237 |doi= 10.1016/j.tcb.2007.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autophagic cell death can be prompted by the over expression of autophagy where the cell digests too much of itself in an attempt to minimize the damage and can no longer survive. When this type of cell death occurs, an increase or loss of control of autophagy regulating genes is commonly co-observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Xie Z, Klionsky DJ |title= Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations |journal= Nature Cell Biology |volume= 9 |issue= 10 |pages= 1102–9 |date= October 2007 |pmid= 17909521 |doi= 10.1038/ncb1007-1102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, once a more in-depth understanding of autophagic cell death is attained and its relation to ROS, this form of programmed cell death may serve as a future cancer therapy.
Autophagy and apoptosis are two different cell death mechanisms brought on by high levels of ROS in the cells, however; autophagy and apoptosis rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and autophagy and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to apoptosis.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of autophagy. When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, autophagy is initiated to dispose of the damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, autophagy may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for apoptosis. The balance of autophagy within the cell and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell’s survival. This crosstalk and connection between autophagy and apoptosis could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.

===Tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis===
After growth factor stimulation of RTKs, ROS can trigger activation of signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion such as members of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family – extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH-2 terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. ROS can also promote migration by augmenting phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p130Cas and paxilin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Tochhawng L, Deng S, Pervaiz S, Yap CT |title= Redox regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion |journal= Mitochondrion |volume= 13 |issue= 3 |pages= 246–53 |date= May 2013 |pmid= 22960576 |doi= 10.1016/j.mito.2012.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in vitro and in vivo, ROS have been shown to induce transcription factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN).&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt;

===Chronic inflammation and cancer===
Experimental and epidemiologic research over the past several years has indicated close associations among ROS, chronic inflammation, and cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt; ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB).&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt; These chemokines and chemokine receptors, in turn, promote invasion and metastasis of various tumor types.

===Cancer therapy===

Both ROS-elevating and ROS-eliminating strategies have been developed with the former being predominantly used. Cancer cells with elevated ROS levels depend heavily on the antioxidant defense system. ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS stress level, either by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol) or by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)). The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular tolerability threshold, may induce cell death.&lt;ref name="pmid16959608"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Kong Q, Beel JA, Lillehei KO |title= A threshold concept for cancer therapy |journal= Medical Hypotheses |volume= 55 |issue= 1 |pages= 29–35 |date= July 2000 |pmid= 11021322 |doi= 10.1054/mehy.1999.0982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Schumacker PT |title= Reactive oxygen species in cancer cells: live by the sword, die by the sword |journal= Cancer Cell |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |pages= 175–6 |date= September 2006 |pmid= 16959608 |doi= 10.1016/j.ccr.2006.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do.&lt;ref name="pmid16959608"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Trachootham D, Alexandre J, Huang P |title= Targeting cancer cells by ROS-mediated mechanisms: a radical therapeutic approach? |journal= Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery |volume= 8 |issue= 7 |pages= 579–91 |date= July 2009 |pmid= 19478820 |doi= 10.1038/nrd2803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the elevation of ROS in all cells can be used to achieve the selective killing of cancer cells.

Radiotherapy also relies on ROS toxicity to eradicate tumor cells. Radiotherapy uses X-rays, γ-rays as well as heavy particle radiation such as protons and neutrons to induce ROS-mediated cell death and mitotic failure.&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt;

Due to the dual role of ROS, both prooxidant and antioxidant-based anticancer agents have been developed. However, modulation of ROS signaling alone seems not to be an ideal approach due to adaptation of cancer cells to ROS stress, redundant pathways for supporting cancer growth and toxicity from ROS-generating anticancer drugs. Combinations of ROS-generating drugs with pharmaceuticals that can break the redox adaptation could be a better strategy for enhancing cancer cell cytotoxicity.&lt;ref name="pmid22117137"/&gt;

He has stated that "I truly, truly love Florissant".&lt;ref name="stlpd01" /&gt;
 
Upon the death of Mayor [[James J. Eagan]] in November 2000 Council President John Moran was Mayor pro tempore and the successor to the position of mayor.  

Lowery was elected Mayor on February 6, 2001 in a  special election to fill the unexpired term of James Eagan. The election had a turn out of 32% of 32,467 registered voters, with Lowery winning the election with 7,057 votes, 68% of the votes cast.&lt;ref name="election01"&gt;{{cite web |title =OFFICIAL RESULTS- CITY OF FLORISSANT  | work = | publisher =Board of Election Commissioners of St. Louis County, Missouri| date =2-8-2001 | url = http://www.co.st-louis.mo.us/ELECTIONS/ERESULTS/el0201/floris.htm| accessdate = 2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law Enforcement Career==
Lowery was a police officer in the city of Florissant for 41 years. During this time he served as police chief for 22 years from 1979 until he was elected mayor in 2001.&lt;ref name="stlpd01" /&gt;  Lowery was elected to the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Florissant police chief picked for commission | publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =1988-11-29 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB3295F50DE1646&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate =2009-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed up the [[St. Louis County Police Department]]'s Major Case Squad for 20 years.&lt;ref name="stlpd01"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gillerman| first = Margaret |  title = Longtime police chief ready to become Florissant's mayor | publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =2001-12-22 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB05304B7F7C1DF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate =2009-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 a thief stole police chief Lowery's gun and holster while he was trying on pants at [[St. Louis Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  title = Florissant police chief loses his gun to a thief at St. Louis Centre| publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =1999-12-15 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB051E8C8D8291D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM

Throughout his career as police chief Florissant was consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in America.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

When elected mayor, Lowery selected Stephen Kruse to become his replacement as police chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Schremp| first = Valerie |  title =  Florissant names police chief as replacement for Lowery | publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =2001-03-01 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0530F1DF4F44C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate =2009-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruse then resigned to accept a new position working in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Brasch Librach| first = Phyllis |  title =  Florissant chief of police is leaving to take executive post at company | publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =2002-08-28 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F5B3662D1F65F5F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate =2009-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2002, Lowery officially appointed William Karabas to be the city's police chief.

===Community Redevelopment===
After taking office, Lowery led the way to many new renovations in the City of Florissant.

The first of these changes came in 2002, in the part of Florissant near Lindbergh Boulevard and New Halls Ferry Road known as Cross Keys.  The area had formerly been a small shopping mall with only a few tenants left.  The tenants that remain included a supermarket, a pharmacy, and a fashion store, all of which are still located near the area where the new shopping center replacing the mall that once stood their.  Adding to the shopping center were several new restaurants and shops including a bookstore.  This had been in the Eagan Florissant city plan prior to Lowery taking office.  

Lowery's improvements are not limited to the Cross Keys neighborhood.  A new bicycling and walking path that extends from the Sunset Park along the [[Missouri River]] to St. Ferdinand Park was recently completed in 2006.  The path, most of which runs along the same path a some high voltage powerlines, connects much of western Florissant with the main section of Florissant via a foot bridge for pedestrians and cyclists.  Much of the city is divided by Coldwater Creek, which has some natural and man-made tributaries that separate various neighborhoods from [[Berkeley, Missouri|Berkeley]], [[Hazelwood, Missouri|Hazelwood]], [[Florissant, Missouri|Florissant]], [[Black Jack, Missouri|Black Jack]], until pouring into the Missouri River in unincorporated St. Louis County.  A similar footbridge plan was slated to connect the Wedgewood subdivision to a footpath leading to St. Ferdinand Park's east entrance, but because of strong opposition by residents in the neighborhood, this plan never became possible. 

Though the commercial redevelopment of Cross Keys is a success, much of the city's other commercial areas are still in need of the same renovation, especially the Florissant Meadows section of town near the city's historic Old Town area.

=== Personal and City Security ===
Lowery has been fearful of his security since taking office. He has said that "every city has people who are really on the edge. We have 25 or 30 who are convinced that everything bad that's happening to them is the government's fault. And the closest government to them is City Hall."&lt;ref name="stl208"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hampel| first = Paul | title =Rampage prompts security reviews here | publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =2-10-2008 | url =http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/675AC306EADAB336862573EB001143A6?OpenDocument | accessdate =2009-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To quell his fears, Lowery has had [[security cameras]] installed at City Hall and is considering adding metal detectors to the entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Schlinkmann| first = Mark | title =Florissant to operate surveillance cameras | publisher =[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date =5-12-2008 | url =http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/28590E3EFA8DFC95862574470004CC20?OpenDocument | accessdate =2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery has also had an increased police prescience in city council meetings and has also installed [[Metal_detectors#Security_screening|metal detectors]] for security screening of attendees.&lt;ref name="stl208" /&gt; 

In addition during Lowery's term the city has purchased surveillance cameras to be deployed throughout the city, despite some citizens concerns about privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hollinshed| first = Denise | title =St. Charles looks anew at City Hall security | publisher =[[Stltoday.com]] | date =2-12-2009 | url =http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/28590E3EFA8DFC95862574470004CC20?OpenDocument | accessdate =2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
Lowery has come under some controversy during his mayorship.

==== Eminent Domain ====
According to a ''Wall Street Journal'' article published on August 3, 2005, a development firm turned down a $30 million project to construct condominiums, lofts, and retail space when the owner of a piece of vacant land refused to sell.  According to city officials, the developer did not want the negative publicity due to the controversy of eminent domain and eminent domain abuse.  The company defended their pull-out stating poor soil conditions and flooding in addition to eminent domain issues were to blame.

Lowery commented "The company did not want the adverse publicity.  People don't understand what eminent domain is. They think it's always taking grandma out of her house, and that's not true. I wouldn't touch anything like that. That's political disaster."

The developers had plans on building in Florissant's Old Town historic district, where many building are registered as historic buildings.  The idea of putting an upscale development project certainly would not have been a suitable area.  However, the project might have been ideal for areas such as the east side of the city where many buildings and businesses have become run down or closed.

While Mayor Lowery and former Florissant city coucilwoman Geri Debo pushed to promote the Old Town Florissant area as an Old St. Charles type area to potential businesses, the area did attract a few new stores, but the promised increased foot traffic did not come to fruition and those businesses closed and had problems selling their property.

==== Busch Wildlife ====
Another controversy that Lowery has tried to keep quiet about is his support for his son, Robert Lowery Jr.

Robert Lowery Jr. served as the city administrator for the city of [[O'Fallon, Missouri]] in nearby [[St. Charles County, Missouri]].  Since taking office, the elder Lowery has quietly supported his son on various issues including the annexation of [[August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area]] in nearby [[Weldon Springs, Missouri]].  While the younger Lowery stated that the annexation was an attempt to be viewed as a "good neighbor."  But a local government watchdog group as well as a few other city officials determined the plan to be a case of backdoor politics.  As a fifth ward, the wildlife preserve owned by [[Adolphus Busch IV]] and maintained by the [[Missouri Department of Conservation]] would have allowed developers to move in and whittle away the property for urban sprawl.  Lowery argued that if the city did not annex the land, another nearby town would.

On June 14, 2007, the O'Fallon city council unanimously opposed the annexation for now.  Attending the meeting was Mr. Busch.

Many people in O'Fallon, St. Charles County, as well as patrons of Busch Wildlife and an independent watchdog group would like to see Lowery step down not only for the Busch Wildlife incident but other instance of corruption within the O'Fallon government.

On June 24, 2009 the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that Lowery Jr. has tendered his resignation as O'Fallon City Administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Currier| first = Joel |url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stcharles/story/91DB8EAD67114490862575DF0056416A?OpenDocument |title=City administrator for O'Fallon, Mo., resigns over rift |publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Currier| first = Joel | title =O'Fallon, Mo.

==Contributions==

===Ensemble theories of everything===
In 2006, Standish published a book [http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html Theory of Nothing] that takes a look at ensemble theories of everything, a subject reinvigorated by [[Max Tegmark]] in 1997. He has also been an extensive contributor to the [http://groups.google.com.au/group/everything-list Everything List], an informal discussion group on these ideas, and has published several papers in the area.

Some readers comments in this book include:
"If you only ever read one book about cosmological eschatology, AI, the nature of mind / consciousness / experience, the Simulation Hypothesis, [[algorithmic information theory]], TOEs, quantum mechanics, ontology, scientific philosophy, and mathematical reasoning - make it this one." - Jeff Bone {{Who|date=May 2012}}

===Complex Systems, Evolutionary Systems, Artificial Life===
Standish has been a longtime contributor to the study of [[evolutionary systems]], an important subcategory of [[Complex system|Complex Systems]] research. He often uses  [[Artificial Life]] models to explore evolutionary behaviour.

*In 1998, he chaired [http://www.hpcoders.com.au/c98/c98.htm Complex Systems '98], one of a series of conferences now known as the Asia Pacific Complex Systems conference.
*In 2002, he chaired [http://www.alife.org/alife8 ALife VIII], The 8th International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems.
*He is the lead developer of [http://ecolab.sourceforge.net EcoLab], an [[open source]] [[C++]] based [[Agent-based model|agent based modelling]] framework, as well as the [[Minsky (economic simulator)|Minsky]] visual simulation system.

===Statistical Mechanics of Nonequilibrium Systems===
Standish's PhD involved research into nonequilibrium [[statistical mechanics]]

'''Samuel T. Anders''' ([[callsign]] "'''Longshot'''")  is a [[fictional character]] from the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series, played by [[Michael Trucco]].   He first appeared as a recurring character in the second-season episode "[[Resistance (Battlestar Galactica)|Resistance]]", but assumed a pivotal role in the series by the end.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Although not revealed until the final season of the show, Anders is approximately two thousand years old, and was born as a member of the ill-fated Thirteenth Tribe, a group consisting entirely of Cylons who left Kobol and settled on the first [[Earth]]. Along with fellow Cylons [[Saul Tigh]], [[Ellen Tigh]], [[Galen Tyrol]] and [[Tory Foster]], Anders worked as part of a research group on Resurrection technology. They were warned about a coming disaster by people no one else could see. The messenger that appeared to Anders looked like a woman. When their Earth was destroyed, the five Cylons were resurrected on a subluminal ship in orbit, and traveled to the [[Twelve Colonies]] at sub-lightspeed, stopping at the temple of the five on algae planet and arriving at the time of the First Cylon War. Seeking to end the conflict, the five Earth Cylons presented the Colonial Cylon forces with a deal &amp;mdash; if the warring Centurions called off the war, the five would teach them to create humanoid Cylon models, and give them Resurrection technology.

The Centurions agreed, and departed from Colonial space along with Anders and his cohorts, but their efforts ultimately backfired. The first humanoid Cylon created, [[John Cavil]], also known simply as Number One, was incensed that he had been created with so many human weaknesses, and turned on his creators. He killed them, arranging it that they would be resurrected with no memory of who they really were, and carefully inserted them into Colonial society with false memories in order to give them a plausible background-cover.

===Caprica ===
Exactly when Anders arrived on [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]]  is unrevealed, but he became involved in the popular Colonial sport of Pyramid, becoming a star player for the Caprica Buccaneers.

When the Cylon attack on the Colonies came, Anders and his team were undergoing high altitude training in the mountains and thus escaped the initial devastation.  Anders muttered that "this has all happened before."  Rounding up other survivors, supplies and weapons, the team, with Anders as their leader, became the nucleus of a functioning resistance group against the Cylon occupation, operating from a wilderness base in the vicinity of the city of Delphi.  Everyone looked to Anders for leadership including the coach and he wasn't aware that he ended up with two Cylons in his resistance movement: a Simon (who he found out about when he rescued Starbuck) and a Cavil who grew sympathetic towards humanity due to his time in the Resistance.  It was in the area of their base that they encountered Lieutenant [[Kara Thrace]] (Starbuck) and [[Karl Agathon]] (Helo) during the events of the episode "[[Resistance (Battlestar Galactica)|Resistance]]" after Thrace returned to Caprica to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo on the orders of President [[Laura Roslin]].  Anders and his team ambushed them after being told by Cavil that they might be Cylons.

Thrace and Anders swiftly form a relationship and, when she has to return to the Fleet, she promises him that she will return to Caprica and rescue his group.  She secures this promise by giving Anders her fleet [[dogtags]].  However, President Roslin and [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] deny Starbuck's request to lead a search and rescue mission back to Caprica, stating the situation is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Anders's team struggle to survive and continue their attacks on the Cylons.

In the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]", during a sabotage mission, Anders is caught in the rubble of a parking structure where he encounters the Cylons [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]], [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon "Boomer" Valerii]] along with a [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]] copy.  The Three attempts to kill Anders, but Caprica Six and Valerii (Number Eight), having decided to sympathize with the human cause, turn against Three and allow Anders to escape.

During the episodes "[[Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)|Lay Down Your Burdens]]", Parts I and II, Thrace is finally given the go-ahead to lead a group of Raptors to Caprica and gather the survivors. Once found, Anders's team comes under attack by Cylon Centurions who discover their encampment and drive them out, forcing the heavily outnumbered resistance group deep into the wilderness where they take cover in a ravine.  After an unsettling 18-hour standoff, the team discovers the Cylons have completely withdrawn from the area.  A mysterious survivor among the group (later discovered to be a copy of the Cylon [[John Cavil]]), announces the Cylons have left the planet.

===New Caprica===
Once at the fleet, Anders and Thrace begin a proper relationship which causes torn feelings for [[Lee Adama]].  During the year that passes after settling on [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#New Caprica|New Caprica]], Thrace and Anders marry and the two live in a tent in the ramshackle "New Caprica City" under the neglectful authority of President [[Gaius Baltar]]. Anders becomes seriously ill with [[pneumonia]] at one point, but makes a full recovery. After the Cylons invade New Caprica at the end of the second season, and Starbuck is taken into custody by the Cylon [[Leoben Conoy]], Anders once again finds himself as one of the leaders of the resistance against a Cylon occupation as seen at the beginning of the third season.

Following the escape from New Caprica, the episode "[[Collaborators (Battlestar Galactica)|Collaborators]]" sees Anders becoming one of the six members of the Circle, a [[Star Chamber]] like group commissioned by the newly sworn in President [[Tom Zarek]] to try, judge, and execute Cylon collaborators.  After thirteen such executions, Anders quits The Circle, having lost his taste for revenge, and is immediately replaced by his wife as a new member.  Anders and Thrace subsequently quarrel, which exposes numerous deep rifts that had emerged in their marriage and the two separate.

Midway through the series’ third season, Anders and Thrace try to reconcile their marriage, but Thrace's growing love for Lee Adama makes things difficult.

In the episode "[[Maelstrom (Battlestar Galactica)|Maelstrom]]", Anders asks her to go with him to another ship for some much needed rest and relaxation to which she replies she would think about it.  He leaves the room and the two never fully resolve their soured relationship. After Starbuck's apparent death in the same episode, Anders starts to drink heavily. In mourning, he finds himself in a drunken state atop one of the [[Colonial Viper]]s in the hangar. Lee Adama tries to talk him down, but Anders slips and falls, breaking his leg.

===Revelation===
In the episode "[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part I]]", Anders is seen wearing the uniform of a Colonial Fleet Ensign, having signed up for flight training since Thrace’s death.  He also shows the beginnings of a relationship with [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Seelix, Spec. Diana "Hardball"|Diana Seelix]], another new pilot recruited from among Galactica’s deck crew.

As the trial of Gaius Baltar commences, Anders, along with his fellow hidden Cylons, Foster, Tyrol and Saul Tigh, begins to hear strange music coming from a radio in [[List of Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining) locations#Joe's Bar|Joe's Bar]]. Anders and Foster sleep together at this time. In the season 3 finale, "[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]", the four become aware of the fact they are Cylons&lt;ref name=rdm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07085/770732-352.stm |title=Executive producer Ron Moore discusses thrilling 'Galactica' cliffhanger |accessdate=2007-03-26 |author=Rob Owen |date=2007-03-26 |publisher=Post-Gazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[hallucinatory]] [[music]] (which turns out to be "[[All Along The Watchtower]]" as arranged by [[Bear McCreary]] and performed by [[Bt4]]) only they can hear, and an apparent mental "switch" that goes off within them. Initially appalled by the discovery, after Saul Tigh declares his loyalty to the Fleet, regardless of who he might be, Anders follows his lead and reports for duty to prepare for battle against the Cylon fleet.

In the first episode of the fourth season, "[[He That Believeth In Me]]", Anders flies his first battle mission and cannot fire upon his targeted Cylon ship due to the weapons being jammed. The Cylon pilot recognizes him as a Cylon, and the Cylon fighters retreat to their baseships and jump away. After being reunited with the newly returned Thrace, who is thought by many to be a Cylon, Anders tells her he will still love her even if she is. Kara replies if he were a Cylon, she would kill him with no qualms. He and the other three secret Cylons meet in secret and he is later assigned as a member of Thrace's crew on the ''Demetrius'', on a secret mission to find Earth.

While aboard the ''Demetrius'', Anders tries to reconnect with his wife and constantly reassure the rest of the crew of the ship who are lacking confidence in Thrace's ability and purpose (especially when she begins to take advice from the captured Cylon, [[Leoben Conoy]]). When the crew eventually mutiny against Thrace, Anders is one of the few who comes to his wife's aid even going so far as to shoot Felix Gaeta in the leg to prevent him jumping the ''Demetrius'' back to the human fleet against Thrace's wishes. Anders continues to show his loyalty to his wife by accompanying her to the damaged Cylon basestar and assisting her with her plans.

Thrace is shocked when it is revealed in "[[Revelations (Battlestar Galactica)|Revelations]]" that her husband is a Cylon, but near the end of the episode they are seen together in the corridor paying respect to a photo of deceased comrade [[Louanne Katraine]]. On the destroyed Earth, Anders finds the remains of a guitar and begins to [[subconscious]]ly play the song "[[All Along the Watchtower]]" on it, and remembers he had once played the song for the woman he loved. He then realizes that he, along with the other members of the Final Five, had lived their past lives on Earth.

===Hybrid===
During the mutiny led by [[Felix Gaeta]] and [[Tom Zarek]], Anders is badly beaten and thrown into the brig with the other prisoners loyal to Admiral Adama.  They are eventually freed by Thrace and Lee Adama.  Anders is shot in the neck during their escape, and a tearful Kara Thrace refuses to leave his side. [[Romo Lampkin]], encountering them in the corridor, helps Kara take her husband to [[Sherman Cottle|Dr. Cottle]].

In the episode "[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]", Anders experiences a reawakening of his Cylon memories due to the brain damage caused by the wound. He frantically attempts to educate his fellow 'Final Five' crewmembers regarding their purpose and destiny, but eventually succumbs to his wounds. The bullet is removed, but he remains comatose. At the end of the following episode, "[[Deadlock (Battlestar Galactica)|Deadlock]]", Anders begins to show brain activity. In "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]", it is shown that Anders' brain activity is very unusual but not indicative of conscious thought. A Number Eight suggests linking him to the datastream aboard the Baseship might help.

Acting on the Eight's idea the Cylons immerse him in a [[Cylon Basestar#The Hybrid|Hybrid]] pool much like those on Cylon baseships and connect him to the datastream. Once connected, he begins mimicking the mannerisms of the baseship Hybrids, down to the incoherent (to casual observers) but prophetic ramblings. Thrace visits him and requests to be alone with him. Saying her goodbyes she attempts to kill him by gunshot to the head, but Anders, acting on reflex, catches and almost crushes Thrace's forearm, telling her, just as another Basestar Hybrid did, that she is the Harbinger of Death. As he does so power fluctuations, which have been going on for sometime on ''Galactica'' grow much worse, including surging power levels of the main engines. Anders releases Thrace and the power fluctuations subside but do not end

It is determined Anders is directly (though inadvertently) interacting with ''Galactica's'' power grid (but not the firewalled computers) via the Cylon organic resin applied to her superstructure for repair purposes.  It is theoretically possible for Anders to jump the ship on his own just like a Hybrid on a Baseship; in effect, Anders has become ''Galactica's'' own Hybrid.  Disturbed by this development, Colonel Tigh orders that Anders be disconnected.  Removed from the datastream, Anders reverts to his comatose state.

Later, in the episode "[[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]", Thrace once again visits her husband, because she believes there is a pattern in a drawing given to her by Hera Agathon, which turned out to be a representation of musical notes for a song Thrace's father played for her as a child. She is determined to get answers from Anders and reconnects him to talk to him. When he is plugged back in, the power surges briefly return but then subside as Samuel Anders vocalizes the line of code "New command".  By this point, Thrace has apparently accepted the permanence of Anders’ condition.

During the final episodes of the series, "[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak]]", Anders plays a pivotal role in the Battle of the Colony, as, acting in the role of ''Galactica's'' Hybrid, he is able to remotely access the Cylon colony's Hybrids and take both them and the weapons that they control offline, preventing ''Galactica's'' destruction. Despite his state, he is able to share his memories during the attempt to recreate resurrection by the other members of the Final Five connecting to the datastream in his tank.

===Finale===
Once the fleet finally arrives at the new Earth, the decision is made for Anders to pilot ''Galactica'' and the rest of the fleet into the sun, leaving humanity to resettle on the planet below with minimal technology.  When Kara leaves after saying her final goodbyes to Sam, Anders quietly responds, “see you on the other side”.  With the last of the crew on Earth, Anders pilots the fleet into the sun.

==Personality and traits==
Despite his fame, Anders cared little for the glamorous aspects of his life as a Pyramid star, instead revealing in an interview that he took pleasure in the subtler aspects of the game, the joys of creating an impressive play, relating the sport to more mathematical concepts of physics and precision.   Although highly successful at the game, he revealed that winning championships was of comparatively little interest to him compared to these more nebulous aspects.

As a resistance leader, Anders showed a talent for organization and a good tactical ability, mounting a number of highly successful strikes, even some deep inside Cylon occupied cities.  He understandably carried a deep hatred for the Cylons, but also had a pragmatic attitude, such as his willingness to accept that the [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Athena" Agathon|Number Eight copy]] who had been traveling with Karl Agathon was on their side. After the escape from New Caprica, Sam joins a tribunal that is kidnapping, trying, and executing those they deem to have collaborated with the Cylons. While Sam is at first willing to execute these collaborators, he quickly loses his taste for vengeance and resigns from the tribunal, as he no longer believes that they seek justice. When Kara later joins the tribunal, he views this as a personal betrayal.

Throughout their tumultuous relationship, Anders showed a great deal of loyalty to his wife Kara Thrace, making frequent attempts to reconcile after their estrangement and, after her return from the dead, often being her strongest advocate. His loyalty to her only wavered during the two months where she was believed dead, when he appeared to be forming a relationship with Diana Seelix, something that he later apologized to Seelix for after Thrace’s return, and had at least 1 sexual encounter with Tory Foster.

{{nihongo|'''''Seaman'''''|シーマン|Shīman}} is a [[Digital pet|virtual pet]] [[video game]] for the [[Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast]]. It is one of the few Dreamcast games to take advantage of the [[microphone]] attachment. The narration is voiced by [[Toshiyuki Hosokawa]] in the original Japanese-language version and by [[Leonard Nimoy]] in the English-language version. The face of the Seaman creature is actually that of the game's producer, [[Yoot Saito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=DreamcastGaga | date=November 15, 2012 | title=Seaman: the prohibited pet! | url=http://www.dcgaga.com/2012/11/seaman-prohibited-pet.html | accessdate=2012-11-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000523/http://www.dcgaga.com/2012/11/seaman-prohibited-pet.html | archive-date=July 15, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited edition  game titled '''''Christmas Seaman''''' was released in Japan on December 16, 1999 alongside a translucent, red Dreamcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=November 30, 1999 | title=Christmas Seaman | url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/072/072568p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, ''Seaman'' was re-released in Japan for the [[PlayStation 2]] as '''''Seaman: Kindan no Pet - Gaze Hakushi no Jikken Shima''''' (シーマン~禁断のペット~ガゼー博士の実験島), the first edition of which came with a microphone. A PC version for [[Microsoft Windows]] was planned, with the Seaman being able to interact with the user's applications. No release date was specified, and it was later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/seaman-goes-pc/1100-2666631/ |title=Seaman Goes PC  |accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel called ''[[Seaman 2]]'' was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 in 2007.

== Story and setting ==
As a new pet owner, the player is given the responsibility of caring for and learning about the enigmatic "Seaman" species, using a replica of the discoverer's laboratory. The player must figure everything out by themselves, such as appropriate care, with some guidance from the narrator [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Himself.

==Backstory==

In the game's manual, it contains the backstory about the seaman. During the 1930s, Dr. Jean Paul Gassé was a member of a special team of French biologists sent to [[Egypt]] by the French government. During that time, Dr. Gassé was determined to research a creature that was an "omnipotent messenger of gods" among the ruins of the [[Third Dynasty]]. In March 1932, in the city of [[Alexandria]], Dr. Gassé met up a local resident, who, while fishing, caught a seaman. Dr. Gassé obtained a sample of some of the seaman eggs, and went back to [[France]] with the egg samples in his possession. 

When Dr. Gassé returned to France, he attempted to raise the eggs, but in the process, the seaman died. Shortly after this, he published a thesis of his work. Leading academics, however, dismissed him and his work as a PR stunt and without proper evidence to support these theories. As the result, the work was ignored, and no one believed him. His hypothesis suggested that the Seaman was responsible for transferring knowledge that increased during the Third Dynasty across oceans and other lands. This theory became the basis for Anthro-Bio Archaeology, which is a highly valued field of study.

Shortly after publishing his thesis, Dr. Gassé was fired from his post. After his dismissal, news of Gassé’s whereabouts and activities were unknown, and details during those times were sketchy. Rumors began circulating that Dr. Gassé's trail traced to some remote islands in Southeast Asia. It is known, however, that he escaped the horrors of [[World War II]] and met up with his colleague, Kimo Masuda. It became clear that sometime during these years they were able to conduct further research on Seaman's evolution, quite possibly even up to the creature walking on all fours. Unfortunately, there was very little hard data or evidence that substantiated these findings.

In March 1996, the French Government established the Anthro-Bio Archeological Research Institute (ABARI), headquartered in [[Paris]]. The institute is based on the work of Dr. Gassé, and most of the modern day research of Seaman specimens has taken place there. In 1997, the ABARI announced  there was a strong possibility that these Seaman species were closely related to the origins of ancient civilizations in Egypt. On October 6, 1998, one of Gassé’s formaldehyde specimens is discovered at the University of Paris.

On February 15, 1999, parts of Gassé's journal and note entries were found in the Masuda family storehouse in Matsuzaka City in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Professor Kendare Takahashi, who was directing the Japanese branch of the ABARI, successfully managed  to breed Seaman eggs in captivity, in July the same year. Soon after, Seaman was presented in aquariums across Japan. In July 2000, an expedition team embarked for Egypt in a first major research of the Seaman in the wild.

== Gameplay ==
The "Seaman" is a form of freshwater [[fish]] (the color and shape of the fins suggest that it is a [[Carp]]) with a very lifelike human face. It possesses human mannerisms and behavior with which the player interacts.

[[File:Dreamcast-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Seaman is played using voice commands and came bundled with the official Dreamcast microphone.]]
''Seaman'' is considered a unique video game in that it presents limited action. The player's role is to feed and care for Seaman, while providing him with the company that he needs. In fact, the player is required to check on the Seaman every day of real time, or he could die. A portion of Seaman's knowledge is random trivia. When he asks what the player's birthday is (and the player responds via the microphone input), Seaman will then share significant events which happened on that date.

The Seaman becomes fairly [[domestication|domesticated]], but this does not prevent it from insulting the player or constructing less-than-friendly remarks.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The player is provided with an unhatched Seaman [[egg (biology)|egg]] at the beginning of the game and through various terms of development and conditions develops and interacts with it. By using various buttons on the Dreamcast controller, the player controls all of the machinery and physical contact with the mysterious creature. The player is also provided with multiple Seamen for breeding and interaction purposes. Over the course of the game, it is required of the player to [[evolution|evolve]] their Seaman to different stages in its life cycle, eventually transforming into a [[frog]]-like creature outlined on the Disc's cover.

;Mushroomer
In the Seaman's first days of life, it begins as a ''Mushroomer'', a form consisting of a well-developed optic organ and a [[flagellum]], lacking a face or any verbal means of communication. In this form, it is essentially a [[parasite]], which overruns a host [[Nautilus]] via being eaten and consumes it from the inside out for nourishment. Mushroomers tend to stick to one side of the tank by the ends of their flagellum if left alone. In this stage, the player's interaction is somewhat minimal and plays similar to a tutorial, allowing the player to learn to control the heat in the fish tank, direct the Mushroomers, and clean out any filthy water that has accumulated over time.

;Gillman
After emerging from the deceased body of the [[Nautilus]], the organism enters a stage called the ''Gillman'', which features a humanoid face and small, fish-like body. During this stage, the Seaman becomes capable of speech, copying and reiterating comments through a microphone input. At this stage, the player will begin the communication process and continue facilitating the aquarium as the Gillman grows larger, developing scales and a larger vocabulary.  Although they begin small, the Gillmen soon kill one another until only two remain. Their genders are indeterminate, however. When they get to a certain point, you can name one of them, and it will change its color and gender.

;Podfish
In this stage, the Seaman is still fish-like in appearance and is similar to that of the Gillman but more developed. After mating, the male Podfish dies.

The aquarium is also transformed into a [[terrarium]], being drained of most of the water and introducing land and oxygen to breathe, the female then lays eggs on the shore.  Shortly after the deposit of the eggs, the female also dies, leaving the player with the hatching of a new evolutionary stage.

;Tadman
Instead of the introduction of new ''Mushroomers'' like the player began the game with, the player is provided with a new form called ''Tadmen'', that look similar to matured tadpoles entering the frog stage. The Tadmen's diet consists of feeding upon their fellow siblings until the number is reduced to two. When this happens, the siblings will produce an egg, which will hatch into a Frogman.

;Frogman
This is the Seaman's final stage of its maturity process. It has now become an [[amphibian|amphibious]] creature, with its humanoid face and a frog's body. Now able to co-exist between the habitats of water and dry land, the Frogman is now capable of powerful leaps and the consumption of insectoid organisms; however, like the real-world frog, the creature still requires the moisture of water to stay alive and the player is now provided with a sprinkler system to achieve this. It is also at this stage where the player releases the seaman into the wild. While anything concerning metamorphosis and reproduction are left to speculation while the Frogmen are in the wild, it can be assumed the Seaman will eventually lay Mushroomer eggs and start the cycle over.

==Reception==
In Japan, the Dreamcast version of ''Seaman'' sold 399,342 copies as of February 1, 2004, making it the third best-selling Dreamcast game in the region at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sega Dreamcast Japanese Ranking | url=http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/dc.php | work=Japan-GameCharts.com | accessdate=2008-12-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504132503/http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/dc.php|archivedate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation 2 version of the game sold 305,632 in Japan as of November 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sony PS2 Japanese Ranking | url=http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/ps2.php | work=Japan-GameCharts.com | accessdate=2008-12-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303232647/http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/ps2.php|archivedate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Famitsu]]'' rated the original Dreamcast version of the game 29/40,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Langan, Matthew | date=July 26, 1999 | title=Famitsu Weekly Reviews Latest Dreamcast Games | url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/069/069082p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored the PlayStation 2 remake a 31/40.&lt;ref&gt;NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: シーマン ~禁断のペット~ ガゼー博士の実験島.

The [[Angry Video Game Nerd]], a game critic who generally reviews only bad games, reviewed the game in 2015 with a positive impression, 16 years after it was released in Japan, praising the game's creativity and voice function, but also criticized its tedious gameplay and controls. He dedicated the episode in memory of the late [[Leonard Nimoy]], who died earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seaman for Dreamcast - Angry Video Game Nerd|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IV8hCvsXy0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14440">{{for|the telephony or computing term|quality of service}}'''Service quality (SQ)''', in its contemporary conceptualisation, is a comparison of perceived expectations (E) of a [[service (business)|service]] with perceived performance (P), giving rise to the equation SQ=P-E.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Booms (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptualistion of service quality has its origins in the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, R.L., Balakrishnan, P.V. S. and Barry, B., "Outcome Satisfaction in Negotiation: A Test of Expectancy Disconfirmation," ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,'' Vol. 60, no. 2, 1994, Pages 252-275&lt;/ref&gt;

A business with high service quality will meet or exceed [[customer]] expectations whilst remaining economically [[competitivity|competitive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/services/why-quality/overview.html  ASQ The Global voice of Quality]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from empirical studies suggests that improved service quality increases profitability and long term economic competitiveness. Improvements to service quality may be achieved by improving operational processes; identifying problems quickly and systematically; establishing valid and reliable service [[performance measure]]s and measuring [[customer satisfaction]] and other performance outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/services/why-quality/overview.html  ASQ The Global voice of Quality]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

From the viewpoint of [[Administration (business)|business administration]], service quality is an achievement in [[customer service]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenzelmann. ''Kundenbindung'' German, 3. Auflage, Berlin: Cornelsen Verlag Skriptor GmbH &amp; Co KG 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It reflects at each service encounter. Customers form service expectations from past experiences, word of mouth and marketing communications.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A.; Berry, Leonard L.; Zeithaml, Valarie A., "Understanding Customer Expectations of Service," ''Sloan Management Review,'' Vol. 32, no. 3, 1991, pp 39 - 48&lt;/ref&gt; In general, customers compare perceived service with expected service, and  which if the former falls short of the latter the customers are disappointed.

For example, in the case of [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]], wherein TAJ remaining the old world, luxury brand in the five-star category, the umbrella branding was diluting the image of the TAJ brand because although the different hotels such as ''Vivanta by Taj''- the four star category, ''Gateway'' in the three star category and ''Ginger'' the two star economy brand, were positioned and categorised differently, customers still expected high quality of Taj.

The measurement of subjective aspects of customer service depends on the conformity of the expected benefit with the perceived result. This in turns depends upon the customer's expectation in terms of service, they might receive and the service provider's ability and talent to  present this expected service. Successful companies add benefits to their offering that not only satisfy the customers but also surprise and [[customer delight|delight]] them. Delighting customers is a matter of exceeding their expectations. 
 
Pre-defined objective criteria may be unattainable in practice, in which case, the best possible achievable result becomes the ideal. The objective ideal may still be poor, in subjective terms.

Service quality can be related to service potential (for example, worker's qualifications); service process (for example, the quickness of service) and  service result (customer satisfaction).

'''Individual service quality''' states the service quality of employees as distinct from the quality that the customers perceived&lt;ref&gt;UYSAL, H.Tezcan &amp; Mehmet Selami YILDIZ (2013), “Effect of Organizational Levels on Individual Service Quality in Health Service: A Research on Doctors”. İktisat İşletme ve Finans Dergisi. 28(329), pp.21-48.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Evolution of service quality concept==

Historically, scholars have treated service quality as very difficult to define and measure, due to the inherent intangible nature of services, which are often experienced subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C.,  "Scandinavian Management and the Nordic School of Services‐Contributions to Service Management and Quality", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management'', Vol. 2, No. 3, pp.17-26, DOI:10.1108/09564239110007247&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest attempts to grapple with the service quality concept came from the so-called ''Nordic School''. In this approach, service quality was seen as having two basic dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "A Service Quality Model and its Marketing Implications," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, pp 36–44, DOI:10.1108/EUM0000000004784&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''''Technical quality:''''' ''What'' the customer receives as a result of interactions with the service firm (e.g. a meal in a restaurant, a bed in a hotel)
: '''''Functional quality''''': ''How'' the customer receives the service; the expressive nature of the service delivery (e.g. courtesy, attentiveness, promptness)

The technical quality is relatively objective and therefore easy to measure. However, difficulties arise when trying to evaluate functional quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "A Service Quality Model and its Marketing Implications," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, p. 39, DOI:10.1108/EUM0000000004784&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions of service quality==
[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality]]
A customer's expectation of a particular service is determined by factors such as recommendations, personal needs and past experiences. The expected service and the perceived service sometimes may not be equal, thus leaving a gap. The service quality model or the ‘GAP model’ developed in 1985, highlights the main requirements for delivering high service quality. It identifies five ‘gaps’ that cause unsuccessful delivery. Customers generally have a tendency to compare the service they 'experience' with the service they 'expect'. If the experience does not match the expectation, there arises a gap.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L.,  Zeithaml, V. A., "Understanding Customer Expectations of Service," ''Sloan Management Review,'' Vol. 32, no. 3, 1991, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Given the emphasis on expectations, this approach to measuring service quality is known as the ''expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm'' and is the dominant model in the consumer behaviour and marketing literature. &lt;ref&gt;Zwick, R., Pieters, R. and Baumgartner, H., "On the Practical Significance of Hindsight Bias: The Case of the Expectancy-disconfirmation Model of Consumer Satisfaction", ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'', Vol. 64, no. 1, pp 103-117, DOI: 10.1006/obhd.1995.1&lt;/ref&gt;

A model of service quality, based on the expectancy-disconformation paradigm, and developed by [[A. Parasuraman]], [[Valarie Zeithaml|Valarie A. Zeithaml]] and [[Leonard Berry (professor)|Len Berry]], identifies the principal dimensions (or components) of service quality and proposes a scale for measuring service quality, known as [[SERVQUAL]]. The model's developers originally identified [[SERVQUAL#Determinants|ten dimensions of service quality]] that influence customer's perceptions of service quality.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Parasuraman|Parasuraman]], [[Valarie Zeithaml]] and Berry (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after extensive testing and retesting, some of the dimensions were found to be autocorrelated and the total number of dimensions was reduced to five, namely - reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness. These five dimensions are thought to represent the dimensions of service quality across a range of industries and settings. &lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., "Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48 &lt;/ref&gt; Among students of marketing, the mnemonic,  '''RATER''', an acronym formed from the first letter of each of the five dimensions, is often used as an aid to recall.

In spite of the dominance of the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm, scholars have questioned its validity. In particular scholars have pointed out the expetancy-disconfirmation approach had its roots in consumer research and was fundamentally concerned with measuring customer satisfaction rather than service quality. In other words, questions surround the ''face validity'' of the model and whether service quality can be conceptualised as a ''gap''.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, R.L., ''Satisfaction: A Behavioural Perspective on the Consumer,'' Boston, MA, Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1996; Souca, Ma. L., "SERVQUAL - Thirty years of research on service quality with implications for customer satisfaction," in ''Marketing - from Information to Decision,'' [Proceedings of the International Conference], Cluj-Napoca: Babes Bolyai University, 2011, pp 420 -429; van Dyke, T.P.,   Kappelman, L.A. and Prybutok, V.R.,"Measuring Information Systems Service Quality: Concerns on the Use of the SERVQUAL Questionnaire," ''MIS Quarterly,'' Vol. 21, No. 2, 1997, pp. 195-208, &lt;Online:  https://www.jstor.org/stable/249419&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring service quality==

Measuring service quality may involve both subjective and objective processes. In both cases, it is often some aspect of [[customer satisfaction]] which is being assessed. However, customer satisfaction is an [[indirect measure]] of service quality.

==E-service quality: The next frontier==

Given the widespread use of internet and [[e-commerce]], researchers have also sought to define and measure [[e-service]] quality. Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;5) define e-service quality as the “extent to which a website facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing, and delivery.” Wolfinbarger and Gilly (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;183) define e-service quality as “the beginning to the end of the transaction including information search, website navigation, order, customer service interactions, delivery, and satisfaction with the ordered product.”.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Valarie A. Zeithaml, and Arvind Malhotra (2005), “E-S-QUAL A Multiple-Item Scale for Assessing Electronic Service Quality,” Journal of Service Research, 7 (3), 213-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfinbarger, Mary, and Mary C. Gilly (2003), “eTailQ: Dimensionalizing, Measuring and Predicting Etail Quality,” Journal of Retailing 79 (3), 183-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent paper examined research on e-service quality.&lt;ref&gt;Jukka Ojasalo. E-Service Quality: A Conceptual Model. ''International Journal of Arts and Sciences, 3''(7): 127 - 143 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The author identified four dimensions of e-service quality: website design, fulfillment, customer service, and security and privacy.

===Measuring subjective elements of service quality===

Subjective processes can be assessed in characteristics (assessed be the [[SERVQUAL]] method); in incidents (assessed in [[Critical Incident Technique|Critical Incident Theory]]) and in problems (assessed by ''Frequenz Relevanz Analyse'' a German term. The most important and most used method with which to measure subjective elements of service quality is the Servqual method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Measuring objective elements of service quality===

Objective processes may be subdivided into primary processes and secondary processes. During primary processes, silent customers create test episodes of service or the service episodes of normal customers are observed. In secondary processes, quantifiable factors such as numbers of customer complaints or numbers of returned goods are analysed in order to make inferences about service quality.

==Approaches to the improvement of service quality==

In general, an improvement in service design and delivery helps achieve higher levels of service quality. For example, in service design, changes can be brought about in the design of service products and facilities. On the other hand, in service delivery, changes can be brought about in the service delivery processes, the environment in which the service delivery takes place and improvements in the interaction processes between customers and service providers.

Various techniques can be used to make changes such as: [[Quality function deployment]] (QFD); [[fail-safe|failsafing]]; moving the line of visibility and the line of accessibility; and [[Service blueprint|blueprinting]].

==Approaches to improve the conformity of service quality==

In order to ensure and increase the 'conformance quality' of services, that is,  service delivery happening as designed, various methods are available. Some of these include [[Surety|Guaranteeing]]; [[Mystery Shopping]]; Recovering; Setting standards and measuring; [[Statistical process control]] and [[Customer involvement management|Customer involvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Harvey, "Service quality: a tutorial", Journal of Operations Management, 1998, No. 16, pp.583–597&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality and customer satisfaction ==
The relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction has received considerable attention in academic literature. The results of most research studies have indicated that the service quality and customer satisfaction are indeed independent but are closely related that and a rise in one is likely to result in an increase in another construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction – a factor specific approachnull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/08876040210433248|journal = Journal of Services Marketing|date = 2002-07-01|issn = 0887-6045|pages = 363–379|volume = 16|issue = 4|doi = 10.1108/08876040210433248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Measuring Service Quality in Ethiopian Airlines|last = Shanka|first = Mesay Sata|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Educational and Social Research|doi = 10.5901/jesr.2012.v2n9p173|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 2 |issue = 9|pages = 173–180|issn = 2239-978X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Peter Marriott''' (30 January 1947 – 20 April 1991) was an English musician, songwriter and [[frontman]] of two notable [[rock and roll]] bands, spanning over two decades. Marriott is remembered for his powerful singing voice which belied his small stature, and for his aggressive approach as a guitarist in [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] rock bands [[Small Faces]] (1965–1969 and 1977–1978) and [[Humble Pie]] (1969–1975 and 1980–1981). Marriott was inducted posthumously into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012 as a member of Small Faces.

In Britain, Marriott became a popular, often-photographed [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] style icon through his role as lead singer and guitarist with the Small Faces in the mid to late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott was influenced from an early age by his heroes including [[Buddy Holly]], [[Booker T &amp; the MG's]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Bobby Bland]].
In later life Marriott became disillusioned with the music industry and turned his back on the big record companies, remaining in relative obscurity. He returned to his music roots playing the pubs and clubs around London and Essex.&lt;ref&gt;

==Early years==
Steve Marriott was born on 30 January 1947 at East Ham Memorial Hospital, [[Plashet]], East Ham, (London, E7), England&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 30
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to parents Kay and Bill Marriott who lived at Strone Road, Manor Park. Born three weeks [[Premature birth|premature]] and weighing just {{convert|4|lb|4|oz|abbr=on}}, he developed [[Neonatal jaundice|jaundice]] and was kept in hospital four weeks before being well enough to go home.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | pages = 30–31
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott came from a working-class background and attended Monega Junior School. His father Bill worked as a printer and later owned a [[jellied eels]] stall, called 'Bill's Eels', outside the Ruskin Arms hotel. For a short time he also sold [[pie and mash]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | pages = 31–32
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kay worked at the [[Tate &amp; Lyle]] factory in [[Silvertown]]. Bill was an accomplished pub pianist. Bill bought Marriott a [[ukulele]] and harmonica which Marriott taught himself to play. Marriott showed an early interest in singing and performing, [[busking]] at local bus-stops for extra pocket money and winning talent contests during the family's annual holiday to [[Jaywick]] [[Holiday camp]] near [[Clacton-on-Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = [[Steve Marriott - All Too Beautiful...]]
 | pages = 34–35
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 at the age of twelve, Marriott formed his first band with school friends Nigel Chapin and Robin Andrews. They were called 'The Wheels', later the 'Coronation Kids', and finally 'Mississippi Five'. They later added Simon Simkins and Vic Dixon to their line-up. From a young age, Marriott was a huge fan of American singer [[Buddy Holly]] and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. He wrote his first song, called "Shelia My Dear", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Buddy Holly and his bandmates also [[nicknamed]] him 'Buddy'.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 44
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They would play at the local coffee bars in [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]] and perform Saturday morning gigs at the Essoldo Cinema in Manor Park.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 44
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott was a cheeky, hyperactive child, according to his mother Kay, and well known by his neighbours in Strone Road for playing pranks and practical jokes. While he was a pupil at local Sandringham [[Secondary Modern School]], Marriott was said to be responsible for deliberately starting a fire in a classroom,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 50
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though he always denied this.

In 1960, Bill Marriott spotted an advertisement in a London newspaper for a new [[Artful Dodger]] replacement to appear in [[Lionel Bart]]'s popular musical ''[[Oliver!]]'', based on the novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], at the ''New Theatre'' (now called the [[Noël Coward Theatre]]) in London's West End, and without telling his son, applied for him to audition. At the age of thirteen, Marriott auditioned for the role. He sang two songs, "[[Who's Sorry Now]]" by [[Connie Francis]], and "[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]" by Buddy Holly. Bart was impressed with Marriott's vocal abilities and hired him. Marriott stayed with the show for twelve months, playing various boys' roles during that time, for which he was paid £8 a week.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott was also chosen to provide lead vocals for the Artful Dodger songs "[[Consider Yourself]]", "Be Back Soon", and "I'd Do Anything", which appear on the official album to the stage show, released by [[World Record Club]] and recorded at the famous [[Abbey Road Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott&amp;nbsp;– All Too Beautiful...
 | pages = 47–48
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the Marriott family moved from Strone Road to a new council flat in Daines Close, Manor Park.

Following Marriott's successful acting debut in ''Oliver!'', his family encouraged him to pursue an acting career. In 1961 he auditioned and was accepted as a student at the [[Italia Conti Academy|Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts]] in London. Because his family were unable to afford the private school fees, it was mutually agreed the fees would be deducted from acting work the school found him.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott&amp;nbsp;– All Too Beautiful...
 | pages = 53–54
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Marriott's enrolment at the Italia Conti Academy, he quickly gained acting roles, working consistently in film, television and radio, often [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the energetic [[Cockney]] child. Soon he lost interest in acting and turned his attention back to his first love, which was music. His parents were devastated and his decision to give up acting caused a family rift. As a result, he left the family home for a short period to stay with friends.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1963, Marriott wrote "Imaginary Love" and touted it around the big [[record labels]] in London. On the strength of "Imaginary Love", Marriott secured a [[Decca Records]] deal as a solo artist with Dick Reagan (also an agent for [[Cliff Richard]]). Marriott's first single was a song written by [[Kenny Lynch]], "Give Her My Regards", with Marriott's self-penned song as the [[B-side]]. The single was released in July 1963 and was commercially unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = small faces the young mods' forgotten story
 | page = 25
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Marriott formed The Frantiks, who recorded a [[cover version]] of [[Cliff Richard]]'s song "[[Move It]]" with ex-[[The Shadows|Shadows]] drummer [[Tony Meehan]], who was brought in to help with production.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 69
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the single being hawked around the major record companies, no one was interested and the song was never released. The band then changed their name to [[The Moments (English group)|The Moments]], or Marriott and his Moments. They played support for artists such as [[The Nashville Teens]], [[The Animals]], [[Georgie Fame]] and [[John Mayall]], playing venues such as the [[100 Club]] in Soho, London, and the [[Crawdaddy Club]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]. The Moments gained a loyal following, and for a short time had their own [[fanzine]], ''Beat '64'', started by Stuart Tuck and dedicated to 'Steve Marriott's Moments'.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 69
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They are noted as performing a total of 80 gigs in 1964. The group was asked to record a single for the American market, a cover version of [[The Kinks]]' UK hit song "[[You Really Got Me]]", released on the World Artists record label (1964).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = small faces the young mods' forgotten story
 | pages = 23–24
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When their version of "You Really Got Me" failed to get attention, Marriott was dropped from the band, with members claiming he was too young to be a lead singer.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 | pages = 68–69
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Don Craine, frontman of London R&amp;B band [[Downliners Sect|The Downliners Sect]], Marriott applied to join the band as a replacement harmonica player. Craine did not invite him to audition because he knew Marriott wanted to be lead vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walton |first=Christian |url=http://musicneedshelp.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/the-dowliners-sect-lost-bands-1-don.html |title=Music-Drop Magazine: The Dowliners Sect – Lost Bands #1 – Don Craine interview |website=Musicneedshelp.blogspot.co.uk |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small Faces==
{{main|Small Faces}}
Between leaving the Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: &lt;blockquote&gt;"He actually approached us (The Checkpoints) and said he needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was with us for a couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He seemed to me to be a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them."{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 28 July 1964, Marriott first saw his future Small Faces partners, [[Ronnie Lane]] and 16-year-old drummer [[Kenney Jones]]. They were all performing at the Albion in [[Rainham, London|Rainham]], with their bands.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane and Marriott met again by chance in the J60 Music Bar, a music shop in High Street North, Manor Park, where Marriott was working after his recent departure from the Moments. Lane came in looking to purchase a bass guitar, and afterwards was invited to Marriott's home to listen to his extensive collection of rare American R&amp;B import records. With their shared love of R&amp;B the trio were soon firm friends.&lt;ref&gt;

Marriott was invited by Lane and Jones to perform with "the Outcasts" (previously called "the Pioneers") at the band's regular gig the Earl of Derby in [[Bermondsey]].&lt;ref&gt;

According to [[David Bowie]] on a 1999 episode of ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'', in 1964 he and his good friend Marriott planned to form an R&amp;B duo called 'David and Goliath'.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Marriott, Lane and Jones decided to form their own band, with Steve bringing along his acquaintance, [[Jimmy Winston]] (Winston was later replaced by [[Ian McLagan]]). Marriott's friend Annabel, an ex-student from the Italia Conti, came up with the band's distinctive name after commenting that they all had "small faces"; the name stuck in part because they were all (apart from Winston) small (none being over 5&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in tall), and the term "face" in English mod culture was the name given to a well-known and respected mod.&lt;ref&gt;

Later, they were said to be one of many influences on the formation and musical style of British [[hard rock]] group [[Led Zeppelin]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. Marriott is reputed to have been [[Jimmy Page]]'s benchmark when selecting a lead singer, and there are unmistakable stylistic and timbral similarities between the voices of Marriott and [[Robert Plant]], [[Led Zeppelin]]'s lead singer{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. Plant was a fan of Small Faces and a regular at their early gigs where he also ran small errands for them. Zeppelin's classic song "[[Whole Lotta Love]]" is a direct take of Marriott's version of the classic song "You Need Lovin'", originally written by [[Willie Dixon]] and recorded by American [[blues]] singer [[Muddy Waters]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small Faces would regularly perform "You Need Lovin'" in their live set, and the song also appears on their debut album ''[[Small Faces (1966 album)|Small Faces]]'', released by Decca in May 1966.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; "It was fantastic, I loved it, Muddy Waters recorded it but I couldn't sing like Muddy Waters so it wasn't that much of a nick. I was a high range and Muddy was a low range so I had to figure out how to sing it. So I did and that was our opening number for all the years we were together. Every time we were on stage that was our opening number, unless we had a short set. That's where Jimmy Page and Robert Plant heard it. Robert Plant used to follow us around. He was like a fan." – Marriott&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

However Marriott bore no animosity to Plant. He is quoted as shouting "Go on my son!" and wishing him luck when he first heard Plant's version on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite book

 | page = 107
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, McLagan describes the house as "party central", a place where the likes of [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Brian Epstein]], [[Pete Townshend]] and other celebrities would hang out. Marriott was just 18 years old.

Marriott wrote or co-wrote most of Small Faces' hit singles. In an interview in 1984, Marriott was asked what his best Small Faces songs were: "I think '[[All or Nothing (Small Faces song)|All or Nothing]]', that I wrote, takes a lot of beating. To me, if there's a song that typifies that era, then that might be it. Words regardless, cos it's only a silly love song, but the actual feel and arrangement of the thing, and maybe '[[Tin Soldier (song)|Tin Soldier]]'".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

She later broke up with Stewart and had a brief romantic liaison with Marriott, but much to his disappointment ended it to go back to Stewart. Rylance and Stewart later split for good after a rocky four-year relationship; when Marriott found out he pursued her relentlessly, leading him to write "Tin Soldier". The song was a hit for the band in 1967 and for Marriott a personal triumph. He and Rylance were married at [[Kensington]] [[Register Office]], London, on 29 May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;

===Relationships and family===
Marriott had liaisons with many women and had four known children with four of them, including one of his three wives. His first wife was model Jenny Rylance (1968–1973). He met American air hostess, Pam Stephens in 1975 and their son Toby was born in 1976. They married after Toby was born.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His third wife was Toni Poulton. They were married until Marriott's death in 1991. He also had three daughters. The first, Lesley, was conceived to fellow teen Sally Foulger before Marriott became famous. She was originally known as Sarah Lisa Foulger (born 9 June 1966). She was adopted out, but later found out who her father was and has been accepted by her siblings. The second was Tonya, with Canadian Terri Elias in 1984. His third daughter Mollie Mae was born in 1985 when Marriott was with his childhood friend Manon Piercey.&lt;ref&gt; Mollie has begun to make a name for herself as a singer, appearing at Small Faces conventions and other gigs. His son, Toby, is a singer and guitarist in the band Black Drummer.

Later Marriott moved into Beehive Cottage in [[Moreton, Essex|Moreton]], Essex, a property he had bought jointly with Ronnie Lane and wife Susan and where he established his "Clear Sounds" music studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...| page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, after a dispute over unpaid [[royalties]], relations between the Small Faces and Don Arden broke down and Arden sold them on to [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who owned the [[Immediate Records|Immediate Records label]]. The band were much happier at Immediate, spending more time in the recording studio and far less time playing live, but they lost the dynamic live sound that had made them famous.&lt;ref&gt;

After the success of the group's number one hit [[concept album]] ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'' Marriott was keen for the group to evolve and wanted to bring in ex-Herd frontman [[Peter Frampton]], but McLagan, Jones and Lane refused.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 167
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott started to feel the band had reached the end creatively and began to spend more time with Frampton and [[Greg Ridley]]. After rumours in the press about the band splitting up, which were always officially denied, Marriott quit the group, storming off stage during a disastrous live performance on New Year's Eve, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = small faces the young mods' forgotten story

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1984 interview with [[NME]] reporter Paolo Hewitt on the subject of leaving the band, Marriott said:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"You grow apart for Christsakes. You're talking about people living together from the ages of seventeen to twenty-two and that's a growing up part of your life and we got to hate each other, no doubt about it. We didn't speak to each other for fucking years. Maybe ten years." – Marriott&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frampton claims that after Marriott's departure from the Small Faces, the remaining members, Lane, McLagan and Jones, turned up at his home and offered him Marriott's role in the band. (Ian McLagan vehemently denied this story).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"The following day after the [[Alexandra Palace]] gig (where Steve walked off), I was back home and I got a call from Ronnie Lane who said, 'Me, Kenney and Mac would like to come round and see you.' I thought, Hello, what's all this about? Anyway, they all came round to my horrible little flat in [[Earls Court]] and asked me to join the Small Faces. All I could say was it's a bit late now. Why couldn't you have asked me while we were in Paris? We'd all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn't have left." – Peter Frampton.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Humble Pie==
{{main|Humble Pie}}
[[File:Steve Marriott in 1972.jpg|thumb|190px|Marriott with Humble Pie during a 1972 performance]]
Shortly after leaving Small Faces, Marriott joined the newly formed [[rock and roll|rock]] band [[Humble Pie]] with [[Peter Frampton]], drummer [[Jerry Shirley]] and bassist Greg Ridley.&lt;ref name="Making Time"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, Humble Pie allowed Marriott the artistic freedom he craved but was denied in Small Faces due, in part, to commercial pressures and individual differences. After extensive secret rehearsals at his Clear Sounds home recording studio, the band released on Immediate their debut album ''[[As Safe As Yesterday Is]]'', closely followed by the Marriott-penned debut single "[[Natural Born Bugie]]" (often mis-spelt "Boogie"), which peaked at No. 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the summer of 1969.&lt;ref name="Making Time"/&gt; Humble Pie almost disbanded after their first American tour when they returned to Britain and discovered that Immediate had gone into liquidation. They transferred to [[A&amp;M Records]] and focused all their attention on the lucrative US market. Their new manager, [[Dee Anthony]], had the band scrap its 'unplugged' set and crank the volume up.

Humble Pie toured constantly over the next three years, completing nineteen tours in the US alone. The band's next album releases, ''[[Humble Pie (album)|Humble Pie]]'' and ''[[Rock On (Humble Pie album)|Rock On]]'', benefitted from their touring. Their live album ''[[Performance Rockin' the Fillmore]]'' (1971) became the band's most successful release to date. During these recordings, Marriott's strong vocal performances became the focal point of the band. Dee Anthony pushed Marriott to take more of the on-stage spotlight, something he had, up to then, been sharing with Frampton and Ridley. Marriott's new prominence is said to have resulted in Frampton's decision to leave the band. (Frampton was replaced by [[Clem Clempson]].)

Some close to Marriott, such as his wife and even Marriott himself, would say that his personality changed for the worse when he toured America. Eventually, possibly as a result of excessive alcohol and drug use, Marriott started showing signs of mild [[schizophrenia]]. He had regularly taken amphetamines (speed) and smoked [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in his days in the Moments and Small Faces, and in the latter half of the 1960s he also tried [[LSD]]. But by the time Humble Pie began to tour America regularly in the early 1970s, Marriott allegedly developed a destructive [[cocaine]] and alcohol addiction, which is thought to have been the cause of his marriage break-ups and to have contributed to his premature death in a house fire.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"He (Steve) became another person to cope with the pressures, he would say things like, "Please tell me that you'll leave me if I go on tour again because if you say that I’ll have justification not to go, if I go and have to be that other person again I'll just go mad." This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off.... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was when he was in the home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace." – Jenny Rylance&lt;ref&gt;

Rylance finally left Marriott in 1973. She said: "The drugs and the drink I would tolerate no more. It broke my heart to leave Steve but it had to be done, I was ultimately the stronger".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the break-up of his marriage and growing drug use, some band members said that Marriott at times became domineering, aggressive and intolerable to work with. Humble Pie disbanded in 1975, citing musical differences as the reason for the split. Financial mismanagement and widespread substance abuse within the band also played a part. In an interview in 2000 with John Hellier, [[Jerry Shirley]] said:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"We were all doing too many drugs, we'd lost sight of our business arrangements and no-one within the band had any control over money matters. But the main reason was that we were making bad records, it all came to a head in early 1975. The rot had set in so deep it was inevitable." – Jerry Shirley&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Steve Marriott - Humble Pie - 1973.jpg|thumb|140px|Marriott with Humble Pie in 1973]]
Marriott always believed Dee Anthony had syphoned off band earnings to promote his new project, Frampton and his album ''[[Frampton Comes Alive]]''. After Marriott's death, second wife Pam Stephens claimed in an interview that while they were making the ''Marriott'' solo album they were warned off accusing Anthony of any financial misdealings and received threatening phone calls. Anthony was alleged to have links with the [[Genovese crime family]] (among others). She also claimed that after Marriott confronted Anthony about the missing money, she and Marriott were summoned to a meeting at the [[Ravenite Social Club]] on [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]] in New York's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] district. Among those present were [[John Gotti]], [[Frank Locascio]] and [[Paul Castellano]], all members of the [[Gambino crime family]]. Marriott was informed that he would not be getting any money and was warned to drop the matter. Marriott took the threats seriously.&lt;ref&gt;

==Solo and various bands==

Marriott released his first solo album, ''Marriott'', in 1976 and moved back to Britain. Stephens gave birth to their first child Toby on 20 February 1976,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 235
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were married on 23 March 1977, at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] [[Register Office]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The money from Humble Pie's farewell tour soon ran out, and Marriott was reduced to stealing vegetables from a field next to his home. He went on to form the Steve Marriott Allstars with ex-Pie bassist [[Greg Ridley]], drummer [[Ian Wallace (musician)|Ian Wallace]] and ex-Heavy Metal Kids' guitarist [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn]], and found a new manager, Laurie O'Leary. In the 1980s O'Leary asked Marriott to meet a friend of his, the infamous [[Ronnie Kray]], who was incarcerated in [[Broadmoor Hospital]] for the murder of [[George Cornell]]. Marriott gave him a signed photo.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of [[Mick Taylor]] in 1975 from the [[Rolling Stones]], Marriott was considered as his replacement; however, [[Mick Jagger]] allegedly blocked the move after Marriott upstaged him during the audition. According to [[Ronnie Wood]] in his autobiography ''Ronnie'', Marriott was Richards' first choice to replace Mick Taylor.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; "Steve told me, 'I was good and stood at the back for a while but then Keith [Richards] would hit this lick and I just couldn't keep my mouth shut.' Keith wanted him in but there was no way that once Steve opened his mouth Mick would have him in the band. He knew Steve would never stay in the background. They were the one band in the world that Steve would have loved to have been in. He just wanted to work with Keith." – Pam Marriott&lt;ref&gt;

In 1976 a court ruled that Arden still owed the Small Faces £12,000 in unpaid royalties. He agreed to pay in monthly instalments, but disappeared after making just one payment.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the success of re-released singles "[[Itchycoo Park]]" and "[[Lazy Sunday (Small Faces song)|Lazy Sunday]]" in 1975 and 1976, McLagan, Jones and Marriott were persuaded to re-form Small Faces.&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"/&gt; Rick Wills took the place of Lane, who pulled out after just two rehearsals. Unknown to the others, Lane was suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]]. The band recorded two albums, ''Playmates'' and '''78 in the Shade'', but the albums were both critical and commercial failures and they disbanded. Marriott did not make any money out of the venture. His earnings were used to extricate him from old binding management contracts. Due to financial problems, Marriott was forced to sell Beehive Cottage, which had been his home since 1968, and move to a small terraced house in [[Golders Green]], London.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 242
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1978, the [[Inland Revenue]] informed Marriott that he still owed £100,000 in back tax from his Humble Pie days; he thought manager Dee Anthony had made all the necessary payments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 243
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary, Marriott's manager, advised him to leave Britain or go to prison.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; He sold the house in Golders Green and moved to California. Marriott, Pam and son Toby were staying with friends in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and Marriott formed a new band called The Firm, with Jim Leverton and (most notably) former [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] guitarist [[Leslie West]]. But after Leverton had to leave the US due to visa problems, and disputes over potential royalties, the band broke up. Marriott was by now completely broke and forced to collect empty glass bottles to redeem them for small change.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} According to Leslie West, Steve needed the money and accepted a lucrative offer to reform Humble Pie.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Marriott contacted Jerry Shirley, who was living in New York City, to discuss a Humble Pie reunion. Shirley agreed and they recorded "Fool for a Pretty Face", which Marriott had written earlier. The new line-up included [[Anthony "Sooty" Jones]], who was well respected among American east coast musicians, also vocalist and guitarist [[Bobby Tench]], former member of the [[Jeff Beck Group]]. The song proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with [[Atco Records|Atco]]. In the UK their material was released by [[Jet Records]], owned by ex-Small Faces manager [[Don Arden]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated248"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 248
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They recorded the heavy rock album ''[[On to Victory (album)|On to Victory]]'' (1980), followed by ''[[Go for the Throat]]'' (1981), and both proved reasonably successful. They also toured America as part of the ''Rock 'N' Roll Marathon'' bill. In the latter half of 1981, Marriott was beset with personal problems. His marriage was almost over and after he broke his wrist in an accident and was hospitalised with a suspected burst ulcer, whilst opening for [[Judas Priest]] and the new Humble Pie line-up disintegrated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated248"/&gt;

During a visit to Britain in 1981, Marriott became eager to see Ronnie Lane.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 249
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Lane had begun to use a wheelchair. After an emotional meeting, Marriott suggested they gig together. They got together with Jim Leverton, Mick Weaver, Dave Hynes, [[Zoot Money]] and [[Mel Collins]] to record an album called ''[[Majik Mijits]]''. The album features songs by Lane and Marriott, though none were co-written.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Lane's illness, they were unable to tour and promote the album.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"Steve and Ronnie went to America to see Clive Davis of Arista Records. They played him the tape. Clive Davis was tapping his foot and tapping his very expensive pen on his very expensive desk. He said "Yeah, that's great man". Steve said "So you like the tape, Clive". Steve then stopped the tape, ejected it and said "WELL YOU CAN'T FUCKING HAVE IT!" The story that Steve told me was that it would have meant touring and Ronnie just wasn't up to it. It would have meant pretty much carrying him everywhere, no tour, no album. That's why the Mijits never came out at that point in time. It's been gathering dust for ages" – Jim Leverton. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The album was released nineteen years later. After the ''Majik Mijits'', Marriott went back to New York playing on the club circuit again.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 251
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next year and a half, Marriott was on the road with Jim Leverton, [[Goldy McJohn]] and Fallon Williams. They played mostly Small Faces and Humble Pie material, touring non-stop for the next eighteen months. After the departure of McJohn, the trio changed the band's name to the Three Trojans. Despite attempts at reconciliation, Marriott's marriage finally came to an end when his wife found out that Marriott was expecting a child with Terry Elias, a Canadian girl he had met while they were separated.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting that his marriage was over, Marriott moved back to the UK. With no home and no money, he stayed in the spare bedroom of his sister Kay's house. Marriott formed Packet of Three,&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = small faces the young mods' forgotten story

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; again playing the pub circuit. He insisted on being paid for each gig in cash as the Inland Revenue were still pursuing him for back taxes. In August 1984, Aura Records released ''Steve Marriott Live at Dingwalls 6.7.84''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott contacted longtime friend Manon Piercey, and they quickly developed a close relationship and rented a house together. Piercey gave birth to daughter Mollie Mae on 3 May 1985.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 262
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Piercey's help, Marriott reduced his excessive drink and drug habits. His sister Kay said: "Steve would say, I'm not drinking any more, and he'd stop, six weeks, two months, he was very strong willed; if he wanted to, he could". In 1985 Marriott was still touring with Packet of Three playing [[North America|Canada, America]] and Europe.

During [[Live Aid]] in 1985, London-based Phoenix Modernist Society joined [[mod revival]] bands such as [[the Lambrettas]] and [[Purple Hearts (UK band)|Purple Hearts]], with 1960s stars such as [[Chris Farlowe]] and [[PP Arnold]]. Together they cut a version of "All or Nothing" for [[Band Aid Trust]]. [[Kenny Lynch]] persuaded Marriott to get involved, and the single was released under the collective name the Spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

Due to his financial situation, Marriott jokingly later renamed the group Steve Marriott and the Official Receivers. In the mid-1980s Marriott and Poulton moved to a rented cottage in the small village of [[Arkesden]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott became well-known locally, often popping into the pub opposite his home to buy bottles of brandy and borrowing glasses. He once turned up wearing trainers and a dressing gown and became something of an eccentric figure, playing pranks, particularly on the owner of the pub.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to past experiences, in later years Marriott became wary of success and fame as well as involvement with big record companies, and turned down lucrative concert and recording deals with names such as [[EMI]]. Because of this attitude, the band grew resentful, believing that he was holding them back, and Packet of Three was disbanded. For the next year Marriott took time off. By now he was 39 years old. He had health problems, was overweight, and had a scruffy appearance. There was little left of the striking 1960s mod icon.&lt;ref&gt;

Film-maker Paolo Sedazzari recalled, "I remember going to see him in the 1980s, and he was brilliant. Great voice, great guitarist but what I couldn't get over were the dungarees and the mullet haircut. That was really disappointing."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his wife, Marriott still smoked [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and took [[cocaine]], but nothing compared to what he had once consumed. In his later years Marriott liked reading; his favourite authors included [[Stephen King]], [[Philip K. Dick]] and anything on [[Noël Coward]], whom Marriott had always admired.

In May 1988, Marriott started rehearsing with a band from [[Leicestershire]], the DTs, though by the time they starting touring they were called Steve Marriott and the DTs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"/&gt; Despite being out of the public gaze, Marriott was still asked to participate in various projects. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] asked Marriott to record two songs for his musical ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', though after becoming drunk at the meeting Marriott ungraciously declined.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott agreed, seeing it as easy money.&lt;ref name="autogenerated274"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While recording the song, [[Trax Records]] asked Marriott to record a solo album. ''Thirty Seconds to Midnite'' was recorded at [[Alexandra Palace]]. Marriott used the money to buy a [[narrowboat]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated274"/&gt; On 14 July 1989, Marriott and Toni Poulton were married at [[Epping, Essex|Epping]] [[Register Office]]. Afterwards, they threw a party at their cottage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated275"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Jim Leverton got in touch and Marriott formed a new group called Steve Marriott's Next Band, with Leverton and ex-members of both the DTs and the Official Receivers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated275"/&gt; When several members left due to financial disagreements, the band name Packet of Three resurfaced.

By 1990 Marriott was playing an average 200 gigs a year, when Frampton flew into Britain and asked Marriott to reform Humble Pie to produce a one-off album and a reunion tour.&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"/&gt; The payment would be enough to allow Marriott to take things easier. He agreed, and they flew out to Frampton's recording studio in Los Angeles on 27 January 1991.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...
 | page = 279
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They began writing songs, but the project was never completed, as Marriott had a change of heart and returned home. 

Two recorded songs from this final effort, "The Bigger They Come" and "I Won't Let You Down", with Marriott on vocals (and guitar), appeared on Frampton's album ''Shine On: A Collection''. A third song, "Out of the Blue", featuring both Marriott and Frampton, was featured on the first solo recording Frampton made after Marriott's death. A fourth song, "An Itch You Can't Scratch", has been found on many illegal compilations and even on one of two "authorised" British releases. The recording date, and whether Frampton played on it, have never been verified.

==Death==

On Friday 19 April 1991, Marriott and Poulton&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = [[Steve Marriott - All Too Beautiful...]]
 | page = 275
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; flew home from the United States, where Marriott had recorded songs for a future album with Frampton. During the flight, according to Poulton, Marriott was drinking heavily, was in a foul mood, and the two argued constantly. After arriving in the UK, a mutual friend met them and they all went for dinner to one of Marriott's favourite restaurants, The Straw Hat in [[Sawbridgeworth]], where he consumed more alcohol. After dinner, they returned to their friend's house and decided to stay overnight, since it was late, but upstairs in bed, Marriott and Poulton continued to argue. Poulton finally fell asleep and later woke to discover that Marriott had taken a taxi to his home in the nearby village of [[Arkesden]].

At about 6:30&amp;nbsp;am on 20 April, a passing motorist saw the roof of Marriott's cottage ablaze and called the [[fire brigade]]. It was reported that four fire engines were needed to put out the fire. In newspaper interviews, Assistant Divisional Fire Officer Keith Dunatis, who found Marriott, said:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"It was a tough fight getting upstairs. We searched the bedroom areas and it was very hot, we knew immediately that no-one could have survived the fire. We began to feel around the walls and discovered him lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. I would say he had been in bed and tried to escape. As soon as I saw the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it's difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever." – (Fire Officer)&lt;ref&gt;

It is believed that the most likely cause of the fire was that soon after arriving home, jet-lagged and tired, in the early hours, Marriott had lit a cigarette while in bed and almost immediately fallen into a deep sleep.

Since Marriott was found lying on the floor between the bed and wall, investigators concluded that he tried unsuccessfully to escape after being awakened by the blaze. Disoriented and confused after inhaling large amounts of thick smoke, Marriott had turned left instead of right towards the bedroom door and safety. He had been unable to rectify his mistake before being overcome with smoke. At the inquest, a verdict of [[accidental death]] by [[smoke inhalation]] was recorded. Marriott's blood was found to contain quantities of [[Valium]] (taken earlier for flight nerves), alcohol and cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"He (Marriott) was certainly the most talented person I ever worked with. He was like a brother to me and I was devastated when he died. He always lived on the edge and I was always waiting for a 'phone call to say that he had died but I never dreamed it would be under those circumstances. He's never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say Steve Marriott." – Jerry Shirley&lt;ref&gt;

To mark the 10th anniversary of Marriott's death a tribute concert was held at the [[London Astoria]] on 20 April 2001. All the songs performed at this concert were from the [[Small Faces]] or [[Humble Pie]] catalogue. Pre-1980 Humble Pie alumni [[Peter Frampton]], [[Clem Clempson]], [[Greg Ridley]] and [[Jerry Shirley]] gave a one-off performance.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''The Last Dive: A Father and Son's Fatal Descent into the Ocean's Depths''''' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chowdhury, Bernie|title= The Last Dive: A Father and Son's Fatal Descent into the Ocean's Depths |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1063862.The_Last_Dive||publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060194628|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Scuba diving|diver]] [[Bernie Chowdhury]] and published by [[HarperCollins]]. It documents the fatal dive of Chris Rouse, Sr. and Chris "Chrissy" Rouse, Jr., a father-son team who perished off the New Jersey coast in 1992. The author is a dive expert and was a friend of the Rouses.&lt;ref name="depth"&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Miller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/29/reviews/001029.29mill.html&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2&amp;OP=2527b9f4Q2FYtQ51Q5EYLkQ5BhMkk,YQ5EkkghYPPY9PYvQ2BYMQ51Q3CbQ51thYPP9PvQ2BQ5DvQ2BQ3DbQ2FQ2FQ5Df,Q3DQ2F|title=Out of Their Depth: The story of father-and-son divers who died off the New Jersey coast in 1992.|date=October 29, 2000|journal=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divers were exploring a German U-boat in {{convert|230|ft}} of water off the coast of New Jersey.  Although experienced in using [[technical diving]] gas mixtures such as "trimix" (adding helium gas to the nitrogen and oxygen found in air), they were diving on just compressed air.&lt;ref name="depth"/&gt; The pair had set out to retrieve the [[captain's log]] book from the so-called ''U-Who'' to "fulfill their dream of diving into fame."&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Neal|last=Matthews|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040711/news_lz1v11divers.html|title=Depth charge: 'Shadow Divers' gives the glossy treatment to a true adventure tale, and dive-bombs its credibility|date=July 11, 2004|journal=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chowdhury is a technical diver who, according to writer Neal Matthews' review of [[Robert Kurson]]'s book ''[[Shadow Divers]]'' (2004), "was among the first to adapt cave-diving principles to deep-water wrecks".&lt;ref name="charge"/&gt; Also according to Matthews, "His book documents how the clashes of equipment philosophy between cave divers and wreck divers mirrored the clash of diving subcultures."&lt;ref name="charge"/&gt;
