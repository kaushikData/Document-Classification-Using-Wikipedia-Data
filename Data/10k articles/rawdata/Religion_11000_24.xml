The '''Agudas Israel''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "Union of Israel") was a political party in [[Latvia]] in the inter-war period. Primarily a party of the [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jews]], it was the most conservative of the Jewish parties in the country, seeking to limit the power of state monopolies. It was led by [[Mordehai Dubin]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p448 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party first contested national elections in [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1922|1922]], when it won two seats in the [[1st Saeima]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1143 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It retained both seats in the [[2nd Saeima]] after the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1925|1925 elections]], but was reduced to one seat in the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1928|1928 elections]]. The [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1931|1931 elections]] saw the party win two seats in the [[4th Saeima]]. However, after the [[1934 Latvian coup d'état]] multi-party elections were not held again until [[Latvian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|1990]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16612">{{Thelema}}'''Aiwass''' /[[Template:Respell |aye-wazz]]/&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|[p] ]]&lt;/sup&gt;is the name given to a voice that English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] claimed to have heard on April 8, 9, and 10 in 1904. Crowley claimed that this voice, which he considered originated with a non-corporeal intelligence, dictated ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' (or ''Liber Legis'') to him.

==The dictation==
According to Crowley, the first appearance of Aiwass was during the Three Days of the writing of ''Liber al vel Legis''. His first and only identification as such is in Chapter I: "Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat" (AL I:7).&lt;ref&gt; Aleister Crowley. ''The Book of the Law''. Red Wheel Weiser Centennial edition, 2004, p. 25 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-paar-kraat]] (Egyptian: Har-par-khered) is more commonly referred to by the Greek transliteration [[Harpocrates]], meaning "Horus the Child", whom Crowley considered to be the central deity within the Thelemic cosmology (see: [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon of Horus]]). However, Harpocrates also represents the Higher Self, the [[Holy Guardian Angel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crowley|1996|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley described the encounter in detail in ''The Equinox of the Gods'', saying:
{{bq|1=The Voice of Aiwass came apparently from over my left shoulder, from the furthest corner of the room. It seemed to echo itself in my physical heart in a very strange manner, hard to describe. I have noticed a similar phenomenon when I have been waiting for a message fraught with great hope or dread. The voice was passionately poured, as if Aiwass were alert about the time-limit&amp;nbsp;... The voice was of deep timbre, musical and expressive, its tones solemn, voluptuous, tender, fierce or aught else as suited the moods of the message. Not bass&amp;nbsp;– perhaps a rich tenor or baritone.  The English was free of either native or foreign accent, perfectly pure of local or caste mannerisms, thus startling and even uncanny at first hearing.  I had a strong impression that the speaker was actually in the corner where he seemed to be, in a body of "fine matter," transparent as a veil of gauze, or a cloud of incense-smoke. He seemed to be a tall, dark man in his thirties, well-knit, active and strong, with the face of a savage king, and eyes veiled lest their gaze should destroy what they saw. The dress was not Arab; it suggested Assyria or Persia, but very vaguely. I took little note of it, for to me at that time Aiwass was an "angel" such as I had often seen in visions, a being purely astral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Crowley |first=Aleister|title=THE EQUINOX OF THE GODS – Chapter 7 |url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/equinox-of-the-gods/eqotg7.html |work=The Equinox |publisher=hermetic.com |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the later-written ''Liber 418'', the voice of the 8th Aethyr says "my name is called Aiwass," and "in ''The Book of the Law'' did I write the secrets of truth that are like unto a star and a snake and a sword." Crowley says this later manifestation took the form of a pyramid of light.

==Identity==
Crowley went to great pains to argue that Aiwass was an objectively separate being from himself, possessing far more knowledge than he or any other human could possibly have. He wrote "no forger could have prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal puzzles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |title=The Equinox of the Gods – Chapter 7 |url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/equinox-of-the-gods/eqotg7.html |work=The Equinox of the Gods |publisher=hermetic.com |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Crowley writes in his ''Confessions'': "I was bound to admit that Aiwass had shown a knowledge of the Cabbala immeasurably superior to my own"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crowley|1979|loc=ch. 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "We are forced to conclude that the author of ''The Book of the Law'' is an intelligence both alien and superior to myself, yet acquainted with my inmost secrets; and, most important point of all, that this intelligence is discarnate."&lt;ref name="Crowley 1979 loc=ch. 49"&gt;{{Harv|Crowley|1979|loc=ch. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, this excerpt (also from ''Confessions'', ch.49):

{{bq|1=The existence of true religion presupposes that of some discarnate intelligence, whether we call him God or anything else. And this is exactly what no religion had ever proved scientifically. And this is what The Book of the Law does prove by internal evidence, altogether independent of any statement of mine. This proof is evidently the most important step in science that could possibly be made: for it opens up an entirely new avenue to knowledge. The immense superiority of this particular intelligence, AIWASS, to any other with which mankind has yet been in conscious communication is shown not merely by the character of the book itself, but by the fact of his comprehending perfectly the nature of the proof necessary to demonstrate the fact of his own existence and the conditions of that existence. And, further, having provided the proof required.&lt;ref name="Crowley 1979 loc=ch. 49"/&gt;}}

However, Crowley also spoke of Aiwass in symbolic terms. In ''The Law is for All'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crowley|1996|pp=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; he goes on at length in comparison to various other deities and spiritual concepts, but most especially to [[Foolishness|The Fool]]. For example, he writes of Aiwass: "In his absolute innocence and ignorance he is The Fool; he is the Saviour, being the Son who shall trample on the crocodiles and tigers, and avenge his father Osiris. Thus we see him as the Great Fool of Celtic legend, the Pure Fool of Act I of ''Parsifal'', and, generally speaking, the insane person whose words have always been taken for oracles."

Perhaps more importantly, Crowley later identified Aiwass as his own personal [[Holy Guardian Angel]] and more. Again from ''Equinox of the Gods'': "I now incline to believe that Aiwass is not only the God once held holy in Sumer, and mine own Guardian Angel, but also a man as I am, insofar as He uses a human body to make His magical link with Mankind, whom He loves, and that He is thus an [[Argenteum Astrum#Ipsissimus|Ipsissimus]], the Head of the [[A∴A∴]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crowley|1974|loc=ch. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet even while eventually identifying Aiwass as his Holy Guardian Angel, Crowley still went to even greater lengths in his later years to insist that Aiwass was an objective entity apart from himself, even going as far as to declare in no uncertain terms that the Holy Guardian Angel is not only entirely objective, but is also not to be confused with the "Higher Self," as in his final work, ''Magick Without Tears'': "The Holy Guardian Angel is not the 'Higher Self' but an Objective individual. . . . He is not, let me say with emphasis, a mere abstraction    from yourself; and that is why I have insisted rather heavily that the term 'Higher Self' implies 'a damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion'. . . . If it were not so, there would be no point in ''The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magick Without Tears|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|publisher=Thelema Publications|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Magick in Theory and Practice'', Aiwass is firmly identified by Crowley as "The Devil," "Satan," and "Lucifer," whose "emblem is Baphomet." This assertion is made while Crowley is discussing "The Devil." After explaining that "The Devil" does not exist, he goes on to clarify his statements by explaining that "The Devil" is in reality a label for the God of any people that one dislikes, and this fact has led to so much "confusion of thought" on the subject that Crowley prefers to "let names stand as they are, and to proclaim simply that AIWAZ, the solar-phallic-hermetic ‘Lucifer,’ is His own Holy Guardian Angel, and ‘The Devil’ SATAN or HADIT, the Supreme Soul behind RA-HOOR-KHUIT the Sun, the Lord of our particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade ‘Know Thyself!’ and taught Initiation. He is ‘the Devil’ of the Book of Thoth, and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magick|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative views===
{{See also|The Book of the Law#Sceptical views}}
A number of authors have expressed the view that Aiwass was most likely an unconscious manifestation of Crowley's personality. Occultist [[Israel Regardie]] argued for this view in his Crowley biography, ''The Eye in the Triangle'', and considered that [[The Book of the Law]] was a "colossal wish fulfillment" on Crowley's part.&lt;ref name=Regardie&gt;{{cite book| last = Regardie | first = Israel | title = The Eye in the Triangle: an Interpretation of Aleister Crowley | date = 1982| publisher = New Falcon Publications | pages = 473–494 | chapter = Chapter 15. The Book of the Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardie noted that in 1906 Crowley wrote: "It has struck me – in connection with reading Blake that Aiwass, etc. 'Force and Fire' is the very thing I lack. My 'conscience' is really an obstacle and a delusion, being a survival of heredity and education." Regardie argued that because Crowley felt that his Fundamentalist upbringing instilled him in an overly rigid conscience, when he rebelled against Christianity “he must have yearned for qualities and characteristics diametrically opposed to his own. In The Book of the Law the wish is fulfilled.” Charles R. Cammell, author of ''Aleister Crowley: The Man, the Mage, the Poet''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/ArtofLaw.htm The Art of the Law: Aleister Crowley’s Use of Ritual and Drama Justin Scott Van Kleeck]&lt;/ref&gt; also wrote that The Book of the Law was "in part (but in part only) an emanation from Crowley's
unconscious mind I can believe; for it bears a likeness to his own Daemonic personality."&lt;ref name=Regardie/&gt;  Journalist Sarah Veale has also argued that Aiwass was an externalised part of Crowley's psyche and in support of this view quotes Crowley himself as saying:

{{bq|1=Ah, you realize that magick is something we do to ourselves. But it is more convenient to assume the objective existence of an angel who gives us new knowledge than to allege that our invocation has awakened a supernormal power in ourselves. (Kaczynski, 542)&lt;ref name=Veale&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://invocatio.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/the-morton-smith-aleister-crowley-connection-part-ii/ |title=The Morton Smith-Aleister Crowley Connection, Part II, Invocatio, a blog mostly about western esotericism, August 8, 2011 |access-date=2012-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114112404/http://invocatio.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/the-morton-smith-aleister-crowley-connection-part-ii/#comment-71 |archive-date=2012-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of authors such as Israel Regardie,&lt;ref name=Regardie/&gt; Sarah Veale,&lt;ref name=Veale/&gt; and academic Joshua Gunn&lt;ref name=Gunn&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunn |first=Joshua |title=Modern occult rhetoric: mass media and the drama of secrecy in the twentieth century |year=2011 |publisher=University of Alabama Press| |pages=91–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtAm1e3S0CEC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=criticism+of+the+book+of+the+law+crowley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oKY-zNKnRz&amp;sig=1xB3kiZBteB0GoEcI1RMuTIoGU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-NV-T4HYJqSziQfTy9T2CQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=criticism%20of%20the%20book%20of%20the%20law%20crowley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the stylistic similarities between The Book of the Law and Crowley's other writings are evidence that Crowley rather than a discarnate entity was the sole source of the book.

Occultist Michael Aquino of the [[Temple of Set]] also believed on esoteric grounds that Aiwass was probably "a subjective idealization of Crowley's own personality".&lt;ref name="Temple of Set"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aquino |first=Michael |title=The Temple of Set |edition=Draft 11 |date=May 1, 2010 |chapter=Appendix 5: ‘’The Book of the Law’’ – Commentary |page=218 |url=http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/TOSd11.pdf |access-date=2012-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312024708/http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/TOSd11.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino based this assertion on the fact that Aiwass identifies himself as "minister of Hoor-pa-kraat"(Chapter I, verse 7). In the view of the Temple of Set, Hoor-pa-kraat, also known as "Harpokrates" or Horus the Younger, is considered to be "the later Osirian corruption of the Great Horus" also known as Horus the Elder. Aquino does not believe in the objective existence of Hoor-pa-kraat, hence he considers the objective authenticity of Aiwass "doubtful" although he did consider The Book an "inspired utterance".

==Gematria==

Crowley, being the [[Qabalah|Qabalist]] that he was, labored to discover Aiwass's number within the system of [[gematria]]. Initially he believed that it was 78: "I had decided on AIVAS = 78, the number of Mezla, the influence from the highest unity, and therefore suitable enough as the title of a messenger from Him."&lt;ref name="Crowley 1979 loc=ch. 85"&gt;{{Harv|Crowley|1979|loc=ch. 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a letter from a stranger, the typographer and publisher Samuel A. Jacobs (whose Golden Eagle Press published the work of [[e.e.cummings]] and others), and whose Hebrew name was Shmuel bar Aiwaz bie Yackou de Sherabad, Crowley asked the Hebrew spelling of Aiwaz. To Crowley's astonishment and delight, it was OIVZ, which equated to [[93 (Thelema)|93]], the number of [[Thelema]] itself, and "also that of the Lost Word of [[freemasonry]], which I had re-discovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley – Chapter 85|url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/confessions/chapter85.html|work=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|publisher=Hermetic.com|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crowley remained perplexed, though, since the spelling of the name in AL was "Aiwass" not "AIVAS", which does not add up to 93. However, when Crowley decided to use the Greek Qabalah, he discovered that

{{quote|. . . its value is 418! and this is the number of the Magical Formula of the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]]. It represents the practice of the Book as 93 does the theory. It is now evident with what inconceivable ingenuity AIWAZ has arranged his expression. He is not content to give one spelling of his name, however potent; he gives two which taken together are not merely twice as significant as either alone, but more so, in a degree which is beyond me to calculate.&lt;ref name="Crowley 1979 loc=ch. 85"/&gt;}}

According to [[Israel Regardie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=[[Israel Regardie]]
|title=A Garden of Pomegranates

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a certain "Qabalist of tremendous knowledge" would have discovered a Hebrew spelling that enumerates to 418 were he aware that Tav is pronounced /s/ when without a ''[[dagesh]]'':

: (tav)400 + (aleph)1 + (waw)6 + (yod)10 + (aleph)1 = 418

'''Al-Ja'fari''' ({{lang-ar|الجعفري}} {{lang-fa|جعفري}}) is a [[surname]] commonly associated with descendants of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], an important Muslim scholar and the [[Imamah (Shia)|6th Shia Imam]].

Descendants of Ja'far al-Sadiq can most commonly be found amongst the [[Shi'i]] of Iraq, Iran and the Indian subcontinent. Some [[Sunni]] Muslims also associate with the surname Ja’fari.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="207813">The [[Bahá'í Faith]] in [[Greater Boston]], a [[combined statistical area]], has had glimpses of the religion in the 19th century arising to its first community of religionists at the turn of the century. Early newspaper accounts of events were followed by papers on the precursor [[Bábí]] religion by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright were noted, materials donated, and lost, and then other scholars began to write about the religion. The community began to coalesce being near to [[Green Acre]], founded by [[Sarah Farmer]], who publicly espoused the religion from 1901. From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Bahá'ís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913. Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, traveled through the area for about 40 days and across the United States for some 239 days. Most prominent were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt, who served in events in the Boston area, Green Acre boards, and national institutions of the religion. In addition to national leaders in the religion, a number of notable individuals joined the religion and were increasingly visible - such as [[Urbain Ledoux]], [[Sadie and Marby Oglesby]], [[James Ferdinand Morton, Jr.]], [[Nancy Douglas Bowditch|Nancy Bowditch]], and [[Guy Murchie]]. The community moved from beginning to host public meetings to systematically support a presence in a Center in Boston with services and presentations on the religion as well as a racially integrated community since 1935. Starting about the 1950s and broadening into the 1960s there was wider recognition of the Bahá'ís themselves. Sometimes this took the form of noting their persecution in [[Bahá'í Faith in Morocco|Morocco]] and then [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|Iran]] and other times noting local concerts and fairs with their participation. The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area. Over the last couple of decades it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children's classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion.

He marks the court examination of the claims of the Báb like the examination of Jesus (suggesting the account may in fact have been copied), then after while continues:

{{quote|In various respects, the history of Mirza Ali Mohammed, surnamed the Báb, presents startling resemblance to that of the Savior. Claiming descent from an ancient prophet king, he was yet, like Jesus, born in a lowly station; still he was regarded by his followers as the sovereign of his nation and of mankind, whose advent had been long foretold and ardently expected. After leading a life of purity, and uttering words of wisdom, he was put to death, through the hostility of his own government, but by the hands of foreign soldiers; and, before his execution, he was denied by some of his most prominent followers; nay, the very form of contumely with which they were compelled to treat him, was the same which had been used towards the Savior in the hall of the high priest.

It is high honor for a teacher of wisdom thus to bear in his own history a resemblance to that of the Redeemer and we would fain believe that Mirza Ali Mohammed was worthy of the distinction. But we cannot forget that the claim was made for him, that he was "the Gate of Truth, the Imam of Islam," the subject of ancient prophecy, the worker of present miracles, and the destined possessor of universal empire ...&lt;ref name=StudiesintheEvidences/&gt;}}

====First Boston visit====
`Abdu'l-Bahá left from New York City on the 22nd of May for [[Boston]] where he would be for four days. On the evening of his arrival he addressed a Unitarian convention then going on.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; There was an audience of some three thousand including hundreds of Unitarian ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On the 24th he met with individuals, a talk before some Unitarians, another in Brookline, and then a talk at the home of a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; On the 25th he met with individuals.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; Sometime during this visit is the incident where William Randall delivered grape juice for `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Second Boston visit====
`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived for the second time in Boston July 23 but sent most of the entourage ahead to Dublin, NH.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; That evening he addressed an audience at a hotel as well as a later one in the home of the Breeds. On the 24th he spoke with individual visitors and for a talk before a club. Some from the club followed him back from that talk and on return there was also a line of people waiting for him at the hotel that evening. He also spoke to the Boston Theosophical Society. On the 25th he met with individuals before he left for Dublin.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt;

====Dublin, NH====
From July 26 to August 16 he was in Dublin.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; He often met with individuals and small groups or made short trips to visit nearby Baha'is and a camp for youth. He also carried on with corresponding through letter across the United States and to Europe. One evening he announced the betrothal of [[Louis G. Gregory]] and Louisa Mathew and astonished the crowd.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; Elders with [[ear trumpet]]s listened. Once he took his Persian entourage aside and spoke comparing feasts of kings that were brilliant but had no enthusiasm while there they ate modestly and in hard circumstances or so it seemed but everywhere there was real enthusiasm of the heart.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; On August 11 he was noted speaking to a local Unitarian church with answers to questions of such length and detail that it was claimed he must have memorized the answers beforehand. He compared his yearning to see the audience to the Apostles that traveled far to see people. From there he left for Green Acre August 16.

====Green Acre====
[[File:Abdul Baha in Green Acre.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Abdul-Baha visiting Green Acre, United States, in 1912]]

He then went to [[Eliot, Maine]] from 16 to 23 Aug, where he stayed in [[Green Acre]].&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahmud"/&gt; Some five&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; or eight hundred people were there to hear the first talk.&lt;ref name=1stday&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk was about ways of knowing the truth - he disavowed individual approaches like pure reason, simple authority, individual inspiration, etc., but affirmed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] statement presented to the mind accompanied by proofs which the senses can perceive to be correct, which the faculty of reason can accept, which is in accord with traditional authority and sanctioned by the promptings of the heart, can be adjudged and relied upon as perfectly correct, for it has been proved and tested by all the standards of judgment and found to be complete.&lt;ref name=1stday/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some in the audience repudiated their former beliefs of inspiration as pure truth.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; At other talks  members of the audience wept during his prayers or fainted. He spoke to a girls club camp group by the river on August 19.

Fred Mortensen arrived August 20.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Riding from Minneapolis to Cleveland he then went on to Green Acre - all by way of [[Freighthopping]]. Being introduced in a crowd he was embarrassed at his dirty appearance and then was told to sit down amid the company of people in fine dress and wait but soon `Abdu'l-Bahá returned and began to speak closely with Mortensen.  His inquiry revealed how Mortisen had traveled and Mortisen felt kindness from `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mortisen had arrived on a day `Abdu'l-Baha had arranged as a feast.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; On the last day at Green Acre he met with individuals and left the 23rd.

====Malden, Massachusetts====
His final destination in New England was [[Malden, Massachusetts]] at the home of Maria P. Wilson, originally of Boston, where he stayed from 23 to 29 August.&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; In Malden he spoke to various groups&lt;ref name=Ward239Days/&gt; - a New Thought movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Albert Vail accompanied William H. Randall meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá there in late August.&lt;ref&gt;The detailed moment Vail met `Abdu'l-Bahá is unknown. `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Malden August 23 -  {{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;Six years ago I met a servant of God named Abdul Baha, so universal in mind, brilliant in utterance, so pure, so radiant with universal love, so majestic in the power of his holy spirit that I became convinced he and his equally perfect and glorious father, Baha o'llah, were God's own messengers of light and salvation to our modern world ...&lt;ref name=ForbesHistory/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá then left for Montreal where he arrived near midnight on 30 August 1912.

===After affects of the visit===

A number of individuals and institutions became more prominent after `Abdu'l-Bahá's travels through the region.

There is a mystery, a force in the Cause far above the ken of men and angels." and then spoke with an eloquence that moved and thrilled the audience. In a separate account of the convention, it was noted he was the final speaker of the meeting and that his "discourse was unique in penetrating power and beauty of utterance among all the eloquent addresses of the Convention" and that the chair had stopped reviewing the watch to limit speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Bowditch became more involved with costume work for theatre productions.&lt;ref name=BowditchMemoir/&gt; While her life was going well she also felt "something was wanting in my existence and couldn't put a finger on ... I then began to seek for that missing link, going to most every church and attending various meetings ... (and) hearing of a meeting to be held in Boston about the Bahá'í Faith."&lt;ref name=BowditchMemoir/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'll never forget entering the large hall and seeing around me such a different type of gathering from the usual Boston crowd. Here were both rich and poor, along with every race. Many were black. I listened to a wonderful talk on the Faith by Mr. Harry Randall and was so thrilled! Afterwards I made my way straight to the table where books were being sold in order to learn more about the subject. I picked out as many as could be comfortably carried home on the streetcar, then found to my dismay that I didn't have enough money with which to pay for them! The person at the book stand told me it was all right to take them home and pay at the next meeting.&lt;ref name=BowditchMemoir/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may have been an event the Boston Bahá'í community hosted called a "World Unity Conference" as part of a series sponsored by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and covered in the ''Boston Evening Transcript''.&lt;ref name=pluralismtimeline&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;At first, I regarded it with amused interest, as one of many little cults; but gradually I found myself drawn into closer and closer relation with it. There was a wideness in its attitude which I had not found elsewhere. It held place for what was best in Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Freethought and all the rest, warring with none of these, but finding each of them definitely serviceable to the larger spiritual plan of the universe. It is the great reconciler and harmonizer. I have discovered in it an abiding-place which I had sought in vain for many restless years.

==Wadi Bakka==
The '''Wadi Bakka''' or '''Wadi Bekka''' runs alongside the village. The [[wadi]] was the scene of the '''Battle of Wadi Bakka''' where a [[Druze]] uprising was put down by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] during the [[1838 Druze revolt]].&lt;ref name="Izzeddin1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nejla M.

==Roman temple==
There are the ruins of a [[Roman temple]] in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;Tallon, Maurice., “Sanctuaires et itinéraires romains du. Chouf et du sud de la Béqa,” Mélanges de l'université Saint Joseph 43, pp. 233-50, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; George Taylor classified it as a [[prostylos temple]] and noted that the north and south walls remained standing and the podium floor had survived. The site has been heavily damaged by local construction of houses over the site. The temple featured an underground [[crypt]] that was accessible via one of the houses that had been built over it.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide. Les temples romains au Liban; guide illustré|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ii8NAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 September 2012|year=1971|publisher=Dar el-Machreq Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Taylor divided up the [[Temples of Lebanon]] into three groups, one group of [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]] lies north of the road from [[Beirut]] to [[Damascus]]. Second, there is the group in the area south of the same road, including the [[Wadi al-Taym]] and the western flank of Mount Hermon. Third, the group in the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of Mount Lebanon. There are relatively few temples along Lebanon's coastal plain. The Temples of Mount Hermon in Taylor's second group included Bakka and [[Ain Harcha]], [[Aaiha]], [[Deir El Aachayer]], [[Dekweh]], [[Yanta (village)|Yanta]], [[Hebbariye]], [[Ain Libbaya]], [[Nebi Safa]], [[Aaqbe]], [[Khirbet El-Knese]], [[Mejdal Anjar]], [[Mdoukha]].

[[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] suggested that word ''bakka' could have derived from the later [[Arabic]] meaning of ''crowd''. Others have linked it to the [[Hebrew]] word ''bikha'' meaning ''plain''.&lt;ref name="(viscountess)1862"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily Anne Beaufort Smythe Strangford (viscountess)|title=Egyptian sepulchres and Syrian shrines: including some stay in the Lebanon, at Palmyra, and in western Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMEYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294|accessdate=20 September 2012|year=1862|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|pages=294–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan]]'' in 1968, Castaneda wrote a series of books that describe his training in [[shamanism]], particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the [[Toltec (Castaneda)|Toltecs]]. The books, narrated in the [[first-person narrative|first person]], relate his experiences under the tutelage of a man that Castaneda claimed was a [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] "Man of Knowledge" named [[don (honorific)|don]] [[don Juan Matus|Juan Matus]]. His 12 books have sold more than 28 million copies in 17 languages. Critics have suggested that they are works of fiction; supporters claim the books are either true or at least valuable works of philosophy.

Castaneda withdrew from public view in 1973, living in a large house in [[Westwood, California]] from 1973 until his death in 1998, with three colleagues whom he called "Fellow Travellers of Awareness." He founded Cleargreen, an organization that promotes "Tensegrity", which Castaneda described as the modern version of the "magical passes" of the shamans of ancient Mexico.

==Early life==

Castaneda moved to the United States in the early 1950s and became a [[naturalized citizen]] on June 21, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Petition for Naturalization No. 199531, United States Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] (B.A. 1962; Ph.D. 1973).&lt;ref&gt;De Mille (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Castaneda married Margaret Runyan in Mexico in 1960, according to Runyan's memoirs.&lt;ref name="Woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/30|title=Margaret Runyan Castaneda, Carlos Castaneda's ex-wife, dies at 90|last=Woo|first=Elaine|date=January 30, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606042311/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/30|archivedate=6 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castaneda is listed on the birth certificate of Runyan's son C.J. Castaneda as his father even though his biological father was a different man.&lt;ref name="Woo" /&gt; It is unclear whether Carlos and Margaret were divorced in 1960, 1973, or not at all, and his death certificate even stated he had never been married.&lt;ref name="Woo" /&gt;

==Career==

Castaneda's first three books – ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge]]''; ''[[A Separate Reality]]''; and ''[[Journey to Ixtlan]]'' – were written while he was an [[anthropology]] student at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He wrote these books as his research log describing his apprenticeship with a traditional "Man of Knowledge" identified as ''don Juan Matus'', allegedly a [[Yaqui]] Indian from northern Mexico. Castaneda was awarded his [[Bachelor degree|bachelor's]] and [[doctoral degree]]s based on the work described in these books.

In 1974 his fourth book, ''Tales of Power'', was published and chronicled the end of his apprenticeship under the tutelage of Matus. Castaneda continued to be popular with the reading public with subsequent publications that unfolded further aspects of his training with don Juan.

Castaneda wrote that don Juan recognized him as the new ''[[nagual]]'', or leader of a party of seers of his lineage. Matus also used the term ''nagual'' to signify that part of perception which is in the realm of the unknown yet still reachable by man, implying that, for his own party of seers, Matus was a connection to that unknown. Castaneda often referred to this unknown realm as "nonordinary reality."

The term ''nagual'' has been used by anthropologists to mean a shaman or sorcerer who claims to be able to change into an animal form, or to metaphorically "shift" into another form through magic rituals, [[shamanism]] and experiences with psychoactive drugs (e.g. [[peyote]] and [[Datura innoxia|jimson weed]]).&lt;ref&gt;Castaneda, C: ''The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge'', pp. 88–120, Washington Square Press Publication, 1968 paperback {{ISBN|0-671-60041-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Castaneda was a well-known cultural figure, he rarely appeared in  public forums. He was the subject of a cover article in the March 5, 1973 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' which described him as "an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a tortilla"&lt;!-- yes this is the actual quote --&gt;. There was controversy when it was revealed that Castaneda may have used a surrogate for his cover portrait. When confronted by correspondent Sandra Burton about discrepancies in his personal history, Castaneda responded: "To ask me to verify my life by giving you my statistics&amp;nbsp;... is like using science to validate sorcery."  Following that interview, Castaneda completely retired from public view.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burton, Sandra |title=Don Juan and the Sorcerer's Apprentice |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,903890,00.html |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=101 |number=10 |date=March 5, 1973 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627173204/http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,903890,00.html |archivedate=June 27, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensegrity===
{{other uses|Tensegrity}}
In the 1990s, Castaneda once again began appearing in public to promote Tensegrity, which was described in promotional materials as "the modernized version of some movements called magical passes developed by Indian shamans who lived in Mexico in times prior to the Spanish conquest." &lt;ref name="nytimes_obit"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Applebome |first1=Peter |title=Mystery Man's Death Can't End the Mystery; Fighting Over Carlos Castaneda's Legacy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/19/arts/mystery-man-s-death-can-t-end-mystery-fighting-over-carlos-castaneda-s-legacy.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=August 19, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleargreen.com/|title=Carlos Castaneda's Tensegrity|accessdate=17 April 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castaneda, along with Carol Tiggs, [[Florinda Donner-Grau]] and [[Taisha Abelar]], created Cleargreen Incorporated in 1995. The organization's stated purpose is "carrying out the instruction and publication of Tensegrity". Tensegrity seminars, books, and other merchandise were sold through Cleargreen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleargreen.com/about-us|title=ABOUT US|website=Carlos Castaneda's Tensegrity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Castaneda died on April 27, 1998&lt;ref name="mystery man"/&gt; in Los Angeles due to complications from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular cancer]]. There was no public service; Castaneda was cremated and the ashes were sent to Mexico. His death was unknown to the outside world until nearly two months later, on 19 June 1998, when an obituary entitled "A Hushed Death for Mystic Author Carlos Castaneda" by staff writer [[J. R. Moehringer]] appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Castaneda Obituary|accessdate=23 February 2015|work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|date=June 19, 1998|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/archives/1998/980619.atc.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807062938/http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/archives/1998/980619.atc.html|archivedate=7 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months after Castaneda's death, C. J. Castaneda, also known as Adrian Vashon, whose birth certificate shows Carlos Castaneda as his father, challenged Castaneda's will in probate court.  C.J. challenged its authenticity. The challenge was ultimately unsuccessful&lt;ref name="mystery man"/&gt;. Carlos' death certificate states metabolic encephalopathy for 72{{nbsp}}hours prior to his death, yet the will was purportedly signed 48{{nbsp}}hours before Castaneda's death&lt;ref&gt;County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services (1998). [[:File:Carlos Castaneda Death Certificate.jpg |Carlos Castaneda death certificate]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Castaneda's colleagues==

After Castaneda stepped away from public view in 1973, he bought a large multi-dwelling property in Los Angeles which he shared with some of his followers. Among those who lived there were [[Taisha Abelar]] (formerly Maryann Simko) and [[Florinda Donner-Grau]] (formerly Regine Thal). Like Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, and Florinda Donner-Grau were students of anthropology at UCLA. Each went on to write books that explored the experience of being followers of Castaneda's teachings from a feminist perspective. Cf. "Related Authors"

Around the time Castaneda died in April 1998, his companions Donner-Grau, Abelar and Patricia Partin informed friends they were leaving on a long journey. [[Amalia Marquez]] (also known as Talia Bey) and Tensegrity instructor Kylie Lundahl also left Los Angeles. Weeks later, Partin's red Ford Escort was found abandoned in Death Valley.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Luis Marquez, the brother of Talia Bey, went to police in 1999 over his sister's disappearance, but was unable to convince them that it merited investigation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In 2006, Partin's sun-bleached skeleton was discovered by a pair of hikers in Death Valley's Panamint Dunes area and was identified by DNA testing. The investigating authorities ruled Partin's death as undetermined.&lt;ref name="salon_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flinchum |first=Robin |title=Remains of guru's disciple identified |newspaper=Pahrump Valley Times |date=2006-02-10 |url=http://archive.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2006/02/10/news/remains.html |accessdate=2015-02-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WWqbUUel?url=http://archive.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2006/02/10/news/remains.html |archivedate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his death, Carol Tiggs, a colleague of Castaneda, has spoken at workshops throughout the world, including at Ontario, California in 1998, Sochi, Russia in 2015 and Merida, Yucatan in 2016. Tiggs had the longest association with Castaneda and is written about in some of his books. Today, she serves as a consultant for Cleargreen.

== Reception ==
Although Castaneda's account of the Teaching of Don Juan were initially well-received as non-fiction works of ethnography, the books are now widely regarded as works of fiction.&lt;ref name="salon_2007"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Robert |date=April 12, 2007 |title=The dark legacy of Carlos Castaneda |url=https://www.salon.com/2007/04/12/castaneda/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, and with the backing of academic qualifications and the [[UCLA]] anthropological department, Castaneda's work was mostly praised by reviewers. [[Edmund Leach]] praised book.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Leach | first =Edmund | authorlink =Edmund Leach | date =June 5, 1969 | title =High School | journal =[[The New York Review of Books]] | issn =0028-7504 | url =http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1969/jun/05/high-school/ | accessdate =2010-10-13 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121013054317/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1969/jun/05/high-school/ | archivedate =October 13, 2012 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist E. H. Spicer offered a somewhat mixed review of ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan]]'', highlighting Castaneda's expressive prose and his vivid depiction of his relationship with Don Juan. However, Spicer noted that the events described in the book were not consistent with other ethnographic accounts of Yaqui cultural practices, concluding it was unlikely that Don Juan had ever participated in Yaqui group life. Spicer also stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; [It is] wholly gratuitous to emphasize, as the subtitle does, any connection between the subject matter of the book and the cultural traditions of the Yaquis." &lt;ref name="spicer_1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spicer |first1=Edward H. |title=Review: The Teaching of Don Jaun: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge |journal=American Anthropologist |date=April 1969 |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=320–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a series of articles, [[R. Gordon Wasson]], the ethnobotanist who made psychoactive mushrooms famous, similarly praised Castaneda's work, while expressing doubts regarding the accuracy of some of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;Wasson, R. Gordon. 1969. (Bk. Rev.). Economic Botany vol. 23(2):197. A review of Carlos Castaneda's "The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.", Wasson, R. Gordon. 1972a. (Bk. Rev.).

A review of Carlos Castaneda's "Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan."; Wasson, R. Gordon. . 1974. (Bk. Rev.). Economic Botany vol. 28(3):245–246. A review of Carlos Castaneda's "Tales of Power."; Wasson, R. Gordon. 1977a. (Mag., Bk. Rev). Head vol. 2(4):52–53, 88–94. November.&lt;/ref&gt;
An early unpublished review by anthropologist Weston La Barre was more critical. La Barre questioned the book's accuracy, calling it a "pseudo-profound deeply vulgar pseudo-ethnography." The review, initially commissioned by The New York Times Review of Books, was rejected and replaced by a more positive review from a different anthropologist.&lt;ref name="salon_2007"/&gt;

Later reviews were more critical, with several critics positing that the books were fabrications. Beginning in 1976, [[Richard de Mille]] published a series of criticisms that uncovered inconsistencies in Castaneda's field notes, as well as several instances of apparent plagiarism.&lt;ref name="salon_2007" /&gt; Later, anthropologists specializing in Yaqui Indian culture, such as Jane Holden Kelley, questioned the accuracy of Castaneda's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Jane Holden |title=Yaqui Women: Contemporary Life Histories |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1978 |pages=24–25 |isbn=978-0-8032-0912-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other criticisms of Castaneda's work include the total lack of Yaqui vocabulary or terms for any of his experiences, and his refusal to defend himself against the accusation that he received his PhD from UCLA through deception.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001). ''Cultural materialism: the struggle for a science of culture.'' Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press. p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen C. Thomas notes&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; that in her book ''With Good Heart: Yaqui Beliefs and Ceremonies in Pascua Village'', Muriel Thayer Painter gives examples of Yaqui vocabulary associated with spirituality: "morea", an equivalent to the Spanish brujo; "saurino", used to describe persons with the gift of divination; and "seataka", or spiritual power, a word which is "fundamental to Yaqui thought and life."&lt;ref name="Painter"&gt;{{cite book | last = Painter| first = Muriel Thayer |title=With Good Heart: Yaqui Beliefs and Ceremonies in Pascua Village | publisher = University of Arizona Press| location = Tucson | date = 1986 | pages = 11, 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas further states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It is hard to believe that Castaneda's benefactor, a self-professed Yaqui, would fail to employ these native expressions throughout the apprenticeship. In omitting such intrinsically relevant terms from his ethnography, Castaneda critically undermines his portrait of Don Juan as a bona fide Yaqui sorcerer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Dedrick, a Protestant missionary who lived among the Yaqui Indians of Vicam, Sonora, from 1940 to 1979, stated in his letter of May 23, 1989 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I've only read "The Teachings of Don Juan", and before I got to the third part of the book I knew that he [Castaneda] did know of the Yaquis and that
he had not been to the Rio Yaqui river, or that there is no terminology in the Yaqui language for any of the instructions and explanations that "Don Juan" was giving it to him [Castaneda]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fikes |first=Jay Courtney |title=Carlos Castaneda: Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties |publisher=Millenia Press |year=1993 |pages=55–56 |isbn=978-0969696001}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clement Meighan and Stephen C. Thomas,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realitysandwich.com/418/shamans_and_charlatans_assessing_castanedas_legacy/ |title=Shamans and Charlatans: Assessing Castaneda's Legacy |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |access-date=18 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618032022/http://realitysandwich.com/418/shamans_and_charlatans_assessing_castanedas_legacy/ |archivedate=18 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  point out that the books largely, and for the most part, do not describe Yaqui culture at all with its emphasis on Catholic upbringing and conflict with the Federal State of Mexico, but rather focus on the international movements and life of Don Juan who was described in the books as traveling and having many connections, and abodes, in the Southwestern United States (Arizona), Northern Mexico, and Oaxaca. Don Juan was described in the books as a shaman steeped in a mostly lost Toltec philosophy and decidedly anti-Catholic.

A March 5, 1973 ''Time'' article by Sandra Burton, looking at both sides of the controversy, stated:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the more worldly claim to importance of Castaneda's books: to wit, that they are anthropology, a specific and truthful account of an aspect of Mexican Indian culture as shown by the speech and actions of one person, a shaman named Juan Matus. That proof hinges on the credibility of Don Juan as a being and Carlos Castaneda as a witness. Yet there is no corroboration beyond Castaneda's writings that Don Juan did what he is said to have done, and very little that he exists at all.

A strong case can be made that the Don Juan books are of a different order of truthfulness from Castaneda's pre-Don Juan past. Where, for example, was the motive for an elaborate scholarly put-on? ''The Teachings'' were submitted to a university press, an unlikely prospect for best-sellerdom. Besides, getting an anthropology degree from U.C.L.A. is not so difficult that a candidate would employ so vast a confabulation just to avoid research. A little fudging perhaps, but not a whole system in the manner of The Teachings, written by an unknown student with, at the outset, no hope of commercial success.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;}}

David Silverman sees value in the work even while considering it fictional. In ''Reading Castaneda'' he describes the apparent deception as a critique of anthropology field work in general – a field that relies heavily on personal experience, and necessarily views other cultures through a lens. According to Silverman, not only the descriptions of [[peyote]] trips but also the fictional nature of the work are meant to place doubt on other works of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;David Silverman. ''Reading Castaneda: A Prologue to the Social Sciences''. {{ISBN|978-0-7100-8146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cherry Hill Seminary''' provides higher education and practical training in Pagan ministry, as the first graduate-level education for Pagan ministry in the world. Cherry Hill Seminary offers online distance-learning classes, regional workshops, and intensive retreats.
[[File:Cherry Hill Seminary logo.jpg|thumb|right]]
Cherry Hill Seminary is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)3 nonprofit organization]] under the laws of the United States, offering master's-level degrees under authority of the state of South Carolina. Cherry Hill's business office is located in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].

==History==
The seminary was founded in the early 1990s by [[Kirk White]], Cat Chapin-Bishop and Laura Wildman-Hanlon of Vermont's Church of the Sacred Earth.  Classes were conducted first by mail, and then brought online in 2000.  The seminary was granted [https://www.guidestar.org/profile/20-4542690 501(c)3 tax-exempt status] by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in March 2007.

White recruited nonprofit consultant and Cherry Hill Seminary student Holli Emore to serve as the chair of the first working board of directors, which began meeting in January 2007.  At the end of that year, Emore became the seminary’s first executive director, and the seminary relocated its business operations and incorporation to South Carolina.  By 2012, the faculty had grown to sixty educators, most with terminal degrees.

The master's program was announced in July 2009.  In fall of 2010, 38 students were matriculated into either a master's or a certificate program, and many more took courses outside of the formal programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission, Vision, Values &amp; History|url=http://www.cherryhillseminary.org/|work=Cherry Hill Seminary: education for leadership, ministry, and personal growth|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherry Hill Seminary granted its first Master of Divinity degree in Pagan pastoral counseling to Sandra Lee Harris of Sacred Well Congregation in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emore|first=Holli|title=Cherry Hill Seminary Awards First-Ever Pagan Master of Divinity Degree|url=http://www.cherryhillseminary.org/blog/news-releases/cherry-hill-seminary-awards-first-ever-pagan-master-of-divinity-degree/|work=Press Release  August 16, 2012|publisher=Cherry Hill Seminary|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of that degree was submitted to the [[Association of Professional Chaplains]] as part of the recipient's application for evaluation of theological equivalency by the Board of Chaplaincy Certification, Inc. in lieu of a graduate degree from an accredited seminary.  On November 1, 2012, BCCI notified the recipient that her educational credentials had been accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Heather|title=One Step, One Leap: The Ripple Effect of Equivalency|url=http://wildhunt.org/2012/11/one-step-one-leap-the-ripple-effect-of-equivalency.html|work=The Wild Hunt 18 November 2012|publisher=Jason Pitzl-Waters|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic standing==
Cherry Hill Seminary has been granted an official religious exemption from South Carolina requirements for educational institutions,&lt;ref name="cherryhillseminary.org"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Cherry Hill Seminary Current Catalog
  | work = cherryhillseminary.org
  | url = http://cherryhillseminary.org/students/forms-and-resources-for-students/
  | accessdate = January 31, 2018
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it can legally grant [[Master of Divinity]] degrees.

Cherry Hill Seminary will seek accreditation from the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC), a process which can take several years.

==Programs==
Courses include topics in ethics, religious history, ministry, leadership, chaplaincy, ritual, spirituality and formation, social justice and more. Registered students receive access to an online classroom for course content, discussion and assignments. Most courses hold live meetings on Skype.
&lt;br&gt;

[http://cherryhillseminary.org/degree-programs/masters-degrees/ Master's degrees] include: Master of Pagan Studies; and Master of Divinity, with areas of focus corresponding to the Department of Ministry, Advocacy and Leadership, Department of Pagan Pastoral Counseling and Chaplaincy, or Department of Theology and Religious History.&lt;br&gt;

Several [http://cherryhillseminary.org/degree-programs/pagan-community-education/ certificate programs] respond to the varying interests of those who do not need a graduate degree, or who seek specific training in addition to their existing degree, for example, in environmental leadership. &lt;br&gt;

Insights short courses are for anyone in the public and last only four weeks, addressing specific topics, often on popular subjects or a particular skill.

&lt;br&gt;
The Seminary is gradually adding [http://cherryhillseminary.org/degree-programs/self-directed-short-courses/ self-directed asynchronous short courses]. 
&lt;br&gt;
[http://cherryhillseminary.org/degree-programs/pagan-life-academy-incarcerated-pagans/ Pagan Life Academy] is a series of eight print lessons (not correspondence) developed especially for incarcerated Pagans and ministers working with Pagans in correctional facilities.
&lt;br&gt;
The [http://cherryhillseminary.org/degree-programs/pagan-community-education/community-ministry-certificate/ Community Ministry Certificate] is a non-professional 15-month asynchronous self-study with an assigned faculty mentor. The first CMC graduates were awarded their certificates in spring of 2018.

The phenomenon of large-scale '''[[Human migration|migration]] of [[Christians]]''' is the main reason why Christians' [[religious demographics|share of the population]] has been declining in many countries. Many [[Muslim countries]] have witnessed disproportionately high [[emigration rate]]s among their Christian minorities for several generations. Today, most [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern people in the United States]] are Christians, and the majority of [[Arab diaspora|Arabs living outside the Arab World]] are [[Arab Christians]].

[[Push factors]] motivating Christians to emigrate include [[religious discrimination]], [[religious persecution|persecution]], and [[religious cleansing|cleansing]]. Pull factors include [[economic migration|prospects of upward mobility]] as well as [[family reunification|joining relatives abroad]].

==Christian emigration from the Middle East==
{{main|Religion in the Middle East|Christianity in the Middle East|Arab Christians|Arab diaspora}}
The majority of [[Arab diaspora|Arabs living outside the Arab World]] are [[Arab Christians]]. Christians have emigrated from the Middle East, a phenomenon that has been attributed to various causes included economic factors, political and military conflict, and feelings of insecurity or isolation among minority Christian populations. The higher rate of emigration among Christians, compared to other religious groups, has also been attributed to their having stronger support networks available abroad, in the form of existing emigrant communities.

===Egypt===
{{main|Christianity in Egypt|Copts in Egypt|Egyptian diaspora|Coptic diaspora}}
As with most [[Arab diaspora|diaspora Arabs]], a substantial proportion of the [[Egyptian diaspora]] consists of [[Arab Christians]]. The [[Copts]] have been emigrating from Egypt both to improve their economic situation and to escape [[Persecution of Copts|systematic harassment and persecution in their homeland]].

===Iran===
{{main|Christianity in Iraq|Iranian Armenians|Assyrians in Iran|Iranian diaspora|Armenian diaspora|Assyrian diaspora}}
Christians and other [[religious minorities in Iran|religious minorities]] make up a disproportionately high share of the [[Iranian diaspora]].

===Iraq===
{{main|Christianity in Iraq|Assyrians in Iraq|Armenians in Iraq|Iraqi diaspora|Assyrian diaspora}}
Following the [[Iraq War]], the Christian population of Iraq has collapsed. Of the nearly 1 million Assyro-Chaldean Christians, most have emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia and within some of the 28 [[member states of the European Union]] and most of the rest concentrated within the northern Kurdish enclave of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. With continuing insurgency, Iraqi Christians are under constant threat or radical Islamic violence.

Since the [[United States]]-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003 and the resulting breakdown of law and order in that country, many [[Syriac language|Syriac]] speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and other Christians have fled the country, taking refuge in [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and further afield. Their percentage of the population has declined from 12% in 1948 (4.8 million population), to 7% in 1987 (20 million) and 6% in 2003 (27 million). Despite Assyrians making up only 3% of Iraq's population, on October 2005, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] reported of the 700,000 Iraqis who took refuge in Syria between October 2003 and March 2005, 36% were "Iraqi Christians."

===Lebanon===
{{main|Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese diaspora}}

[[Lebanon]] has experienced a large migration of Lebanese Christians for many generations. There are more [[Lebanese people]] living [[Lebanese diaspora|outside of Lebanon]] (8.6&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-01/255048-bassil-promises-to-ease-citizenship-for-expatriates.ashx#axzz30yVHukzf Bassil promises to ease citizenship for expatriates]&lt;/ref&gt;-14&lt;ref name=fco&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029394365&amp;a=KCountryProfile&amp;aid=1018721190906 |title=Country Profile: Lebanon |work=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] |date=3 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080206062728/http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029394365&amp;a=KCountryProfile&amp;aid=1018721190906 |archivedate=6 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; million), than within (4.3 million). The majority of the diaspora population consists of [[Lebanese Christians]]; however, there are some who are Muslim, Druze, or Jewish. They trace their origin to several waves of Christian emigration, starting with the exodus that followed the [[1860 Lebanon conflict]] in [[Ottoman Syria]].

Under the current [[Lebanese nationality law]], diaspora Lebanese do not have an automatic [[right of return]] to Lebanon. Due to varying degrees of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and high degree of interethnic marriages, most diaspora Lebanese [[language shift|have not passed on the Arabic language to their children]], while still maintaining a Lebanese [[ethnic identity]].

The [[Lebanese Civil War]] has further fed the higher Christian emigration rate. Higher Muslim birthrates, the [[Palestinians in Lebanon|presence of Palestinians in Lebanon]] and [[Syrians in Lebanon|Syrian migrant workers]] have contributed to reducing the Christian proportion of the Lebanese population. Lebanese Christians still remain culturally and politically prominent, forming 35-40% of the population. Since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] emigrants have outnumbered Christians, but the latter remain somewhat over-represented compared to their proportion of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.org/bulletin-bodypg.aspx?BulletinID=682 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427020651/http://www.cnewa.org/bulletin-bodypg.aspx?BulletinID=682 |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestine (West Bank and Gaza)===
{{main|Palestinian Christians|Palestinian diaspora}}

In the [[Palestinian National Authority]], there has been considerable emigration and Palestinian Christians are disproportionately represented within the Palestinian diaspora. Most of Gazan Christians have fled the [[Gaza Strip]] following the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Hamas takeover in 2007]], largely relocating to the West Bank.

===Syria===

Under the current [[nationality law]], diaspora Syrians do not have an automatic [[right of return]] to Syria.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Due to varying degrees of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and high degree of interethnic marriages, most diaspora Syrians [[language shift|have not passed on the Arabic language to their children]], while still maintaining a Syrian [[ethnic identity]].

Following the eruption of [[Syrian civil war]] in 2011, Christians have been targeted by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|militant Islamists]], and hence have become a major component of the [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrian refugees]].

In FY 2016, when the US dramatically increased the number of refugees admitted from Syria, the US let in 12,587 refugees from the country, with 99% being Muslims (with few Shia Muslims admitted).

===Turkey===
{{main|Christianity in Turkey|Greeks in Turkey|Armenians in Turkey|Assyrians in Turkey|Turkish diaspora}}

Originally, most emigrants from what is now Turkey were [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire]], including [[Greek refugees]]. Today, [[Turkish diaspora|emigration from Turkey]] consists primarily of [[Turkish Muslims|Muslims]].

The percentage of [[Christians]] in Turkey fell from 19 percent in 1914 to 2.5 percent in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Içduygu|first=Ahmet|author2=Toktas, Şule; Ali Soner, B.|title=The politics of population in a nation-building process: emigration of non-Muslims from Turkey|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|date=1 February 2008|volume=31|issue=2|pages=358–389|doi=10.1080/01419870701491937}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to events which had a significant impact on the country's demographic structure, such as the [[Armenian Genocide]], the massacre of 500,000 Greeks and 375,000 Assyrian Christians, [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Chapter ''The refugees question in Greece (1821-1930)'' in "''Θέματα Νεοελληνικής Ιστορίας''", ΟΕΔΒ (''"Topics from Modern Greek History"''). 8th edition|format=PDF|publisher=Nikolaos Andriotis |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the emigration of Christians (such as [[Levantines]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] etc.) to foreign countries (mostly in [[Europe]], [[the Americas]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]) that actually began in the late 19th century and gained pace in the first quarter of the 20th century, especially during [[World War I]] and after the [[Turkish War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.meforum.org/487/editors-introduction-why-a-special-issue |format=PDF|title='Editors' Introduction: Why a Special Issue?: Disappearing Christians of the Middle East|publisher=Editors' Introduction |accessdate=11 June 2013|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman censuses undercounted the number of Christians which was closer to 24-5% of the population: 4.3 million not 3 million as reported. Today there are more than 160,000 people of different [[Christian denominations]], representing less than 0.2 percent of [[Turkey]]'s population,&lt;ref name="cia-rel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html#tu|title=Religions|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian emigration from South Asia==
===India===
{{main|Christianity in India|Indian diaspora}}

Christians have also fled from India but for their own reasons and in very few numbers, as India has been considered as one of safest place for them in South Asia. Moreover India has been one of the favourite tourist destination of the people of United States, Europe in south asia. However, theirs no legal confirmation that claims any kind of violence against Christians. This was also seen that Indian people celebrates Christmas festival with full enthusiasm and love.

'''Dakshinayana''' ({{lang-sa|दक्षिणायण}}) is the six-month period between [[Summer solstice]] and [[Winter solstice]], when the sun travels towards the south on the [[celestial sphere]]. Dakshinayana begins on Karka [[Sankranti]] or July 16, as it marks the transition of the Sun into Karka [[Rāshi (Jyotiṣa)|rashi]] ([[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]).

It marks the end of the six-month [[Uttarayana]] period of [[Hindu calendar]] and the beginning of Dakshinayana, which itself ends at [[Makar Sankranti]] and the [[Uttarayan]] period begins.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in [[Radio Academy|The Radio Academy]]'s Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="radioacad"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Radio Academy Hall of Fame |url=http://www.radioacademy.org/hall-of-fame |work=The Radio Academy |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mNGrql2?url=http://www.radioacademy.org/hall-of-fame/ |archivedate= 8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams also wrote ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'' (1988), and co-wrote ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' (1983), ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]'' (1990), ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' (1990), and three stories for the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''; he also served as [[script editor]] for the show's seventeenth season in 1979. A posthumous collection of his works, including an unfinished novel, was published as ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in 2002.

Adams was an advocate for environmentalism and [[conservation movement|conservation]], a lover of fast cars,&lt;ref name=TI&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Douglas Adams: Master of his universe|date=19 April 2005|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/douglas-adams-master-of-his-universe-495422.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[innovation|technological innovation]] and the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]], and a radical [[atheism|atheist]].

==Early life==
Adams was born on 11 March 1952 to Janet (née Donovan; 1927–2016) and Christopher Douglas Adams (1927–1985) in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=ODNB &gt;Webb 2005b&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to the [[East End of London]] a few months after his birth, where his sister, Susan, was born three years later.&lt;ref name=Adams_xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced in 1957; Douglas, Susan, and their mother moved to an [[RSPCA]] animal shelter in [[Brentwood, Essex]], run by his maternal grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;Webb 2005a, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At nine, he passed the entrance exam for [[Brentwood School (Essex)|Brentwood School]]. [[Griff Rhys Jones]] was a year below him, and he was in the same class as [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]. He attended the [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until December 1970. Adams was {{convert|6|ft|m}} by age 12 and stopped growing at {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}}. His form master, Frank Halford, said Adams's height had made him stand out and that he had been self-conscious about it.&lt;ref name=Adams_7&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botti, Nicholas. [http://douglasadams.eu/interview-with-frank-halford/ "Interview with Frank Halford"]. ''Life, DNA, and H2G2.'' 2009. Web. Retrieved 13 March 2012. (Click on link at bottom for facsimile page from ''Daily News'' article, 7 March 1998.)&lt;/ref&gt; His ability to write stories made him well known in the school.&lt;ref name=Simpson_9&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing, something he remembered for the rest of his life, particularly when facing [[writer's block]].&lt;ref name=Adams_xix /&gt;

Some of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club in ''The Brentwoodian'' in 1962, or spoof reviews in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'', edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]], who later became a character in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. He also designed the cover of one issue of the ''Broadsheet'', and had a letter and short story published in ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'', the boys' comic, in 1965. A poem entitled "A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining" written by Adams in January 1970, at the age of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Alison (March 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/lost-school-poems-douglas-adams-griff-rhys-jones "Lost poems of Douglas Adams and Griff Rhys Jones found in school cupboard"], ''The Guardian'', 19 March 2014. Accessed 2 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On the strength of an essay on religious poetry that discussed [[the Beatles]] and [[William Blake]], he was awarded an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|Exhibition]] in English at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], going up in 1971. He wanted to join the [[Footlights]], an invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for comic talent. He was not elected immediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith, forming a group called "Adams-Smith-Adams", and became a member of the Footlights by 1973.&lt;ref name="Simpson_30-40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite doing very little work—he recalled having completed three essays in three years—he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in [[English literature]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Career==

===Writing===
After leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being discovered by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#6. Party Political Broadcast|episode 45]] of ''Monty Python'' for a sketch called "[[Patient Abuse]]". The pair also co-wrote the "Marilyn Monroe" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of ''[[The Album of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the Film of Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being [[Neil Innes]]).&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|title=Terry Jones remembers Douglas Adams, 'the last of the Pythons'|newspaper=The Times|date=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb]]

Adams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. At the beginning of episode 42, "The Light Entertainment War", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a [[List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters#Pepperpots|pepper-pot]] outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6150254.stm |title='Lost' gems from the TV archives |last=Young |first=Kevin |date=1 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=9 May 2018 |language=en-GB |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point Adams's career stalled; his writing style was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and TV comedy.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; To make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs, including as a hospital porter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made their fortune in oil.&lt;ref&gt;Webb 2005a, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed ''Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to live with his mother.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [..] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather&amp;nbsp;– you just have to get on with it".&lt;ref name=Adams_prologue&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=prologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Adams's early radio work included sketches for ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The News Huddlines]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote, again with Chapman, 20 February 1977 episode of ''[[Doctor on the Go]]'', a sequel to the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series. After the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'']] became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a pantomime called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jem. ''The Clue Bible: The Fully Authorised History of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue from Footlights to Mornington Crescent'': London, 2009, p164-5&lt;/ref&gt; He left after six months to become the script editor for ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

In 1979, Adams and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] wrote scripts for two half-hour episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'': "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and "The Great Disappearing Mystery" (episodes eight and twelve).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2014|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original ''Hitchhiker'' radio series ("Fit the Fifth" and "Fit the Sixth", also known as "Episode Five" and "Episode Six"), as well as ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]''.

====''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''====
{{Main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}
''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer [[Simon Brett]] to [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could be used in the series.
[[File:Towelday-Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Towel Day]] 2005 in Innsbruck, Austria, where Adams first had the idea of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. In the novels a towel is the most useful thing a space traveller can have. The annual Towel Day (25 May) was first celebrated in 2001, two weeks after Adams's death.]]

According to Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'', and it occurred to him that "somebody ought to write a ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas| editor= Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), Additional Material by M. J. Simpson|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | page = 10 | edition =25th Anniversary | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003 | isbn=0-330-41957-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''.&lt;ref&gt;Webb 2005a, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United States by [[National Public Radio]]. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21–25 January 1980.

While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Felch 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted as saying, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by."&lt;ref name=Simpson_236&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992.

The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four ''Hitchhiker's'' novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback edition).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iblist.com/series.php?id=2 Internet Book List] page, with links to all five novels, and reproductions of the 1990s paperback covers that included the [[42 Puzzle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Adams began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a film, making several trips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/|title=''The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy''|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with [[Disney]], which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting film]] was released in 2005.

Radio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005|isbn=0-330-43510-8 |pages=xiv | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book "trilogy". As with the movie, this project was realised only after Adams's death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and editing, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded with, "The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Dirk Maggs'', Page 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Dirk Gently'' series====
[[File:Douglas Adams San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Adams in March 2000]]
Between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was published in 1987, and was described by its author as "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams &amp; The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | edition=Second U.S. | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | page=169 | isbn=1-84023-742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had written.

A sequel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' After the book tour, Adams set off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.

====''Doctor Who''====
{{Main|Doctor Who}}
Adams sent the script for the ''HHGG'' pilot radio programme to the ''Doctor Who'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen", which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [[List of Doctor Who episodes (1963–1989)|''Doctor Who'' serials]] starring [[Tom Baker]] as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]:
* "[[The Pirate Planet]]" (the second serial in the "[[The Key to Time|Key to Time]]" arc, in [[Doctor Who (season 16)|season 16]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Discontinuity Guide]] |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |last2=Day |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Day |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |authorlink3=Keith Topping |year=1995 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |location=London |isbn=0-426-20442-5 |pages= |chapter=The Pirate Planet|chapterurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/pirateplanet/detail.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[City of Death]]" (with producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]], from an original storyline by writer [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]].

* "[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]" (only partially filmed; not televised due to [[strike action|industry disputes]], but was later completed using animation for the unfinished scenes and broadcast as "Doctor Who: The Lost Episode" on [[BBC America]] 19 July 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Discontinuity Guide]] |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |last2=Day |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Day |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |authorlink3=Keith Topping |year=1995 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |location=London |isbn=0-426-20442-5 |pages= |chapter=Shada|chapterurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/shada/detail.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that were not novelised as Adams would not allow anyone else to write them, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/en001/drwhogde.htm |title=A 1990s Doctor Who FAQ |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Shada" was later adapted as a novel by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]] in 2012 and "City of Death" and "The Pirate Planet" by [[James Goss (producer)|James Goss]] in 2015 and 2017 respectively.

Elements of ''Shada'' and ''City of Death'' were reused in Adams's later novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of [[Professor Chronotis]]. [[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[BBC Online|BBC website]] in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on 10 December 2005.

In the ''Doctor Who'' 2012 Christmas episode ''[[The Snowmen#Production|The Snowmen]]'', writer [[Steven Moffat]] was inspired by a storyline that Adams pitched called ''The Doctor Retires''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moffat |first=Steven |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-12-24/doctor-who-christmas-special-steven-moffat-matt-smith-and-jenna-louise-coleman-reveal-all |title=Doctor Who Christmas special: Steven Moffat, Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman reveal all |work=Radio Times |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s with the same teacher as [[Paul Wickens]], the pianist who plays in [[Paul McCartney]]'s band (and composed the music for the 2004–2005 editions of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series).&lt;ref&gt;Webb, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Procol Harum]] had important influence on Adams' work.

====Pink Floyd====
Adams's official biography shares its name with the song "[[Wish You Were Here (1975 song)|Wish You Were Here]]" by [[Pink Floyd]]. Adams was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and, on Adams's 42nd birthday, he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd's concert of 28 October 1994 at Earls Court in London, playing guitar on the songs "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" and "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]".&lt;ref name="Mabbett-MM"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher= Omnibus Press |isbn= 978-1-84938-370-7 |last= Mabbett |first= Andy |title= Pink Floyd – The Music and the Mystery |location= London |year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'', by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, "High Hopes".&lt;ref name="Mabbett-MM" /&gt; Gilmour also performed at Adams's memorial service in 2001, and what would have been Adams's 60th birthday party in 2012.

===Computer games and projects===
Douglas Adams created an [[interactive fiction]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|HHGG]]'' with [[Steve Meretzky]] from [[Infocom]] in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the [[Lucasfilm Games]] team for the game ''[[Labyrinth: The Computer Game|Labyrinth]]''. Later he was also involved in creating ''[[Bureaucracy (computer game)|Bureaucracy]]'' as a parody of events in his own life.

Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of [[The Digital Village]], a digital media and Internet company with which he created ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', a [[[[Software and Information Industry Association]]#CODiE Awards|Codie award]]-winning and [[BAFTA#Games Awards|BAFTA-nominated adventure game]], which was published in 1998 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;BBC Online (no date) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/dna/biog.shtml "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: DNA (1952-2001)"] Accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botti, Nicolas (2009).

In April 1999, Adams initiated the [[h2g2]] [[collaborative writing]] project, an experimental attempt at making ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1990, Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme ''[[Hyperland]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188677/ Internet Movie Database's page for ''Hyperland'']&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Tom Baker]] as a "software agent" (similar to the assistant pictured in Apple's [[Knowledge Navigator]] video of future concepts from 1987), and interviews with [[Ted Nelson]], the co-inventor of [[hypertext]] and the person who coined the term. Adams was an [[early adopter]] and advocate of hypertext.

==Personal beliefs and activism==

===Atheism and views on religion===
Adams described himself as a "radical [[atheist]]", adding "radical" for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told [[American Atheists]] that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it. He imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, "This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" to demonstrate his view that the [[fine-tuned Universe]] argument for God was a fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs. "I love to keep poking and prodding at it.

The evolutionary biologist and atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] uses Adams's influence to exemplify arguments for non-belief in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]''. Dawkins dedicated the book to Adams, whom he jokingly called "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism&lt;ref name="TheGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/roundupstory/0,,1939704,00.html |title=Observer, '&amp;#39;The God Delusion'&amp;#39;, 5&amp;nbsp;November 2006|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 November 2006 |accessdate=1 June 2009 | location=London | first=Kim | last=Bunce}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote on his death that "Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the [[mountain gorilla]] and the [[black rhino]] have lost a gallant defender."&lt;ref name=Dawkins2001&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=Lament for Douglas Adams|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/14/books.booksnews|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental activism===
Adams was also an [[environmental activist]] who campaigned on behalf of [[endangered species]]. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[kakapo]] and [[Chinese river dolphin|baiji]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of [[audiobook]], [[e-book]] and picture slide show.

Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from ''Last Chance to See'' to the book ''[[Great Ape Project|The Great Ape Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Paola Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Paola]] and [[Peter Singer]], editors | title=The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity | edition=U.S. Paperback | publisher=St. Martin's Griffin | year=1994 | pages=19–23|isbn=0-312-11818-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]], launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human and non-human.

In 1994, he participated in a climb of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation [[Save the Rhino|Save the Rhino International]]. Puppeteer [[William Todd-Jones]], who had originally worn the suit in the London Marathon to raise money and bring awareness to the group, also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while travelling to the mountain before the climb began. About £100,000 was raised through that event, benefiting schools in Kenya and a [[black rhinoceros]] preservation programme in [[Tanzania]]. Adams was also an active supporter of the [[Dian Fossey]] Gorilla Fund.

Since 2003, Save the Rhino has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifednah2g2.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/ninth-douglas-adams-memorial-lecture.html |title=The Ninth Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture |publisher=Save the Rhino International |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology and innovation===
Adams bought his first [[word processor]] in 1982, having considered one as early as 1979. His first purchase was a Nexu. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow 100|Rainbow]]. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], then a [[BBC Micro]] and a [[Tandy 1000]].&lt;ref name="Simpson_184-185"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Last Chance to See'' Adams mentions his [[Cambridge Z88]], which he had taken to [[Zaire]] on a quest to find the [[northern white rhinoceros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas and [[Mark Carwardine]] | title=Last Chance to See | edition=First U.S. Hardcover | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | year=1991 | page=59 | isbn=0-517-58215-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams's posthumously published work, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', features several articles by him on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in ''[[MacUser]]'' magazine, and in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper. In these Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a [[Commodore PET]], and that he had "adored" his Apple Macintosh ("or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it is that I've recklessly accumulated over the years") since he first saw one at Infocom's offices in Boston in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=90–1 | isbn=0-333-76657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe (the second being [[Stephen Fry]] – though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought his Mac first. Fry claims he was second to Adams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx6WPQkhUXI |title=Craig Ferguson 23 February 2010B Late Late show Stephen Fry PT2 |publisher=YouTube |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Adams was also an "[[AppleMasters|Apple Master]]", celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (others included [[John Cleese]] and [[Gregory Hines]]). Adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of [[iMovie]] with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available on Adams's [[.Mac]] homepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of [[Mac OS X]] in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] programming framework. He said it was "awesome...", which was also the last word he wrote on his site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.douglasadams.com/cgi-bin/mboard/info/dnathread.cgi?2922,1 |title=Adams's final post on his forums at |publisher=Douglasadams.com |accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams used email to correspond with [[Steve Meretzky]] in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom's version of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''.&lt;ref name="Simpson_184-185"/&gt; While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own [[USENET]] newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams |title=Discussions – alt.fan.douglas-adams &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Google |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams was a keynote speaker at the [[Microsoft]] [[Professional Developers Conference]] (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his keynote speech is archived on [[Channel 9 (discussion forum)|Channel 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Adams |first = Douglas |title = PDC 1996 Keynote with Douglas Adams |work=[[channel9.msdn.com]] |publisher=Channel 9 |date = 15 May 2001 |url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC-1996/PDC-1996-Keynote-with-Douglas-Adams |accessdate =22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adams was also a keynote speaker for the April 2001 [[Academic conference|Embedded Systems Conference]] in San Francisco, one of the major technical conferences on [[embedded system]] engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassel |first=David |title=So long, Douglas Adams, and thanks for all the fun |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |date=15 May 2001 |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/05/15/douglas_adams/index.html |accessdate=10 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307080733/http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/05/15/douglas_adams/index.html |archivedate=7 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Adams moved to [[Upper Street]], [[Islington]], in 1981&lt;ref name="IPP" /&gt; and to Duncan Terrace, a few minutes' walk away, in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="IPP" /&gt;

In the early 1980s Adams had an affair with novelist [[Sally Emerson]], who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, [[Peter Stothard]], a contemporary of Adams's at [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]], and later editor of ''[[The Times]]''. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the "lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's''. When the deal fell through, they moved back to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom")&lt;ref name=sfweekly&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowers |first=Keith |title=Big Three |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-07-06/calendar/big-three/ |work=SF Weekly |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mSWp8yr?url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-07-06/calendar/big-three/ |archivedate= 8 December 2011 |deadurl=no |date=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991.

Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where they lived until his death. Following the funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Belson died on 7 September 2011 of cancer, aged 59.&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;{{cite web |title=Obituary &amp; Guest Book Preview for Jane Elizabeth BELSON |url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=153521790 |work=The Times |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mSoMnJe?url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary-preview.aspx?n=jane-elizabeth-belson&amp;pid=153521790&amp;referrer=2282 |archivedate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=no |date=9 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Grave of Douglas Adams, Highgate.jpg|thumb|upright|Adams's gravestone, [[Highgate Cemetery]], North London]]

Adams died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 11 May 2001, aged 49, after resting from his regular workout at a private gym in [[Montecito, California]]. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at [[Harvey Mudd College]] on 13 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2001-05-24/news/lots-of-screamingly-funny-sentences-no-fish/ |title=Lots of Screamingly Funny Sentences.

His ashes were placed in [[Highgate Cemetery]] in north London in June 2002.&lt;ref name="Simpson_337-338"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial service was held on 17 September 2001 at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church, [[Trafalgar Square]], London. This became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;Gaiman, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Video clips of the service are still available on the BBC's website for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/celebration/ |title=BBC Online – Cult – Hitchhiker's – Douglas Adams – Service of Celebration |publisher=BBC |date=17 September 2001 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his last public appearances was a talk given at the University of California, Santa Barbara, ''Parrots, the universe and everything'', recorded days before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZG8HBuDjgc |title=Parrots, the universe and everything, recorded May 2001 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full transcript of the talk is available, and the university has made the full video available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navarroj.com/parrots |title=Transcript of "Parrots, the Universe and Everything" |publisher=Navarroj.com |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days before Adams died, the [[Minor Planet Center]] announced the naming of asteroid [[18610&amp;nbsp;Arthurdent]].&lt;ref name=MPC42677&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = 9 May 2001 | title = New Names of Minor Planets | periodical = [[Minor Planet Circular]] | publication-place = Cambridge, Massachusetts | publisher=[[Minor Planet Center]] | issue = MPC 42677 | url = http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2001/MPC_20010509.pdf | issn = 0736-6884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the asteroid [[25924&amp;nbsp;Douglasadams]] was named in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6867061/ Asteroid named after 'Hitchhiker' humorist: Late British sci-fi author honored after cosmic campaign] by Alan Boyle, MSNBC, 25 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' was published, containing many short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Fry]] (in the UK edition), [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] (in the US edition), and [[Terry Jones]] (in the US paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his unfinished novel, ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which was originally intended to become a new [[Dirk Gently]] novel, but might have later become the sixth ''Hitchhiker'' novel.&lt;ref&gt;

Other events after Adams's death included a [[webcast]] production of ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'', allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series, and the completion of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. The film, released in 2005, posthumously credits Adams as a producer, and several design elements – including a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the film – incorporated Adams's features.

A 12-part radio series based on the [[Dirk Gently]] novels was announced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/Dirk%20Maggs%20News%20%20new%20projects.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021209193312/http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/dirk%20maggs%20news%20%20new%20projects.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 9 December 2002 |title=Dirk Maggs News and New Projects page |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio series based on the incomplete chapters of ''The Salmon of Doubt'', and written by [[Kim Fuller]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Hemley |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24312/douglas-adams-final-dirk-gently-novel-to-be |title=The Stage / News / Douglas Adams's final Dirk Gently novel to be adapted for Radio 4 |work=The Stage |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on the two completed novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/10/11/9767/bbc_plans_dirk_gently_tv_series|title=BBC plans Dirk Gently TV series|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=11 October 2009|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth ''Hitchhiker'' novel, ''[[And Another Thing... (novel)|And Another Thing...]]'', by ''[[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]]'' author [[Eoin Colfer]], was released on 12 October 2009 (the 30th anniversary of the first book), published with the support of Adams's estate. A [[BBC Radio 4]] ''[[Book at Bedtime]]'' adaptation and an audio book soon followed.

On 25 May 2001, two weeks after Adams's death, his fans organised a tribute known as [[Towel Day]], which has been observed every year since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Molloy | first=Mark | date=25 May 2016 | title=What is Towel Day?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Gabâ''' or '''gabaa''', for the people in many parts of the [[Philippines]] particularly among [[Visayans]], is the concept of a non-human and non-divine, imminent [[Retributive justice|retribution]]. A sort of negative karma, it is generally seen as an evil effect on a person because of their wrongdoings or transgressions. The word has later been recycled for translating "'''divine retribution'''" or "'''divine fury'''" in the translations of the Bible to many local dialects in the Philippines. It is also translated as '''[[wikt:nemesis|nemesis]]'''. The opposite of "Gaba" is ''Grasya'', literally ''Grace'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which pertains to ''blessings from the Heavens''.

== Background ==

The gabâ can be characterized through various Cebuano proverbs:

* It is not necessarily immediate in its effect. (''Ang gabâ dili sama sa sili nga mohalang dayon.'')
* It may come unexpectedly. (''Ang gabâ dili magsaba.'')
* It is not limited to transgressions against fellow human beings: objects considered holy can also cause gabâ, such as dropping on the ground a sacred root crop of ''ubi''. (The concept was later extended to religious icons such as bibles or rosaries). Even the least-valued object may cause it. (''Bisan ang ube makagabâ.'')
* It could happen to persons who are important to the transgressor. For example, people would say "''gigabâan''" of a womanizing father whose daughter has a child out of wedlock.

=== Sources ===

The source of gabâ is not a god or God or an absolute karmic principle, but in the spirits of nature. It must have arisen out of the [[animism]] of pre-Spanish Cebuanos. With the coming of Christianity into the Islands, gabâ became "absorbed" in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In-depth examination, however, would show that it is incompatible with [[Catholic]] [[dogma]].

=== Applications ===

==== Gabâ and ''panghimaraot'' ====

Gabâ is distinct from ''[[panghimaraot]]'' (curse) whereby a transgressed person pronounces a ''maldesyon'' against the transgressor. In ''panghimaraot'', evil is asked to befall on the sinner; with gabâ, [[evil]] is sure to befall on the sinner, even if it is not asked. Sometimes Cebuanos blurt out threats of gabâ, "''Gabâ-an ka gyod!''", but it is not taken to mean that gabâ is being asked; it is only a reminder to the transgressor that no one is excluded from it. Sometimes sinners also ask for exclusion in pidgin Spanish: ''Puyra gabâ!'' (Fuera gabâ)

==== Gabâ and karma ====

Gabâ is not synonymous with the [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] law of [[karma]]: gabâ is only in the negative (a punishment), unlike karma which may be good or bad. Both concepts are known to the Visayan peoples, although gabâ is considered purely indigenous, while karma was historically imported.

; Gabâ and divine retribution

Gabâ is not, strictly speaking, the same as punishment from a godhead, such as the monotheisms' God or the Greek goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]: gabâ does not presuppose an Ultimate Being.

Ill-doings to one's fellowmen does not alone cause Gaba but actions like wasting food, disrespecting elders, abusing animals, desacrating holy places or objects, cursing God, and destroying ''[[Nuno sa Punso]]'' cause Gaba as well. An expression is also common among the Bisaya and Hiligaynon, ''Purya Gaba'' which is said when one walks in an eerie place, this is believed to ward off evil.

=== Social effects ===

Some sociologists believe that Gabâ is one of the causes of the complacency of Cebuanos: because of their belief in it, they prefer to be silent on abuses. It gives hope to the oppressed that someday the abuses will be paid for.

'''Gherasim Luca''' ({{IPA-ro|ɟeraˈsim ˈluka}}; 23 July 1913 – 9 February 1994) was a French-speaking [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] [[theorist]] and [[poet]]. Born '''Salman Locker''' in [[Romania]] and also known as '''Salman Locker''', '''Gherashim Luca''', '''Costea Sar''', and '''Petre Malcoci''', he regarded himself as an apatrid. His entire post-Second World War work is written in French. He is frequently cited in the works of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]].

== Biography ==

Born in [[Bucharest]] the son of a [[Jew]]ish tailor, Berl Locker (died 1914), he spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. During 1938, he traveled frequently to [[Paris]] where he was introduced to the Surrealist circles. [[World War II]] and the official [[antisemitism]] in Romania forced him into local [[exile]]. During the short pre-[[Communist Romania|Communist]] period of Romanian independence, he founded a Surrealist artists group, together with [[Gellu Naum]], Paul Păun, Virgil Teodorescu and [[Dolfi Trost]].

His first publications, including poems in French followed. He was the inventor of [[Surrealist techniques#Cubomania|cubomania]] and, with Dolfi Trost, the author of [[surautomatism|the statement "Dialectic of Dialectic"]] in 1945. Harassed in Romania and caught while trying to flee the country, the self-called ''étran-juif'' ("StranJew") finally left Romania in 1952, and moved to Paris through [[Israel]].

There he worked among others with [[Jean Arp]], [[Paul Celan]], François Di Dio and [[Max Ernst]], producing numerous [[collage]]s, drawings, objects, and text-installations. From 1967, his reading sessions took him to places like [[Stockholm]], [[Oslo]], [[Geneva]], [[New York City]], and [[San Francisco]]. The 1988 TV-portrait by Raoul Sanglas, ''Comment s'en sortir sans sortir'', made him famous for a larger readership.

In 1994, he was expelled from his apartment in Montmartre. Luca had spent forty years in France without papers and  could not cope. On February 9, at the age of 80, he committed suicide by jumping into the [[Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/016_01/3558|title=The Passive Vampire|last=Gammel|first=Irene|publisher=Bookforum|accessdate=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected works ==

Luca initially wrote most of his poetic works in his native Romanian. Two collections of these, ''Inventatorul Iubirii'' and ''Un lup văzut printr-o lupă,'' published in Bucharest in 1945, were translated into English (''The Inventor of Love and Other Works'') by Julian and Laura Semilian and published by Black Widow Press in 2009.

With the authorisation of éditions Corti, a forthcoming chapbook of his poems translated by [[Fiona Sze-Lorrain]] will be featured in "Poetry International", Issue no. 15, Spring 2010.

[[File:Asan gyanmala.jpg|thumb|Members of Annapurna Gyanmala Bhajan Khala singing hymns at [[Asan, Kathmandu]].]]
'''Gyānmālā Bhajan Khala''' ([[Devanagari]]: ज्ञानमाला भजन खल:) is a Nepalese hymn society formed in [[Kathmandu]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gellner| first = David N.| authorlink = | url = http://www.lumbini.org.uk/r_d.html |title = Gyanmala Bhajan (Devotional songs) | work = | publisher =Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK) | date=2008| accessdate =20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helped to raise awareness against the oppression of the [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]] (1846-1951), and is also a symbol of the movement for religious freedom in [[Nepal]]. 

Gyānmālā Bhajan Khala mostly performs [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] devotional songs. It is based in [[Swayambhu]], Kathmandu, and has chapters across the country and abroad.

==Early history==

Gyānmālā Bhajan Khala popularized the singing of [[bhajan]]s to the accompaniment of the [[harmonium]]. This style entered Nepal in the 1880s. The traditional devotional songs sung in the Kathmandu Valley are known as "dāpā" or "dāphā", and are accompanied by the "khin" (double-headed drums) and "tā" (small [[cymbals]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gellner| first = David N.| authorlink = | url = http://www.lumbini.org.uk/r_d.html |title = Gyanmala Bhajan (Devotional songs) | work = | publisher =Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK) | date=2008| accessdate =12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyānmālā Bhajan Khala was established in the face of state suppression against Buddhism and [[Nepal Bhasa]]. The Ranas were harsh against Buddhism and the language of the [[Newar]] people, and any religious or literary expression was quashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Nevārīgītīmañjarī| year = 1992| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| isbn = 978-81-208-0963-5| page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Gyānmālā Bhajan Khala were arrested for singing Buddhist hymns in Nepal Bhasa, and their hymn books confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pradhan | first = Bhuwan Lal | authorlink = | url =http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/jns/pdf/JNS_06.pdf |title = Jnanamala Bhajan Khalah| work = Journal of Newar Studies: Newah Vijnana | publisher = Oregon: International Nepal Bhasha Sevaa Samiti | date=1997| accessdate =19 February 2013}} Pages 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Grandin| first = Ingemar| title = Music and Media in Local Life Music Practice in a Newar Neighbourhood in Nepal| year = 1989| publisher = Linköping University| isbn = 9178704804| page = 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding of Gyānmālā Bhajan Khala coincided with the resurgence of [[Theravada Buddhism]] in Nepal in the 1930s. Newly ordained monks encouraged their followers to sing Buddhist hymns, and they published song books for them from [[India]] as it was illegal to do so in Nepal. Bhikshu Pragyabhivamsha published the first hymn book in [[Kushinagar]], and another monk [[Dhammalok Mahasthavir|Bhikshu Dhammalok]] brought hundreds of copies to Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pradhan | first = Bhuwan Lal | authorlink = | url =http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/jns/pdf/JNS_06.pdf |title = Jnanamala Bhajan Khalah| work = Journal of Newar Studies: Newah Vijnana | publisher = Oregon: International Nepal Bhasha Sevaa Samiti | date=1997| accessdate =19 February 2013}} Pages 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Dhammalok was later punished for his activities to promote Buddhism. In 1944, he and seven other monks were expelled from the country by the Rana regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maharjan|first=Phra Sujan|authorlink= |title=The Revival of Theravāda Buddhism and Its Contribution to Nepalese Society |url=http://www.mcu.ac.th/thesis_file/254951.pdf |accessdate= 16 April 2013|year=2549 BE |publisher=Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University |location=Bangkok, Thailand |isbn=974-364-509-8 |page=26 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As hymn singing became popular and a number of groups were formed, there was a move towards making the songs educational instead of keeping them purely devotional. So from 1943, the hymns and hymn groups were called Gyānmālā ("garland of wisdom").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gellner| first = David N.| authorlink = | url = http://www.lumbini.org.uk/r_d.html |title = Gyanmala Bhajan (Devotional songs) | work = | publisher =Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK) | date=2008| accessdate =17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police harassment==

The hymn singers had to suffer repeated police harassment for singing in Nepali Bhasa. They were also accused of converting [[Hindus]] to Buddhists. In 1944, members of Gyanmala singing Buddhist hymns led a procession from [[Swayambhu]] to Jana Baha in Kathmandu. The police stopped the procession and confiscated their song books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sarah E. LeVine|author2=David N. Gellner| title = Rebuilding Buddhism The Theravada Movement in Twentieth Century Nepal| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-674-01908-9| page = 124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another occasion in 1945, the police broke up a singing session at the rest house at Swayambhu where they usually held their recitals. They ransacked the place and took away all the hymn books they could find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mahaju| first = Sashi | url =http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75832163/Lumbini-journal-2008pmd |title = Gyanmala Bhajan Khalah Reaches West| work = Lumbini: Journal of the Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK) | publisher = | date=May 2008| accessdate =20 February 2013}} Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present times==

After the fall of the Ranas with the revolution of 1951, the group was formally organized and dedicated itself to recitation of hymns, preservation of the sacred site of Swayambhu and humanitarian work. In 1990, it was restructured as a national organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sarah E. LeVine|author2=David N. Gellner| title = Rebuilding Buddhism The Theravada Movement in Twentieth Century Nepal| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-674-01908-9| pages = 124-126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swayambhu Gyanmala Bhajan Khala is based in a rest house at Swayambhu. Recitals are held here in the morning on holidays and daily during the Buddhist holy month of [[Gunla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lewis| first = Todd T.| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:JAPb_sAK2UUJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8816/2723+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh9r3oBIyPmcAJBn1hacu0AnNvM6afGBlNAfuPm7tNLRceDLGzir-JXClg6UJsf6DE7aWRvAbgUdBNIeuwX_kLpb7cpsnT4eSZuBQg6O81zm6mLSbFeAnSo16RtH4LHPVXF58kU&amp;sig=AHIEtbTBvE6656upPxJB5L1Yl_GwQum0hQ |title = Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma | work =Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies | publisher = | date=Winter 1993| accessdate =19 February 2013}} Page 331.&lt;/ref&gt; It presently has 70 chapters nationwide and one each in [[Kalimpong]], India and [[London]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mahaju| first = Sashi | url =http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75832163/Lumbini-journal-2008pmd |title = Gyanmala Bhajan Khalah Reaches West| work = Lumbini: Journal of the Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK) | publisher = | date=May 2008| accessdate =20 February 2013}} Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heimia salicifolia''''' is a species of [[flowering plant]] in the [[Lythrum|Loosestrife]] family, [[Lythraceae]]. It is native to the [[Americas]], ranging from the [[southwestern United States]] ([[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]) through [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="GRIN"/&gt; Common names include '''shrubby yellowcrest''', '''sinicuichi''', '''sun opener''', '''willow-leaf heimia''', '''sini'''.  The plant has been used for shamanic purposes by native peoples in Central America and Mexico.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Spiritual use==

Use of ''H. salicifolia'' for shamanic purposes by native peoples of Central America and Mexico has been described.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the method of preparation commonly used, fresh leaves are collected and allowed to wilt. The leaves are put into a cup or jar, cool water is added, and the mixture is placed in the sun to brew and ferment for at least 24 hours. It is said that during the fermentation process, the knowledge of the sun is embedded into the potion, creating the "elixir of the sun."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

}}'''Joseph Peter de Fonseka''' (1897 - 1948) was a [[Sri Lanka]]n essayist and editor. His essays were noted for their trenchant humour and defence of [[Roman Catholic]] values, in the style of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]]. He was a friend and collaborator of the former.

Fonseka worked as a teacher of English in [[St. Joseph's College, Colombo|St. Joseph's Catholic College]], Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was then known), a school he had attended as a youth, when he captained the cricket team. He trained as a lawyer, but did not practice, preferring to teach and write.

==Chesterton==
In 1927 Fonseka moved to Britain, becoming a close friend of G. K. Chesterton. Fonseka edited the book ''G. K. C. as M. C.'', a collection of Chesterton's introductory essays to books by other authors.&lt;ref name = "ed"&gt;Edmund J. Cooray, "The Genius of Gilbert Keith Chesterton, A Review of "G. K. C. as M. C." edited by J. P. de Fonseka, ''Blue and White'' 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesterton paid tribute to Fonseka, whose "excess of enthusiasm has inspired this collection". Fonseka's own introduction was described as "running over with wit and wisdom" by one reviewer.&lt;ref name = "ed"/&gt;

Fonseka wrote essays on a variety of topics, including many on the culture and history of Ceylon. His essays also addressed aspects of Catholic belief and life. He occasionally published verse. He contributed regularly to Chesterton's magazine ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''.

In one ''G. K.'s Weekly'' essay, "The Plays of Mrs. Shakespeare", he proposed that Shakespeare's wife [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] was the real author of his works.&lt;ref name = "chur"&gt;R. C. Churchill, ''Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others'', Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; According to R. C. Churchill, Fonseka appears to present the case "that Mrs. Shakespeare wrote the plays at Stratford and her husband edited them for the stage."&lt;ref name = "chur"/&gt; However, Churchill is not clear whether or not the essay is intended as "burlesque" (it contains satirical references to [[Virginia Woolf]]'s feminist booklet ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', in which Shakespeare's sister is portrayed as an oppressed literary genius).

==Later life==
Fonseka returned to live in Ceylon and to work at St. Joseph's school. He also established a newspaper to promote [[Distributism]], the Catholic economic theory espoused by Chesterton and Belloc. According to Maisie Ward and Andrew Greeley the paper had "considerable effect" in both Ceylon and India.&lt;ref&gt;Maisie Ward, Andrew M. Greeley, ''Gilbert Keith Chesterton'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005, p.445.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he was given the honorary position of "Chamberlain of Honour of the Swords and Cape" by [[Pope Pius XII]], but was unable to leave Ceylon to officially receive the investment in Rome due to illness. He died in 1948.

==Influence as a teacher==
Fonseka was much praised for his inspiring teaching and dedication to his work. Among his pupils was the novelist [[Ambalavener Sivanandan]], who recalled that Fonseka "really stimulated me...De Fonseka gave me a taste for language: English sat on my tongue, I could taste it together with the Tamil I spoke at home."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=2812 A. Sivanandan, An Island Tragedy: Buddhist Ethnic Cleansing in Sri Lanka, ''New Left Review'' (Volume 60, Nov-Dec. 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentored the Sri Lankan artist and advertising mogul [[Reggie Candappa]], getting him his first work as an illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolanka.com/org/srilanka/people/70.htm Reggie Candappa: advertising life]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SantKukadaruSahebGrey.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Dastur Jamshed Ervad Sohrab Kukadaru|Dastur Jamshed Ervad Sohrab Kukadaru]]

'''Jamshedji Sorab Kukadaru ('''26 May 1831- 4 October 1900) was a [[Zoroastrian]] priest in [[Mumbai]], [[India]] revered by Zoroastrians for a number of miracles he is believed to have performed. He was well known by his contemporaries for his simple lifestyle and asceticism and unflinching adherence to priestly purity rules. Most of his life is said to have been spent in prayer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kukadaru was also an astrologer of some repute. He was renowned for his spirituality, in particular his healing and divination. He is also reported to have prophesied several events (including the death of certain people, including [[Queen Victoria|Empress Victoria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to orthographic differences between English and Gujarati he is also referred to as '''Dasturji Jamshedji Ervad Sohrabji Kookadaru Saheb''' and numerous other variations. [[Dastur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ji and [[Herbad|Ervad]] are both [[honorific titles]] relating to his position as a priest. Rather confusingly he has the title Dasturji and Ervad, which are different priestly 'ranks'. This is unprecedented, in his lifetime Kukadaru was only an Ervad a medium-level 'mere ritual priest'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; not befitting the title of Dastur which was granted after his death by the noted priest Jamasp-Asa at his Uthamna (Zoroastrian funeral prayers). The title [[Sahib|Saheb]] give to him is another honorific, translating as 'master', it is often used in the Indian Subcontinent in reference to 'spiritual masters' like the Sikh ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''''.''

==Lifestyle of Dasturji Kukadaru==
Kukadaru was born on 26 May 1831 in [[Surat]], [[Gujarat]], India. The day as per the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] was Yazdegerdi Mah (month) Ava, Roj (day) Zamyad. Kukadaru moved from [[Surat]] to the larger city of [[Bombay]], to work as the (priest) of Kapawala Agiary (Fire-Temple) at Nizam Street, Baharkot.

Kukadaru Saheb lived a simple life including washing his own clothes and eating only one meal a day which consisted of rice and [[ghee]]  (clarified butter). This meal woulf be cooked by keeping a vessel of rice in the rays of the sun and reciting sacred [[Avestan]] verses. He did not eat meat, and only consumed milk and fruits.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ervad Burjor H. Antia, Zarthoshti Anjuman Atash Bahram A Book celebrating the 100 years of its enshrinement, Anjuman Atash Bahram&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Miracle of the Gold Bar ==
[[Image:Anjuman Atash Behram.gif|thumb|right|alt=Anjuman Atash Behram in Mumbai, India, beneficiary of the Gold Bar Miracle of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb|Anjuman Atash Behram in Mumbai, India, beneficiary of the Gold Bar Miracle of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb]]
Several miracles were performed by Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb, and the most famous one was the Gold Bar miracle. Dasturji Saheb transformed an ordinary brick into a large bar of gold by praying the ancient Avestan prayers throughout the night. 
This was on request of the Zoroastrian devotees to cover a shortfall in the construction money for the Anjuman [[Atash Behram]] building at Dhobi Talao (Mumbai, India). The sum of [[Rupees]] 10,000 was raised by selling the transformed bar of gold, 
a handsome sum of money in the 19th century. Even today, an amazing lifelike portrait of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb is placed in the hall of the Atash Behram, and similar portraits of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb are placed in most of the Parsi Zoroastrian Atash Behrams and Agiaris (Fire Temples) in the Indian subcontinent. Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb also cured people of diseases by praying the Avestan scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion.
&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Posthomus fame in the 20th Century ==
Kukadaru died on 4 January 1900 on the Yazdegerdi calendar day Behram in the month of Fravardin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Stausberg and Ramiyar P. Karanjia, “Kukadaru, Jamshedji Sorab,” Encyclopaedia Iranica Online, June 23, 2008, available at www.iranicaonline.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years after Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb had died, Ervad Nadarsha Navroji Aibara who was a well-known priest of Cusrow Baug, [[Colaba]], (Mumbai, India) was responsible for rekindling the faith in Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb among the Parsi Zoroastrian community in India and overseas. Ervad Nadarsha Navroji Aibara was born in 1933, which was a number 
of years after Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb died. Ervad Aibara’s spiritual [[Guru]] (mentor) was Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb, and Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb’s spiritual Guru 
was the more ancient Dastur [[Azar Kayvan]] Bin Azar Gushasp Saheb.

== [[Mazagaon|Mazagon]] [[Navjote]]s ==
[[File:Kukkadaru saheb page.jpg|thumb|Mazgaon Navjotes, Parsi Prakash, Vol. 3, page 41.]]Dasturji Kukadaru was reported to have participated in the Mazgaon Navjotes. In 1882, a group of poor dock workers living and working in the [[Mazgaon Docks]] appealed to various priests and also petitioned the Bombay Parsi Panchayet (BPP) to be admitted as Parsi Zoroastrians, despite being born of mixed Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian parentage. Some 200 prominent Parsis collected funds and eminent priests (including Kukadaru and Jamaspji Minocherji,) performed the Navjote ceremony, in the presence of a large gathering on 26 June 1882. At the time it was said this act of generosity brought "prestige to the community"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Zoroastrianism.html?id=zJ3XAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Zoroastrianism: A Beleaguered Faith|last=Pangborn|first=Cyrus R.|date=1983|publisher=Advent Books|year=|isbn=9780898910063|location=|pages=94|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Eleven navjotes were performed of 4 males and 5 females, adults with ages ranging from 35 years to 77 years as well as two children. The two children of 5 and 2, were considered too young to undergo the ritual. It was understood that all of the initiates had male Parsi parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=R6oNt3M_yLgC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=mazagaon+navjote&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cV4kXz6dwp&amp;sig=Fy1j0fZoTs7acluaMIV-hp6p2Rc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi25a233IXZAhUJfMAKHYMaBoYQ6AEILjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mazagaon%20navjote&amp;f=false|title=The Parsis of India: Preservation of Identity in Bombay City|last=Palsetia|first=Jesse S.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004121145|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  event was duly reported in the [[Mumbai Samachar]], [[Jam-e-Jamshed]] and Parsi Prakash’. Reformists Parsis, including the plaintiffs in the case of [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit|''Petit'']] ''vs.  [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jeejeebhoy]]'' cite the events of the Mazagon Navjotes as evidence of universal acceptance in Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=W-f3sgEACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Argument+for+Acceptance+in+Zoroastrianism+Dr.+Kersey+H.+Antia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixv-fQ6IXZAhVHJ8AKHdg5DQMQ6AEIJzAA|title=The Argument for Acceptance in Zoroastrianism|last=Antia|first=Kersey H.|date=2012-09-03|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781466363335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nirang Prayers==
Ervad Aibara mentioned that over the years, the spiritual power of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb communicated with him regularly through his inner voice. Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb gave Ervad Aibara a number of nirangs (short prayers) and instructed him to give these nirangs to any person who came to him for help in difficulties. Many people benefited from these prayers in India as well as overseas, during the later half of the 20th century. The faith in Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb spread considerably due to the power of these prayers.

The '''Jewish Catacombs of Venosa''' are a set of [[catacombs]] located near the Italian city of [[Venosa]], [[Province of Potenza]], on Maddelena Hill. The exact date of construction for the catacombs is unknown, but it seems likely that they were built and used between the 4th and 6th centuries [[Common Era|C.E.]], and their existence has been known since the 19th century. The structure of the catacombs is simple, with two parallel tunnels connected by passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ḥa̱klîlî|first=Rāḥēl|title=Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Diaspora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKGpa-FJ3XsC&amp;pg=PA273|date=January 1, 1998|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-10878-5|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the names listed in the catacombs reflect the tendency of [[Jewish diaspora]] to take [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] names as opposed to names in [[Hebrew]], with only a small minority of the people buried there having names reflecting a Hebrew [[etymology]]. The earliest writing in the catacombs is usually in [[Koine Greek]], with Latin existing in the newer and deeper sections of the catacombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=William David|last2=Finkelstein|first2=Louis|last3=Katz|first3=Steven T.|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA499|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77248-8|pages=499–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is more Hebrew text in these catacombs than in the better known Jewish [[catacombs of Rome]]. Religious [[iconography]], such as the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], can be seen in the catacombs.

{{Jewish philosophy}}
'''Jewish ethics''' is the moral philosophy particular to one or both of the [[Ethics in religion|Jewish religion]] and peoples. Serving as a convergence of [[Judaism]] and the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical]] tradition of [[ethics]], the diverse literature of Jewish ethics's broad range of moral concern classifies it as a type of [[normative ethics]]. For two millennia, Jewish thought has focussed on the interplay of [[legal positivism|ethics with the rule of law]]. The tradition of [[rabbinic]] [[religious law]] - ''[[Halakhah]]'' - addresses several problems associated with ethics, including its semi-permeable relation with duties that are usually not punished under law.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

==Jewish ethical literature==

===Biblical and rabbinic ethical literature===
{{See also|Ethics in the Bible}}
In early [[rabbinic Judaism]], the [[Oral law|oral Torah]] both interpreted the Hebrew Bible and engaged in novel topics. Ethics is a key aspect of this legal literature, known as the literature of [[halakhah]].

The best known rabbinic text associated with ethics is the non-legal [[Mishnah]] [[Talmud|tractate]] of ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'' (“forefathers”), commonly translated as “Ethics of the Fathers”. Similar ethical teachings are found throughout more legally oriented portions of the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and other rabbinic literature. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as [[aggadah]]. This early rabbinic ethics shows signs of ideological and polemical exchange with the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Medieval ethical literature===
In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, [[Maimonides]] offers a Jewish interpretation of [[Aristotle]] (e.g., ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. [[Maimonides]], in turn, influences [[Thomas Aquinas]], a dominant figure in [[Christian ethics]] and the [[natural law]] tradition of moral theology. The relevance of [[natural law]] to medieval [[Jewish philosophy]] is a matter of dispute among scholars.

Medieval and early modern rabbis also created a pietistic tradition of Jewish ethics. This ethical tradition was given expression through [[musar literature]], which presents virtues and vices in a didactic, methodical way. The Hebrew term ''musar'', while literally derived from a word meaning "discipline" or "correction," is usually translated as ethics or morals.  Examples of medieval [[Musar literature]] include:

* ''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' ('Duties of the Heart') by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].
* ''Ma'alot ha-Middot'' by Yehiel ben Yekutiel Anav of Rome.
* ''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (The Ways of the Righteous) by an anonymous author.
* ''Kad ha-Kemah'' by Bahya ben Asher.

[[Halakhic]] (legal) writings of the Middle Ages are also important texts for Jewish ethics.  Important sources of Jewish ethical law include [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah]] (12th century) and [[Joseph Karo]] and [[Moses Isserles]]'s [[Shulkhan Arukh]] (16th century), especially the section of that code titled "[[Choshen Mishpat]]."  A wide array of topics on ethics are also discussed in medieval [[responsa]] literature.

===Modern ethical literature===
In the modern period, Jewish ethics sprouted many offshoots, partly due to developments in [[modern ethics]] and partly due to the formation of [[Jewish denominations]]. Trends in modern Jewish normative ethics include:

* The pietistic [[Musar Literature|musar]] tradition was continued by 18th-century rabbis such as [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in his book ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]''.  Other [[Musar Literature|musar]] writings were authored by [[Haskalah]] writers such as [[Naphtali Herz Wessely]] and [[Menachem Mendel Lefin]].
*The [[Musar Literature|musar]] tradition was revived by the Jewish ethics education movement known as the [[Musar Movement]] that developed in the 19th-century Orthodox Jewish European ([[Ashkenazi]]) community.
*The 19th- and early 20th-century [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement promoted the idea of Judaism as [[Ethical Monotheism]].  The writings of [[Abraham Geiger]] and [[Kaufmann Kohler]] show this approach.
*In the 20th and 21st centuries, liberal [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] rabbis have fostered novel approaches to Jewish ethics, for example in the writings of [[Eugene Borowitz]].  Some Reform rabbis have also engaged in [[applied ethics]] by writing legal [[responsa]].
*In 20th and 21st centuries, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis often engage in [[applied ethics]] by interpreting rabbinic law ([[Halakha]]) in [[responsa]] (formal opinions). A dominant topic has been bioethics.
*20th- and 21st-century rabbis in [[Conservative Judaism]] have also produced legal [[responsa]] on a wide range of topics.  Dominant topics have included [[bioethics]], sexual ethics, and [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/law/teshuvot_public.html |title=Committee on Jewish Law and Standards |publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] ethicists such as the philosopher and rabbi [[Elliot Dorff]] have also written extensively on [[moral theory]].
*Other modern Jewish philosophers have pursued a range of ethical approaches, with varying degrees of reliance upon traditional Jewish sources. Notably, [[Hermann Cohen]] authored ''Religion of Reason'' in the tradition of [[Kantian ethics]]. [[Martin Buber]] wrote on various ethical and social topics, including the dialogical ethics of his ''I and Thou''. [[Hans Jonas]], a student of [[Martin Heidegger]], draws upon [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] in his writings on bioethics, technology and responsibility. [[Emmanuel Levinas]] sought to distinguish his philosophical and Jewish writings; nevertheless, some scholars are constructing Jewish ethics around his innovative and deeply Jewish approach. [[Jewish feminism]] has used the principles of [[feminist ethics]] and also played a role in Jewish ethics.

Academic scholars of Judaism have also engaged in descriptive Jewish ethics, the study of Jewish moral practices and theory, which is situated more in the disciplines of history and the social sciences than in ''ethics'' proper (see Newman 1998).

In 2003, the [[Society of Jewish Ethics]] was founded as the academic organization "dedicated to the promotion of scholarly work in the field of Jewish ethics."  The Society promotes both normative research (the field of ethics proper) and descriptive (historical/social scientific) research.

==Central virtues and principles in Jewish ethics==

=== Major themes in biblical ethics ===
The writings attributed to the Biblical [[prophet]]s exhort all people to lead a righteous life. Kindness to the needy, benevolence, faith, compassion for the suffering, a peace-loving disposition, and a truly humble and contrite spirit, are the virtues which the Prophets hold up for emulation.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Civic loyalty, even to a foreign ruler, is urged as a duty (Jer. 29:7). "Learn to do good" is the keynote of the prophetic appeal (Isa. 1:17); thus the end-time will be one of peace and righteousness; war will be no more (Isa. 2:2 et seq.).

===Summaries of classical rabbinic ethics===
[[Hillel the Elder]]  formulated a version of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]: "What is hateful to you, do not do unto others." (Talmud, tracate Shabbat 31a; Midrash Avot de Rabbi Natan.)  [[Rabbi Akiva]], a 1st-century CE rabbi,  states "Whatever you hate to have done unto you, do not do to your neighbor; wherefore do not hurt him; do not speak ill of him; do not reveal his secrets to others; let his honor and his property be as dear to thee as thine own" (Midrash ''Avot deRabbi Natan''.)

[[Rabbi Akiva]] also declared the commandment "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" ([[Lev.]] xix.18) to be the greatest fundamental commandment of the Jewish doctrine (compare to [[Great Commandment]]); Ben Azzai, in reference to this, said that a still greater principle was found in the Scriptural verse, "This is the book of the generations of Adam [origin of man]. In the day that God created man [Adam], in the likeness of God made he him" ([[Gen.]] v.1; [[Sifra]], Ḳedoshim, iv; [[Yer.]] [[Ned.]] ix.41c; [[Gen. R.]] xxiv).

Rabbi Simlai taught "Six hundred and thirteen commandments were given to Moses; then David came and reduced them to eleven in Psalm 15.; Isaiah (33:15), to six; Micah (6:8), to three: 'To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God'; Isaiah again (56:1), to two: 'Maintain justice, and do what is right'; and Habakkuk (2:4), to one: 'The righteous person lives by his faithfulness'."

===Justice, truth, and peace===
Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel taught: "The world rests on three things: justice, truth, and peace" (Avot 1:18).

Justice ("din" corresponding to the Biblical "mishpat") being God's must be vindicated, whether the object be of great or small value (Sanh. 8a). "Let justice pierce the mountain" is the characteristic maxim attributed to [[Moses]] (Sanh. 6b). Stealing and oppression, even if only in holding back overnight the hired man's earnings, are forbidden.

Falsehood, flattery, perjury and false swearing are also forbidden.  The reputation of a fellow man is sacred (Ex. 21:1). Tale-bearing and unkind insinuations are proscribed, as is hatred of one's brother in one's heart (Lev. 19:17). A revengeful, relentless disposition is unethical; reverence for old age is inculcated; justice shall be done; right weight and just measure are demanded; poverty and riches shall not be regarded by the judge (Lev. 19:15, 18, 32, 36; Ex. 23:3).

[[Shalom]] ("peace"), is one of the underlying principles of the [[Torah]], as "her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom ('peace')."{{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:17|HE}}  The Talmud explains, "The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom".&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Gittin 59b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] comments in his [[Mishneh Torah]]: "Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Chanukah 4:14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loving-kindness and compassion===
{{main|Chesed|Jewish views on love}}
Simon the Just taught: "The world rests upon three things: Torah, service to God, and showing loving-kindness ([[chesed]])" (Pirkei Avot 1:2).  Loving-kindness is here the core ethical virtue.

Loving-kindness is closely linked with compassion in the tradition.  Lack of compassion marks a people as cruel (Jer. vi. 23). The repeated injunctions of the Law and the [[Prophet]]s that the widow, the orphan and the stranger should be protected show how deeply, it is argued, the feeling of compassion was rooted in the hearts of the righteous in [[ancient Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=699&amp;letter=C&amp;search=compassion The Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendship is also highly prized in the Talmud; the very word for "associate" is "friend" ("[[Chavruta#Quotes|chaver]]"). "Get thyself a companion" (Abot i. 6). "Companionship or death" (Ta'an. 23a).

Respect for one's fellow creatures is of such importance that Biblical prohibitions may be transgressed on its account (Ber. 19b). Especially do unclaimed dead require respectful burial (see Burial in Jewish Encyclopedia iii. 432b: "met miẓwah").

===Health and self-respect===
In addition to teaching caring for others, Jewish sources tend to teach that humans are duty bound to preserve their lives (Berachot 32b) and health. Foods dangerous to health are more to be guarded against than those ritually forbidden.  Jewish ethics denies self-abasement. "He who subjects himself to needless self-castigations and fasting, or even denies himself the enjoyment of wine, is a sinner" (Taanit 11a, 22b). People have to give account for every lawful enjoyment they refuse (Talmud Yer. Ḳid. iv. 66d).  A person should show self-respect in regard to both one's body, "honoring it as the image of God" (Hillel: Midrash Leviticus Rabbah 34), and one's garments (Talmud Shabbat 113b; Ned. 81a). According to Judaism, real life goes beyond the concept of breathing and having blood flow through our veins, it means existing with a purpose and connecting to God and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meaning of Am Yisrael Chai|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3769384,00.html|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=[[Ynet]]|date=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of applied Jewish ethics==

=== Business ethics ===
{{Main|Jewish business ethics}}
In the [[Torah]], there are more commandments concerning the kashrut (fitness) of one's money than the kashrut of food. These laws are developed and expanded upon in the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (particularly in Order [[Nezikin]]).  The Talmud denounces as fraud every mode of taking advantage of a man's ignorance, whether he be Jew or Gentile; every fraudulent dealing, every gain obtained by betting or gambling or by raising the price of breadstuffs through speculation, is theft (B. B. 90b; Sanh. 25b). The Talmud denounces advantages derived from loans of money or of victuals as usury; every breach of promise in commerce is a sin provoking God's punishment; every act of carelessness which exposes men or things to danger and damage is a culpable transgression.  There is a widely quoted tradition (Talmud Shabbat 31a) that in one's judgement in the next world, the first question asked is: "were you honest in business?"

Laws concerning business ethics are delineated in the major codes of Jewish law (e.g. [[Mishneh Torah]], 12th century; [[Shulhan Arukh]], particularly [[Choshen Mishpat]], 16th century). A wide array of topics on business ethics are discussed in the responsa literature. Business ethics received special emphasis in the teaching of Rabbi [[Yisrael Lipkin Salanter]] (19th century), founder of the [[Musar movement]] in Eastern Europe.  Enforcing laws regarding the proper treatment of workers in the food industry has been central to the efforts of [[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Hekhsher Tzedek]] commission and its 2008 approval of a [[responsum]] by Rabbi [[Jill Jacobs (rabbi)|Jill Jacobs]] which required paying workers in accordance with Jewish law and treating workers with dignity and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/358 |title=Dispatches from the Workplace: Rabbis for Worker Justice |publisher=Religiondispatches.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20052010/jacobs-living-wage.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127140236/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20052010/jacobs-living-wage.pdf |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charitable giving===
{{Main|Tzedakah}}
The Jewish idea of righteousness ("[[tzedaka]]h") gives the owner of property no right to withhold from the poor their share.  According to [[Maimonides]] in the [[Mishneh Torah]], the highest level of tzedakah is giving charity that will allow the poor to break out of the poverty cycle and become independent and productive members of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Tzedakah_Charity/History/Jewish_Tradition/Maimonides_Ladder.shtml Meir Tamari]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Matanot Aniyim (Laws about Giving to Poor People), Chapter 10:7-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Tzedakah may come in the form of giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need; so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.

Traditional Jews commonly practice "ma'aser kesafim," tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.  The Rabbis decreed (against Essene practice, and against advice given in the New Testament) that one should not give away much, most or all of their possessions. They did not expect a supernatural savior to come and take care of the poor, and so they held that one must not make oneself poor.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=499&amp;letter=E |title=ETHICS |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that nearly all Jews of their day were poor or middle-class (even the rich of that time were only rich relative to the poor), they ruled that one should not give away more than a fifth of his income to charity, while yet being obligated to give away no less than 10% of his income to charity.&lt;ref&gt;The Jerusalem Talmud Gemara to Tractate Pe'ah 1:1; Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 50a; Babylonian Talmud, Arakhin, 28a&lt;/ref&gt;

Many folios of the Talmud are devoted to encouragement in giving charity (see, for example, B.B. 9b-11a; A.Z. 17b; Pes. 8a; Rosh. 4a), and this topic is the focus of many religious books and rabbinic responsa.

===Ethics of speech===
{{Main|Lashon hara}}
Evil-speaking is a sin regarded with intense aversion both in the Bible and in rabbinical literature. The technical term for it in the latter is [[lashon hara]], "the evil tongue."  In the Bible the equivalent words are: dibbah, meaning "talk" in a sinister sense; rakhil, the "merchandise" of gossip with which the talebearer goes about; and ragal, a verb, denoting the "peddling" of slander. As these words indicate, that which is condemned as [[lashon hara]] denotes all the deliberate or malicious accusations, or even the exposure of truthful information which has the purpose of injuring one's neighbor, that is, calumny proper, and also the idle but mischievous chatter which is equally forbidden, though it is not slander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=C |title=Calumny |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rabbi in the [[Talmud]] opines that putting one's fellow man to shame is in the same category as murder (B. M. 58b), and brands as calumny the spreading of evil reports, even when true.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Also forbidden is listening to slanderous gossip, or the causing of suspicion, or the provoking of unfavorable remarks about a neighbor.

===Jewish family ethics===
{{Main|Honor your father and your mother}}

The Jewish tradition gives great stress to reverence for parents. More [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] forms of Judaism view the father as the head of the family, while seeing the mother as entitled to honor and respect at the hands of sons and daughters. More liberal Jews view the mother and father as equal in all things.

The [[family]] plays a central role in Judaism, both socially and in transmitting the traditions of the religion. To honour one's father and mother is one of the [[Ten Commandments]]. Jewish families try to have close, respectful family relationships, with care for both the elderly and young. Religious observance is an integral part of home life, including the weekly [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and keeping kosher dietary laws. The [[Talmud]] tells parents to teach their children a trade and survival skills, and children are asked to look after their parents.

===Marriage and sexual relations===
{{Main|Jewish views on marriage|Judaism and sexuality|LGBT topics and Judaism}}

[[Jewish views of marriage|Marriage]] is called ''kiddushin'', or 'making holy'. To set up a family home is to take part in an institution imbued with holiness.  [[Monogamy]] is the ideal (Gen. ii. 24). Celibacy is regarded as contrary to the injunction to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 2:18 and Isaiah 45:18).  According to the [[Talmud]] and [[midrash]], man is enjoined to take a wife and obtain posterity (Yeb. 63b; Mek., Yitro, 8). "He who lives without a wife lives without joy and blessing, without protection and peace"; he is "not a complete man" (Yeb. 62a, 63a), and for it he has to give reckoning at the great Judgement Day (Shab. 31a).

Sex is not considered acceptable outside marriage, but it is an important part of the love and care shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the [[mikveh]] (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Adultery]] and [[incestual]] relationships (Leviticus 18:6–23) are prohibited. [[Orthodox Jews]] view male homosexuality as explicitly prohibited by the Torah, but other Jews view various forms of homosexual behavior or all forms of homosexual behavior as permitted by the tradition.

===Medical ethics and bioethics===
{{Main|Jewish medical ethics}}
[[Jewish medical ethics]] is one of the major spheres of contemporary Jewish ethics. Beginning primarily as an [[applied ethics]] based on [[halakhah]], more recently it has broadened to [[bioethics]], weaving together issues in [[biology]], [[science]], [[medicine]] and [[ethics]], [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. Jewish bioethicists are usually rabbis who have been trained in medical science and philosophy, but may also be experts in medicine and ethics who have received training in Jewish texts. The goal of Jewish medical ethics and bioethics is to use [[halakha|Jewish law and tradition]] and Jewish ethical thought to determine which medical treatments or technological innovations are moral, when treatments may or may not be used, etc.

===Political governance===
{{Main|Judaism and politics}}
The ethics of proper governance is the subject of much contention among Jews.  Various models of political authority are developed in the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[rabbinic literature]], and later Jewish literature.  Many prominent Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], see monarchy as a moral ideal, while others, such as [[Abravanel]], disparage the model of monarchy.  Modern Jews have championed a variety of [[Jewish political movements]], often based on their conceptions of Jewish ethics.

===Ethics of warfare===
{{see also|Judaism and war|Judaism and peace}}
Jewish war ethics are developed by Maimonides in his "Laws of Kings and their Wars," part of his [[Mishneh Torah]].  Modern Jewish war ethics have been developed especially in relationship to the Israeli military's doctrine of [[Purity of arms]].

===Capital punishment===
{{Main|Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism}}
The Talmud approves of the death penalty in principle but the standard of proof required for application of death penalty is extremely stringent, so that situations in which a death sentence could be passed are effectively impossible.

===Relationship to non-Jews===
The non-Jew is within the covenant of ethical considerations (Ex. xxii. 20; Lev. xix. 33). "You shall love him as yourself," a law the phraseology of which is taken to  show that in the preceding verse "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Lev. xix. 18) "neighbor" does not connote a Jew exclusively. There was to be one law for the native and the stranger (Lev. xix. 34; comp. Ex. xii. 49).

The exhortation, 'Remember the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt' (Deuteronomy 10:19), is considered important in Judaism.  During Passover, Jews are expected to show hospitality to all, and to consider the needs and feelings of anyone who may be marginalized, for whatever reason. According to the Hebrew Bible, the slaves of Jewish people had special rights that preserved their dignity as equal human beings, allowed them freedoms, and forbade mistreatment.

Non-Jews are to have a share in all the benevolent work of a township which appeals to human sympathy and on which the maintenance of peace among men depends, such as supporting the poor, burying the dead, comforting the mourners, and visiting the sick (Tosefta Giṭtin, v. 4-5; Babylonian Talmud, Giṭtin 64a).

Most Jews do not actively seek to convert non-Jews to Judaism; in fact conversion to Judaism can be a lengthy and difficult process. They cannot actively approve of religions that appear to promote idolatry or immorality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Jews believe that non-Jews who follow the [[Noachide]] code, the minimum ethical and religious requirements for all non-Jews, will be equally recognized by God. The laws of the Noachide code are: do not engage in idolatry; do not engage in blasphemy; do not murder; do not steal; do not commit acts of sexual immorality; do not cause excessive pain to animals (e.g. eating a limb torn from a living animal); and establish courts of justice.

The principle of [[Kiddush Hashem]] requires Jews to conduct themselves in every way as to prevent the name of God from being dishonored by non-Israelites.  The greatest sin of fraud, therefore, is that committed against a non-Israelite, because it may lead to the reviling of God's name. A desire to sanctify the name of God may help to motivate some Jews to treat adherents of other creeds with the utmost fairness and equity.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

===Treatment of animals===
{{See also|Tza'ar ba'alei chayim|Jewish vegetarianism}}
According to Jewish tradition, [[animal]]s have a right to be treated well, even ones that might belong to one's enemy (Ex. 23:4).  The Biblical commands regarding the treatment of the brute (Ex. xx. 10; Lev. xxii. 28; Deut. xxv. 4; Prov. xii. 10) are amplified in rabbinical ethics, and a special term is coined for the prohibition on causing suffering to animals ("[[tza'ar ba'alei hayyim]]"). Not to sit down to the table before the domestic animals have been fed is a lesson derived from Deut. xi. 15. Compassion for the brute is declared to have been the merit of [[Moses]] which made him the shepherd of his people (Exodus Rabbah 2), while [[Judah ha-Nasi]] saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf.

Consideration for animals is an important part of Judaism. It is part of the Noachide code. Resting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before they sit down to eat. At harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work. All animals must be kept in adequate conditions. Sports like bullfighting are forbidden. Animals may be eaten as long as they are killed using  [[shechitah]], a method where the animal has its throat cut using a specially sharpened knife. Jewish butchers are trained in this method which must meet the requirements of [[kashrut]].

Enforcing laws regarding the treatment of animals in the certification of food products has been part of the effort of [[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Hekhsher Tzedek]] commission.

In modern times, a [[Jewish vegetarianism|Jewish vegetarian]] movement has emerged, led in part by Jews who believe that Jewish ethics demands vegetarianism or veganism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Vegan'', ed. Rabbi Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental ethics===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}
The [[Book of Genesis]] 1:26 indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis 2:15 emphasizes that people were put in the world to maintain it and care for it. The Talmud teaches the principle of [[Bal tashkhit]], which some take to mean that wasting or destroying anything on earth is wrong.  Many take the view that pollution is an insult to the created world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care for God's creation. However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is paramount. Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have to take account of the well-being of humans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Trees and other things of value also come within the scope of rabbinical ethics, as their destruction is prohibited, according to Deut. xx. 19 (Talmud, tracate Shabbat 105b, 129a, 140b, et al.).  In modern times, a [[Judaism and environmentalism|Jewish environmentalist]] movement has emerged.

{{distinguish|Georg Faust}}
[[File:Dreifacher Höllenzwang.jpg|thumb|Title page of one of the ''Höllenzwang'' grimoires attributed to ''D. Faustus Magus Maximus Kundlingensis'' (18th century)]]
'''Johann Georg Faust''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aʊ|s|t}}; c. 1480 or 1466 &amp;ndash; c. 1541), also known in English as '''John Faustus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔː|s|t|ə|s}}, was an itinerant [[alchemy|alchemist]], [[astrologer]] and [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] of the [[German Renaissance]].

''Doctor Faust'' became the subject of  [[Faust|folk legend]] in the decades after his death, transmitted in  [[Volksbuch|chapbooks]] beginning in the 1580s, and was notably adapted by [[Christopher Marlowe]] in his play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus]]'' (1604). The ''[[Faustbuch]]'' tradition survived throughout the [[early modern period]], and the legend was again adapted in  [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s [[closet drama]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808), and [[Hector Berlioz]]'s musical composition ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'' (premiered 1846).

==Historical Faust==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
Because of his early treatment as a figure in legend and literature, it is very difficult to establish historical facts about his life with any certainty.  In the 17th century, it was even doubted that there ever had been a historical Faust, and the legendary character was identified with a printer of Mainz called ''[[Johann Fust]]''. [[Johann Georg Neumann]] in 1683 addressed the question in his ''Disquisitio historica de Fausto praestigiatore'', establishing Faust's historical existence based on contemporary references.

In the light of records of an activity spanning more than 30 years, the two suggested birth years (1466 vs. 1480/1), the two recorded first names (Georg vs. Johann) and the two recorded places of origin (Knittlingen vs. Heidelberg/Helmstett), it has been suggested{{by whom|date=July 2017}} that there were two itinerant magicians calling themselves ''Faustus'', one Georg, active ca. 1505 to 1515, and another Johann, active in the 1530s.

Possible places of origin of the historical Johann Faust are [[Knittlingen]] (Manlius 1562), [[Helmstadt-Bargen|Helmstadt]] near [[Heidelberg]], or [[Stadtroda|Roda]]. Knittlingen today has an archive and a museum dedicated to Faust.  Baron (1978)&lt;ref name = "Baron 1978"&gt;{{citation | first = Frank | last = Baron | title = Doctor Faustus: From History to Legend | publisher = Wilhelm Fink Verlag | year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leo Ruickbie|Ruickbie]] (2009)&lt;ref name="Leo Ruickbie 2009 p. 26-7"&gt;{{citation | first = Leo | last = Ruickbie | title = Faustus: The Life and Times of a Renaissance Magician | publisher = [[The History Press]] | year = 2009 | pages = 26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue for Helmstadt as his place of birth.

Faust's year of birth is given either as 1480/1 or as 1466. Baron (1992) and Ruickbie&lt;ref name= "Leo Ruickbie 2009 p. 26-7" /&gt; prefer the latter. The city archive of [[Ingolstadt]] has a letter dated 27 June 1528 which mentions a ''Doctor Jörg Faustus von Haidlberg''. Other sources have ''Georgius Faustus Helmstet(ensis)''. Baron, searching for students from Helmstet in the archives of [[Heidelberg University]], found records of a ''Georgius Helmstetter'' inscribed from 1483 to 1487.   He was promoted to [[baccalaureus]] on 12 July 1484 and to [[magister artium]] on 1 March 1487.

The first editions of ''Doctor Faustens dreyfacher Höllenzwang'' were printed in Rome in the year 1501.

For the year 1506, there is a record of Faust appearing as performer of magical tricks and horoscopes in [[Gelnhausen]]. Over the following 30 years, there are numerous similar records spread over southern Germany. Faust appeared as physician, doctor of philosophy, alchemist, magician and astrologer, and was often accused as a fraud. The church denounced him as a blasphemer in league with the devil.

[[Johannes Trithemius]] in a letter to [[Johannes Virdung]] dated 20 August 1507 warns the latter of a certain ''Georgius Sabellicus'', a trickster and fraud styling himself ''Georgius Sabellicus, Faustus junior, fons necromanticorum, astrologus, magus secundus etc.'' According to Trithemius, in Gelnhausen and Würzburg, Sabellicus boasted blasphemously of his powers, even claiming that he could easily reproduce all the miracles of Christ. Trithemius alleges that Sabellicus received a teaching position in [[Sickingen]] in 1507, which he abused by indulging in sodomy with his male students, evading punishment by a timely escape.&lt;ref&gt;Engel (1885), [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_v-tXAAAAYAAJ#page/n17/mode/2up pp. 2-4].&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad [[Mutianus Rufus]] in 1513 recounts a meeting with a ''chiromanticus'' called ''Georgius Faustus, Helmitheus Heidelbergensis'' (likely for ''hemitheus'', "demigod of Heidelberg"), overhearing his vain and foolish boasts in an [[Erfurt]] inn.

On 23 February 1520, Faust was in [[Bamberg]], doing a horoscope for the bishop and the town, for which he received the sum of 10 [[Goldgulden|gulden]].&lt;ref name = "Baron 1978" /&gt;{{rp |42}}

In 1528, Faust visited [[Ingolstadt]], whence he was banished shortly after. In 1532 he seems to have tried to enter Nürnberg, according to an unflattering note made by the junior mayor of the city to "deny free passage to the great [[nigromancy|nigromancer]] and sodomite Doctor Faustus" (''Doctor Faustus, dem großen Sodomiten und Nigromantico in furt glait ablainen''). 
Later records give a more positive verdict; thus the [[Tübingen]] professor [[Joachim Camerarius]] in 1536 recognises Faust as a respectable astrologer, and physician [[Philipp Begardi]] of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 1539 praises his medical knowledge.
The last direct attestation of Faust dates to 25 June 1535, when his presence was recorded in [[Münster]] during the [[Münster Rebellion|Anabaptist rebellion]].

Faust's death is dated to 1540 or 1541.  He allegedly died in an explosion of an alchemical experiment in the "Hotel zum Löwen" in [[Staufen im Breisgau]]. His body is reported to have been found in a "grievously mutilated" state which was interpreted to the effect that the devil had come to collect him in person by his clerical and scholarly enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/staufen/mythische-orte-ein-toedlicher-pakt--5369881.html|title=Staufen|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1548, the theologian [[Johann Gast]] in his ''sermones conviviales'' states that Faust had suffered a dreadful death, and would keep turning his face to the earth in spite of the body being turned on its back several times.  
In his 1548 account, Gast also mentions a personal meeting with Faust in [[Basel]] during which Faust provided the cook with poultry of a strange kind. According to Gast, Faust travelled with a dog and a horse, and there were rumours that the dog would sometimes transform into a servant.

Another posthumous account is that of [[Johannes Manlius]], drawing on notes by [[Melanchthon]], in his ''Locorum communium collectanea'' dating to 1562. According to Manlius, ''Johannes Faustus'' was a personal acquaintance of Melanchthon's and had studied in [[Kraków]]. Manlius' account is already suffused with legendary elements, and cannot be taken at face value as a historical source. Manlius recounts that Faust had boasted that the victories of the German emperor in Italy were due to his magical intervention. In Venice, he allegedly attempted to fly, but was thrown to the ground by the devil. [[Johannes Wier]] in ''de prestigiis daemonum'' (1568) recounts that Faustus had been arrested in [[Batenburg]] because he had recommended that the local chaplain called Dorstenius should use [[arsenic]] to get rid of his stubble. Dorstenius smeared his face with the poison, upon which he lost not only his beard but also much of his skin, an anecdote Wier says he heard from the victim himself. [[Philipp Camerarius]] in 1602 still claims to have heard tales of Faust directly from people who had met him in person, but from the publication of the 1587 ''[[Faustbuch]]'', it becomes impossible to separate historical anecdotes from rumour and legend.

The town of [[Bad Kreuznach]] has a "Faust Haus" restaurant reportedly built in 1492&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magister Faust Haus|url=https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g198635-d2203705-Reviews-Magister_Faust_Haus-Bad_Kreuznach_Rhineland_Palatinate.html|website=TripAdvisor|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of "the home of the legendary Magister Johann Georg Sabellicus Faust".

===Ascribed works===
[[File:Mephistophiles Passau 1527.jpg|thumb|Page of ''Praxis Magia Faustiana'' ("1527")]]
There are several prints of [[grimoire]]s or magical texts attributed to Faust. 
Some of them are artificially dated to his lifetime, either to "1540", or to "1501", "1510", etc., 
some even to unreasonably early dates, such as "1405" and "1469".
The prints in fact date to the late 16th century, from ca. 1580, i.e. the same period of the development of the ''Volksbuch'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Engel (1885) is aware of fifteen prints (no. 335-349, pp. 154-157) dated between 1501 and 1540. Engel's no. 334 (''Dr. Johann Faustus Miracul- Kunst- und Wunder-Buch'', reprinted in ''Kloster'' vol. 2, 852-897) is dated MCDXXXXXXIX, i.e. 1469.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Höllenzwang'' text is also extant in manuscript versions from the late 16th century.
A manuscript of c. 1700 under the title ''Doctoris Johannis Fausti Morenstern practicirter Höllenzwang genant Der schwarze Mohr. Ann(o) MCCCCVII'' (i.e. "1407") includes the text which in print is known as ''Dr. Faustens sogenannter schwartzer Mohren-Stern, gedruckt zu London 1510''. 
Variants of the ''Höllenzwang'' attributed to Faust continued to be published for the next 200 years, well into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;þ [http://www.rarebookhub.com/auction_lot_books/3828206?key=de4c04448f109610eddabf37790e7a0b8dc84a84 Zisska and Lacher, lot nr. 67, auction of 9&amp;ndash;11 November  2016 (sold for EUR 2750)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faust in legend and literature==
{{Main|Faust|Faustbuch}}
[[Image:VolksbuchFaust-portada.jpg|thumb|Title page of a 1588 edition of the ''Faustbuch''.]]

The ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (chapbook)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]'' printed by [[Johann Spies]] 1587, a German [[chapbook]] about Faust's sins, is at the beginning of the literary tradition of the [[Faust]] character. It was translated into [[English language|English]] in 1587, where it came to the attention of [[Christopher Marlowe]]. Marlowe's [[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]] of 1589 portrays Faust as the archetypical adept of [[Renaissance magic]].  In the 17th century, Marlowe's work was re-introduced to Germany in the form of popular plays, which over time reduced Faust to a merely comical figure for popular amusement. Meanwhile, the chapbook of Spies was edited and excerpted by G. R. Widmann and Nikolaus Pfitzer, and was finally re-published anonymously in modernised form in the early 18th century, as the ''Faustbuch des Christlich Meynenden''. This edition became widely known and was also read by [[Goethe]] in his youth. As summarized by Richard Stecher, this version is the account of a young man called ''Johann Faust'', son of a peasant, who studies theology in [[Wittenberg]], besides medicine, astrology and "other magical arts". His boundless desire for knowledge leads him to conjure the devil in a wood near Wittenberg, who appears in the shape of a [[greyfriar]] who calls himself  ''[[Mephistopheles]]''.

Faust enters a pact with the devil, pledging his soul in exchange for 24 years of service. The devil produces a [[wikt:famulus|famulus]] ''Christoph Wagner'' and a poodle ''Prästigiar'' to accompany Faust in his adventure. Faust goes on to live a life of pleasures. In [[Leipzig]], he rides out of [[Auerbachs Keller]] on a barrel. In [[Erfurt]] he taps wine from a table. He visits the Pope in Rome, the Sultan in Constantinople and the Kaiser in Innsbruck. After 16 years, he begins to regret his pact and wants to withdraw, but the devil persuades him to renew it, conjuring up [[Helen of Troy]], with whom Faust sires a son called Justus.  As the 24 years are over, "[[Satan]], chief of devils" appears and announces Faust's death for the coming night. Faust at a "last supper" scene in  [[Rimlich]] takes leave of his friends and admonishes them to repentance and piety. At midnight, there is a great noise from Faust's room, and in the morning, its walls and floors are found splattered with blood and brains, with Faust's eyes lying on the floor and his dead body in the courtyard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5586">{{Tenrikyo sidebar}}
In [[Tenrikyo]], the '''Joyous Life''' (''yōki yusan'' or ''yōki gurashi'') is the ideal taught by spiritual leaders and pursued through charity and abstention from greed, selfishness, hatred, anger and arrogance. [[Tenrikyo theology|Theologically]], the Joyous Life functions as the [[Meaning of life|purpose of human existence]] preordained by [[God in Tenrikyo|God]] during the [[Tenrikyo creation narrative|creation of human beings]] and as the means for the [[salvation]] of humankind.

==Etymology==
The term "Joyous Life" refers to several related terms that appear in Tenrikyo scriptures and historical documents in the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. In the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'', the term is written as ''yōki yusan'' (よふきゆさん&lt;!-- yes, it is ふ instead of う --&gt;), while in the ''[[Osashizu]],'' it is written as ''yōki asobi'' (陽気遊び) and ''yōki gurashi'' (陽気ぐらし). Early outlines of the Tenrikyo teachings use the terms ''yōkinaru yusan asobi'' (よふきなるゆさんあすび&lt;!-- yes, it is す instead of そ --&gt;) and ''yōki yusan'' (陽気遊参).{{sfn|Ishizaki|1986|p=368}}

The characters that make up ''yōki yusan/gurashi'' are as follows:

* ''Yō'' (陽) is "positive", the same character as ''Yang'' in the Chinese [[Yin and Yang]].
* ''Ki'' (気) is "spirit" or "energy", the same character as [[Qi]] in Chinese.
* ''Yusan'' (遊山) is "an outing to the mountain or fields" (lit. excursion), implying an outgoing life.
* ''Gurashi'' (暮) is "livelihood", implying life in a more day-to-day sense.

==History==
{{empty section|date=April 2018}}

==Theology==
===Creation===
{{Main article|Tenrikyo creation narrative}}
At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of ''original causality'', or ''causality of origin'' (''moto no innen'' もとのいんねん), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a [[teleological]] element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.{{sfn|Kisala|1994|p=77}}

===Salvation===
The Joyous Life is understood as the salvific state which individuals can work toward through prayer (i.e. [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]], ''[[Sazuke]]'') and practice in [[everyday life]] (i.e. ''tannō,'' ''hinokishin'').

====''Tannō''====
''Tannō'' (たんのう), or "joyous acceptance," is the spiritual practice of the Joyous Life. It is the state of mind which accepts all occurrences in one's daily life positively and as the intention of God, including hardships.{{sfn|Higashibaba|2016|pp=42–3}}

====''Hinokishin''====
''Hinokishin'' (ひのきしん), or "daily contribution," is the physical practice of the Joyous Life. It is an expression of joy and gratitude that materializes in the world through service for one's community or surroundings.{{sfn|Higashibaba|2016|p=43}}

===Eschatology===
Tenrikyo doctrine and tradition assert the spiritual maturity of humankind will gradually improve over many rebirths and countless millennia, and by so doing will grow in more joy and bliss and will get closer to the world of the Joyous Life. It is said that when the hearts of humankind have been adequately purified, God will inaugurate the world of the Joyous Life by bestowing a sweet dew on the basin to be placed on top of the ''[[Kanrodai]],'' which when consumed, will allow people to live the full lifespan of 115 years without illness or misfortune, and die painlessly to be reborn. Therefore Tenrikyo [[eschatology]] maintains a [[Progress (history)|progressive]] and a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] outlook on the future of humankind.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=92}}

'''Kudalasangama'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vishwagurubasavanna.com/KudalaSangama.aspx|title=Kudala Sangama|accessdate=2008-09-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323024231/http://vishwagurubasavanna.com/KudalaSangama.aspx|archivedate=2010-03-23|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also written as '''Kudala Sangama''') in [[India]] is an important centre of pilgrimage for [[Lingayats]]. It is located about {{convert|15|km}} from the [[Almatti Dam]] in [[Bagalkot district]] of [[Karnataka]] state. The [[Krishna river|Krishna]] and [[Malaprabha River]] rivers merge here and flow east towards Srisaila (another pilgrim center) [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The ''Aikya Mantapa'' or the holy ''[[Samādhi]]'' of [[Basavanna]], the founder of the Lingayat sect of Hindu religion along with [[Linga]], which is believed to be self-born (''[[Swayambhu]]''), is here. The Kudala Sangama Development Board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpal.kar.nic.in/pdf_files/37%20of%201994%20%28E%29.pdf|title=THE KUDALA SANGAMA DEVELOPMENT BOARD ACT, 1994. arrangement of sections|publisher=|accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes care of the maintenance and development.

==Tourism==
The main attractions in and around Kudala Sangama are:
* The Sangamanatha Temple in [[Chalukya]] style
* The Aikya Linga of Basaveshwara
* The Mahamane Campus of the Basava Dharma Peetha
* The Poojavana, a mini forest with neat paths amidst the trees.
* The Sabha Bhavana. Colossal, it is a spacious auditorium with a seating capacity for 6,000. The exquisite doorways on the four sides - named after Gangambike, Nilambike, Channabasavanna and Akka Nagamma - surround the huge grey dome in the centre.
* The Basava Gopura. Tall, it is slated to house the Basava International Centre. The {{convert|200|ft}} high symmetrical tower is imposing.
* Museum. The Ashrama, meant for visitors to stay, also has a museum with a collection of sculptures related to Basavanna and the history of Karnataka state.

==History==
An inscription in the temple of AD 1213 records a gift to the god Acheshvara. Another stone record of AD 1160 refers to land grant to deities, Kaleshvara and Achesvara.

It is believed that in the 12th century Jathaveda Muni Sarangamath had set up an education centre here and Basaveshvara, Channabasavanna and Akkanagamma were students. Basaveshvara spent his boyhood here and, after his return from Kalyana, he is said to have become one with the God at this place. The vachanas composed by him are dedicated to the presiding deity here, Sangamanatha.

==Location and architecture==
[[File:Kudala Sangama.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Kudala sangama]] in [[Bagalkot district]], where Guru [[Basavanna]]'s samadhi is located.]]
The place is a village about {{convert|19|km}} from Hungund. Close by is the holy pilgrim centre and the renowned temple of Sangameshwara, on the river bank, at the confluence of the Krishna and the Malaprabha rivers. Formerly it was known as Kappadi sangama where Basaveshwara’s teacher Ishanaguru lived.

The temple consists of a porch, navaranga and the main shrine. The idols of Basaveshvara, Neelamma, Nandi and Ganapathi have been placed in the navaranga. The door frame of the garbhagriha is richly carved with floral designs and animal figures. In the shrine is the linga famed as Sangameshvara or Sangamanatha.

In front of the temple, in the midst of the river, is a small stone mantapa with a Shivalinga in it, and lofty cement concrete dry well has been built around it to protect it from submersion.

On the east, across the river Krishna, stands the Neelamma’s temple. She was the consort of Basaveshvara. Here also a high cement concrete dry well has been built around the structure to protect it from the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Karnataka State Gazetteer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vishwaguru Basavanna==
[[File:Linga above.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Iykya linga]] seen from above.]]
Vishwaguru ('universal teacher') Basavanna is the famous prophet and social reformer who was born in Bagewadi ([[Basavana Bagewadi]]), a small village in [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur District]], in [[North Karnataka]], also called Ingaleshwara Bagewadi. Agrahara was an important place in town. The house of Madiraja the chief of the township was situated here. Basaveshwara&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vishwagurubasavanna.com/LifeOfBasava.aspx|title=Birth Of Lord Basavanna|accessdate=2008-09-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323024040/http://vishwagurubasavanna.com/LifeOfBasava.aspx|archivedate=2010-03-23|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born to Madiraja and Madambike on third day of Vyshakha month of Anandanama year in Rohini star, according to the Hindu calendar (the year coincides with AD 1134). Basavanna was a great saint; he is considered [[Guru]] by some and some believe in him as an incarnation of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], [[Lord Shiva]]'s greatest devotee.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} A true visionary of his time and a revolutionary who started Lingayat sect. Basavanna's ultimate aim was to make this fundamental right available to each and everyone. Basavanna, keeping welfare as the ultimate aim, expedited programmes to take religion to the people by preaching and writing religious literature in [[Kannada]]. His samadhi is at Kudalasangama.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13197">{{History of al-Andalus}}
'''''La Convivencia''''' ({{IPA-es|la kombiˈβenθja|lang}}, "The Coexistence") is an academic hypothesis regarding the period of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]] from the [[Muslim]] [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the early eighth century until the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Edict of Expulsion|expulsion of the Jews]] in 1492. It claims that in the different [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Iberian kingdoms]],   the [[Moors|Muslims]], [[Catholic Church|Christians]] and [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews]] lived in relative peace. According to this interpretation of history, this period of religious diversity differs from later Spanish and Portuguese history when Catholicism became the sole religion in the Iberian Peninsula, as a result of expulsions and forced conversions.

However, the historicity of the above view of the supposed intercultural harmony has also been challenged as a "myth", with the argument that it is too strongly dependent on unreliable documentation.&lt;ref name="DassMyth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dass|first1=Nirmal|title=Review of The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise: Muslims, Christians, and Jews Under Islamic Rule in Medieval Spain|url=http://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/history/andalusia-or-the-legend-of-islamic-spain|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Qurtuba"&gt;[http://www.awraq.es/blob.aspx?idx=5&amp;nId=96&amp;hash=ac20943d589408c5a0a3cd2c1e0908a4], Qurtuba:  Algunas reflexiones críticas sobre el califato de Córdoba y el mito de la convivencia [Qurtuba:  Some Critical Reflections on the Caliphate of Cordova and the Convivencia Myth], by Eduardo Manzano Moreno, Awraq n.° 7. 2013, pp 226-246&lt;/ref&gt; “Contemporary ecumenist appeal to the ‘Golden Age’ of tolerance" in the 10th and 11th centuries in [[Córdoba, Andalusia]], Spain under Muslim rule, but, for the most part, they are not interested in what actually happened among the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Rather, they describe it as ‘tolerance,’ a word “that would have had little or no meaning at that time.”&lt;ref&gt;Aaron W. Hughes, ''Abrahamic Religions: On the Uses and Abuses of History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural meaning==
''La Convivencia'' often refers to the interplay of cultural ideas between the three religious groups and ideas of [[religious tolerance]]. [[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] invokes this concept and indicates that it played an important role in bringing the classics of Greek philosophy to Europe, with translations from Greek to Arabic to Hebrew and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James (2001), ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews'', Chapter 33. Houghton Mifflin, Co., Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerrilynn Dodds references this concept in the spatial orientation seen in architecture that draws on building styles seen in synagogues and mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/213407379|title=The arts of intimacy : Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the making of Castilian culture|last=Denise.|first=Dodds, Jerrilynn|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Menocal, Maria Rosa., Balbale, Abigail Krasner.|isbn=9780300142143|location=New Haven|oclc=213407379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ''La Convivencia'' was [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was “one of the most important cities in the history of the world.” In it, “Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city.”&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, “Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,” in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 257 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; [[María Rosa Menocal]],  Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, further describes the libraries of Córdoba as "a significant benchmark of overall social (not just scholarly) well being, since they represented a near-perfect crossroads of the material and the intellectual." &lt;ref&gt;Menocal, María Rosa (2002), "The Ornament of the World: how Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain", Little, Brown, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

James L. Heft, the Alton Brooks Professor of Religion at [[University of Southern California|USC]], describes ''La Convivencia'' as one of the “rare periods in history” when the three religions did not either keep “their distance from one another, or were in conflict.” During most of their co-existing history, they have been “ignorant about each other” or “attacked each other.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/ James L. Heft, “The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue”] The First Sheridan-Campbell Lecture Given at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, Malta, May 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Convivencia==
{{main|Expulsion of the Moriscos}}
{{main|Expulsion of the Jews from Spain}}
While the [[Reconquista]] was ongoing, Muslims and Jews who came under Christian control were allowed to practice their religion to some degree. This ended in the late 15th century with the [[fall of Granada]] in 1492. Even before this event, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] had been established in 1478. In 1492, with the [[Alhambra decree]], those Jews who had not converted to Catholicism were expelled. Many Jews settled in [[Portugal]], where they were expelled in 1497.

Similarly the Muslims of Iberia were forced to convert or face either death or expulsion. This happened even though the Granadan Muslims had been assured of religious freedom at the time of their surrender. Between 1500 and 1502 all remaining Muslims of Granada and Castile were converted.&lt;ref name="Making Europe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kidner|first1=Frank|last2=Bucur|first2=Maria|last3=Mathisen|first3=Ralph|last4=McKee|first4=Sally|last5=Weeks|first5=Theodore|title=Making Europe: The Story of the West|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285415185|pages=376|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1525, Muslims in Aragon were similarly forced to convert. The Muslim communities who converted became known as [[Moriscos]]. Still they were suspected by the ''old Christians'' of being crypto-Muslims and so between 1609 and 1614 their entire population of 300,000 was forcibly expelled. All these expulsions and conversions resulted in Catholic Christianity becoming the sole sanctioned religion in the Iberian Peninsula.

==Criticisms==
[[David Nirenberg]] challenges the significance of the age of "convivencia", claiming that far from a "peaceful ''convivencia''" his own work "demonstrates that violence was a central and systemic aspect of the coexistence of majority and minority in medieval Spain, and even suggests that coexistence was in part predicated on such violence".&lt;ref&gt;Nirenberg, David, Communities of violence • Persecution of Minorities in the Middle ages. Princeton University Press, 1996. P. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], professor of Near Eastern studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the "idealized" interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = cohen&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth was met with what Cohen calls the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,&lt;ref name = cohen /&gt; which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=  Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen |author= Daniel J. Lasker|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76–78 |doi=10.2307/1455066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen aims to present a correction to both these "myths".

The Spanish mediaevalist Eduardo Manzano Moreno wrote that the concept of convivencia has no support in the historical record [“el concepto de convivencia no tiene ninguna apoyatura histórica“]. He further states that there is scarcely any information available on the Jewish and Christian communities during the Caliphate of Cordoba, and that this may come as a shock in view of the huge clout of the convivencia [[meme]] [“... quizá pueda resultar chocante teniendo en cuenta el enorme peso del tópico convivencial.”] Dr. Manzano attributes the genesis of the convivencia myth to the Spanish philologist Américo Castro (1885-1972).  But Castro’s conception “… was never converted into a specific and well-documented treatment of el-Andalus, perhaps because Castro never succeeded in finding in the Arabist bibliography materials suitable for incorporation into his interpretation …”&lt;ref name="Qurtuba"/&gt;

During the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] of much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was, more often than not, marked by segregation and mutual hostility.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera: [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/41_02/fernandez-morera.pdf "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise"], ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Fall 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–31 (25)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1066 Granada massacre]] of the entire Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogroms in the [[Rhineland]] slightly later.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"/&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], which may have prompted his bitter statement that Islam had inflicted more pain on the Jewish people than any other 'nation'.&lt;ref&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lao Krang''' ({{lang-th|ลาวครั่ง}}, {{RTGS|''Lao Khrang''}}, {{IPA-th|lāːw kʰrâŋ|pron}}; endonym: {{IPA-lo|laːw kʰaŋ|}}) are a sub-group of the [[Lao people|Lao]] [[ethnic group]].  Also known as the '''Tai Krang''' ({{lang-th|ไทครั่ง}}), they speak a dialect of the [[Lao language]] that is not too different from the modern Lao/Isan languages of Laos and [[Isan]].  The Lao Krang should not be confused with the Tai Khang (spelt the same as 'Thai Krang' in Thai) who are a closely related people inhabiting northeastern Laos.

==Geographic Location==
The Lao Krang are spread out throughout Western and Central Thailand, especially the provinces of [[Phichit Province|Phichit]], [[Suphanburi Province|Suphanburi]], [[Uthai Thani Province|Uthai Thani]], [[Chai Nat Province|Chai Nat]], [[Phitsanulok Province|Phitsanulok]], [[Kamphaeng Phet Province|Kamphaeng Phet]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]] and [[Nakhon Sawan Province|Nakhon Sawan]]. 

==History==
The Lao Krang are descendants of Lao people from [[Luang Prabang Province|Luang Prabang]] and [[Houaphanh Province|Houaphanh]] provinces who were enslaved by invading [[Thai people|Siamese]] soldiers after the fall of the last remnant kingdoms of [[Lan Xang]].  The Lao Krang were settled in the rich farmlands of Central Thailand to work as farm labourers to increase food production for the army and capital. Aside from their geographic isolation, the cultural traits and language of the Lao Krang give away their ancestors' traditional homeland.

==Religion and Culture==
The Lao Krang are [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]], but also maintain older [[Tai folk religion|animist beliefs]].  Especially revered is the tutelary spirit of the village, the ''hu chao nei''.  Traditional activities include farming, as well as making a red dye from beetles used to stain textiles, hence the namesake ''krang'' or 'lac'.  Traditionally, marriages were only between members of the same group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2181">:''For the theological principle of following Jesus, please see [[Imitation of Christ|Life in Christ]]''

'''Life in Christ''' is a 1993 ecumenical document that covers the topic of [[moral theology]], especially as it relates to the relationship between the [[Anglican communion]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcicII_morals.html Text of the document]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The document is historically relevant in that it presents the doctrinal views of the [[Church of England]] shortly before the latter began to accept the [[ordination of homosexuals]] and the [[ordination of women]] within its moral discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/ecum/iss_ecum_arcic-lifechrist.asp Life in Christ (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text, which is signed by [[Cormac Murphy O'Connor]] on the Catholic side and [[Mark Santer]] on the Anglican side, also gives a valuable portrait of Catholic teaching surrounding marriage, and why it is regarded as indissoluble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:O0__zx9gOcMJ:www.cofe.anglican.org/about/gensynod/agendas/july09/gs1736.doc+%22life+in+christ%22+anglican&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk Anglican – Roman Catholic International Commission: Life in Christ: Morals, Communion and the Church ]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Life in Christ'' was notably cited by Cardinal [[William Levada]] in his declaration on the motives for creating personal ordinariates for Anglicans entering the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/24513.php?index=24513&amp;lang=en Note of the CDF about personal ordinariates for Anglicans entering the Catholic Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024000252/http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/24513.php?index=24513&amp;lang=en |date=2009-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] anoints David, [[Dura Europos]], [[Syria]], Date: 3rd century CE.]]

In [[Abrahamic religions]], the '''messiah''' or '''messias''' ({{Lang-he|מָשִׁיחַ|translit=māšîaḥ}}; {{Lang-el|μεσσίας|translit=messías}}, {{Lang-ar|مسيح|translit=masîḥ}}) is a [[salvation|saviour]] or liberator of a group of people.

The concepts of ''[[Messiah in Judaism|moshiach]]'', [[Messianism#Judaism|messianism]], and of a [[Messianic Age#Judaism|Messianic Age]] originated in [[Judaism]],&lt;ref name="schochet moshiah ben yossef"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL messiah"/&gt; and in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; a ''moshiach'' (messiah) is a king or [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] traditionally [[Anointing|anointed]] with [[holy anointing oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|30:22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messiahs were not exclusively Jewish: the [[Book of Isaiah]] refers to [[Cyrus the Great]], king of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], as a messiah&lt;ref&gt;"[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4828-cyrus#anchor7 Cyrus]". ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1906). "This prophet, Cyrus, through whom were to be redeemed His chosen people, whom he would glorify before all the world, was the promised Messiah, 'the shepherd of Yhwh' (xliv. 28, xlv. 1)."&lt;/ref&gt; for his decree to [[Second Temple|rebuild the Jerusalem Temple]].

''Ha mashiach'' (המשיח, "the Messiah", "the anointed one"),&lt;ref name="JVL The Messiah"&gt;{{cite web |last=Telushkin|first=Joseph|title=The Messiah|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/messiah.html|publisher=The Jewish Virtual Library Jewish Literacy.

He is thought to accomplish predetermined things in only one future arrival, including the unification of the [[Israelites#The Twelve Tribes|tribes of Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;Megillah 17b–18a, Taanit 8b&lt;/ref&gt; the gathering of all Jews to ''[[Eretz Israel]]'', the [[Third Temple|rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem]], the ushering in of a Messianic Age&lt;ref&gt;Sotah 9a&lt;/ref&gt; of global universal peace, and the annunciation of the [[World to Come#Jewish eschatology|world to come]]&lt;ref name="schochet moshiah ben yossef"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schochet|first=Jacob Immanuel|title=Moshiach ben Yossef|url=http://www.moshiach.com/discover/tutorials/moshiach_ben_yossef.php|work=Tutorial|publisher=moshiach.com|accessdate=2 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220182918/http://www.moshiach.com/discover/tutorials/moshiach_ben_yossef.php|archivedate=20 December 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL messiah"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blidstein|first=Prof. Dr. Gerald J.|title=Messiah in Rabbinic Thought|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_13744.html|work=Messiah|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library and Encyclopaedia Judaica 2008 The Gale Group|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific expression, "HaMashiach" (המשיח, lit. "the Messiah"), does not occur in the [[Tanakh]].&lt;ref name="JfJ-hamashiach"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish Concept of Messiah and the Jewish Response to Christian Claims - Jews For Judaism|url=https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/the-jewish-messiah/the-jewish-concept-of-messiah-and-the-jewish-response-to-christian-claims/|website=jewsforjudaism.org|publisher=Jews For Judaism|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], the Messiah is called the [[Christ (title)|Christ]], from {{Lang-el|χριστός|translit=khristós}}, translating the Hebrew word of the same meaning.&lt;ref name=EOC_1&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=messiah Etymology Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Messiah in Christianity originated from the Messiah in Judaism. However, unlike the concept of the Messiah in Judaism and [[Islam]], the Messiah in Christianity is the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]]. Christ became the accepted Christian designation and title of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesus]] of Nazareth, the central figure of Christianity, born c. 4 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; because [[Christians]] believe that the [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] in the [[Old Testament]] were fulfilled in his [[Ministry of Jesus|mission]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. They believe that Christ will fulfill the rest of the messianic prophecies, specifically the prophecy of a future king who would come from the Davidic line and usher in a Messianic Age and the [[World to Come#Christian eschatology|world to come]] at the [[Second Coming]].

==Etymology==
Messiah ({{Hebrew name|{{hebrew|מָשִׁיחַ}}|Mashiaẖ|Māšîăḥ}}; in modern Jewish texts in English spelled ''Mashiach''; {{lang-arc|משיחא}}, {{lang-grc-gre|Μεσσίας}}, {{lang-syc|ܡܫܺܝܚܳܐ}}, {{transl|arc|Məšîḥā}}, {{lang-ar|المسيح}}, {{transl|ar|al-Masīḥ}}, {{lang-la|Messias}}) literally means "anointed one".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;[http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=messiah&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In Hebrew, the Messiah is often referred to as מלך המשיח (''Meleḵ ha-Mašīaḥ'' in the [[Tiberian vocalization]], {{IPA-he|ˈmeleχ hamaˈʃiaħ|pron}}, literally meaning "the Anointed King".)

The [[ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Old Testament]] renders all thirty-nine instances of the [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] word for "anointed" (''Mašíaḥ'') as Χριστός (''Khristós'').&lt;ref name=EOC_1/&gt; The [[New Testament]] records the Greek transliteration Μεσσίας, ''Messias'' twice in [[Gospel of John|John]].{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:41|}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|4:25}}

''al-Masīḥ'' (proper name, {{IPA-ar|maˈsiːħ|pron}}) is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for messiah. In modern Arabic, it is used as one of the many titles of Jesus. ''Masīḥ'' is used by [[Arab Christians]] as well as [[Muslim]]s, and is written as ''Yasūʿ al-Masih'' (يسوع المسيح) by Arab Christians or ''ʿĪsā al-Masīḥ'' (عيسى المسيح) by Muslims. The word ''al-Masīḥ'' literally means "the anointed", "the traveller", or the "one who cures by caressing".&lt;ref name="Badawi 2008 881"&gt;{{cite book |last= Badawi|first= Elsaid |last2= Haleem |first2= Muhammad Abdel |year= 2008 |title= Arabic–English Dictionary of Qur'anic Usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwWwCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Badawi+Arabic-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjexeWfmJTWAhWD6oMKHQ5ACK4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cures%20by%20caressing%22&amp;f=false |publisher= Koninklijke Brill |page= 881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Messiah in Judaism|Jewish Messiah claimants}}
{{See also|Jewish eschatology|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
The literal translation of the Hebrew word ''mashiach'' (messiah) is "anointed", which refers to a ritual of [[consecration|consecrating]] someone or something by putting holy oil upon it. It is used throughout the [[Hebrew Bible]] in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king, Jewish priests and prophets, the Jewish Temple and its utensils, unleavened bread, and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus the Great).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tanakh]] verses:
*{{Bibleverse|1 Samuel|10:1-2|HE}}
*{{Bibleverse|1 Kings|1:39|HE}}
*{{Bibleverse|Leviticus|4:3|HE}}
*{{Bibleverse|Exodus|40:9-11|HE}}
*{{Bibleverse|Numbers|6:15|HE}}
*{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|45:1|HE}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish eschatology]], the term came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|king]] from the Davidic line, who will be "anointed" with holy anointing oil, to be king of [[God's kingdom]], and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be [[God]] or a pre-existent divine [[Son of God]]. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as [[Messiah ben David]], which means "Messiah, son of David". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|publisher=Jewfaq.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will be the one who will not "judge by what his eyes see" or "decide by what his ears hear".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:3-4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].&lt;ref name="Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:
{{quote|And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight God's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: "For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9)."&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).&lt;ref name="Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah"/&gt;

A common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, "When will you finally come?" He was quite surprised when he was told, "Today." Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, "You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?" The Messiah replied, "Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Jesus in Christianity|Redeemer (Christianity)|Christian messianic prophecies}}
The Greek translation of Messiah is ''khristos'' ({{lang|el|χριστός}}), anglicized as ''[[Christ (title)|Christ]]'', and Christians commonly refer to Jesus as either the "Christ" or the "Messiah". Christians believe that messianic prophecies were fulfilled in the mission, death, and resurrection of Jesus and that he will [[second coming|return]] to fulfill the rest of messianic prophecies.

The majority of historical and mainline Christian theologies consider Jesus to be the [[Son of God]] and [[God the Son]], a concept of the Messiah fundamentally different from the [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Messiah#Islam|Islamic]] concepts. In each of the four New Testament Gospels, the only literal [[anointing of Jesus]] is conducted by a woman. In the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and John, this anointing occurs in Bethany, outside Jerusalem. In the Gospel of Luke, the anointing scene takes place at an indeterminate location, but context suggests it to be in Galilee, or even a separate anointing altogether.

==Islam==
{{Eschatology|expanded=Islamic}}
{{Main article|Mahdi|Muhammad al-Mahdi|Jesus in Islam}}
While the term "messiah" does appear in Islam, the meaning is different from that found in Christianity and Judaism. "Though Islam shares many of the beliefs and characteristics of the two Semitic/Abrahamic/monotheistic religions which preceded it, the idea of messianism, which is of central importance in Judaism and Christianity, is alien to Islam as represented by the Qur'an."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Riffat|date=Spring 1985|title=Messianism and Islam|url=http://soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/MessianismAndIslamHassan.pdf|journal=Journal of Ecumenical Studies|volume=22:2|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] identifies Jesus (Isa)&lt;ref name="thesis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Albert|first=Alexander|title=Orientating, Developing, and Promoting an Islamic Christology|url=http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&amp;context=etd|publisher=FIU Electronic Theses and Dissertations|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as the messiah (''[[Masih (title)|Masih]]''), who will one day return to earth. At the time of the second coming, "according to Islamic tradition, Jesus will come again and exercise his power of healing. He will forever destroy falsehood, as embodied in the Daj-jal, the great falsifier, the [[Antichrist|anti-Christ]]. Then God will reign forever."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Muslim View of Christianity: Essays on Dialogue|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud|publisher=Orbis Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57075-690-0|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is one of the most important prophets in the Islamic tradition, along with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad.{{Quran-usc|33|7}}{{Quran-usc|42|13-14}}{{Quran-usc|57|26}}&lt;ref name="thesis" /&gt; Unlike Christians, Muslims see Jesus as merely a prophet, but not as God himself or the son of God. Like all other prophets, Jesus is an ordinary man, who receives revelations from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-masih-SIM_5012|title=al- Masih|last=Wensick|first=A.J.|date=2012|website=Encyclopedia of Islam|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious scholar [[Mona Siddiqui]], in Islam, "Prophecy allows God to remain veiled and there is no suggestion in the Qur'an that God wishes to reveal of himself just yet. Prophets guarantee interpretation of revelation and that God's message will be understood."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christians, Muslims, and Jesus|last=Siddiqui|first=Mona|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-300-16970-6|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecy in human form does not represent the true powers of God, contrary to the way Jesus is depicted in mainstream Christianity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Quran states that Isa, the Son of [[Mary in Islam|Maryam]] (Arabic: ''Isa ibn Maryam''), is the messiah and prophet sent to the Children of Israel.{{Quran-usc|3|45}} The birth of Isa is described in Quran sura 19 verses 1–33,{{Quran-usc|19|1-33}} and sura 4 verse 171 explicitly states Isa as the Son of Maryam.{{Quran-usc|4|171}} [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] believe Isa is alive in Heaven and did not die in the crucifixion, as depicted in mainstream Christianity. According to religious scholar [[Mahmoud Ayoub]], "Jesus' close proximity or nearness (qurb) to God is affirmed in the Qur'anic insistence that Jesus did not die, but was taken up to God and remains with God&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;" &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Quran in sura 4 verse 157-158 states that: "They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but they thought they did" since the messiah was "made to resemble him to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After Saturday Comes Sunday: Understanding the Christian Crisis in the Middle East|last=Kendal|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Resource Publications|year=2016|isbn=9781498239882|location=Eugene, OR|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Isa will return to Earth to defeat the [[Masih ad-Dajjal]] (false Messiah),&lt;ref name="MC_1" /&gt; a figure similar to the [[Antichrist]] in Christianity, who will emerge shortly before ''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' ("the Day of Resurrection"). The ''Mahdi'' will come shortly before the second coming of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim Jesus|last=Khalidi|first=Tarif|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|year=2001|isbn=0-674-00477-9|location=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he has destroyed ad-Dajjal, his final task will be to become leader of the Muslims. Isa will unify the Muslim ''[[Ummah]]'' (the followers of Islam) under the common purpose of worshipping Allah alone in pure Islam, thereby ending divisions and deviations by adherents. Mainstream Muslims believe that at that time Isa will dispel Christian and Jewish claims about him.

A ''[[hadith]]'' in [[Abu Dawud]] ({{Hadith-usc|abudawud|37|4310}}) says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Prophet said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Isa. He will descend (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height, reddish fair, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight the people for the cause of Islam. He will break the cross, kill swine, and abolish [[jizyah]]. Allah will perish all religions except Islam. He will destroy the Antichrist and will live on the earth for forty years and then he will die. The Muslims will pray over him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both Sunni&lt;ref name="thesis"/&gt; and [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] agree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunni and Shi'a|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/subdivisions/sunnishia_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that al-Mahdi will arrive first, and after him, Isa. Isa will proclaim al-Mahdi as the Islamic community leader. A war will be fought—the Dajjal against al-Mahdi and Isa. This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day. After Isa slays al-Dajjāl at the Gate of [[Lod|Lud]], he will bear witness and reveal that Islam is indeed the true and last word from God to humanity as [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]]'s translation reads: "And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them."{{Quran-usc-range|4|159}} A ''hadith'' in [[Sahih Bukhari]] ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|55|658}}) says:
"Allah's Apostle said "How will you be when the son of Mariam descends among you and your Imam is from among you?" "

The Quran denies the crucifixion of Jesus,&lt;ref name=thesis/&gt; claiming that he was neither killed nor crucified.{{Quran-usc|4|157}} The Quran also emphasizes the difference between Allah ([[God in Arabic]]) and the Messiah:
"Those who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary, are unbelievers. The Messiah said: "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord... unbelievers too are those who have said that Allah is the third of three... the Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger before whom other Messengers had gone."{{Quran-usc|5|72-77}}

===Shia Islam===

Shi'i Islam, which significantly values and revolves around the 12 spiritual leaders called [[Imam]]s, differs significantly from the beliefs of Sunni Islam. Unlike Sunni Islam, "Messianism is an essential part of religious belief and practice for almost all Shi'a Muslims." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Shi'i Islam believes that the last Imam will return again, with the return of Jesus. According to religious scholar Mona Sidique, "Shi'is are acutely aware of the existence everywhere of the twelfth Imam, who disappeared in 874. Shi'i piety teaches that the hidden Imam will return with Jesus Christ to set up the messianic kingdom before the final Judgement Day, when all humanity will stand before God. There is some controversy as to the identity of this imam. There are sources that underscore how the Shia sect agrees with the Jews and Christians that Imam Mehdi (al-Mahdi) is another name for Elijah, whose return prior to the arrival of the Messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Israel: The History and How Jews, Christians and Muslims Can Achieve Peace|last=Abbas|first=Muhammad|publisher=iUniverse|year=2007|isbn=9780595426195|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is also belief from among Shia and Sunni adherents that the imam will be Muhammad.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Imams and Fatima will have a direct impact on the judgements rendered that day. This will represent the ultimate intercession." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roman Catholics and Shi'i Muslims|last=Bill|first=James|last2=Williams|first2=John Alden|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8078-2689-8|location=|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate on whether Shi'i Muslims should accept the death of Jesus. Religious scholar Mahmou Ayoub argues "Modern Shi'i thinkers have allowed the possibility that Jesus died and only his spirit was taken up to heaven."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Conversely, religious scholar Mona Siddiqui argues that Shi'i thinkers believe Jesus was "neither crucified nor slain."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She also argues that Shi'i Muslims believe that the twelfth imam did not die, but "was taken to God to return in God's time," &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and "will return at the end of history to establish the kingdom of God on earth as the expected Mahdi."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (c. 1897).jpg|thumb|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, considered by [[Ahmadis]] to be the Promised Messiah of the latter days]]
*In [[Ahmadiyya]] theology, the terms "Messiah" and "Mahdi" are synonymous terms for one and the same person.&lt;ref name="rororg"&gt;[http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1599/my%E2%80%88claim-to-promised-messiahship/ Messiah and Mahdi - Review of Religions]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Mahdi" means ''guided'' by God, thus implying a direct ordainment by God of a divinely chosen individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Mahdi" in a Special Meaning and Technical Usage|url=http://www.al-islam.org/discussions-concerning-al-mahdi-gulpaygani/“mahdi”-special-meaning-and-technical-usage|publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Ahmadiyya thought, Messiahship is a phenomenon through which a special emphasis is given on the transformation of a people by way of offering suffering for the sake of God instead of giving suffering (i.e. refraining from revenge).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Ahmadis believe that this special emphasis was given through the person of Jesus and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908)&lt;ref name="askislamorg"&gt;[http://www.askislam.org/concepts/prophecy_and_prophethood/question_577.html Ask Islam: What is the different between a messiah and a prophet? (audio)]&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Ahmadis hold that the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam, the Messiah and Mahdi, were in fact to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&amp;region=E1&amp;CR= |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous hadith are presented by the Ahmadis in support of their view, such as one from [[Sunan Ibn Majah]], which says, "There is No Mahdi but Jesus son of Mary."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, Bab, Shahadatu-Zaman&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadis believe that the prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement. Unlike mainstream Muslims, the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven, but that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus, the promised Messiah and Mahdi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jesus: A humble prophet of God|url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/jesus/|publisher=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have appeared in the likeness of [[Krishna]] and that his advent fulfilled certain prophecies found in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hadrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian |date=2007 |title=Lecture Sialkot |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/LectureSialkot.pdf |location=Tilford, Surrey, United Kingdom |publisher=Islam International Publications Ltd. |page=39-40 |isbn= |author-link= }} Lecture Sialkot&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the founder of [[Sikhism]] was a Muslim saint, who was a reflection of the religious challenges he perceived to be occurring.&lt;ref name="honor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Francis|title=Prophets without honour? Ahmad and the Ahmadiyya|journal=History Today|volume=40|issue=June|page=46|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghulam Ahmad wrote ''[[Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya]]'', in 1880, which incorporated Indian, Sufi, Islamic and Western aspects in order to give life to Islam in the face of the [[British Raj]], Protestant Christianity, and rising Hinduism. He later declared himself the Promised Messiah and the Mahdi following Divine revelations in 1891. Ghulam Ahmad argued that Jesus had appeared 1300 years after the formation of the Muslim community and stressed the need for a current Messiah, in turn claiming that he himself embodied both the Mahdi and the Messiah. Ghulam Ahmad was supported by Muslims who especially felt oppressed by Christian and Hindu missionaries.&lt;ref name=honor/&gt;
*In [[Buddhism]], [[Maitreya]] is considered to the next Buddha (awakened one) that is promised to come. He is expected to come to renew the laws of Buddhism once the teaching of [[Gautama Buddha]] has completely decayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maitreya (Buddhism)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358868/Maitreya|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh addressed not only those timeless theological and philosophical questions that have stayed with humanity since old times such as: Who is God? What is goodness? and Why are we here? but also the questions that have preoccupied philosophers of the 20th century: What motivates human nature? Is real peace indeed possible?

Even if the Emperor denied being the messiah, the followers of the Rastafari movement believe that he is a messenger from God. To justify this, Rastafarians used reasons such as Emperor Haile Selassie's bloodline, which is assumed to come from [[King Solomon]] of Israel, and the various titles given to him, which include Lord of Lords, King of Kings and Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haile Selassie I - God of the Black race|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/beliefs/haileselassie.shtml|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">The '''Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute''' ('''MJB''') is a Jerusalem-based applied research institute on social policy and human services, serving Israel, the Jewish world, and the international community.

The Institute’s mission is to identify and study key social issues, and contribute to shaping policy, designing programs and improving services for individuals, families, and communities.

== History and development ==
In 1974, the JDC-Brookdale Institute of Gerontology was established with a grant from the Brookdale Foundation as a partnership between the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (AJJDC) and the Government of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Habib|first1=Jack|title=Leadership for Change: Ralph Goldman's Role in the Social Development of Israel|journal=Journal of Jewish Communal Service|date=Fall-Winter 2005|volume=81|issue=1-2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's original focus was on addressing the challenges of an aging society in Israel. Over time, this mandate expanded to include a broad range of social challenges facing Israel, including children and youth at risk, integration of immigrants and other minorities, integrating people with disabilities, employment of disadvantaged populations, and improving the quality of the social service sector.&lt;ref&gt;Habib, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Cleveland-based David and Inez Myers Foundation joined the partnership with a $15 million endowment gift.  In recognition the Institute was renamed the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/myers-foundation-grants-million-to-jdc-brookdale/article_ecbb60d8-d016-592d-a0ce-4f7e50b749d2.html|title=Myers Foundation grants $15 million to JDC-Brookdale|last=Reporter|first=MARGI HERWALD Staff|work=Cleveland Jewish News|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Today, MJB includes 6 research divisions: Engelberg Center for Children and Youth, Smokler Center for Health Policy Research, Division for Research on Disabilities, Division for Research Employment, Division for Research on Aging, and the Division for Quality in Social Services.

=== Staff ===
In 2017, Prof. Michael Hartal was named Executive Director of the Institute. He replaced Prof. Jack Habib, who had been with MJB since its founding.

The Institute's multi-disciplinary approach is reflected in the diversity of the 120+ research and support staff, who have backgrounds in anthropology, economics, education, gerontology, health, psychology, public policy, social work, sociology, statistics, and more.

=== Governance ===
MJB’s Governance Committee includes representatives from the Israeli Government (ministries of Finance, Education, Health, Social Services and the Social Security Administration), the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and the David and Inez Myers Foundation.

== Contributions and Impact ==
As a partnership between the government and the philanthropic sector, MJB seeks to "promote the application and impact of the research while ensuring academic independence and objectivity."&lt;ref&gt;Habib, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the core of the Institute's work are evaluations of national social initiatives, both at in their development phase and the national dissemination phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maor|first1=Moshe|title=Developments in Israeli Public Administration|date=2002|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers|location=London|isbn=0714682632|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the Institute's studies have contributed to many of the major issues on Israel's public and social policy agenda.  Of note:

* In the 1990s, the mass immigration of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel]] created a need for an entirely new social policy and service infrastructure to promote their integration into Israeli society.  The Institute evaluated a number of the national initiatives, such as the Ethiopian National Project and PACT (Parents and Children Together), which were established as partnerships between the government and Jewish philanthropic sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enp.org.il/en/evaluations.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also in the 1990s, the institute began conducting the National Consumer Health Survey, a bi-annual national satisfaction survey of Israel's national health insurance system.  The findings are consistently cited by the four national health care plans in their competition for new members.&lt;ref&gt;John Benzaquen. "Maccabi strives for excellence." The Jerusalem Post—Golden Age. 24 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; The National Program for Children and Youth at Risk was developed with the professional input of MJB researchers in the mid-2000s, and the Institute has remained involved in the program's expansion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.molsa.gov.il/CommunityInfo/ResearchAndEvaluation/tb_ResearchesAndPublications/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%A8-%D7%91%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%93%D7%95%D7%97-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%9B%D7%9D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of national initiatives to address the challenges of aging society have been developed and evaluated by the Institute, including Israel's first National Strategy for Dementia and other Alzheimer's in 2013, and programs to promote employment among seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.maariv.co.il/news/israel/Article-605662|title="ההפסד כולו שלנו": מיזם ייחודי מסייע לגמלאים למצוא עבודה|access-date=2018-05-11|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute also promotes international exchange among researchers and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.childtrends.org/israel-trip-leads-to-early-childhood-scholarly-exchange/|title=Israel Trip leads to Early Childhood Scholarly Exchange - Child Trends|date=2014-05-14|work=Child Trends|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a co-sponsor of the ''Israel Journal of Health Policy Research.''&lt;ref&gt;https://ijhpr.biomedcentral.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  MJB is also responsible for the Israel country report to the [[European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hspm.org/countries/israel25062012/countrypage.aspx|title=Country page for Israel - HSPM|website=www.hspm.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noah's Ark Zoo Farm''' is a {{Convert|100|acre|sing=on}} [[zoo]] developed on a working [[farm]] in [[Wraxall, Somerset|Wraxall]], [[North Somerset]], {{Convert|6|mi}} west of [[Bristol]], England, which  promotes a form of [[creationism]] that includes a belief that the biblical story of [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]] was an actual cataclysmic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noahsarkzoofarm.co.uk/pages/about-us/earth-history/was-it-a-true-story/ |title=The Truth behind Noah's Ark - Noah's Ark Zoo Farm |website=Noahsarkzoofarm.co.uk |date=20 December 2015 |accessdate=24 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120022150/http://www.noahsarkzoofarm.co.uk/pages/about-us/earth-history/was-it-a-true-story/ |archivedate=20 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the zoo was expelled from the [[British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums]], the main industry regulatory body, "for bringing the association into disrepute", but in 2018 it regained membership in the body.

==History==

===Anthony Bush===
Noah’s Ark Zoo Farm was conceived by Anthony Bush (b. 1938), the son of a [[Wiltshire]] farm manager.  Bush attended [[Monkton Combe School]], served a stint as an officer in [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] with the [[Somerset Light Infantry]], and attended [[Worcester College, Oxford]], for a year before deciding to return to farming.  In 1960 he became a tenant of [[Richard Gibbs, 2nd Baron Wraxall|Richard Gibbs, Lord Wraxall]], at Moat House Farm, near [[Bristol]], which Bush operated as a dairy farm.  In 1962 he married Christina James, an art teacher, and they had four children.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Bush, ''From Cows to Tigers: Building Noah's Ark'' (privately published, 2012), 11-62.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Bush was elected onto the Somerset County Executive Committee of the [[National Farmers Union of England and Wales|National Farmers Union]], and in 1980, he began a Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group to encourage farmers to conserve wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, 119, 123; "Farmer turned zookeeper is a man with a mission", ''Bristol Post'', 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Monkton Combe, Bush attended [[Christian Union (students)|Christian Union]] meetings and "asked God who I knew was out there, to forgive me and to come into my life, to be involved with everyday stuff, change me and use me".&lt;ref&gt;Bush, 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bush and wife became active at [[St Philip and St Jacob, Bristol|St. Philip and St. Jacob Church]], helping to revive the church with a youth program.  In 1967 Bush became a member of the Anglican [[Church Assembly]], and in 1974 he and his wife established the Bristol Family Life Association, which lobbied on behalf of marriage education and against the use of obscenities on television.

In 1996 Bush also chaired a four-day evangelistic campaign in the same stadium for the Argentinian-American evangelist [[Luis Palau]] (166-67).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987, Bush helped found the African relief agency, Send a Cow.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, 145-52; [http://www.sendacow.org.uk/assets/files/Publications/sac-annrev-0809-web.pdf Send a Cow website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094856/http://www.sendacow.org.uk/assets/files/Publications/sac-annrev-0809-web.pdf |date= 4 March 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationism==

==Charges of professional misconduct==
In October 2009 the [[BBC]] and the [[Captive Animals Protection Society]] charged that the zoo's tigers and camels belonged to the now defunct [[Great British Circus]] owned by [[Martin Lacey]];&lt;ref name="captiveanimals.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2013/06/noahs-ark-zoo-farm-does-business-with-another-notorious-circus-trainer |title=Noah’s Ark Zoo Farm does business with (another) notorious circus trainer - Captive Animals Protection Society |work=captiveanimals.org |accessdate=18 September 2015 |year=2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926012319/http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2013/06/noahs-ark-zoo-farm-does-business-with-another-notorious-circus-trainer |archivedate=26 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the zoo admitted a number of animals were on loan from Lacey, though none had taken part in any circus performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/8310757.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Somerset &amp;#124; Zoo admits connection with circus |first= |last= |work=[[BBC News]] |date= |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2009, BIAZA stripped the zoo of its membership for what it claimed was a refusal of Noah's Ark to provide BIAZA requested information and for bringing "the association into disrepute."&lt;ref name=BBCNewsDec2009&gt;{{cite news

Also in 2009, the [[Western Animal Rights Network]] (WARN) and the [[Captive Animals Protection Society]] (CAPS) said that the zoo had culled healthy chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noah's Ark Zoo Farm hits back at animal cull claim |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Noah-s-Ark-Zoo-Farm-hits-animal-cull-claim/story-11284448-detail/story.html |work=Bristol Evening Post |publisher=Bristol News and Media |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202123/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Noah-s-Ark-Zoo-Farm-hits-animal-cull-claim/story-11284448-detail/story.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAPS claimed that the zoo regularly culled animals during winter months to reduce costs. The zoo explained that it had euthanised some chickens to protect the quality of its flock. A March 2010 report of an investigation by [[North Somerset]] Council called the CAPS allegations "grossly unfair", though because zoo inspectors found some failures to comply with the Secretary of State's Standards of Modern Zoo Practice, tighter licence conditions were imposed on the zoo, including inspection by independent veterinarians every six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/8585669.stm | title= Zoo cruelty claims are rejected | date= 24 March 2010 | publisher= BBC News | accessdate= 27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against Buddhists}}

==Pre-modern persecutions of Buddhism==

===Sassanids===
In 224 CE [[Zoroastrianism]] was made the official religion of the [[Persia]], and other religions were not tolerated, thus halting the spread of Buddhism westwards.&lt;ref name="CHI"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Yarshater |editor-first=Esham  |year=1983 |title=The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods |series=The Cambridge History of Iran |volume=Volume 3(2) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=860-861 |isbn=0-521-24693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century the [[Sassanids]] overran the [[Bactria]]n region, overthrowing [[Kushan]] rule,&lt;ref name="Berzin"&gt;Alexander Berzin, ''History of Buddhism in Afghanistan'', November 2001, Online Article from Study Buddhism. [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-mongolia-central-asia/history-of-buddhism-in-afghanistan Last accessed 20 June 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; were persecuted{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} with many of their [[stupa]]s fired.&lt;ref name="CHI"/&gt; Although strong supporters of Zoroastrianism, the Sassanids tolerated Buddhism and allowed the construction of more Buddhist monasteries. It was during their rule that the Lokottaravada followers erected the two [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamiyan]].&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt;

During the second half of the third century, the Zoroastrian high priest Kirder dominated the religious policy of the state.&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt; He ordered the destruction of several Buddhist monasteries in Afghanistan, since the amalgam of Buddhism and Zoroastrianism manifested in the form of a "Buddha-Mazda" deity appeared to him as heresy.&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt; Buddhism quickly recovered after his death.&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt;

===Pushyamitra Shunga===
The first alleged persecution of Buddhists in India took place in the 2nd century BC by King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Buddhism: "Persecutions", P. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-contemporary Buddhist text states that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted Buddhists. While some scholars believe he did persecute Buddhists based on the Buddhist accounts, others consider them biased because of him not patronising them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdu1AAAAIAAJ |title=Indigenous states of northern India, circa 200 B.C. to 320 A.D. |first=Bela |last=Lahiri |publisher=University of Calcutta |year=1974 |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other scholars have expressed skepticism about the Buddhist claims. [[Étienne Lamotte]] points out that the Buddhist legends are not consistent about the location of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign and his death: "To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof."&lt;ref&gt; Lamotte, E., Dantinne, J., &amp; Webb-Boin, S. (1988). History of Indian Buddhism: From the origins to the Śaka era. Louvain-la-Neuve: Université Catholique de Louvain, Institut Orientaliste.&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeing with him, D. Devahuti states that Pushyamitra's sudden destruction after offering rewards for Buddhist heads is "manifestly false". R. C. Mitra states that "The tales of persecution by Pushyamitra as recorded in ''Divyavadana'' and by Taranatha bear marks of evident absurdity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simmons|first1=Caleb|last2=Sarao|first2=K.

===Hepthalites===
Central Asian and North Western Indian Buddhism weakened in the 6th century following the [[White Hun]] invasion who followed their own religions such as [[Tengri]] and [[Manichaean]].&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt; Around 440 CE they conquered [[Sogdiana]] then conquered [[Gandhara]] and pushed on into the [[Gangetic Plains]].&lt;ref name="CHI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt; Their King Mihirkula who ruled from 515 CE suppressed Buddhism, destroying monasteries as far as modern-day [[Allahabad]] before his son reversed the policy.&lt;ref name="Berzin"/&gt;

=== Persecution by Hindus ===
Persecution of Buddhism started as early as in the life or soon after the death of King Ashoka. D.N. Jha writes that according to Kashmiri texts dated to 12th century, Ashoka's Son [[Jalauka]] was shaivite and was responsible for the destruction of many Buddhist monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reviews-and-essays/dn-jha-destruction-buddhist-sites|title=Monumental Absence The destruction of ancient Buddhist sites|last=Jha|first=DN|date=1 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Jalauka is essentially legendary, and no independent corroboration of the Kashmir tradition has been discovered.&lt;ref name="Smith99"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA180|title=The Early History of India|date=|publisher=Oxford University|year=1908|isbn=|edition=|location=|pages=180|oclc=235958116|last1=Smith|first1=Vincent A.|authorlink=Vincent A.

Even though Gupta empire was tolerant towards Buddhism and patronized Buddhist arts and religious institutions, Hindu revivalism generally became a major threat to Buddhism which led to its decline. A Buddhist illustrated palm leaf manuscript from [[Pala Empire|Pala period]] (one of the earliest Indian illustrated manuscripts to survive in modern times) is preserved in University of Cambridge library. Composed in the year 1015, the manuscript contains a note from the year 1138 by a Buddhist believer called Karunavajra which indicates that without his efforts, the manuscript would have been destroyed during a political struggle for power. The note states that 'he rescued the '''Perfection of Wisdom'', incomparable Mother of the Omniscient' from falling into the hands of unbelievers (who according to Camillo Formigatti were most probably people of Brahmanical affiliation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/news/1000-year-old-manuscript-and-stories-it-tells|title=The 1,000-year-old manuscript and the stories it tells|last=Harper|first=Francesca|date=2015-05-12|website=www.lib.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emperor Wuzong of Tang===
{{main| Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution}}
[[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] (814-846) indulged in indiscriminate religious persecution, solving a financial crisis by seizing the property of Buddhist monasteries. Buddhism had developed into a major religious force in China during the [[Tang period]], and its monasteries had tax-exempt status. Wuzong closed many Buddhist shrines, confiscated their property, and sent the monks and nuns home to lay life. Apart from economic reasons, Wuzong's motivation was also philosophical or ideological. As a zealous [[Taoist]], he considered Buddhism a foreign religion that was harmful to Chinese society. He went after other foreign religions as well, all but eradicating [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Manichaeism]] in China, and his persecution of the growing [[Nestorian Christian]] churches sent Chinese Christianity into a decline from which it never recovered.

===King Langdarma of Tibet===
[[Langdarma]] was a Tibetan King, who [[reign]]ed from 838-841 CE. He is believed to have been anti-Buddhist and a follower of the [[Bön]] religion.

===Oirat Mongols===
The [[Oirats]] (Western Mongols) converted to [[Tibetan Buddhism]] around 1615. The [[Dzungars]] were a confederation of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that emerged suddenly in the early 17th century. The Dzungar Khanate was the last great [[nomadic empire]] in Asia. In the 18th century, the Dzungars were annihilated by [[Qianlong Emperor]] in several campaigns. About 80% of the Dzungar population, or around 500,000 to 800,000 people, were killed during or after the [[Zunghar Genocide]] by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols during the Manchu conquest in 1755-1757.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/uploads/approved/adt-QGU20061121.163131/public/02Whole.pdf Michael Edmund Clarke, ''In the Eye of Power'' (doctoral thesis), Brisbane 2004, p37] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQnNChmw?url=http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/uploads/approved/adt-QGU20061121.163131/public/02Whole.pdf |date=2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk Khanate]] was founded in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, following the earlier migration of the [[Oirats]] from Dzungaria through Central Asia to the steppe around the mouth of the [[Volga River]]. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire, which was then expanding to the south and east. The Russian Orthodox church pressured many [[Kalmyks]] to adopt Orthodoxy. In the winter of 1770-1771, about 300,000 Kalmyks set out to return to China. Their goal was to retake control of Dzungaria from the [[Qing dynasty]] of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetan-museum-society.org/java/arts-culture-Kalmyk-People.jsp|title=The Kalmyk People: A Celebration of History and Culture|author=Asian Art|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way many were attacked and killed by [[Kazakhs]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], their historical enemies based on intertribal competition for land, and many more died of starvation and disease. After several months of travel, only one-third of the original group reached [[Dzungaria]] and had no choice but to surrender to the Qing upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic of Kalmykia in Transition: Natural Resource Management After Disintegration of the Soviet Union|url=http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?csp=17|website=lead.org|publisher=Lead International|accessdate=28 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720192137/http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?csp=17|archivedate=20 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecutions by Islamic regimes==

====Arab invasions====

[[Qutaybah ibn Muslim]], the Arab general of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] conquered a number of territories in [[Central Asia]] including [[Samarkand]] where he broke a number of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lQbcCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|title=History of The Arabs|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|author=Phillip K. Hitti|page=213|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several instances of Buddhist shrines being destroyed by the advancing Muslims are recorded though the religion continued to survive in some places for a considerable period of time. Bertolf Spuler cites the writings of [[Narshakhi]] while stating that the residents of [[Bukhara]] had reconverted from Islam to Buddhism four times until it was conquered by Qutayba in 712-13. A mosque was built in the city in place of a Buddhist monastery. Buddhists continued to live there until the tenth century. Similarly, Buddhism continued to exist in other places like Old Bukhara, Simingan in southern [[Tukharistan]], [[Bamiyan]] and Kabul with suburbs inhabited by "Indians" which were also home to Buddhists. However, the religion could no longer develop as a power or distribute propaganda and its adherents also had to abandon the conversion of peoples in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=G-FTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|title=Iran in the Early Islamic Period: Politics, Culture, Administration and Public Life between the Arab and the Seljuk Conquests, 633-1055|publisher=Bertold Spuler|author=Brill Publishers|page=207|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Richard Nelson Frye]] have doubted the story of Marshaki, pointing out that unlike its statement, Qutayba ibn Muslim didn't live during the time of [[Umayyad]] Caliph Mu'awiya, as this story suggests, but rather much later.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Bukhara by Narshaki (Tras. Richard Nelson Fyre), Commentary, Pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to discrimination, emigration, and the conversion of the laity, Buddhism and its monasteries also declined with the Muslims taking over the trade along the [[Silk Road]] as well as in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=yPZzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|title=An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism|publisher= Oxford University Press|author=Lars Fogelin|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Communities/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elverskog/&gt;

During their conquest of Sindh, the Arabs brought the non-Muslims into the category of ''[[ahl al-kitab]]'', considering them ''ahl al-dhimmah'' (protected subjects) and thus practicing a certain amount of non-interference in their religious lives under the condition that they fulfil a number of obligations that came with this status. Since both Buddhism and [[Hinduism]] are literate religions with scriptures, the precedent of assimilating [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] into the category of ''ahl al-kitab'' was extended to them as well. The ''[[dhimmis]]'' were obligated to pay the [[jizya]] for following their ancestral religion. The historian [[Al-Baladhuri]] notes a decision by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in relation to a Buddhist [[vihara]] and [[Aror]] that after conquering the city through a treaty (''[[sulh]]'') he agreed not to kill the people and enter their temple, in addition to imposing [[kharaj]] on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xxAVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41| author=Derryl L.

{{main|Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang|Kingdom of Khotan}}

The historical area of what is modern day Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]], and was originally populated by Indo-European Tocharian and Iranic Saka peoples who practiced the [[Buddhist]] religion. The area was subjected to Turkification and Islamification at the hands of invading Turkic Muslims.

====Conquest of Buddhist Khotan====

The Islamic attacks and conquest of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar was started by the Turkic Karakhanid Satok Bughra Khan who in 966 converted to Islam and many tales emerged about the Karakhanid ruling family's war against the Buddhists, Satok Bughra Khan's nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was slain by the Buddhists during the war. Buddhism lost territory to Islam during the Karakhanid reign around the Kashgar area.&lt;ref name="RingSalkin1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trudy Ring |author2=Robert M.

Iranic Saka peoples originally inhabited Yarkand and Kashgar in ancient times. The Buddhist Iranic Saka Kingdom of Khotan was the only city-state that was not conquered yet by the Turkic Uyghur (Buddhist) and the Turkic Qarakhanid (Muslim) states and its ruling family used Indian names and the population were devout Buddhists. The Buddhist entitites of Dunhuang and Khotan had a tight-knit partnership, with intermarriage between Dunhuang and Khotan's rulers and Dunhuang's Mogao grottos and Buddhist temples being funded and sponsored by the Khotan royals, whose likenesses were drawn in the Mogao grottoes.&lt;ref name="Millward2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=James A.

Halfway in the 20th century Khotan came under attack by the Qarakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006.&lt;ref name="Millward2007" /&gt;

The Taẕkirah is a genre of literature written about Sufi Muslim saints in [[Altishahr]]. Written sometime in the period from 1700-1849, the Eastern Turkic language (modern Uyghur) '' Taẕkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams'' provides an account of the Muslim Karakhanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists, containing a story about Imams, from Mada'in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq) came 4 Imams who travelled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by Yusuf Qadir Khan, the Qarakhanid leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=The Association for Asian Studies |volume=71 |issue=3 |page=632 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |jstor=23263580 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of the battles waged by the invading Muslims upon the indigenous Buddhists takes up most of the Taẕkirah with descriptions such as "blood flows like the Oxus", "heads litter the battlefield like stones" being used to describe the murderous battles over the years until the "infidels" were defeated and driven towards Khotan by Yusuf Qadir Khan and the four Imams, but the Imams were assassinated by the Buddhists prior to the last Muslim victory so Yusuf Qadir Khan assigned Khizr Baba, who was born in Khotan but whose mother originated from western Turkestan's Mawarannahr, to take care of the shrine of the 4 Imams at their tomb and after Yusuf Qadir Khan's conquest of new land in Altishahr towards the east, he adopted the title "King of the East and China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=The Association for Asian Studies |volume=71 |issue=3 |page=633 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |jstor=23263580 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Imams deaths in battle and burial in Khotan, Altishahr, despite their foreign origins, they are viewed as local saints by the current Muslim population in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=The Association for Asian Studies |volume=71 |issue=3 |page=634 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |jstor=23263580 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bangladesh]], the persecution of the indigenous tribes of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] such as the [[Chakma people|Chakma]], Marma, Tripura and others who are mainly [[Buddhists]], [[Hindus]], [[Christians]], and [[Animists]], has been described as genocidal.{{sfn|Gray|1994}}{{sfn|O'Brien|2004}}{{sfn|Mey|1984}}{{sfn|Moshin|2003}}{{sfn|Roy|2000}} The Chittagong Hill Tracts are located bordering India, Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal, and is the home to 500,000 indigenous people. The perpetrators of are the Bangladeshi military and the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslim settlers, who together have burned down Buddhist and Hindu temples, killed many Chakmas, and carried out a policy of gang-rape against the indigenous people. There are also accusations of Chakmas being forced to convert to [[Islam]], many of them children who have been abducted for this purpose. The conflict started soon after Bangladeshi independence in 1972 when the Constitution imposed Bengali as the sole official language, Islam as the state religion - with no cultural or linguistic rights to minority populations. Subsequently, the government encouraged and sponsored massive settlement by Bangladeshis in region, which changed the demographics from 98 percent indigenous in 1971 to fifty percent by 2000. The government allocated a full third of the Bangladeshi military to the region to support the settlers, sparking a protracted guerilla war between Hill tribes and the military.{{sfn|O'Brien|2004}} During this conflict which officially ended in 1997, and in the subsequent period, a large number of human rights violations against the indigenous peoples have been reported, with violence against indigenous women being particularly extreme.{{sfn|Chakma|Hill|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chittagong Hill Tracts: Sabita Chakma's Murder Condemned By CHT Commission|url=http://unpo.org/article/16867|publisher=[[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]|date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1953 rumoured allegations had surfaced of discrimination against Buddhists in Vietnam. These allegations stated that Catholic Vietnamese armed by the French had been raiding villages. By 1961, the shelling of [[pagoda]]s in Vietnam was being reported in the Australian and American media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/15/home/halberstam-quagmire.html Errors Escalated Too] NY Times Books - May 16, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] came to power in [[South Vietnam]], backed by the United States, he favoured his relatives and co-religionists over Buddhists. Though Buddhists made up 80% of Vietnam's population, Catholics were given high positions in the army and civil service. Half of the 123 National Assembly members were Catholic. Buddhists also required special government permits to hold large meetings, a stipulation generally made for meetings of trade unions.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Religious Crisis |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874816,00.html |magazine=Time |date=June 14, 1963 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1963, the government forbade the flying of Buddhist flags on [[Vesak]]. After Buddhist protesters clashed with government troops, nine people were killed.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; In protest, the Buddhist monk [[Thích Quảng Đức]] burned himself to death in Saigon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ngo Dinh Diem: South Vietnamese president|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/specials/0004/vietnam.profiles/diem.html|website=cnn.com|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=28 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218190701/http://www.cnn.com/interactive/specials/0004/vietnam.profiles/diem.html|archivedate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, the [[Xá Lợi Pagoda raids]] led to a death toll estimated in the hundreds.

==Persecution in Nepal==
{{See also|Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal}}

The banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal was part of a government campaign to suppress the resurgence of Theravada Buddhism in Nepal in the early decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Dietrich"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm|accessdate=17 March 2011|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two deportations of monks from Kathmandu, in 1926 and 1944.&lt;ref name="Dietrich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html |title=Theravada Buddhism in Modern Nepal |publisher=Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK)|accessdate=15 May 2013|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuladhar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|title=The monks in yellow robes

The exiled monks were the first group of monks to be seen in Nepal since the 14th century. They were at the forefront of a movement to revive Theravada Buddhism which had disappeared from the country more than five hundred years ago. The [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime disapproved of Buddhism and [[Nepal Bhasa]], the mother tongue of the [[Newar]] people. It saw the activities of the monks and their growing following as a threat. When police harassment and imprisonment failed to deter the monks, all of whom were Newars, they were deported.&lt;ref name="Dietrich"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuladhar"/&gt;

Among the charges made against them were preaching a new faith, converting [[Hindu]]s, encouraging women to renounce and thereby undermining family life and writing books in Nepal Bhasa.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

==Persecution under Communism==

===Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge===
The [[Khmer Rouge]], which was basically [[Maoist]], actively imposed an atheistic agrarian revolution, resulting in the persecution of ethnic minorities and Buddhist monks during their reign from 1975 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsp.yale.edu/case-studies/cambodian-genocide-program/publications/chronology-cambodian-events-1950|title=Chronology, 1994-2004 - Cambodian Genocide Program - Yale University|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTi" /&gt; Buddhist institutions and temples were destroyed and Buddhist monks and teachers were killed in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/050300/NIE/Remembering_the_death.shtml |title=Nie: Remembering the deaths of 1.7-million Cambodians |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of the nation's [[monastery|monasteries]] were destroyed along with numerous holy texts and items of high artistic quality. 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime.&lt;ref name="NYTi"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE163CF931A35752C0A964958260 Philip Shenon, Phnom Penh Journal; Lord Buddha Returns, With Artists His Soldiers] ''[[New York Times]]'' - January 2, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pol Pot]] believed that Buddhism was a decadent affectation, and he sought to eliminate its 1,500-year-old mark on [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref name="NYTi" /&gt; while still maintaining the structures of the traditional Buddhist base.&lt;ref name="Wessinger2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wessinger|first=Catherine|title=Millennialism, Persecution, and Violence: Historical Cases|year=2000|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|language=English |isbn=9780815628095|pages=282–283|quote=Khmer Buddhist influences still persisted and they are also recognizable in the Khmer Rouge's worldview, particularly in their notions of time, authority, and normative ethics ...

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhism}}
Since the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]], Buddhism was severely restricted and brought under state-control at times.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In addition, "[[Marxist-Leninist atheism]] has been widely publicized, resulting in steadily decreasing religious communities", especially in areas with developed economies. In 1989, less than 12% of the population held religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Population Aging in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHD-AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 July 2016|year=1989|publisher=Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific|language=English |page=48|quote=Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Marxist-Leninist atheism has been widely publicized, resulting in steadily decreasing religious communities, especially in predominantly Han and the coastal areas with a developed economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Buddhists were actively persecuted and sent for re-education, and temples, statues, and sutras were vandalized and destroyed. In recent years, Buddhism has been undergoing a revival but most Buddhist institutions are within the confines of the state.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Tibet====
Although many temples and monasteries have been rebuilt after the cultural revolution, Tibetan Buddhists have largely been confined by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=10025&amp;size=A Human rights abuses up as Olympics approach] ''Asia News'' - August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monks and nuns have been reported tortured and killed by the Chinese military, according to all human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-71575498.html Area Tibetans mourn their nation's lost independence] ''Star Tribune'' - March 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; There were over 6,000 [[List of Tibetan monasteries|monasteries in Tibet]], and nearly all of them were ransacked and destroyed by the Chinese communists, mainly during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm Tibetan monks: A controlled life].

Intensifying propaganda on atheism is especially important for Tibet because atheism plays an extremely important role in promoting economic construction, social advancement and socialist spiritual civilization in the region."  He further said it would push "people of all ethnic groups in the region to raise their ideological and ethical quality, to learn a civilized and healthy life style and to strive to build a united, prosperous and civilized new Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/253345.stm|title=China announces "civilizing" atheism drive in Tibet|date=12 January 1999|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC)|language=English|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolia===
Buddhist monks were persecuted in [[Mongolia]] during communist rule up until [[democratization]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_791031"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_travel_story_skin/791031 |title=Mongolia's monks make a comeback |date=July 18, 2006 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=November 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516095640/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_travel_story_skin/791031 |archivedate=May 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] declared 17,000 of the monks to be enemies of the state and deported them to Siberian labor camps, where many perished.

===North Korea===
During the 1960s and 1970s, "North Korea effectively exterminated all signs of Buddhism" in the region.&lt;ref name="RossRoss2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present|date=4 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|language=English |isbn=9781317461098|page=776|quote=In the 1960s and 1970s, the Burmese government persecuted approximately 2,000 Buddhist monks who, refusing to ahdere to government rule that ultimately contravened Buddhist philosophy, were either arrested or bayoneted by government troops.

===Pre and Post-Soviet Union===
{{further|Soviet anti-religious legislation}}
Being a non-theistic religion, [[Buddhism]] initially enjoyed a compatible relationship with the State under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime.  Under the communists, Buddhism reached its peak in development; a "Congress of Soviet Buddhists" was formed under the leadership of [[Agvan Dordzhiev]], and many Buddhists were also members of the [[League of the Militant Godless]]. However, after [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] assumed power, the suppression of religious influences in society, including Buddhism, was increased.&lt;ref name="Bräker2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bräker |first=Hans |year=2008 |title=Buddhism in the Soviet Union: Annihilation or survival? |journal=Religion in Communist Lands |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=36–48 |issn=0307-5974 |doi=10.1080/09637498308431057  |quote=The Party and State countered with the argument that Buddhist atheism had nothing to do with militant atheism, which was based on the Marxist-materialist interpretation of the laws of nature and society. The precise and binding outcome of this "new" attitude is to be found in the article on Buddhism in the second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. This argued that the theory that Buddhism was an atheist religion or a philosophical system was totally untenable, and that it was an attempt by the ideologues of the exploiting class to gloss over the reactionary nature of Buddhism. In reality, Buddhism was no more than an instrument erected by the feudal lords to exploit the working masses. However, since ideological means did not prove all that effective in the struggle against Buddhism, administrative measures were adopted and implemented at the same time. As early as 1928, heavy taxes were imposed upon the monasteries (which were maintained by the population). In 1929, many monasteries were forcibly closed and many monks arrested and sent into exile. In 1934 even Agvan Dordzhiev was exiled to Leningrad. He was arrested there in 1937 and transferred to a prison in Ulan-Ude, where he died in 1938 (possibly as a result of torture)".}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Stalin's purges, thousands of Buddhist lamas and priests were sent to the [[gulag]]s or executed. However, Soviet authorities grew more conciliatory toward Buddhists, allowing priests and monks to travel to study and establish contacts with Buddhist faithful.  By 1998, long after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], adherents were attacked by interior ministry special troops who forcefully dispersed Buddhist monks who were involving themselves in regional politics. The Buddhists were trying to prevent unique Tibetan drawings from being sent on a year-long tour through American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/AH26Ag01.html |title=Asia Times: Buddhist revival tangles with politics |publisher=Atimes.com |date=1999-08-26 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
Despite the communist regime's hostility, Buddhism is still widely practiced in [[Vietnam]]. According to ''Human Rights News'', "Vietnam continues to systematically imprison and persecute independent Buddhists as well as followers of other religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/05/08/vietna18774.htm|title=Vietnam: Religious Freedom Denied|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the [[Unified Buddhist Congregation of Vietnam]], [[Thích Huyền Quang]] and [[Thích Quảng Độ]] were imprisoned for decades. [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has spoken out about the wiping out of his spiritual tradition in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhachannel.tv/portail/spip.php?article10879|title=Vietnam — Thich Nhat Hanh responds to Bat Nha crackdown with Zen koan - Buddhachannel|website=www.buddhachannel.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prabhāvakacarita''' is a Jain text devoted to history, composed by [[Prabhācandra]], an ''[[acarya]]'' of the [[Svetambara]] tradition of [[Jainism]] in 1277-78.&lt;ref&gt;Prabhāvakacarita of Prabhācandrācārya. Ed. Jina Vijaya Muni. Singhi Jaina Series, vol. 13. Ahmedabad, Calcutta: Sañcālaka Siṅghi Jaina Granthamālā, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; While Prabhāvakacarita is dedicated to the lives of Jain scholars of the Shvetambara tradition, it is often quoted in the context of contemporary history, often dealing with the time of Acharya [[Hemachandra]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Sheldon (2006). Language of the Gods in the World of Men. 
University of California Press. p. 182. 587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalhana's Rājatarangini: A Chronicle of the Kings of Kaśmīr, Volume 2, Sir Aurel Stein, The Shrine of Sarada, Note B, p. 279-289, Archibald Constable, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major source of the information on the society in that era.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Indian Women Through the Ages: The middle ages, Simmi Jain, Gyan Publishing House, 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhāvakacarita includes a mention of use a parachute in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering
Volume 4 of Physics &amp; Physical Technology PT. 2
Science and Civilisation in China, Joseph Needham, p. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

Prabhācandra mentions that he was inspired by the [[Hemachandra]]'s Parishisthaparvan, which is an appendix to the [[Trishahsthi-Shalaka-Purusha-Charitra]] which stops at the account of Vajraswami. Prabhachandra gives accounts of acharyas from the first century of the Vikram era to 13th century, concluding with the account of [[Hemachandra]]. It gives an account of 22 acharyas, including Vajraswami, Kalaka,  [[Haribhadra]], Bapabhatti, [[Manatunga]], Mahendra Suri (which includes an account of poet [[Dhanapala]]&lt;ref&gt;Dhanapāla and His Times: A Socio-cultural Study Based Upon His Works, Ganga Prasad Yadava, Concept Publishing Company, 1982, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;) and Hemachandra.  It concludes by including a prashati of the author himself.

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais, Noyon, and Senlis''' ([[Latin]]: ''Dioecesis Bellovacensis, Noviomensis et Silvanectensis''; [[French language|French]]: ''Diocèse de Beauvais, Noyon et Senlis'') is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in France. The diocese encompasses the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Oise]] in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Hauts-de-France]]. The diocese is a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archdiocese of Reims]]. The current bishop is Jacques Benoit-Gonnin, appointed in 2010.

==History==

The Diocese of [[Beauvais]] was founded in the 3rd century, by [[Lucian of Beauvais|St. Lucian]] (Lucianus, Lucien), according to a story first told in the 9th century. Gregory of Tours, who wrote in the second half of the 6th century, however, never speaks of the diocese of Beauvais or of any of its bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Duchesne, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither does the name of Beauvais appear in the documents of any church council down to 695.&lt;ref&gt;C. De Clercq, ''Concilia Galliae A. 511 — A. 695'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After 1015 each Bishop of Beauvais was simultaneously Count of Beauvais, and one of the [[Peerage of France|Peers of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Léon-Honoré Labande|author2=Honoré Lambert Labande|title=Histoire de Beauvais et de ses institutions communales jusqu'au commencement du XVe siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llZMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA377|year=1892|publisher=Imprimerie nationale|location=Paris|language=French|pages=25-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Count Odo of Beauvais had given all of his lands in his county to Bishop Roger and the Church of Beauvais, with the consent of King Robert; he also made the bishop his heir to the county.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' X, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop had a role in the coronation ceremony of the French king, and played a role in politics.

Bishop Roger II died during the [[First Crusade]], [[Philip of Dreux]] was a participant in the [[Third Crusade]] and the [[Battle of Bouvines]], and [[Pierre Cauchon]] was the leading judge in the trial of [[Joan of Arc|Jeanne d'Arc]].

==Politics and scandal in Beauvais==
Beginning in 1100, a five year long period of ecclesiastical, social and political discord descended upon Beauvais, involving eventually Bishop [[Ivo of Chartres]], Archbishop Manasses of Reims, two papal legates, Joannes of Saint Anastasia and Benedict of Saint Pudenziana, King [[Philip I of France]], and [[Pope Paschal II]]. On the death of Bishop Ansellus of Beauvais in November 1099, it became evident that there were two opposed parties in the business of the election of a successor. One was the majority of the Chapter and the secular clergy of the diocese, who were accommodated to the social system of society and preferred matters as they were; the other was led by the clergy of Saint-Quentin, who were seeking reform and greater rigor, and who looked to Ivo of Chartres, formerly a priest in Saint-Quentin, for advice and support. The Chapter chose as its candidate Étienne de Garlande, fourth son of Guillaume, Seneschal of France, a protegé of the excommunicated King Philip I and his mistress Bertrade, who were no doubt expecting Garlande's aid in solving their matrimonial problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Merlet (ed. and tr.), ''Lettres de Saint Ives'' (Chartres: Garnier 1885), p. 180, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not in holy orders at all, and yet was Dean of Orleans and Archdeacon of Paris. The other candidate, supported by the monks of Saint-Quentin, was Walon (Gualon), abbot of Saint-Quentin. In the election, Étienne obtained exactly enough votes to form a majority.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It happened that the ecclesiastical Province of Reims was holding a synod at Soissons, and the leaders of the winning party, the Dean and Archdeacons of Beauvais, went to announce the election and request that letters be sent to the King and the Pope on Etienne's behalf, and they petitioned Lambert of Arras, the Papal Visitor in the province to write to Pope Paschal as well. The letter to Lambert seriously misrepresented the facts in stating that the election was nearly unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The losing party enlisted Ivo of Chartres, who made a detailed investigation into the deeds and character of Étienne Garlande. He found that Garlande was not in holy orders, that he was illiterate and addicted to gambling, that he had a bad moral reputation, that he had been excommunicated by the Legate Hugh de Die for public incontenence (which made him ineligible for ecclesiastical office), and that his election had been intrigued at by laymen who were excommunicated. He then wrote both to the papal legates, Joannes and Benedict, and to the Pope himself.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, p. 6. Merlet, pp. 184-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope took the case, and Étienne had to make the journey to Rome to clear his reputation. He failed, but on his return to France, he extorted a letter of recommendation from Ivo of Chartres. The Pope, however, was not fooled, and quashed the election. A new election was ordered, and Lambert of Arras was ordered to preside at the election. The canonically convoked assembly elected Walon (Gualon) the Abbot of Saint-Quentin.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, pp. 8-13. Merlet, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt; The King, however, refused to recognize the election, and Prince Louis made a statement to the effect that Walon would never be bishop of Beauvais, and that the King should install Étienne immediately, which was done.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, p. 14. Merlet, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope, however, ratified the election of Gualon, and issued a mandate to Archbishop Manasses of Reims to consecrate him. The Archbishop was a friend of the Court, though, and had crowned the excommunicated King. He procrastinated in taking action. Gualon, therefore, set out for Rome, where he so impressed the Pope that Paschal appointed him Apostolic Legate to Poland. In the meantime the Church of Beauvais sank into disorder, with two competing jurisdictions, that of the uncanonical and unconsecrated Étienne, and that of the Vicars appointed by the Chapter in the absence of a consecrated bishop. The King raged against the Chapter and exiled several of the Canons, and Ivo of Chartres consoled it with the knowledge that it was canonically justified.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, pp. 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Ivo worked out a settlement with the King. Prince Louis held a meeting in Beauvais with the Chapter in January 1104, which brought peace to the city. Since the diocese of Paris happened to be vacant, the Pope authorized the transfer of bishop-elect Gualon to the diocese of Paris, and the seat of Beauvais was declared to be vacant. In December the King was reconciled to the Church, and his excommunication was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, II, pp. 25-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Councils in Beauvais===
A synod was held in Beauvais in 845, in the presence of King [[Charles the Bald]], during a ''sede vacante'' of the See of Beauvais. The synod ratified the election of Hincmar as Archbishop of Reims.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Mansi (ed.), ''Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio'', editio novissima, Tomus XIV (Venice: A. Zatta 1669), pp. 809-810. Delettre, I, p. 340. C. J. Hefele, '' Histoire des Conciles'' Tome IV, première partie (ed. H. Leclercq) (Paris: Letouzey 1911), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 1114 a Council was held in Beauvais, presided over by the Papal Legate Cardinal [[Cuno of Praeneste|Kuno von Erach]] (Conon, Kono). The Archbishops of Reims, Bourges and Sens and their suffragans participated. The [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry V]] was again anathematized, along with the Bishop of Münster and Count Thomas de Marla, who enjoyed raving the areas of Laon, Reims and Amiens. The case of Bishop Geoffroy of Amiens, who had been driven from his city by the burghers, was discussed, and his resignation was submitted. The discovery of Manichaean heretics in the diocese of Soissons was discussed, but action was deferred until the next synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Joseph von Hefele|editor=Delarc|title=Histoire des conciles d'après les documents originaux: 1085-1198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nYUAAAAYAAJ|volume=Tome septième|year=1872|publisher=A. Le Clère|language=French|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Kuno von Erach held another synod in Beauvais, on 18 October 1120. The purpose was to decide on the sainthood of Bishop Arnulf of Soissons (died 1087). The synod accepted his sanctity and authorized the moving of his remains from the convent of Aldenbourg in the diocese of Tournai to the cathedral of Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, VII, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a note in the ''Chronicon Malleacense'' that a council took place at Beauvais in 1124. Nothing at all is known about it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Mansi (ed.), ''Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio'', editio novissima, Tomus XXI (Venice: A. Zatta 1776), p. 306.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1160 an important council was convoked at Beauvais by King [[Louis VII of France]]. The papal Conclave of 1159 had produced a schism between [[Pope Alexander III]] and the puppet of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Octavianus de' Monticelli, Cardinal of S. Cecilia, who called himself Victor IV. The council agreed with the King that Alexander III was the true pope, a judgment that was confirmed in a joint meeting held by Louis VII and Henry II of England at Toulouse in the autumn of 1160.&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, XXI, p. 1155. Hefele, VII, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hundred Years War===
{{Main article|Hundred Years' War}}
{{Main article|Hundred Years' War (1415–1453)}}
Beauvais, which was situated close to the frontier between English and French territories, was frequently subjected to attack and siege from the English and their allies, especially the Burgundians.

The celebrated [[Battle of Agincourt]] took place only a few miles north of Beauvais on 25 October 1417.

On 1 June 1427, Bishop Pierre Cauchon, who was a partisan of [[Philip the Good]], Duke of Burgundy, and no supporter of Charles VII, was one of the consecrators of Jacques du Chastellier, the English candidate for the bishopric of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' Tomus VII (Paris: Typographia regia 1744), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; He fled from Beauvais as Charles' armies appeared in the area, led by Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc). Cauchon took refuge in Rouen, where he was induced by the English to sit as judge in the trial of Joan, who had been captured on 23 May 1430. After a contentious trial he pronounced her guilty, and had her turned over to the secular authorities to be burned as an heretic. He also assisted at the coronation of the English King Henry VI in Paris on 17 December 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, III, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1452 the case was reopened on orders of Pope Nicholas V by Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, cousin of a former bishop of Beauvais, but the proceedings did not lead to a definitive conclusion. In 1455 they were begun again on orders of the new pope, [[Calixtus III]], and the bishop of Beauvais at the time, Bishop Guillaume de Hellande, as successor of Pierre Cauchon, was required to provide defense attorneys to argue the case for Cauchon's right conduct. The court issued its judgment on 7 June 1456: "We say, pronounce, decree and declare the said Processes and Sentences full of cozenage, iniquity, inconsequences, and manifest errors, in fact as well as in law. We say that they have been, and are, and shall be—as well as the aforesaid Abjuration, their execution, and all that followed—null, nonexistent, without value or effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=T. Douglas Murray|title=Jeanne d'Arc, maid of Orleans, deliverer of France: being the story of her life, her achievements, and her death, as attested on oath and set forth in original documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8BZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|edition=new and revised|year=1907|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|pages=158, 303–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1472 Beauvais was attacked and besieged by forces of the Duke of Burgundy. Their leader, Philippe de Crevecoeur, Sieur d'Esquerdes (des Cordes) launched the attack on 27 June, which broke through the fortifications and seized the faubourg de Saint-Quentin. Bishop Jean de Bar immediately mounted his horse and tried to leave the city, heading for Paris to obtain royal aid, but he was stopped by the defenders, who had orders to allow no one to leave the city. Matters were clarified, and the bishop was in Paris on July 1. He offered the leaders of the commune nearly 1,000 livres which the King had given for the construction of the cathedral. The Seigneur de Tressures had also ridden out and obtained several thousand troops from various sources, including Robert d'Estouteville, Provost of Paris. In the meantime, the church of Saint-Hippolyte, which had been taken by the besiegers, was destroyed by fire, and the episcopal palace, next to the ramparts, took fire in three places, perhaps by arson. Assaults continued through 6 July, at which there was a pause until the 9th. In the third assault, when the Burgundian standard was planted on the ramparts, a courageous Beauvasienne, Jeanne Hachette, grabbed it and threw it back down into the ditch, rallying the citizens to throw back the Burgundians, and even to mount a nighttime attack on the Burgundian camp which killed over 200, many of them officers. After losses of more than 3,000 men, the Duke of Burgundy abandoned the siege on 22 July. Three days later, the bishop celebrated a Mass. The Abbey of Saint-Quentin had been rendered uninhabitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Constant Moisand|title=Histoire du siége de Beauvais en 1472|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anpIAAAAYAAJ|year=1847|publisher=Imprimerie de Moisand|location=Beauvais|language=French}} Delettre, III, pp. 68-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathedral and Chapter===

In 875, Bishop Odo, with the consent of King [[Charles the Bald]], as an act of considerable generosity, increased the number of Canons in the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre to fifty.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' X, pp. 242-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 1320, the Cathedral was served by a Chapter&lt;ref&gt;Labande &amp; Labande, pp. 182-192.&lt;/ref&gt; composed of eight dignities (not 'dignitaries') and forty canons. The dignities were: the Dean (who was also Archdeacon of Bray&lt;ref&gt;Delettre, I, p. 554, by an act of Bishop Anselmus in 1100.&lt;/ref&gt;), the Treasurer, the Archdeacon of Beauvais, the Archdeacon of Belvacinio, the Cantor, the Succentor, the Penitentiary, and the Chancellor. The Dean was elected by the Chapter, the others were episcopal appointments.&lt;ref&gt;''Pouillé général'', pp. 1-4 (c. 247-250). Longnon, pp. 498-499.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1679 the dignities had been reduced to five.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 117 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six of the churches in Beauvais were also capitular churches: Saint-Nicolas (6 prebends), Saint-Bartholomew (7 prebends), Saint-Michel (13 prebends), Saint-Laurent (7 prebends), Nôtre-Dame du Châtel (12 prebends),&lt;ref&gt;The church was begun ca. 1136, and greatly advanced through the patronage of Bishop Bartholomew of Montcornet (1162–1175). Delettre, II, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint-Vaast (11 prebends).&lt;ref&gt;Longnon, pp. 500-501; 503-504.&lt;/ref&gt; These offices were all benefices, in the gift of the bishop or of the Chapter, and provided a regular income for the incumbents. These offices were a way of rewarding faithful followers. There was also a Collegiate Church at Geberoy (headed by a Dean, with 5 prebends, later 12 prebends).&lt;ref&gt;''Pouillé général'', pp. 6-15 (c. 252-261). Longnon, p. 471. For the state of the Collegiate Churches in 1630, see: Delettre, I, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1516 King Francis I signed at treaty with Pope Leo X, which has come to be called the [[Concordat of Bologna]], in which the King and his successors acquired the right to nominate each and every one of the bishops in France, except those of the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Thomas, ''Le Concordat de 1516 : ses origines, son histoire au XVIe siècle,'' Paris: Alphonse Picard 1910, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k933620x première partie], pp. 329-343; [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9336054/f11.image deuxième partie]; [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9336190 troisième partie].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution===

During the [[French Revolution]] the diocese of Beauvais was suppressed by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], under the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] (1790).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludovic Sciout|title=Historie de la constitution civile du clergé (1790-1801) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwxdAAAAIAAJ|volume=Tome premier|year=1872|publisher=Firmin Didot frères|location=Paris|language=French|chapter=Chapitre IV: La Constitution Civile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'Oise', which was coterminous with the new civil department of the same name. Oise was made part of the Metropolitanate called the 'Métropole des Cotes de la Manche'. The new Civil Constitution mandated that bishops be elected by the citizens of each 'département',&lt;ref&gt;Bishops and priests were also to be salaried by the State. The salaries were paid out of funds realized from the confiscation and sale of church properties. After the Concordat of 1801, bishops and priests continued to be salaried and pensioned by the State, down to the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|Law of Separation of 1905]], Article 2. {{cite book|author=Jean Marie Mayeur|title=La séparation des Églises et de l'État|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ0kEyikxmwC&amp;pg=PA51|year=1991|publisher=Editions de l'Atelier|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=978-2-7082-4340-8|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which immediately raised the most severe issues in Canon Law, since the electors did not need to be Catholics and the approval of the Pope was not only not required, but actually forbidden. Erection of new dioceses and transfer of bishops, moreover, was not canonically in the competence of civil authorities or of the Church in France. The result was schism between the 'Constitutional Church' and the Roman Catholic Church.

The legitimate bishop of Beauvais, François-Joseph de la Rochefoucauld, declined to take the required oath to the Civil Constitution, and betook himself to Paris, where he was accused and arrested. He was imprisoned in the monastery of the Carmelites, along with his brother, Pierre Louis, who was Bishop of Saintes. Both were massacred on 2 September 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 the electors of 'Oise' assembled and elected as their Constitutional Bishop a priest, Jean-Baptiste Massieu, who had been a teacher, first at Vernon, and then at Nancy. He became cure of Cergy near Pontoise in 1782, and was elected to the Estates General for the baillage of Senlis.  He was in Paris at the time of his election, serving as an active member of the Ecclesiastical Committee which had drawn up the civil Constitution. He had just been elected secretary of the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]]. He was consecrated at Notre-Dame de Paris on 6 March 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel, the seventh constitutional bishop to be consecrated. His behavior became more and more radical, during 1791 and 1792. He voted in favor of the execution of King Louis XVI. He resigned the priesthood and helped to organize [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]]. He married the daughter of the mayor of Givet, and presided at the Festivals of Reason. Complaints against him were so frequent, however, that he was delated to the Committee of Public Safety, and condemned on 9 August 1794. Somehow he escaped the guillotine and was pardoned in October 1794, and given a post as teacher in the school at Versailles. He had no successor in the Constitutional church, which he had helped to make universally loathed in the former diocese of Beauvais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=Répertoire biographique de l'épiscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ|year=1907|publisher=A. Picard et fils|location=Paris|language=French|pages=183-184, 455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory of the former diocese of Beauvais was made part of the [[Diocese of Amiens]] when legitimate ecclesiastical government was restored in 1802. Church property, which had been confiscated for the public good by the Constitutional Assembly, was not restored. Bishops and priests therefore continued to be dependent upon salaries paid to them by the State, a practice which continued down until the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|Law of the Separation of the Churches and the State]] of 1905. The Diocese of Beauvais was re-established in 1822, and the Diocese of Beauvais, [[Noyon]], and [[Senlis]] was created in 1851, comprising the territories of all three formerly separate dioceses. [[Beauvais Cathedral]] serves as the seat of the enlarged diocese.

*Roger II (1095–1096)&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Roger was in office in time to attend the [[Council of Clermont]] as Bishop of Beauvais in November 1095. {{cite book|author1=Martin Bouquet|author2=Michel-Jean-Joseph Brial|title=Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrgQAQAAMAAJ|edition=nouvelle|volume=Tome quatorzieme (14)|year=1877|publisher=Gregg Press|language=French, Latin|page=98}} Roger is said to have been Keeper of the Seals, and to have died in Egypt during the [[First Crusade]]. François Duchesne, p. 164, expressed the view that the office of Garde des Sçeaux was established in 1095, and that the first holder of the office was Hambald; he makes no mention of Roger. ''Gallia christiana'' IX, p. 714, states that it was believed by some that this Roger is the same person as had been Chancellor of France in 1074, 1078, and 1080. Nothing in the documents cited, however, mentions Beauvais. Duchesne, pp. 158–159, attributing the notion to the brothers Sainte-Marthe. The idea that Roger resigned the diocese of Beauvais to go on crusade is rejected by Delettre, I, p. 548, who indicates that Roger had left the three archdeacons in charge, Hugues de Gerberoy, Lisiard, and Roger.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ansel (1096–1099)&lt;ref&gt;Ansellus (Anselmus) was elected bishop of Beauvais, but his election was contested, due to the irregularities in the departure of Bishop Roger. Ansellus carried the matter to Pope Urban, who was holding a Council at Nîmes, and he received papal confirmation on 12 July 1096. ''Gallia christiana'' IX, pp. 714–715. J. D.

*[[Galon (bishop of Beauvais)|Galon]] (1099–1104) Bishop-elect&lt;ref&gt;Gualon was never installed, due to the intrusion of Étienne Garlande and the opposition of King Philip I. Instead Paschal II made Gualon [[papal legate]] in Poland. As legate he deposed two bishops, one of them the bishop of Cracow. In 1104, he was named [[Bishop of Paris]] and the See of Beauvais was declared vacant. ''Gallia christiana'' VII, p. 55. Augustinus Theiner (ed.), ''Caesaris S. R. E.

*[[Philip of Dreux]] (1175–1217)&lt;ref&gt;Philippe was a son of Count [[Robert I of Dreux]], and Agnes, Countess of Braine and Bar-sur-Seine; and thus nephew of Bishop Henry of France. Philippe wished to visit the Holy Land before his consecration; he was abroad from 1176 to 1179. On 1 November 1179 he participated in the coronation of Philip II Augustus as King of France. He was consecrated a bishop by Archbishop Guillaume de Champagne in Reims in 1180. He went on the [[Third Crusade]] in the summer of 1190 with his brother Robert II of Dreux, returning in 1197. While Richard the Lionheart was a prisoner in Germany, Philip II attacked his possessions in northern France, and when Richard was ransomed, he made war on Philip, during with Bishop Philippe was captured (c. 1196–1198). On the death of Archbishop Guillaume de Champagne of Reims in 1202, Philippe was a candidate for the office, with royal support, but his warlike spirit convinced the electors to look elsewhere. They tried Archdeacon Thibault de Perche, but he refused. They rejected Archdeacon Milon de Nantueil of Beauvais due to youth. Exasperated, King Philip II sent an embassy to Rome, and Pope Innocent III appointed Cardinal Guillaume Paré. Philippe was a participant the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. He died on 12 November 1217. Delettre, II, pp. 162-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Robert de Cressonsacq]] (1237–1248)&lt;ref&gt;There was a ''sede vacante'' of more than a year following the death of Bishop Godefrey, which resulted in several exchanges of letters between [[Pope Gregory IX]] and [[Louis IX]]. Finally Robert de Cressonsacq, whose father had participated in the taking of Constantinople in 1203, and who was Dean of the Chapter of the Cathedral, was chosen. Robert was elected in August 1237, and took possession on 24 August.  He dedicated the Église Saint-Étienne de Cambronne-lès-Clermont. In 1247 he took part in the council held in Paris by Louis IX, to arrange for the crusade which had been voted at the Council of Lyon in 1245, and in August of 1248 he was one of the crusaders who departed for Cyprus. He died in Cyprus of one of the usual campaigning diseases, during the [[Seventh Crusade]], on 1 October 1248. Guillaume de Nangis claims that he returned from crusade and died in 1253; this view is contradicted by the documentary evidence showing his successor in office in 1250. His nephew, also named Robert de Cressonsacq, became Bishop of Senlis (1260–c. 1283). Delettre, II, p. 284-308. Eubel, I, p. 132, 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Pierre de Savoisy]] (1398–1412)&lt;ref&gt;Pierre's father and brother were Chamberlains of King Charles VI. Pierre had previously been Treasurer of the Chapter of Saint Martin of Tours, and then [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Le Mans|Bishop of Le Mans]] (1385–1398); and on 16 January 1398, he was transferred by Benedict XIII to Beauvais. He took part in the Assembly of Paris which began on 22 May 1398, which discussed withdrawing the right of either pope to appoint to benefices in France, and whether to withdraw obedience from Benedict XIII; on 27 July 1398 King Charles VI signed an ordinance which did so (which was withdrawn on 30 May 1403). In 1406 he was a member of an embassy to Pope Benedict, to attempt to compose the quarrel between him and France, which did not succeed. The clergy assembled again in Paris and again definitively revoked their obedience.

The Chapter instead resigned the election to the decision of the Pope. Bernard had previously been Bishop of Agen (1395–1398) by appointment of Benedict XIII, Bishop of Saintes (1398–1411), and then [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Amiens|Bishop of Amiens]] (1411–1413) by appointment of [[Antipope John XXIII|Pope John XXIII]].

'''Sacrament of Transition''' is a [[new religious movement]] based in [[Slovenia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvs.gov.si/index.php?id=481&amp;L=1 "REGISTERED CHURCHES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140919/http://www.uvs.gov.si/index.php?id=481&amp;L=1 |date=2011-07-17 }}, Government of [[Slovenia]] Web site; Sacrament of Transition is listed as "Sakrament Prehoda"&lt;/ref&gt; based on and promoting the [[sacrament]]al use of the [[psychoactive]] plant ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'' and its psychoactive chemical constituent [[ibogaine]]. The founder of Sacrament of Transition is Marko Resinovic. The organization routinely sponsors psychedelic-related conferences and meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibogaine.org/nyc2006.html "New York City Ibogaine Conference 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707033225/http://ibogaine.org/nyc2006.html |date=2007-07-07 }} at ''ibogaine.org''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/News/2006Columbia-COSM.html "The 2006 NYC Ibogaine Conference"] at ''ibogaine.mindvox.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/News/2005COSM.html "The 2005 NYC Ibogaine Conference @ COSM"] at ''ibogaine.mindvox.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrament of Transition has representatives from [[activist]] organizations such as the [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy]] and [[Million Marijuana March]]. Other affiliates include [[Patrick K. Kroupa]], whom the group has made a high priest, and [[Dana Beal]], founder of Cures Not Wars, the North American Apostolic Delegate.  Discussing addiction and his ibogaine use at the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in early 2006, Kroupa said that while [[psychedelics]] such as [[LSD]] might allow a user to become aware of the damage his [[Substance dependence|addiction]] was doing, "The flesh doesn't let you forget... But with ibogaine, the Light comes back down with you." The Sacrament of Transition actively proselytizes to [[heroin]] addicts with the message that ibogaine can help them. Besides the use of ibogaine as a sacrament, the Sacrament of Transition remains a [[heterodox]] body, with no other disclosed dogmas. Beal has maintained that [[Jesus]] consumed a mixture of ibogaine, [[Syrian rue]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] during the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].

'''Shalom Ben Moses Buzaglo''' ({{lang-he|בוזאגלו, שלום בן משה}}) (also '''Buzagli''', '''Buzaglio''') ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1700 – 1780) was a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[kabbalist]] born in [[Marrakesh]] and filled the position of dayyan. Owing to voyages in the Orient made in his capacity of collector of alms for the relief of the poor in Palestine, he became acquainted with the chief Kabbalists of the period. He also visited Europe, and sojourned for some time in London. He was tortured by the [[Sultan of Morocco|Sultan]] and left for England in 1745, where he remained until his death.

Although his Kabbalistic works bear his name on the title-page, they are merely compilations of teachings attributed to [[Isaac Luria]] and [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]]. Buzaglio took part in the discussion, which arose among many Kabbalists, as to whether Jews should be allowed to undergo vaccination, which had been discovered shortly before that day. Buzaglio pronounced himself in favor of vaccination, but disputed the priority of [[Edward Jenner|Jenner]] in regard to its discovery.

==Published works==

(1) ''Miḳdash Melek'' (The Sanctuary of the King), a commentary on the [[Zohar]], published by Meldola (4 vols., Amsterdam, 1750);

(2) ''Hadrat Melek'' (The Beauty of the King), a commentary on the [[Zohar]], compiled from Isaac Luria and Ḥayyim Vital (2 vols., Amsterdam, 1766; London, 1772);

(3) ''Kisse Melek'' (The Throne of the King), annotations on the Tiḳḳune Zohar (Amsterdam, 1769);

(4) ''Hod Melek'' (The Majesty of the King), commentary on the book Zeni'uta of the Zohar (London, no date);

(5) ''Sefer ha-Zohar'', notes on the Zohar, published together with the text (London, 1772);

(6) ''Kebod Melek'' (The Honor of the King), a collection of Kabbalistic ''derashot'' (London, no date);

(7) ''Ma'aseh she-Hayah Kak-Hayah'' (What Happened Was in This Fashion), report of the proceedings of a lawsuit (London, 1774);

(8) ''Kunṭras Ma'aseh Adonai Ki Nora Hu'' ([[Fascicle (book)|Fascicle]] on the Work of God, Which Is Majestic), an appeal to the public concerning the authority of Buzaglio's judgment in a lawsuit, in Hebrew and [[Judæo-German]] (London, 1774);

(9) ''Tokaḥat le-Shobabim we-Taḳḳanah le-Shabim'' (Admonition for Transgressors and Rehabilitation for the Repentant), consisting of two letters to [[Meshullam Solomon|Israel Meshullam Solomon]], also concerning Buzaglio's lawsuit (London, 1774).

He authored a number of commentaries on Zohar:
* מקדש מלך "Mikdash Melech" – published in Amsterdam in 1750; etc.
* הדרת מלך "Hadrat Melech" – published in Amsterdam 1766; in London 1770; etc.
* כסא מלך "Kiseh Melech" – published in Amsterdam in 1769; etc.
* פני מלך "Pnei Melech" – published in London in 1773; etc.
This is the first systematic commentary on the Zohar to be published.

"These were based mainly on Lurianic Kabbalah,
including all the scattered work of Isaac Luria's disciples,
which Buzaglo usually copied word for word,
occasionally quoting other opinions.
Although this book does not convey the literal meaning of the Zohar,
it has continuing value for scholars."

"'''The Beautiful People'''" is a song by American rock band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. It was released as the lead single from the band's second [[studio album]], ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' in September 1996. Classified as [[alternative metal]], the song was written by frontman [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Jeordie White|Twiggy Ramirez]], and was produced by [[Trent Reznor]], [[Dave Ogilvie]] and Manson.

The title of the song comes from Marilyn Bender's 1967 book ''The Beautiful People'', about the lifestyles of the [[jet set]]&lt;ref name="howiwrote"/&gt; In the context of the album's concept, the song refers to the privileged [[Social class|class]] of [[elites]] whom the titular character, a [[Right-wing populism|populist]] [[demagogue]] called ''Antichrist Superstar'', fulminate against. Lyrically, it discusses what Manson refers to as "the culture of beauty".&lt;ref name="howiwrote"&gt;Manson, Marilyn. "''How I Wrote "The Beautiful People''". May 2005, ''Kerrang!'', reported by [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=37436 Blabbermouth.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313170007/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=37436 |date=March 13, 2007 }}; last accessed September 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The single peaked at number 26 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks chart]] and remains known as one of Marilyn Manson's most famous and most successful original songs; in a 2004 review, Richard Banks of the BBC called the track "still the most impressive"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Banks, "Rock &amp; Alt Review", 2004, at [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/rockandalt/reviews/marilynmanson_bestof.shtml BBC.co.uk]; last accessed September 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; in the band's catalogue, and in 2006 it was ranked at number 28 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs.&lt;ref&gt;''"VH1 40 Greatest Metal Songs"'', May 1–4, 2006, ''VH1'' Channel, reported by [http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/103446/episode_this_list.jhtml VH1.com]; last accessed September 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song information==

===Origins===
"The Beautiful People" was written in 1994, with lyrics by Marilyn Manson and music by Twiggy Ramirez. The original demo version was written in a hotel room while on tour, and recorded to [[multitrack recording|four-track]] by Manson, Ramirez, and drummer [[Ginger Fish]]. Manson recalled to ''Kerrang!'' magazine in May 2005: "It was somewhere in [[Southern United States|the South]], which is ironic. I remember playing the drum beat on the floor and then having my drummer duplicate that on the drum machine. It happened in one day pretty much".&lt;ref name="howiwrote a"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Manson|first=Marilyn|date=28 May 2005|title=How I Wrote... ''The Beautiful People''|format=transcription|url=http://www.providermodule.com/media/?v=i/2005/kerrang_bp|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|issue=1058|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the song comes from Marilyn Bender's 1967 book ''The Beautiful People'',&lt;ref name="howiwrote"/&gt; which exposed the world of scandal within the "jet-set" lifestyle of the 1960s, and the culture of beauty as it pertained to fashion and politics.&lt;ref name="howiwrote"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3670958/The-book-that-started-the-madness.html|date=2008-02-03|df=mdy-all|accessdate=2017-06-18|title=The book that started the madness|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Steven Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition and lyrical content===
{{Listen |filename=Marilyn Manson - The Beautiful People.ogg|format=[[Ogg]] |title="The Beautiful People"|description=A sample of "The Beautiful People"}}

The song is preceded with a few seconds of [[backmasking|backwards-guitar]] feedback and electronic noise. It includes a heavily distorted spoken [[sampling (music)|sample]] by [[Charles "Tex" Watson|Tex Watson]], declaring "[We would] swoop down on the town. . . [and] kill everyone that wasn't beautiful".&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;D. Damon, ''The Beautiful People''. Retrieved from [http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/ddamon/hierophant/lexicon/acs-2.htm ''The Marilyn Manson Lexicon'' (section)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223051601/http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/ddamon/hierophant/lexicon/acs-2.htm |date=February 23, 2007 }}, last accessed October 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is written in [[drop D tuning]], and is built primarily out of [[power chords]] based on the notes of a [[diminished triad]]. It also incorporates extensive use of [[Guitar effects#Distortion-related effects|guitar distortion]], and the use of [[palm muting]] creates a highly rhythmic, driving style amplified by a heavy [[percussion instrument|percussion]] track. The song's characteristic element is its repetitive drum beat: a five-beat [[common time]] pattern played on [[floor tom]]s, with a [[swung note|shuffle note]] each measure creating a triplet feel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[Sean Beavan]], who mixed and co-produced ''Antichrist Superstar'', is credited with "descending horn guitar" on the track. Beavan can be heard playing a repeated descending [[figure (music)|figure]] with a [[brass instrument]]-like sound using a [[guitar synthesizer]].

Lyrically, it is entwined with the ''Antichrist Superstar'' album's overarching theme, a semi-narrative examination of the [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] [[Übermensch]].&lt;ref name="cmj"&gt;Marilyn Manson (interview). ''College Music Journal'', October, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context, "The Beautiful People" deals explicitly with the destructive manifestation of the Will to Power ("There's no time to discriminate / hate every [[motherfucker]] that's in your way"), while also exploring Nietzsche's view of [[master-slave morality]] ("It's not your fault that you're always wrong / The weak ones are there to justify the strong"), particularly the concept's connection with [[Social Darwinism]] and its relation to various political and economic systems such as [[capitalism]] and [[fascism]] ("Capitalism has made it this way/Old-fashioned fascism will take it away").

===Notable performances===
"The Beautiful People" was performed sporadically during the 1995–1996 [[Smells Like Children Tour]], frequently in abbreviated form as part of the ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' song "My Monkey". It was "officially" premiered on October 3, 1996, at the State Theatre in [[Kalamazoo]] – the second show of the band's [[Dead to the World (tour)|Dead to the World]] Tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

On September 4, 1997, Marilyn Manson performed the song as the grand finale of the [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. Preceded by a marching band playing "[[Hail to the Chief]]", Manson entered the stage flanked by mock United States Secret Service agents and, from a microphone-covered podium, delivered a speech&lt;ref name="MTVVideo"&gt;''MTV Video Music Awards'', MTV (television broadcast). Originally broadcast September 4, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; to the audience:

{{quote|My fellow Americans:

We will no longer be oppressed by the fascism of Christianity! And we will no longer be oppressed by the fascism of beauty. As I see you all sittin' out there trying your hardest not to be ugly, trying your hardest not to fit in, trying your hardest to earn your way into Heaven, but let me ask you: Do you want to be in a place that's filled with a bunch of ''assholes''?}}

Manson then threw off his costume, revealing "a leather corset, leather G-string and fishnet stockings", and the band delivered a performance of "The Beautiful People" that ''Rolling Stone'' called "riveting",&lt;ref&gt;''"Virtual Inanity"'', October 1997, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' № 748, reported by [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924661/virtual_inanity RollingStone.com]; last accessed September 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the magazine's extremely negative review of the program as a whole. As the show closed, host [[Chris Rock]] teasingly yelled for the audience to "Run to church right now! Get your asses to church, or you're going to Hell!".&lt;ref name="MTVVideo"/&gt;

Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez joined [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] at Mountain View, California's [[Shoreline Amphitheatre]] for an acoustic performance of "The Beautiful People" during the venue's annual [[Bridge School Benefit]] on October 18, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Strauss, "POP REVIEW: Neil Young and Friends Gather to Have Fun For a Serious Purpose", October 20, 1997, ''The New York Times'', reported by [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E0DC1F3FF933A15753C1A961958260 NYTimes.com]; last accessed September 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nine Inch Nails]] also performed "The Beautiful People", with frontman [[Trent Reznor]] on bass guitar and Marilyn Manson on lead vocals, on May 9, 2000 at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Manson had been a surprise guest at the concert, appearing unannounced on stage during Nine Inch Nails' "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]"; this performance was filmed and released as a bonus feature on ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Skanse, ''"Manson Joins NIN Onstage in NYC"'', May 10, 2000, at [https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/marilynmanson/articles/story/5925826/manson_joins_nin_onstage_in_nyc RollingStone.com]; last accessed September 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2012 [[Echo (music award)|Echo Awards]], [[Rammstein]] performed the song, with Marilyn Manson standing in for lead singer [[Till Lindemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahmoud |first1=Von Karim |last2=Peters |first2=Bernd |last3=Henseke |first3=Stefon |last4=Kampe |first4=Sina |url=http://www.berliner-kurier.de/kultur-leute/echo-2012-berlin-marilyn-manson-rammstein-schoeneberger-mueller,7169134,11959656.html |title=Oldie-Alarm beim Echo Innige Zungenküsse und alte Männer(freundschaften) |work=[[Berliner Kurier]] |publisher=Berliner Verlag GmbH |date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2014 in a special setup on [[Halloween|Halloween night]], Manson performed the song with [[Johnny Depp]] on guitar and [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Ninja]] (from [[Die Antwoord]]) as a background vocalist, in the club [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] in [[West Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Alex |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2014/11/marilyn-manson-performs-the-beautiful-people-with-johnny-depp-and-die-antwoord-for-some-reason-watch/ |title=Marilyn Manson performs "The Beautiful People" with Johnny Depp and Die Antwoord, for some reason — watch |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |publisher=Consequence Holdings, LLC |date=2014-11-02|accessdate=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In live performances, Manson frequently incorporates the lyric "How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?" from [[The Beatles]]' "[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]" into the song, either shouted over its instrumental break or as a lead-in to the introductory drums.&lt;ref&gt;Track 2 on the UK CD Single 2 for "[[The Dope Show]]" [[The Dope Show]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions and releases===

In addition to the version on the ''Antichrist Superstar'' album and the version on the single (which differ only in the length of the introductory noise) a radio edit also exists, which removes the profanity. The phrase "hate every motherfucker" has been replaced by the alternate lyric "hate every other hater", and the word "shit" has been excised. This radio edit is the version used in the music video for "The Beautiful People".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Three official remixes of "The Beautiful People" have been released. The first, "The Horrible People", was created by [[Danny Saber]] and appears on the 1997 ''[[Remix &amp; Repent]]'' EP; the remix features a fast-tempo [[drum n bass]] backing track, and accents the original song's [[Swing (genre)|swing jazz]]-inflected rhythm with brass and piano samples. [[J. G. Thirlwell]]'s "The Not-So-Beautiful People" is a straight [[industrial music|industrial]] reworking of the track, with rhythmic vocal samples and churning, [[audio filter|filtered]] [[synthesizer]]s. It was used as the opening theme for ''[[WWE Raw|WWF RAW is WAR]]'' for only a few weeks in March 1997. Later an edited version of the song was used as the opening theme for ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWE SmackDown!]]'' from 2001 to 2003, and a remix of it was included on ''[[WWF Forceable Entry]]'' and a 10-inch picture disc single of the song.

Marilyn Manson's 2004 greatest hits compilation, ''[[Lest We Forget: The Best Of|Lest We Forget]]'', contains a slightly reworked version of the track. The longer introduction from the single version has been restored, and certain musical elements (most notably, an organ-like sound not noticeable in the previously released versions) have been made more pronounced.

In 1997, [[MTV News]] reported that Manson had expressed interest in collaborating with [[Snoop Dogg]] to produce a [[rapping|rap]] version of "The Beautiful People".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} It is unknown if the collaboration ever actually occurred, although in his September 4, 1997 keynote address at the [[College Music Journal|CMJ]] Music Marathon, the singer referred to the project as "something I would still love to do"&lt;ref&gt;Manson, Marilyn. Keynote address, CMJ Music Marathon, September 4, 1997 [speech]. As reported by [http://www.spookhouse.net/angelynx/manson/mmcmj.html spookhouse.net], last accessed September 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and blamed the hectic touring schedules of both his own band and the rapper for the delay.

The song has been made available as [[downloadable content]] for ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'' and is included on the ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' soundtrack.

Intercut with these performance clips are scenes of lead singer Marilyn Manson in a long gown-like costume and aviator goggles, wearing stilts and prosthetic makeup which make him appear bald and grotesquely tall; after being placed in this costume by similarly attired attendants, he appears to a cheering crowd through a window in a scene reminiscent of a fascist rally, and later stands in the center of a circle while people march around him giving the [[Hitler salute]]. Other [[fast cutting|fast cut]] scenes include extreme close-ups of crawling earthworms, mannequin heads and hands, and the boots of people marching; and shots of the individual band members bizarrely costumed, including Manson in back and neck braces, a leather aviator cap and an orthodontic cheek retractor, exposing metallic teeth.

The video premiered on [[MTV]] on September 22, 1996 and was nominated for two [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]]: Best Rock Video and Best Special Effects.&lt;ref name="1997 MTV Video Music Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/mtvvmas.htm |title= 1997 MTV Video Music Awards |publisher=Rock On The Net |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The single was generally praised on its release. [[AllMusic|AllMusic's]] [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] highly praised the song, stating that "With its mock menace and pummeling metal triplets, it was the first Manson song with an oversized hook -- the kind of song that even the group's detractors couldn't get out of their heads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/beautiful-people-mw0000916310 |title=Beautiful People- Marilyn Manson |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=AllMusic |access-date=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its 1996 review of ''Antichrist Superstar'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine described "The Beautiful People" as "suspense-filled", with "a zombielike, repetitive quality [and] ghostly electronic sounds. . .", adding that in his vocal delivery, "Manson hisses his lines, punctuating certain words with a shrill, insane pitch, others with a retching scream".&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Ali, ''"Antichrist Superstar"'' (starred review) , October 29, 1996, ''Rolling Stone'' № 748, reported by [https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/870/albums/album/306030 RollingStone.com]; last accessed September 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the single managed to reach number 29 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and number 26 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard''.

'''''Tikkun''''' is a quarterly [[interfaith]] Jewish [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Progressivism|progressive]] magazine and website, published in the [[United States]], that analyzes [[Culture of the United States|American]] and [[Israeli culture]], politics, religion, and history in the [[English language]]. The magazine has consistently published the work of [[Israelis|Israeli]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] left-wing intellectuals, but also included book and music reviews, personal essays, and poetry. In 2006 and 2011, the magazine was awarded the ''Independent Press Award for Best Spiritual Coverage'' by ''[[Utne Reader]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Spiritual Coverage: Tikkun |journal=Utne Reader|date= January–February 2007 |accessdate=March 4,  2016|url= http://www.utne.com/issues/2006_139/features/12371-1.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907065256/http://www.utne.com/issues/2006_139/features/12371-1.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008|quote= In November, Rabbi Michael Lerner's erudite rejoinder to the religious right released ''Tikkun Reader: Twentieth Anniversary'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield) to showcase memorable essays from the bimonthly magazine's all-star cast of contributors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Winners of the 2011 Utne Independent Press Awards |journal=Utne Reader|date= April 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 4, 2016|url= http://www.utne.com/Utne-Independent-Press-Award-Winners-2011.aspx|quote= Illuminated by the Jewish faith but accessible to all, Tikkun aims to 'mend, repair and transform the world'}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its analysis of the inability of many progressives to understand people's yearning for faith, and the American [[fundamentalist]]s' political influence on the international conflict among religious [[zealots]].

Since 2012, its publisher is [[Duke University Press]]. [[Beyt Tikkun]] [[Synagogue]], led by Rabbi Michael Lerner, is loosely affiliated with Tikkun magazine. It describes itself as a "[[Halakha|hallachic]] community bound by Jewish law".&lt;ref name=Founding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyttikkun.org/fmd/files/FoundingPerspective.pdf|format=PDF|title=Founding Perspective|work=Beyt Tikkun|accessdate=February 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002001335/http://beyttikkun.org/fmd/files/foundingperspective.pdf|archivedate=October 2, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and meaning of the name==
The magazine's title comes from mystical Hebrew concept ''[[Tikkun Olam|tikkun olam]]'' ({{lang-he|'''תיקון עולם'''}}; "healing or restoring the world"), emphasizing both humanity's and God's co-responsibility "to heal, repair and transform the world".

==Publisher==
Initially, Nan Fink Gefen, at the time married to Lerner, devoted financial resources and served as a hands-on publisher until she left as their marriage ended in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1997 a fellow 1960s-activist Danny Goldberg, a major music industry figure heavily involved in the [[ACLU]], became co-publisher with his father, Victor. During these years, prominent journalists such as [[Jack Newfield]] interviewed national and international leaders such as Mario Cuomo and Haiti's embattled President [[Aristide]] to bring more credibility to the growing influence of the magazine. From 2002 through 2011, Lerner's sister, [[Trish Vradenburg]], and her husband served as co-publishers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Editorial policy==
Founded in 1986, the magazine's editorial policy was shaped by Nan Fink Gefen, Michael Lerner, and [[Peter Gabel]]. According to the founding editorial statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.amazon.com/Tikkun-Heal-Repair-Transform-World/dp/0935933034/ref=sr_1_3/002-2929806-7815211?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1186208537&amp;sr=8-3 |title=Tikkun 5 Year Anthology edited by Michael Lerner|publisher=Tikkun Books|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; political concerns of the 1960s civil rights, anti-war, and feminist movements and psychological studies of workers in the 1970s and 1980s were their most direct influences. Among authors who contributed to the magazine's interfaith character were the historian [[Christopher Lasch]], philosopher [[Cornel West]], and [[Harvey Cox]] of Harvard Divinity School.

Obliquely confronting more conservative American Jewish community's [[Commentary Magazine]], which caused some members of the Editorial Board, including [[Elie Wiesel]], to resign,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} the magazine introduced itself with prominent ads placed in leading intellectual papers and journals declaring a new voice for the Jewish Left. Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]'s legacy of "prophetic" Jewish activism has been honored and analyzed from the first issue onward. Some writers who have contributed recently to the magazine include Michael Bader, [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Shaul Magid]] (a [[contributing editor]]), [[Benny Morris]], Or N. Rose (also a contributing editor), [[Edward Said]], [[Richard Silverstein]], [[Jim Wallis]], and [[Stephen Zunes]]. In every issue, it is stated that its articles "do not necessarily reflect ''Tikkun's'' position on any issue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disclaimer|publisher=Tikkun|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its editor, Rabbi Michael Lerner, has written that he "often consciously seeks to print articles with which he disagrees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/ask_the_rabbi_form|title=Ask the Rabbi|accessdate=February 7, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231025743/http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/ask_the_rabbi_form|archivedate=December 31, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Network of Spiritual Progressives''==
In 2001 the magazine's interfaith activist community's website, the ''[[Network of Spiritual Progressives]]'', initially named differently, was established by founders that include ''Sister'' Joan Chittister, a [[Benedictine]] nun, and [[Cornel West]], a Princeton University professor of religion, in order to engage readers in broader activism and broaden the magazine's appeal to non-Jewish readers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Challenging the anti-religious and anti-spiritual biases within liberal culture and "replacing world domination with generosity" are among the ideas that are supported by the community.

==Controversy==
===Accusations of Anti-Semitism===
In 2005 [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]] cited an article published by ''Tikkun'' &amp;mdash; [[Joel Kovel]]’s "On Left Anti-Semitism and the Special Status of Israel" (May/June 2003) &amp;mdash; as one of two examples of "essays of Jewish authors using anti-Semitic arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-30.htm |title=Jews against Israel |first=Manfred |last=Gerstenfeld |publisher=''Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism'' |date=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, Kovel described Israel as a racist state that "automatically generates crimes against humanity and lacks the internal means of correcting them", adding that such a state "cannot have that legitimacy which gives it the right to exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=3597|title=On Left anti-Semitism and the Special Status of Israel|author=Joel Kovel|work=Tikkun|date=May–June 2003|accessdate=February 7, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130547/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=3597|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 column, [[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote that "''Tikkun'' is quickly becoming the most virulently anti-Israel screed ever published under Jewish auspices" and that "support for ''Tikkun'' is support for the enemies of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/30647/edition_id/575/format/html/displaystory.html|title=The accusation: 'Moral pervert' hit piece shouldn’t have been spread|author=Alan Dershowitz|work=The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|date=October 20, 2006|accessdate=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz and his books have been the targets of criticism in the pages of ''Tikkun'' (for example: May/June 1997, September/October 1997, November/December 1997, January/February 1999).

===Improprieties regarding Letters to the editor===
In 1997 former ''Tikkun'' editors accused Lerner of publishing pseudonymous letters to the editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/5763/edition_id/107/formathtml/displaystory.html |title=Tikkun editor calls letter-writing policy 'a mistake' |date=March 21, 1997|author=Leslie Katz|work=Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''True Will''' is a term found within the mystical system of [[Thelema]], a magical society founded in 1904 with [[Aleister Crowley]]'s writing of ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Stephen (ed). ''The Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley: Tunisia 1923'', p. 79, n. 8. Weiser, 1996. {{ISBN|0-87728-856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAO131&gt;IAO131. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hdbq111/JoTS/JoTS1-1.pdf&amp;date=2010-01-17+12:04:48 Thelema &amp; Buddhism] in ''Journal of Thelemic Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 1, Autumn 2007, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined either as a person's grand destiny in life or as a moment-to-moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with Nature. True Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the deepest Self and the entire Universe. Thelemites in touch with their True Will are said to have eliminated or bypassed their false desires, conflicts, and habits, and accessed their connection with the divine. Theoretically, at this point, the Thelemite acts in alignment with Nature, just as a stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor "lust of result". Crowley's ideas on the subject partly originated with the teachings of [[Eliphas Levi]], whose magical books emphasize the magician finding their magical identity &amp;ndash; his or her 'true self', which Levi referred to as the "True Will".

== Thelema ==
Thelema roughly means "will" in [[Greek language|Greek]]. The phrase ''True Will'' does not appear in ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the central sacred text of Thelema. Nevertheless, [[Aleister Crowley]]'s various commentaries on the Book routinely postulate that each individual has a unique and incommensurable True Will that determines his or her proper course in life. Crowley's invention appears to be an attempt to explain how some actions may be wrong (or "false") when "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt".&lt;ref&gt;Liber AL III:60&lt;/ref&gt; Actions that conform to True Will are thus considered to be correct, while willed actions that deviate from True Will may nevertheless be wrong. In ''The Book of the Law'' Crowley wrote "Do What Thou Wilt". 

"DO WHAT THOU WILT" can often be misunderstood to mean "do what you want". When one says "do what thou wilt", this means that the origin of will directs the path. To understand and act upon one's True Will is a sort of "enlightenment" to Thelemites. The ultimate goal of a [[Thelema|Thelemite]] would be to understand and perform their True Will. True Will directs the individual towards destiny and forces them into the joy of accomplishing what they were meant to accomplish without "lust of result" (outside motivations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber AL vel Legis|year=1904|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
In Crowley's essay ''The Secret Conference'' (written under the pseudonym "Gerald Aumont", and prefaced to ''The Heart of the Master''), he suggests that a technique must be devised by which a child's True Will may be discovered at birth, or as early as possible in life, in order to permit the correct ordering of society. 

In Crowley's ethical treatise [http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_duty.html ''Duty''], he identifies True Will with the Nature of the individual. This capitalized "Nature" may be compared with the "Perfect Nature" of earlier Gnostic systems, which was another term for the personal daimon or augoeides,{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} usually referenced by Crowley as the [[Holy Guardian Angel]]. 

''The Message of the Master Therion'' ([http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_message.html Liber II]) is a document that attempts to delineate the doctrine of True Will. By reference to [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib913.html ''Liber Thisharb''], Liber II suggests a theory of metempsychosis, whereby the individual True Will is the resultant of a person's prior incarnations. But here as elsewhere, Crowley stops short of asserting objective validity for memories of past lives. He recommends developing "the magical memory" as a means to an end, and connecting the aspirant's abilities and remembered past with some purpose. By definition, the aspirant's True Will must fit the aspirant's nature.

In ''De Lege Libellum'' ([http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_lege.html Liber CL]), Crowley defines True Will as the will which "does not rest content with things partial and transitory, but...proceed[s] firmly to the End", and in the same passage he identifies that "end" as the destruction of oneself in love.

June 24 is the date that aviator [[Kenneth Arnold]] reported what is generally considered to be the first widely reported unidentified flying object sighting in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/weekinreview/04schwartz.html?_r=0|title=Out of This World, Out of Our Minds|date=3 July 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while July 2 commemorates the supposed UFO crash in the 1947 [[Roswell UFO Incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/why-don-t-you-1-537512|title=Why don't you?
