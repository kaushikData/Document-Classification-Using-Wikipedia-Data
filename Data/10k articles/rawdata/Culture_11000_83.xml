{{redirects here|Adaptive|other uses|Adaptation (disambiguation)}}
'''Adaptive behavior''' refers to behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to get along in his or her environment with greatest success and least conflict with others.  This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education.  Adaptive behavior relates to every day skills or tasks that the average person is able to complete, similar to the term [[life skills]].

Nonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome. For example, a constant [[habit (psychology)|repetitive action]] could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something. In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else.

In contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive. For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term. Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of [[abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]] or [[mental dysfunction]], since its assessment is relatively free from [[subjectivity]]. However, many behaviors considered [[morality|moral]] can be maladaptive, such as [[dissent]] or [[abstinence]].

Adaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living. Behavior patterns change throughout a person's development, across life settings and social constructs, changes in personal values, and the expectations of others. It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally.

==Examples==
*A child born with cerebral palsy will most likely have a form of [[hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] (the weakening, or loss of use, of one side of the body). In order to adapt to one's environment, the child may use these limbs as helpers, in some cases even adapt the use of their mouth and teeth as a tool used for more than just eating or conversation.
*Frustration from lack of the ability to verbalize one's own needs can lead to tantrums. In addition, it may lead to the use of signs or sign language to communicate one's desires. One subject that is pertinent to this article is [[ABA therapy]]. "Applied means that interventions are geared toward achieving socially-important goals, helping people be more successful in natural settings such as homes, schools, and communities. Behavioral means that ABA focuses on what people say or do, rather than interpretations or assumptions about behavior. And analytic means that assessments are used to identify relationships between behavior and aspects of the environment (e.g., screaming occurs most when Johnny is given a difficult task and allows him to delay or avoid that activity) before proceeding to intervention."&lt;ref name="Meme Hieneman, Viviana Gonzalez, &amp; Paula Chan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hieneman|first=Meme|url=http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com/news/what-aba-now-really-autism-33299272|publisher=Autism Support Network|accessdate=10 May 2013|title=What is ABA Therapy now, really?|author2=Viviana Gonzalez|author3=Paula Chan|page=2}} cited at [http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com Austism Support Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core problems==
Limitations in self-care skills and social relationships, as well as behavioral excesses are common characteristics of individuals with mental disabilities. Individuals with mental disabilities who require extensive supports are often taught basic self care skills such as dressing, eating, and hygiene.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt; Direct instruction and environmental supports, such as added prompts and simplified routines are necessary to ensure that deficits in these adaptive areas do not come to seriously limit one's quality of life.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt;

Most children with milder forms of mental disabilities learn how to take care of their basic needs, but they often require training in self-management skills to achieve the levels of performance necessary for eventual [[activities of daily living|independent living]]. Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships present significant challenges for many persons with mental disabilities. Limited cognitive processing skills, poor language development, and unusual or inappropriate behaviors can seriously impede interacting with others. Teaching students with mental disabilities appropriate social and interpersonal skills is one of the most important functions of special education. Students with mental disabilities more often exhibit behavior problems than children without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt; Some of the behaviors observed by students with mental disabilities are difficulties accepting criticism, limited self-control, and inappropriate behaviors. The greater the severity of the mental disabilities, generally the higher the incidence of behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt;

==Adaptive behaviors in education==
In education, adaptive behavior is defined as that which (1) meets the needs of the community of stakeholders (parents, teachers, peers, and later employers) and (2) meets the needs of the learner, ''now'' and ''in the future''. Specifically, these behaviors include such things as effective speech, self-help, using money, cooking, and reading, for example.

Training in adaptive behavior is a key component of any educational program, but is critically important for children with special needs. The [[US Department of Education]] has allocated billions of dollars ($12.3 billion in 2008) for Special Education programs aimed at improving educational and early intervention outcomes for children with disabilities. 
In 2001, the [[United States National Research Council]] published a comprehensive review of interventions for children and adults diagnosed with [[autism]]. The review indicates that interventions based on [[applied behavior analysis]] have been effective with these groups.

Adaptive behavior includes socially responsible and independent performance of daily activities. However, the specific activities and skills needed may differ from setting to setting. When a student is going to school, school and academic skills are adaptive. However, some of those same skills might be useless or maladaptive in a job settings, so the transition between school and job needs careful attention.

==Specific skills==
Adaptive behavior includes the age-appropriate behaviors necessary for people to live independently and to function safely and appropriately in daily life. Adaptive behaviors include life skills such as grooming, dressing, safety, food handling, working, money management, cleaning, making friends, social skills, and the personal [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] expected of their age and [[social group]].&lt;ref name="Heward"&gt;William Heward: ''Exceptional Children'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Specific skills include:

==Adaptive skills==
Every human being must learn a set of skills that is beneficial for the environments and communities they live in. Adaptive skills are stepping stones toward accessing and benefiting from local or remote communities. This means that, in urban environments, to go to the movies, a child will have to learn to navigate through the town or take the bus, read the movie schedule, and pay for the movie. Adaptive skills allow for safer exploration because they provide the learner with an increased awareness of his/her surroundings and of changes in context, that require new adaptive responses to meet the demands and dangers of that new context. Adaptive skills may generate more opportunities to engage in meaningful social interactions and acceptance. Adaptive skills are socially acceptable and desirable at any age and regardless of gender (with the exception of gender specific biological differences such as menstrual care skills, etc.)

===Learning adaptive skills===
Adaptive skills encompass a range of daily situations and they usually start with a [[task analysis]]. The task analysis will reveal all the steps necessary to perform the task in the natural environment. The use of behavior analytic procedures has been documented, with children, adolescents and adults, under the guidance of behavior analysts&lt;ref&gt;[[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]&lt;/ref&gt; and supervised behavioral technicians. The list of applications has a broad scope and it is in continuous expansion as more research is carried out in applied behavior analysis (see ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'', ''[[The Analysis of Verbal Behavior]]'').

== Practopoietic theory ==
According to '''practopoietic''' theory,&lt;ref name=Nikolic2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; creation of adaptive behavior involves special, ''poietic'' interactions among different levels of system organization. These interactions are described on the basis of [[cybernetic]] theory in particular, [[good regulator]] theorem. In practopoietic systems, lower levels of organization determine the properties of higher levels of organization, but not the other way around. This ensures that lower levels of organization (e.g., genes) always possess cybernetically more general knowledge than the higher levels of organization&amp;mdash;knowledge at a higher level being a special case of the knowledge at the lower level. At the highest level of organization lies the overt behavior. Cognitive operations lay in the middle parts of that hierarchy, above genes and below behavior. For behavior to be adaptive, at least three adaptive traverses are needed.

==Publication history==
Early in its production, the book was partially funded through crowd-sourced fundraising site [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1311198387/original-graphic-novel-all-fall-down-by-casey-jone/ | title=The project's Kickstarter Page| accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Thirteen-year-old Sophie Mitchell just accidentally stole every superpower known to man. She can't turn them off or give them back. The world must now make do without their most powerful heroes, a team known as The Pantheon, and the heroes themselves must come to terms with their changing identities, helplessness, and a looming threat that suddenly appears.

The '''''Assumption of the Virgin between St. Miniato and St. Julian''''' is a painting by the Italian early Renaissance master [[Andrea del Castagno]], executed around 1449-1450. It is now housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of [[Berlin]].

==History==
An inscription mentioned by [[Filippo Baldinucci]], dated 20 November 1449, reported that the altarpiece was commissioned by Leonardo di Francesco di Nardo Falladanzi, the rector of [[San Miniato tra le Torri]], a church in Florence. Falladanzi kept a notebook in which he noted that he paid "maestro Andrea, pintore" 104 lire for an altarpiece for the main altar of the church.&lt;ref&gt;John Richard Spencer, ''Andrea Del Castagno and His Patrons,'' Durham: Duke University Press, 1991, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was demolished around 1888 (it was located where the main post office is today), and its heritage was dispersed, after which Andrea del Castagno's ''Assumption'' was acquired by Berlin's Gemäldegalerie.

==Description==

The painting portrays Mary in a wide blue cloak, while she is lifted up from a sepulchre depicted in perspective. The cloak, as typical in Andrea del Castagno, is painted with a heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. The sepulchre contains roses, a flower usually associated with the Virgin. She is carried within a brilliant [[aureola#Mandorla|mandorla]] by three angels.

At Mary's sides, both with a red aureola, are [[Julian the Hospitaller|St. Julian]] (left, with a sword) and [[Minias of Florence|St. Minias of Florence]] (right, with a stick and a crown). While the Virgin is portrayed in a realistic posture, the two saints have a more mystic and static appearance. Both men are elegantly dressed in the most expensive of contemporary costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the damask fabrics, but also the saturated red color indicate the costliness of their garments.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, ''Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The background was painted in gold, with a blending effect in correspondence of the saints' aureolas.

To explore [[Pandoran biosphere|Pandora's biosphere]], scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former [[United States Marine|Marine]], replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a [[Pandoran biosphere#Fauna|thanator]] and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.

[[Colonel]] Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's [[private military company|private security force]], promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,&lt;ref name="Script25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxscreenings.com/media/pdf/JamesCameronAVATAR.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q2mqY36B?url=http://www.foxscreenings.com/media/pdf/JamesCameronAVATAR.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Avatar |page=25 |accessdate=February 9, 2010 |last=Cameron |first=James |work=Avatar Screenings |publisher=Fox and its Related Entities |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an [[wikt:outpost|outpost]]. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,&lt;ref name="Script8and15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxscreenings.com/media/pdf/JamesCameronAVATAR.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nQAunHrW?url=http://www.foxscreenings.com/media/pdf/JamesCameronAVATAR.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2010 |title=Avatar |pages=8 and 15 |accessdate=February 9, 2010 |last=Cameron |first=James |work=Avatar Screenings |publisher=Fox and its Related Entities |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.

Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the [[biological neural network]] native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.

To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.

During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when [[Characters and wildlife in Avatar#Fauna|Pandoran wildlife]] unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an [[mecha|AMP suit]], escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.

With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred&lt;!-- NOTE: AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION, IT WAS DECIDED ''not'' TO USE THE WORDS "SOUL" OR "CONSCIOUSNESS" HERE, AS BOTH RAISED OBJECTIONS. --&gt; into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

Rider Haggard]].&lt;ref name="QA" /&gt; In {{Nowrap|August 1996}}, Cameron announced that after completing ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', he would film ''Avatar'', which would make use of synthetic, or [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]], actors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996" /&gt; The project would cost $100&amp;nbsp;million and involve at least six actors in leading roles "who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2009/08/james-camerons-avatar-hollywood-betting-big-on-3-d-future-after-years-of-dismissing-3-d-as-childs-play-hollywood-studio.html|title="Avatar": James Cameron's New SciFi Thriller  -The Official Trailer (VIDEO)|website=The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Randy McMullen|author2=Joe Garofoli|title=|work=People|date=August 9, 1996}}{{verify source|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref --&gt; Visual effects house [[Digital Domain]], with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a ''[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]'' cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10&amp;nbsp;million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for ''Avatar'', which he showed to Fox executives in {{Nowrap|October 2005}}.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grover |first=R |author2=Lowry, T. |author3=White, M. |title=King of the World (Again)|date=January 21, 2010|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_05/b4165048396178.htm|pages = 1–4| accessdate = January 26, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125173417/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_05/b4165048396178.htm| archivedate=January 25, 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their [[Na'vi language|language]] was created by Dr. [[Paul Frommer]], a linguist at [[University of Southern California|USC]].&lt;ref name="QA" /&gt; The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's [[phoneme]]s include [[ejective consonant]]s (such as the "kx" in "skxawng") that are found in the [[Amharic]] language of [[Ethiopia]], and the initial "ng" that Cameron may have taken from New Zealand [[Māori language|Māori]].&lt;ref name="radionz1" /&gt; Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's [[Scenic design|set designers]] met with Jodie S.

From 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator [[Wayne Barlowe]] and renowned concept artist [[Jordu Schell]], to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://io9.com/5354315/avatar-concept-designer-reveals-the-secrets-of-the-navi|title = Avatar Concept Designer Reveals the Secrets of the Na'vi|work = [[io9]]|accessdate = April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Neil | last1 = Kendricks|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/07/cameron-the-science-geek-who-became-a-movie-titan/|title = Cameron, the Science Geek Who Became a Movie Titan for the Ages|work = [[U-T San Diego]]|date = March 7, 2010|accessdate = April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Nowrap|July 2006}}, Cameron announced that he would film ''Avatar'' for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by {{Nowrap|February 2007}}.&lt;ref name="extravaganza"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Sheigh |last1=Crabtree |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/columns/film_reporter_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002801137 |title=Cameron comes back with CG extravaganza |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 7, 2006 |accessdate=October 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814194411/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/columns/film_reporter_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002801137 |archivedate=August 14, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following August, the visual effects studio [[Weta Digital]] signed on to help Cameron produce ''Avatar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Lynn | last1 = Smith|title=Special-Effects Giant Signs on for 'Avatar'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Winston]], who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined ''Avatar'' to help with the film's designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Jody|author2=James Cameron|title=The Winston Effect|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|date=October 2006|isbn=1-84576-150-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 22, 2006--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Production design]] for the film took several years.

While these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to ''Avatar'' because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, ''Titanic'', even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt; Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer [[Jon Landau (film producer)|Jon Landau]]'s office to represent the film's uncertain future.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt; In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], showing his [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] to then-chairman [[Dick Cook]].&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt; However, when [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] attempted to take over, Fox exercised its [[right of first refusal]].&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt; In {{Nowrap|October 2006}}, Fox finally agreed to commit to making ''Avatar'' after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237&amp;nbsp;million budget.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt; After Fox accepted ''Avatar'', one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, "I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you ''can'' do this&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of Avatar |last=Duncan |first=Jody |author2=Lisa Fitzpatrick|year=2010|publisher=[[Abrams Books]]|location=United States |isbn=0-8109-9706-1 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Cameron described ''Avatar'' as "a futuristic tale set on a planet 200&amp;nbsp;years hence&amp;nbsp;... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling".&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The {{Nowrap|January 2007}} press release described the film as "an emotional journey of redemption and revolution" and said the story is of "a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in [[biodiversity]], who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of [[wikt:phantasmagoria|phantasmagorical]] plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.&lt;ref name="starts" /&gt;

Estimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310&amp;nbsp;million to produce and an estimated $150&amp;nbsp;million for marketing, noting that about $30&amp;nbsp;million in [[tax credit]]s will lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.&lt;ref name="www.nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes budget" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanityfair"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keegan |first=R. |title=How Much Did Avatar Really Cost? |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/12/how-much-did-avatar-really-cost.html |date=December 3, 2009 |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114015407/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/12/how-much-did-avatar-really-cost.html |archivedate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A studio spokesperson said that the budget was "$237&amp;nbsp;million, with $150&amp;nbsp;million for promotion, end of story."&lt;ref name="Patten (2009)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patten |first=D. |title='Avatar's' True Cost&amp;nbsp;– and Consequences |url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/true-cost-and-consequences-avatar-11206?page=1 |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher=The Wrap |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m4EySibe?url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/true-cost-and-consequences-avatar-11206 |archivedate=December 16, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Avatar'' is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of [[imperialism]] and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name="themes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Ordoña |title=Eye-popping 'Avatar' pioneers new technology |date=December 13, 2009 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst communications Inc |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/12/11/PK4B1B0EHD.DTL&amp;type=movies |accessdate=April 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212220623/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F12%2F11%2FPK4B1B0EHD.DTL&amp;type=movies |archivedate=February 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120505035317/http://www.webcitation.org/5pLMKz92a Archived version {{Nowrap|April 29}}, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cameron said his inspiration was "every single science fiction book I read as a kid", and that he was particularly striving to update the style of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs|Edgar Rice Burroughs's]] ''[[John Carter (character)|John Carter]]'' series and the deep jungles of Pandora were visualized from Disney's 37th animated film, ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''.&lt;ref name="QA2" /&gt; He acknowledged that ''Avatar'' shares themes with the films ''[[At Play in the Fields of the Lord]]'', ''[[The Emerald Forest]]'', and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with ''[[Dances with Wolves]],'' where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.&lt;ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/james-cameron-the-new-trek-rocks-but-transformers-is-gimcrackery/ |title=James Cameron: Yes, 'Avatar' is 'Dances with Wolves' in space&amp;nbsp;... sorta &amp;#124 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimesblogs |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sankei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/091225/tnr0912250750004-n2.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q2n1zL3E?url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/091225/tnr0912250750004-n2.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=新作「アバター」宮崎アニメにオマージュ Ｊ・キャメロン監督 (New Film ''Avatar'' Homage to Miyazaki's Animated Film: J.

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term ''[[Avatar]]'', to which he replied, "It's an incarnation of one of the [[Hindu deities|Hindu gods]] taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body."&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1576622,00.html|title=Q&amp;A with James Cameron|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Winters Keegan|first=Rebecca|date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avatarjakeneytiri.jpg|thumb|right|Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.&lt;ref name="themes" /&gt;]]
The look of the Na'vi&amp;nbsp;– the humanoids indigenous to Pandora&amp;nbsp;– was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on ''Avatar''. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet ({{Nowrap|4 m}}) tall, which he thought was "kind of a cool image".&lt;ref name="themes" /&gt; Also he said, "I just like blue.

The Na'vi were based on them.&lt;ref name="themes" /&gt;

For the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a [[star-crossed]] love theme, and acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film ''Titanic.'' An interviewer stated, "Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities."&lt;ref name="www.MTV.Com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Ditzian, with reporting by Josh Horowitz |title=James Cameron Compares His 'Avatar' And 'Titanic' Couples.

To create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the ''[[Noble Corporation|Noble]] Clyde Boudreaux''&lt;ref name="NobleClydeBoudreaux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noblecorp.com/Fleet/RigDetail.asp?RigAbbrev_CH=NCB|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130205313/http://www.noblecorp.com/Fleet/RigDetail.asp?RigAbbrev_CH=NCB|archivedate=January 30, 2012 |title=Noble Clyde Boudreaux| accessdate=January 31, 2010 |publisher=[[Noble Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil platform in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] during {{Nowrap|June 2007}}.

Cameron said that he wanted to make "something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that" but also have a conscience "that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man". He added that "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".&lt;ref name="Avatar Friday"&gt;{{cite news|last=Press |first=Associated |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6047137/Avatar-Friday-fans-will-be-shown-preview-of-James-Camerons-3-D-film.html |title='Avatar Friday': fans will be shown preview of James Cameron's 3-D film |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 20, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326135042/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6047137/Avatar-Friday-fans-will-be-shown-preview-of-James-Camerons-3-D-film.html| archivedate=March 26, 2010 | deadurl=no}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120505032911/http://www.webcitation.org/5pNQl8RRK Archived version {{Nowrap|April 30}}, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron acknowledges that ''Avatar'' implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the [[Iraq War]] and the impersonal nature of [[mechanized warfare]] in general. In reference to the use of the term ''[[shock and awe]]'' in the film, Cameron said, "We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America."&lt;ref name="Hoyle2009" /&gt; He said in later interviews, "...&amp;nbsp;I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/movies/13avatar.html|author=John Anderson|title=Alternate World, Alternate Technology|work=The New York Times|date=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, "The film is definitely not anti-American."&lt;ref name="nytimesqa"&gt;{{cite news

A scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the [[September&amp;nbsp;11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], Cameron said he had been "surprised at how much it did look like {{Nowrap|September 11}}".&lt;ref name="Hoyle2009"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Hoyle |title=War on Terror backdrop to James Cameron's Avatar|date=December 11, 2009|work = The Australian|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/war-on-terror-backdrop-to-james-camerons-avatar/story-e6frg8pf-1225809286903|accessdate = December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Principal photography]] for ''Avatar'' began in {{Nowrap|April 2007}} in Los Angeles and [[Wellington]], New Zealand. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. "Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at," Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sharon Waxman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/movies/08cnd-cameron.html|title='Titanic' Director Joins Fox on $200&amp;nbsp;Million Film|work=The New York Times|date=January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D [[Fusion Camera System]], developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.&lt;ref name="popularmechanics"&gt;{{cite news|author=Anne Thompson |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4339455.html?page=2 |title=How James Cameron's Innovative New 3D Tech Created ''Avatar'' |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=January 2010 |accessdate=December 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214063740/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4339455.html?page=2 |archivedate=December 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Nowrap|January 2007}}, Fox had announced that [[3-D film|3-D]] filming for ''Avatar'' would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher [[frame rate]] to make [[strobing]] less noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=David S.|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=December 26, 2009|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117983864.html?categoryid=1043&amp;cs=1|title=James Cameron supercharges 3-D|work=Variety| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113211622/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117983864.html?categoryid=1043&amp;cs=1| archivedate=January 13, 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional [[miniature effect|miniatures]].&lt;ref name="epic1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Anne Thompson|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1c5a3d24ccc0c11be5f736c8e625bd90|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110054929/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1c5a3d24ccc0c11be5f736c8e625bd90|archivedate=January 10, 2007|title=Cameron sets live-action, CG epic for 2009|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During filming, Cameron made use of his [[virtual camera system]], a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, "It's like a big, powerful [[game engine]]. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale."&lt;ref name="Waxmantimes"&gt;{{cite news|author = Sharon Waxman|title = Computers Join Actors in Hybrids On Screen|work = The New York Times|date = January 9, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/movies/09came.html|accessdate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sc-ent-0224-avatar-actors-20100224,0,1272757.story |author=Rachel Abramowitz |title=Do the 'Avatar' actors deserve recognition? |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301025506/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sc-ent-0224-avatar-actors-20100224%2C0%2C1272757.story |archivedate=March 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron described the system as a "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/145382/Avatar-Director-James-Cameron-s-crowning-glory|author=Henry Fitzherbert|title=Avatar: Director James Cameron's crowning glory |work=Daily Express |location=UK|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron gave fellow directors [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Peter Jackson]] a chance to test the new technology.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite news|author=James Rampton |url=http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/features/article2087309.ece |title=James Cameron: King of all he surveys |work=The Independent |location=London |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=December 20, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108222329/http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/features/article2087309.ece |archivedate=January 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg said, "I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation&amp;nbsp;... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater."&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com" /&gt; Spielberg and [[George Lucas]] were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.&lt;ref name="media-freaks.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Aldric |last=Chang |title=Reading Between the Lines: First Image of James Cameron's Avatar |publisher=media-freaks.com |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |url=http://blog.media-freaks.com/reading-lines-image-james-camerons-avatar/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017045200/http://blog.media-freaks.com/reading-lines-image-james-camerons-avatar/ |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a "simulcam" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in [[augmented reality]] and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.&lt;ref name="makingofavatar" /&gt;

Due to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only [[Plant-based diet|plant-based]] (vegan) food to be served on set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/animal-agriculture-choking-earth-making-sick-climate-food-environmental-impact-james-cameron-suzy-amis-cameron|title=Animal agriculture is choking the Earth and making us sick.

"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment."&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt; Although he felt ''Avatar'' would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target [[Demographics|demographic]],&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt; he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: "If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience."&lt;ref name="SciFiWire"&gt;{{cite web|first=Iain|last=Blair|title=Avatar's Cameron shrugs off buzz&amp;nbsp;– and promises a sequel|publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire|SciFiWIRE.com]]|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=January 1, 2010|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/12/avatars-cameron-shrugs-of.php| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102105042/http://scifiwire.com/2009/12/avatars-cameron-shrugs-of.php| archivedate=January 2, 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron was aware of the sentiment that ''Avatar'' would need significant "repeat business" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed ''Avatar'' could inspire the same "sharing" reaction as ''Titanic''. He said that film worked because, "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it.

After the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing ''Titanic''{{'}}s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.&lt;ref name="omg.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news |title='Avatar' Hits $1&amp;nbsp;Billion Mark, Eyes 'Titanic' Record |work=[[omg!]] |publisher=[[Yahoo!

"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second.

Although analysts have been unable to agree that ''Avatar''{{'}}s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically "the dumping ground for the year's weakest films", and this also applied to 2010.&lt;ref name="www.newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite news| first=Sarah|last=Ball|title=Why 'Avatar' Could Out-Earn 'Titanic'.

Cameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt; ''Titanic'' capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.&lt;ref name="www.newsweek.com" /&gt; Additionally, ''Avatar'' established itself as a "must-see" event. Gray said, "At this point, people who are going to see ''Avatar'' are going to see ''Avatar'' and would even if the slate was strong."&lt;ref name="www.newsweek.com" /&gt; Marketing the film as a "novelty factor" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.&lt;ref name="www.newsweek.com" /&gt; The "[[Academy Award|Oscar]] buzz" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. "Two-thirds of ''Titanic''{{'}}s haul was earned overseas, and ''Avatar'' [tracked] similarly&amp;nbsp;...''Avatar'' opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets "such as Russia, where ''Titanic'' saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" with "more screens and moviegoers" than before.&lt;ref name="www.newsweek.com" /&gt;

According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', films in 3D accumulated $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2009, "a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross". The increased ticket price&amp;nbsp;– an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets&amp;nbsp;– helped the film.&lt;ref name="www.newsweek.com" /&gt; Likewise, ''Entertainment Weekly'' attributed the film's success to 3D glasses, but also to its "astronomic [[Word of mouth|word-of-mouth]]". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but "the buzz" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.&lt;ref name="hollywoodinsider.ew.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam B. |last=Vary |title=Box Office Report: 'Avatar' is No. 1 again, soars past $1&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/01/03/box-office-avatar-soars-past-1-billion-worldwide/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q2lIbBX4?url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/01/03/box-office-avatar-soars-past-1-billion-worldwide/ |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray said ''Avatar'' having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. "The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes," he said, "but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: ''Titanic'' (historical events), the ''Star Wars'' movies (an established film franchise), or ''The Lord of the Rings'' (literature).

The '''Barton Cylinder''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[creation myth]], written on a clay cylinder in the mid to late 3rd millennium [[Anno Domini|BC]], which is now in the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. [[Joan Goodnick Westenholz]] suggests it dates to around 2400 BC ([[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|ED III]]).&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel Ángel Borrás|author2=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|title=La fundación de la ciudad: mitos y ritos en el mundo antiguo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yPVFGPr0aoC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Edicions UPC|isbn=978-84-8301-387-8|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The cylinder is inscribed with a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] mythological text, found at the site of [[Nippur]] in 1889 during excavations conducted by the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The cylinder takes its name from [[George Aaron Barton|George Barton]], who was the first to publish a transcription and translation of the text in 1918 in "[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]".&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;George Aaron Barton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=miscellaneous+babylonian+inscriptions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f9Tqkb8rHg&amp;sig=fNUlMe6MbiOARgsCsZH2pRSs528&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ssvVS43MFYSclgfGr7W6CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions''] (Yale University Press, 1918).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Catalogue of the Babylonian Section (CBS) number 8383. [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] referred to it as ''The Nippur Cylinder'' and suggested it may date as far back as 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramer|first=Samuel Noah|title=Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.|publisher=Forgotten Books|date=2007|orig-year=1961|isbn=978-1-60506-049-1|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t16tDOHZLLEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Nippur+cylinder%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2fHVS-bpOs2fOJmn6YsO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nippur%20cylinder%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cylinder dates to the Old Babylonian period, but Falkenstein (1951) surmises that the composition was written in Archaic, pre-Ur III cuneiform, likely dating to the Akkad dynasty (c. 2300 BC). He concludes a non-written literary history that was characterised and repeated in future texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bendt Alster, "On the Earliest Sumerian Literary Tradition," ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'' 28 (1976) 109-126. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1359501]&lt;/ref&gt; Jan van Dijk concurs with this suggestion that it is a copy of a far older story predating neo-Sumerian times.&lt;ref name="selskapNederland1964"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norsk orientalsk selskap|author2=Oosters Genootschap in Nederland|author3=Orientalsk samfund (Denmark)|title=van Dijk, J.

==Content==
The most recent edition was published by Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz in 1994.&lt;ref name="Alster"&gt;Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz, "The Barton Cylinder," ''Acta Sumeriologica'' 16 (1994) 15-46. [http://cdl.museum.upenn.edu/s/x/resources/barton-cylinder.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Black (assyriologist)|Jeremy Black]] calls the work "a beautiful example of Early Dynastic [[calligraphy]]" and discussed the text "where primeval cosmic events are imagined." Along with Peeter Espak, he notes that Nippur is pre-existing before creation when heaven and earth separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/handle/10062/15915/espak_peeter.pdf;jsessionid=54A91837C3AAA6666B5A952ACB757AE2?sequence=1 Espak, Peeter. ''The god Enki in Sumerian Royal Ideology and Mythology'', Tartu University Press, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Nippur, he suggests is transfigured by the mythological events into both a "scene of a mythic drama" and a real place, indicating "the location becomes a [[metaphor]]."&lt;ref name="JacobsenAbusch2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thorkild Jacobsen|author2=I. Tzvi Abusch|title=Jeremy Black in ''Riches hidden in secret places: ancient Near Eastern studies in memory of Thorkild Jacobsen''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4s5MveufJgC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-061-3|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black details the beginning of the myth: "Those days were indeed faraway days. Those nights were indeed faraway nights. Those years were indeed faraway years. The storm roared, the lights flashed. In the sacred area of Nibru (Nippur), the storm roared, the lights flashed. Heaven talked with Earth, Earth talked with Heaven."&lt;ref name="JacobsenAbusch2002"/&gt; The content of the text deals with [[Ninhursag]], described by Bendt and Westenholz as the "older sister of [[Enlil]]." The first part of the myth deals with the description of the sanctuary of [[Nippur]], detailing a [[sacred marriage]] between [[Anu|An]] and [[Ninhursag]] during which heaven and earth touch. Piotr Michalowski says that in the second part of the text "we learn that someone, perhaps Enki, made [[love]] to the [[mother goddess]], Ninhursag, the sister of Enlil and planted the seed of seven (twins of) deities in her midst."&lt;ref name="Prosecký1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiří Prosecký|title=Piotr Michalowski in ''Intellectual life of the Ancient Near East: papers presented at the 43rd Rencontre assyriologique international, Prague, July 1–5, 1996'', p. 240.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcuRAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=1998|publisher=Oriental Institute|isbn=978-80-85425-30-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alster and Westenholz translation reads: "Enlil's older sister / with Ninhursag / he had intercourse / he kissed her / the semen of seven twins / he planted in her womb"&lt;ref name="Alster"/&gt;

Peeter Espak clarifies the text gives no proof of Enki's involvement, however he notes "the motive described here seems to be similar enough to the intercourse conducted by Enki in the later myth "Enki and Ninhursag" for suggesting the same parties acting also in the Old-Sumerian myth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/handle/10062/958/espakpeeter.pdf;jsessionid=F71776D1F928C8B023CAFF1BB333185A?sequence=5 Espak, Peeter., ''Ancient Near Eastern Gods Ea and Enki; Diachronical analysis of texts and images from the earliest sources to the neo-sumerian period'', Masters thesis for Tartu University, Faculty of Theology, Chair for Ancient Near Eastern Studies, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barton's translation and discussion==
Barton's original translation and commentary suggested a primitive sense of religion where "chief among these spirits were gods, who, however capricious, were the givers of vegetation and life." He discusses the text as a series of ''entreatments'' and ''appeals'' to the various provider and protector gods and goddesses, such as [[Enlil]], in lines such as "O divine lord, protect the little habitation."&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt; Barton suggests that several concepts within the text were later [[recycled]] in the much later [[Bible|biblical]] [[Book of Genesis]]. He describes Ninhursag in terms of a [[snake goddess]] who creates enchantments, incantations, and oils, to protect from demons, saying: "Her counsels strengthen the wise divinity of [[Anu|An]]", a statement which reveals a point of view similar to that of Genesis 3, ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|3:1|HE}}) 'Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field." Barton also finds reference to the [[tree of life]] in the text, from which he claimed: "As it stands the passage seems to imply a knowledge on the part of the Babylonians of a story kindred to that of Genesis ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:9|HE}}). However, in the absence of context one cannot build on this." Finding yet another parallel with Genesis, Barton mentions that "The [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] are twice spoken of as holy rivers &amp;ndash; and the 'mighty abyss' (or 'well of the mighty abyss') is appealed-to for protection."

His translation reads: "The holy Tigris, the holy Euphrates / the holy sceptre of Enlil / establish [[Hursag|Kharsag]]."

[[File:Pitch class space star.svg|thumb|For comparison, the chromatic scale produced by an aliquant bisector or generator, the perfect fifth, creating a circle of fifths]]

In [[diatonic set theory]], a '''bisector''' divides the [[octave]] approximately in half (the equal tempered [[tritone]] is exactly half the octave) and may be used in place of a [[generated collection|generator]] to derive [[Set (music)|collections]] for which [[structure implies multiplicity]] is not true such as the [[ascending melodic minor]], [[harmonic minor]], and [[octatonic scale]]s. Well formed generated collections generators and bisectors coincide, such as the [[perfect fifth]] ([[circle of fifths]]) in the [[diatonic collection]]. The term was introduced by [[Jay Rahn]] (1977), who considers any division between one and two thirds as approximately half ([[major third]] to [[minor sixth]] or 400 to 800 cents) and who applied the term only the equally spaced collections. Clough and Johnson both adapt the term to apply to [[generic interval|generic scale steps]]. Rahn also uses '''''aliquant bisector''''' for bisectors which may be used to generate every note in a collection, in which case the bisector and the number of notes must be [[coprime]]. Bisectors may be used to produce the [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[harmonic minor]], and [[ascending melodic minor]] collections. (Johnson 2003, p.97, 101, 158n10-12)

The diatonic scale may be derived from a chain of perfect fifths:
  P5 P5 P5 P5 P5
 F  C  G  D  A  B = C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C.
 5, 0, 7, 2, 9, e = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, e, 0.
  +7 +7 +7 +7 +7 (mod 12)

For example, the octatonic scale may be derived similarly to derivations of the diatonic scale by a chain of perfect fifths (a generator), by using a bisector of 5 scale steps (3 may also be used). However, five steps in the octatonic scale alternates between 7 and 8 semitones, so it is a bisector and not a generator:
  A5 P5 A5 P5 A5 P5 A5 P5
 C  Ab Eb B  Gb D  A  F  C = C  D  Eb F  Gb Ab A  B  C.
 0, 8, 3, e, 6, 2, 9, 5, 0 = 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, e, 0.
  +8 +7 +8 +7 +8 +7 +8 +7

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3699">'''Cast Earth''' is a proprietary natural building material developed since the mid-1990s by [[Harris Lowenhaupt]] and Michael Frerking&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Matthew R. ''When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self-reliance, Sustainability, and Surviving the Long Emergency''. White River Junction, VT: Chelsea Green Pub., 2008. 189. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the earlier Turkish [[Alker]], which is a [[concrete]]-like composite with [[soil]] of a suitable composition as its bulk component stabilized with about 15% [[gypsum|calcined gypsum]] (plaster of Paris) instead of [[Portland cement]]. It can be used to form solid walls that need not be reinforced with a [[steel frame]] or [[timber framing]], unless extra [[Earthquake engineering|seismic reinforcement]] is necessary. Forms are set up and filled with Cast Earth, which sets quickly and solidly. Once the forms are removed the wall stays sound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cast Earth is often promoted as an environmentally friendly alternative to cast concrete. The Cast Earth slurry is poured in forms similar to concrete construction and is a suitable alternative to concrete walls in areas prone to hurricane damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel D.|last=Chiras|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;pg=PA235|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology has the potential to be able to compete against traditional wood frame construction in terms of cost. Cast Earth can also be installed with a lot less labor than most green alternatives, such as [[rammed earth]]. Since the product is proprietary, installation requires a crew trained by the Cast Earth company, leaving it out of reach of do-it-yourself builders. It is also not cost-effective for contractors unless they do a lot of Cast Earth installations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self-Reliance, Sustainability, and Surviving the Long Emergency, 2nd Edition|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SKt_u35t9hsC&amp;pg=PA193|publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing|date = 2008|isbn = 978-1-60358-095-3|language = en|first = Matthew|last = Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The calcined gypsum sets quickly. When calcined gypsum is added to soil, the setting time is reduced even further, to mere minutes. Often this quick setting is too fast and a retardant must be added to the mix so it can be poured. In Alker, lime is added to extend working time to 20 minutes. Cast Earth uses another retardant for an even greater working time. This ingredient is proprietary and a carefully guarded secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The New Ecological Home: The Complete Guide to Green Building Options|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EikhMnT_p3wC&amp;pg=PA165|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-931498-16-6|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the material is dry, it is similar to [[adobe]] in various ways, outperforming it in [[tensile strength]], hardness, and erosion resistance. It also has less tendency to crack and shrink. Some Cast Earth walls do soak up water, however, depending upon the porosity of the earthen materials used.  For example, decomposed granite tends to be prone to absorption if the eaves of the roof is inadequate or it is exposed to water for a prolonged time, i.e. days.  Limestone materials however, tend to repel water once the walls are completely dried/cured.

'''Clara'''  is the main character in the French Novel ''[[The Torture Garden (novel)|''The Torture Garden'']]'' ({{fr icon}} ''Le Jardin des supplices'', 1899), by [[Octave Mirbeau]].

== A free woman ==

Clara, who has no last name or civil status, is an [[England|English]] woman with red hair and green eyes--“a greyish green of the young fruits of the almond tree.” Single, rich and [[bisexual]], Clara lives near [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and leads an idle existence, entirely devoted to finding perverse pleasures. She is fully emancipated, financially and sexually, and freed from oppressive laws and taboos prevailing in the West and which, according to her critique of [[anarchist]] inspiration, prohibit the development of the individual. Clara thus claims to enjoy complete freedom. She particularly enjoys visiting the city prison every week, which is open to tourists on Wednesday. Clara delights in watching the death row inmates, many of whom are innocent or guilty of minor offenses, being brutally tortured and put to death.

This protagonist meets the anonymous narrator, a petty political crook, aboard the ''Saghalien'', where the pseudo-embryologist was sailing to [[Ceylon]], as part of an official mission. In reality, his primary goal is just to distance himself from [[France]]. She seduces him, awakening his sexual desire along with the need to unburden himself, and becomes his mistress. She takes him with her to [[China]], where both the narrator and Clara share a lover, Annie.

Two years later, the narrator, who had fled from Clara's pernicious embraces and went to Annam, returns. Clara regains her power over him and is pleased to dominate and humiliate him. She takes him to visit the [[torture]] garden of the prison, where they wander around. During a ''crescendo''  of horror, Clara experiences waves of ecstasy and has a hysterical fit.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pierre Michel]],  « Mirbeau et l’hystérie », in ''Écrire la maladie – Du bon usage des maladies'', Actes du colloque d’Angers, Imago, 2002, p. 71-84.&lt;/ref&gt; She then feels almost purified after  climaxing. The scene takes place in a "flower boat", a floating brothel, where orgies take place. According to the narrator, the area is more like a place of punishment than a garden of delights. But, as  Ki Pai, the boatman who regularly accompanies Clara, says, "It will start all over again!"

== A fantastic and sadistic woman ==

The enigmatic character of Clara, "fairy of mass graves, angel of decomposition and decay", seems to be based on pure fantasy, unrelated to a plausible reality that the novel would be expected to reproduce mimetically, to the point at which the narrator becomes haggard wondering whether she is not a figment of his imagination: "Does she really exist?... I wonder, not without fear... Was she not born out of my debauchery and fever?... Is she like one of those impossible images, like a child in a nightmare? ... A criminal temptation, lust sparking the sick imaginations of murderers and madmen?... Could she be nothing but my soul, escaped outside of my body, despite myself, which materialized in the form of sin?... "

This character is an illustration of a ''fin-de-siècle'' [[femme fatale]], an all-powerful ghoul who treats men as puppets and enjoys their humiliation. Sadistic and voyeuristic, she experiences an intense and ever growing pleasure to view sophisticated executions, whose art was perfected by China, as opposed to industrial and technological massacres, which were practiced on a large scale in Europe without any concern for art. As Jean-Luc Planchais wrote, she is a "bloody tribade who castrates ideals", who "believes herself to be God, the destruction of the other confirms her supremacy".&lt;ref&gt;See Jean-Luc Planchais, [http://mirbeau.asso.fr/darticlesfrancais/Planchais-clara.pdf « Clara : supplices et blandices dans ''Le Jardin'' »], ''[[Cahiers Octave Mirbeau]]'', n° 8, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, she is equally masochistic because she likes to imagine herself in the role of a victim whose suffering is an unparalleled source of ecstasy. For example, when witnessing the “iron rods” torture, she says, "It felt like the rod entered the small of my back with every strike... It was atrocious and very sweet!" Perverse, she is an apologist for "lust" in all its forms and sees it as "the perfection of love" because "all the mental faculties of man are revealed and sharpened" and that "it is only by lust" that can achieve "development total personality. " And it is through lust that she intends to initiate the shy narrator.

This character's perhaps monstrous values and claims seem totally at odds with the humanism of [[Octave Mirbeau]], a defender of [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. However, one could make the argument that the novelist was using Clara's character as a means of denouncing English and French [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Michel]], [https://www.scribd.com/doc/9090760/ « Octave Mirbeau et le colonialisme »], Brussels, Librairie Van Balberghe, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The reader can only be disconcerted and uncomfortable and may lose his aesthetic and ethical bearings.

'''"Daughter from California" syndrome''' is a phrase used in the [[Medicine|medical profession]] to describe a situation in which a long-lost distant relative arrives at the hospital at which a dying elderly relative is being treated, and insists that the medical team pursue aggressive measures to prolong the patient's life, or otherwise challenges the care the patient is being given. In his 2015 book ''[[The Conversation: A Revolutionary Plan for End-of-Life Care]]'', American doctor [[Angelo Volandes]] ascribes this to "guilt and denial," "not necessarily what is best for the patient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volandes|first1=Angelo|title=The Conversation: a Revolutionary Plan for End-of-Life Care.|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=[S.l.]|isbn=1620408546|pages=60–61}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The "daughter from California" is often described as angry, articulate and informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychiatry: Clinical Cases Uncovered|last = Byrne|first = Nicola|publisher = Wiley|year = 2008|isbn = 9781405159838|location = |pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical professionals say that because the "daughter from California" has been absent from the life and care of the elderly patient, he or she is frequently surprised by the scale of the patient's deterioration, and may have unrealistic expectations about what's medically feasible. He or she may feel guilty about having been absent, and may therefore feel motivated to reassert his or her role as an involved caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruera|first1=edited by Russell K. Portenoy, Eduardo|title=Topics in Palliative Care|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195102452|page=317}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was first documented by [[David Molloy]] and other [[Gerontology|gerontologists]] in a 1991 case report published in the ''[[Journal of the American Geriatrics Society]]'', titled "Decision Making in the Incompetent Elderly: 'The Daughter from California Syndrome'." In the paper, Molloy and colleagues presented strategies intended to help medical staff deal with the difficult family members of mentally incompetent patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Youngner|first1=edited by Maurice D.

In California, the "daughter from California" is known as the "daughter from New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Thomas Grisso, Paul S.|title=Assessing competence to consent to treatment: a guide for physicians and other health professionals|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195103726|page=159}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''District 9''''' is a 2009 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]], written by Blomkamp and [[Terri Tatchell]], and produced by [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Carolynne Cunningham]]. It is a co-production of New Zealand, the United States, and South Africa. The film stars [[Sharlto Copley]], [[Jason Cope]], and [[David James (actor, born 1972)|David James]], and was adapted from Blomkamp's 2006 short film ''[[Alive in Joburg]]''.

The film is partially presented in a [[found footage (film technique)|found footage]] format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]], [[xenophobia]], and [[social segregation]], begins in an [[alternate history|alternate]] 1982, when an alien ship appears over [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]. When a population of sick and malnourished insect-like aliens is found aboard the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson tries to escape with his son and return home, crossing paths with a bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe. The title and premise of ''District 9'' were inspired by events in [[Cape Town]]'s [[District Six]], during the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era.

A [[viral marketing]] campaign for the film began in 2008 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], while the theatrical trailer debuted in July 2009. ''District 9'' was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on 14 August 2009, in North America and became a financial success, earning over $210 million at the box office. It also received acclaim from critics, who praised the film's direction, performances, themes, and story, and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/oscar-nominations/ |work=The New York Times |title=The 82nd Annual Oscar Nominations |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011036/http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/oscar-nominations/ |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In 1982, an alien ship hovers over [[Johannesburg]]. When investigation teams enter, they discover a population of malnourished extraterrestrials, thereafter nicknamed "prawns". The South African government confines the aliens to District 9, a government camp. In 2010, following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires private military company Multinational United (MNU) to relocate the aliens to a new camp. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints his son-in-law Wikus van de Merwe, a [[wiktionary:nebbish|nebbish]] Afrikaner [[bureaucrat]], to lead the relocation. The relocation uses bribes of cat food, which is addictive for the aliens.

Three aliens—Christopher Johnson, his son, and a friend—are seen scavenging pieces of alien technology, from which they finish distilling a fluid which they collect in a small canister. During an inspection, Wikus discovers and confiscates the canister from the shack of Christopher's friend, but accidentally sprays some of the fluid onto his own face, which causes him to have a momentary seizure. Christopher's friend is subsequently killed by Koobus Venter, a [[mercenary]] soldier employed by MNU.

Wikus's body tissue begins to mutate into alien tissue. He is detained and transported to MNU headquarters for brutal experimentation, where researchers and officials discover that his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to use his transformed arm to wield alien weapons. When MNU doctors try to kill him by surgery to harvest his vital organs, Wikus overpowers them and escapes the facility. Venter and his men hunt Wikus down, while a smear story is broadcast, one that reaches his wife, Tania, claiming that Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from sex with prawns.

Wikus finds refuge in District 9 and learns that Christopher is hiding the command module of their spacecraft and the canister's fluid would be able to reactivate the command module and the dormant mothership. He claims he can reverse Wikus's mutation in the mothership. To recover the canister from MNU headquarters, Wikus obtains alien weapons from District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo and his gang. They use these to assault the headquarters, retrieve the canister, and flee to District 9.

Upon seeing the treatment of his people in the lab, Christopher decides to return to his home planet for help and explains that he cannot undo Wikus's mutation until he returns in three years. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher out and attempts to fly the command module to the mothership, but is almost immediately shot down by Venter and his men. They capture Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang attacks the convoy and seize Wikus.

Christopher's son remotely activates the mothership and an alien mechanized battle suit in Obesandjo's base that kills Obesandjo and his men. Wikus uses the suit to rescue Christopher, who promises to return in three years with a cure for Wikus. Wikus kills all the attacking soldiers before Venter cripples the suit, ejecting Wikus. As he corners a heavily injured Wikus, a group of aliens protect Wikus by killing Venter. The command module is lifted into the mothership and Christopher and his son leave Earth.

A series of news broadcasts are shown about the potential return of the spacecraft and Wikus's whereabouts. MNU's illegal experiments are exposed and District 9 is demolished. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. The final scene shows a fully transformed Wikus in a junkyard, crafting a similar flower.

== Themes ==
Like ''Alive in Joburg'', the short film on which the feature film is based, the setting of ''District 9'' is inspired by historical events during the [[apartheid]] era, particularly alluding to [[District Six]], an inner-city residential area in [[Cape Town]], declared a "whites only" area by the government in 1966, with 60,000 people [[Apartheid#Forced removal|forcibly removed]] to [[Cape Flats]], {{Convert|25|km|abbr=in}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1916009,00.html |title='District 9' Review: The Summer's Coolest Fantasy Film |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=13 August 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816090634/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1916009,00.html |archivedate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also refers to contemporary evictions and forced removals to suburban ghettos in post-apartheid South Africa, as well as the resistance of its residents.&lt;ref name="The real 'District 9' – South Africa's shack dwellers"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=1237&amp;catID=9 |title=The real 'District 9'&amp;nbsp;– South Africa's shack dwellers |publisher=''[[Guardian Weekly]]'' |date=28 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118165406/http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dewaal"&gt;{{Cite web |last=de Waal |first=Shaun |work=Film |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-08-28-loving-the-aliens |title=Loving the Aliens |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'' |date=28 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830174836/http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-08-28-loving-the-aliens |archivedate=30 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the high-profile attempted forced removal of the [[Joe Slovo, Cape Town|Joe Slovo]] informal settlement in Cape Town to [[N2 Gateway#Temporary Relocation Areas in Delft|temporary relocation areas]] in [[Delft, Cape Town|Delft]], plus evictions in the shack settlement, Chiawelo, where the film was actually shot.&lt;ref name="5things" /&gt; [[Blikkiesdorp]], a temporary relocation area in Cape Town, has also been compared with the ''District 9'' camp earning a front-page spread in the ''[[Daily Voice (South African newspaper)|Daily Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blikkiesdoprp housingdisaster has become Cape Flats' own...District 9 in ''[[The Daily Voice (South African newspaper)|The Daily Voice]]'', South Africa, 3 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN affiliated NGO asks the City to reconsider Symphony Way's eviction to Blikkiesdorp which will be decided in Court on Wednesday"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://antieviction.org.za/2009/10/05/un-affiliated-ngo-asks-the-city-to-reconsider-symphony-ways-eviction-to-blikkiesdorp-which-will-be-decided-in-court-on-wednesday/ |title=UN affiliated NGO asks the City to reconsider Symphony Way's eviction to Blikkiesdorp which will be decided in Court on Wednesday |publisher=''[[Anti-Eviction Campaign]]'' |date=5 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121091511/http://antieviction.org.za/2009/10/05/un-affiliated-ngo-asks-the-city-to-reconsider-symphony-ways-eviction-to-blikkiesdorp-which-will-be-decided-in-court-on-wednesday/ |archivedate=21 November 2009 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film emphasizes the irony of Wikus and the impact of his experiences on his personality, which show him becoming more humane as he becomes less biologically human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://movies.msn.com/oscars/geek-oscars/?icid=MOVIES1&amp;GT1=MOVIES1&amp;mpc=2 |title=If Geeks Ran the Oscars |date= |accessdate=16 February 2010 |work=MSN Movies |author=Don Kaye |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224174605/http://movies.msn.com/oscars/geek-oscars/?icid=MOVIES1&amp;GT1=MOVIES1&amp;mpc=2 |archivedate=24 December 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Mikesell from the [[University of Hawaii]] newspaper ''Ka Leo'' writes that "Substitute 'black,' 'Asian,' 'Mexican,' 'illegal,' 'Jew,' or any number of different labels for the word 'prawn' in this film and you will hear the hidden truth behind the dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.knphotographics.com/wp-kaleo/2009/08/26/features/district-9-reveals-human-inhumanity.html |title=''District 9'' reveals human inhumanity |last=Mikesell |first=Chris |date=26 August 2009 |publisher=Ka Leo |accessdate=6 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]] are shown in the form of [[speciesism]]. Used to describe the aliens, the word "prawn" is a reference to the [[Parktown prawn]], a [[Anostostomatidae|king cricket]] species considered a pest in South Africa.&lt;ref name="radiointerview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.highveld.co.za/thelounge/gallery/event.asp?id=565 |title=Interview with Neill Blomkamp on the Highveld Stereo 94.7 radio station |date=19 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830194354/http://www.highveld.co.za/thelounge/gallery/event.asp?id=565 |archivedate=30 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sermon|first1=Sarah|title=Close Encounters of the Invasive Kind: Imperial History in Selected British Novels of Alien-encounter Science Fiction After World War II|date=30 September 2013|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Germany|isbn=978-3643903914|page=66|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copley has said that the theme is not intended to be the main focus of the work, but can work at a subconscious level even if it is not noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/08/xenophobia-racism-drive-alien-relocation-in-district-9/ |title=Xenophobia, Racism Drive Alien Relocation in District 9 |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2009 |work=Wired |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830210737/http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/08/xenophobia-racism-drive-alien-relocation-in-district-9/ |archivedate=30 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duane Dudek of the ''Journal Sentinel'' wrote that "The result is an action film about xenophobia, in which all races of humans are united in their dislike and mistrust of an insect-like species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/movies/53074407.html |title='District 9' social theme isn't so alien – JSOnline |last=Dudek |first=Duane |date=13 August 2009 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |accessdate=6 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723064150/http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/movies/53074407.html |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another underlying theme in ''District 9'' is states' reliance on multinational corporations (whose accountability is unclear and whose interests are not necessarily congruent with democratic principles) as a form of government-funded enforcement. As MNU represents the type of corporation which partners with governments, the negative portrayal of MNU in the film depicts the dangers of outsourcing militaries and bureaucracies to private contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/352.1 |title=Hold the Prawns |work=SACSIS |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922201454/http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/352.1 |archivedate=22 September 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/343.1 |title=District 9, Ugly Marvel |work=SACSIS |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922222034/http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/343.1 |archivedate=22 September 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

=== Development ===
[[File:NeillBlomkampCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Neill Blomkamp]] at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] 28 July 2008]]
Producer [[Peter Jackson]] planned to produce a [[Halo (series)#Film|film adaptation]] based on the ''[[Halo (franchise)|Halo]]'' [[Video game|video-game]] franchise with first-time director [[Neill Blomkamp]]. Due to a lack of financing, the ''Halo'' adaptation was placed on hold. Jackson and Blomkamp discussed pursuing alternative projects and eventually chose to produce and direct, respectively, ''District 9''. Blomkamp had previously directed commercials and short films, but ''District 9'' was his first [[feature film]]. The director co-wrote the script with his wife, [[Terri Tatchell]], and chose to film in South Africa, where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fleming |first=Michael |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/peter-jackson-gears-up-for-district-2-1117975244/ |title=Peter Jackson gears up for 'District' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2018 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leotta 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leotta |first=A. |title=Peter Jackson |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |series=The Bloomsbury Companions to Contemporary Filmmakers |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-62356-096-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gua2CgAAQBAJ |access-date=February 16, 2018 |pages=126–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''District 9'', Tatchell and Blomkamp returned to the world explored in his [[short film]] ''[[Alive in Joburg]]'', choosing characters, moments and concepts that they found interesting including the documentary-style filmmaking, staged interviews, alien designs, alien technology/[[mecha]] suits, and the parallels to racial conflict and segregation in South Africa, and fleshing out these elements for the feature film.&lt;ref name="talks" /&gt;

[[QED International]] financed the [[negative cost]]. After the 2007 [[American Film Market]], QED partnered with [[Sony Pictures|Sony's]] [[TriStar Pictures]] for distribution in several territories.&lt;ref name="sonydistr"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frater |first=Patrick |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975365.html |title=Sony to release Jackson's 'District' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee Jr|first1=John J|last2=Gillen|first2=Anne Marie|title=The Producer's Business Handbook: The Roadmap for the Balanced Film Producer|date=3 November 2010|publisher=Focal Press|location=New York|isbn=0240814630|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
The film was shot on location in Chiawelo, [[Soweto]] during a time of violent unrest in [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] ([[Gauteng]]) and other South African townships involving clashes between native South Africans and Africans born in other countries.&lt;ref name="nyt0805"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=A Young Director Brings a Spaceship and a Metaphor in for a Landing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/movies/06district.html |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher= |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425071554/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/movies/06district.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location that portrays ''District 9'' in itself was in fact a real impoverished neighborhood from which people were being forcibly relocated to [[Subsidized housing|government-subsidised housing]].&lt;ref name="5things" /&gt; Several scenes were shot at the [[Ponte City Apartments|Ponte building]].&lt;ref name="HDVideo4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blair |first=Ian |title=I, Robot |url=http://www.hdvideopro.com/film-and-tv/feature-films/i-robot/page-4 |publisher=Werner Publishing Corp. |accessdate=8 August 2015 |date=10 March 2015 |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713044920/http://www.hdvideopro.com/film-and-tv/feature-films/i-robot/page-4 |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming for ''District 9'' took place during the winter in Johannesburg, South Africa. According to director Neill Blomkamp, during the winter season, Johannesburg "actually looks like [[Chernobyl]]", a "[[Nuclear holocaust|nuclear apocalyptic]] wasteland". Blomkamp wanted to capture the deserted, bleak atmosphere and environment, so he and the crew had to film during the months of June through July. The film took a total of 60 days of shooting. Filming in December raised another issue in that there was much more rain. Due to the rain, there was a lot of greenery to work with, which Blomkamp did not want. In fact, Blomkamp had to cut some of the vegetation in the scenery to portray the setting as desolate and dark.

Blomkamp said no single film influenced ''District 9'', but cited the 1980s "hardcore sci-fi/action" films such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[RoboCop (1987 film)|RoboCop]]'' as subconscious influences. The director said, "I don't know whether the film has that feeling or not for the audience, but I wanted it to have that harsh 1980s kind of vibe—I didn't want it to feel glossy and slick."&lt;ref name="talks" /&gt;

Because of the amount of [[Hand-held camera|hand-held shooting]] required for the film, the producers and crew decided to shoot using the digital [[Red Digital Cinema|Red One]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K]] camera. Cinematographer [[Trent Opaloch]] used nine digital Red Ones owned by Peter Jackson for primary filming.&lt;ref name="caranicas824"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Caranicas |first=Peter |coauthors= |title='District' lenser braces for invasion |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007288.html |date=14 August 2009 |work=International |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to HD Magazine, ''District 9'' was shot on RED One cameras using build 15, Cooke S4 primes and Angenieux zooms. The [[Documentary film|documentary]]-style and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]-style cam footage was shot on the Sony EX1/EX3 XDCAM-HD. Additionally, the post-production team was warned that the most RED Camera footage they could handle a day was about an hour and a half. When that got to five hours a day reinforcements were called in and 120 terabytes of data was filled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.definitionmagazine.com/journal/2009/11/1/attack-of-the-terabytes.html Attack Of The Terabytes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709011335/http://www.definitionmagazine.com/journal/2009/11/1/attack-of-the-terabytes.html |date=9 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual effects ===
Already as a young child living in South Africa, Blomkamp was captivated by artwork and visual effects. "I knew I wanted to be in movies … So I thought I wanted to be in special effects, like model-making and prosthetic effects." The combination of knowing he would find a career in the visual effects area and the advancement of technology allowing better computer graphics capabilities led him to work at a Canadian post-production company as a visual effects artist. The aliens in ''District 9'' were designed by [[Weta Workshop]], and the design was executed by [[Image Engine]].

Blomkamp wanted the aliens to maintain both humanistic and barbaric features in the design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, "They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge." The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, "Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired ... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't."&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;

Blomkamp originally sought to have [[Weta Digital]] design the creatures, but the company was busy with effects for ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. The director then decided to choose a Vancouver-based effects company because he anticipated making films there in the future and because [[British Columbia]] offered a tax credit. Blomkamp met with Image Engine and considered them "a bit of a gamble" since the company had not pursued a project as large as a feature film.&lt;ref name="talks"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=4032 |title=Neill Blomkamp Talks ''District 9'' |work=VFXWorld |publisher=AWN, Inc. |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820182016/http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=4032 |archivedate=20 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the aliens appearing on the operating table in the medical lab, all of them were created using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alfio|first1=Leotta|title=Peter Jackson|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=New York, USA|isbn=9781623569488|page=128|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/peter-jackson-9781623569488/|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
The music for ''District 9'' was scored by Canadian composer Clinton Shorter, who spent three weeks preparing for the film. Director Neill Blomkamp wanted a "raw and dark" score, but one that maintained its South African roots. This was a challenge for Shorter, who found much of the South African music he worked with to be optimistic and joyful. Unable to get the African drums to sound dark and heavy, Shorter used a combination of [[taiko]] drums and synthesized instruments for the desired effects, with the core African elements of the score conveyed in the vocals and smaller percussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hoover |first=Tom |title=Interviews: Clinton Shorter&amp;nbsp;– The Music of District 9 |url=http://scorenotes.com/interviews.html |year=2009 |publisher=Score Notes |accessdate=8 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909061811/http://scorenotes.com/interviews.html |archivedate=9 September 2009 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the score and soundtrack feature music and vocals from [[Kwaito]] artists.

== Marketing ==
Sony Pictures launched a "Humans Only" marketing campaign to promote ''District 9''. Sony's marketing team designed its promotional material to emulate the segregational [[billboard]]s that appear throughout the film.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Oldham |first=Stuart |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007279.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2564 |title=Interview: Neill Blomkamp |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821083921/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007279.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2564 |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billboards, banners, posters, and stickers were thus designed with the theme in mind, and the material was spread across public places such as bus stops in various cities, including "humans only" signs in certain locations and providing toll-free numbers to report "non-human" activity.&lt;ref name="humans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Billington |first=Alex |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/08/14/for-humans-only-a-look-back-at-district-9s-success-story/ |title=For Humans Only: A Look Back at District 9's Success Story |work=FirstShowing.net |publisher=First Showing, LLC |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819135155/http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/08/14/for-humans-only-a-look-back-at-district-9s-success-story/ |archivedate=19 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marketing strategy was designed to provoke reactions in its target audience, namely: sci-fi fans, and people concerned with social justice.

According to Dwight Caines, Sony's president of digital marketing, an estimated 33,000 phone calls were made to the toll-free numbers during a two-week period with 2,500 of them leaving voicemails with reports of alien sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/19/entertainment/et-district19 |title=Alien' Bus-Stop Ads Create A Stir |last=Lee |first=Chris |date=19 June 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date= |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031085139/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/19/entertainment/et-district19 |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotional material was also presented at the 2008 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], advertising the website D-9.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://d-9.com/ |title=D-9.com |publisher=Sony Pictures |accessdate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725090044/http://www.d-9.com// |archivedate=25 July 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had an application presented by the fictional Multi-National United (MNU).

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
''District 9'' grossed US$210.8 million, including US$115.6 million from the United States and Canada, against a production budget of US$30 million.&lt;ref name="Mojo" /&gt;

It opened in 3,048&amp;nbsp;theatres in Canada and the United States on 14 August 2009, and the film ranked first at the weekend box office with an opening gross of US$37.4 million. Among comparable science fiction films in the past, its opening attendance was slightly less than the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]'' and the 1997 film ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]''. The audience demographic for ''District 9'' was 64 percent male and 57 percent people 25 years or older.&lt;ref name="humans"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2610&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Report: Humans Welcome ''District 9'' |last=Gray |first=Brandon |date=16 August 2009 |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818223908/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2610&amp;p=.htm |archivedate=18 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stood out as a summer film that generated strong business despite little-known casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McClintock |first=Pamela |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007321.html?categoryid=1082&amp;cs=1 |title='District 9' invades top of box office |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=16 August 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821031343/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007321.html?categoryid=1082&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its opening success was attributed to the studio's unusual marketing campaign.

=== Political response ===
Nigeria's Information Minister [[Dora Akunyili]] asked movie theatres around the country to either ban the film or edit out specific references to the country, because of the film's negative depiction of the Nigerian characters as criminals and cannibals. Letters of complaint were sent to the producer and distributor of the film demanding an apology. She also said the gang leader Obesandjo is almost identical in spelling and pronunciation to the surname of former president [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-af-nigeria-district-9-091909-2009sep19-story.html|title=Nigerian officials: "District 9" not welcome here|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=Sep 19, 2009|accessdate=19 February 2018|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later banned in Nigeria; the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board was asked to prevent cinemas from showing the film and also to confiscate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Govt bans showing of District 9 film in Nigeria |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2009/09/25/govt-bans-showing-of-district-9-film-in-nigeria/ |publisher=Vanguard |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001070536/http://www.vanguardngr.com/2009/09/25/govt-bans-showing-of-district-9-film-in-nigeria/ |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]], a Nigerian-born British actor also criticized the portrayal of Nigerians in the film,&lt;ref name=xenophobiaafrica&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/02/district-9-labelled-xenophobic-nigerians |title=District 9 labelled xenophobic by Nigerians |last=Smith |first=David |date=2 September 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=6 September 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907121910/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/02/district-9-labelled-xenophobic-nigerians |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; telling the ''[[Beeld]]'' (the leading Afrikaans-language daily newspaper): "Africa is a beautiful place and the problems it does have can not be shown by such a small group of people."{{Quotew|date=February 2014|reason=I could not find an article with Hakeem Kae-Kazim in using the Beeld search page}}

However, the Malawian actor Eugene Khumbanyiwa, who played Obesandjo, has stated that the Nigerians in the cast of ''District 9'' were not perturbed by the portrayal of Nigerians in the film, and that the film should not be taken literally: "It's a story, you know. It's not like Nigerians do eat aliens. Aliens don't even exist in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8264180.stm |title=BBC News {{!}} Africa {{!}} Nigeria 'offended' by sci-fi film|date = 19 September 2009|accessdate = 23 March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teju Cole]], a Nigerian-American writer, has commented that the "one-dimensionality of the Nigerian characters is striking," even when taking into account the fact that ''District 9'' is meant to be a fable. He suggests two possible explanations for Blomkamp's narrative choice: first, that it is meant to reflect anti-foreigner sentiment within South Africa, or second, that it simply represents an oversight on Blomkamp's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://africasacountry.com/comment-district-9-and-the-nigerians/ |title=COMMENT: DISTRICT 9 AND THE NIGERIANS {{!}} Africa is a Country|date = 11 September 2009|accessdate = 23 March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by [[David Sirota]] in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon.com]]'' in an article concerning [[White savior narrative in film|white savior narratives in film]].&lt;ref name="sirota"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sirota |first=David |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/21/oscar_loves_a_white_savior/ |title=Oscar loves a white savior |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410110258/http://www.salon.com/2013/02/21/oscar_loves_a_white_savior/ |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Heller Nicholas discusses Wikus's self-identity in District 9 as problematic due to him being a white man and the hero of the film. Nicholas argues that a white savior "disempowers the film’s allegory to apartheid that comments on the corruption of the South African government" as well as the discrimination black South-Africans dealt with during and post-apartheid. Making Wikus the "white savior" backtracks from the main message of ''District 9'' which is to show the audience the detrimental effects "of colonialism brought by the Western world". Another point Nicholas makes is that ''District 9'' is a "stereotypical White Savior film". She states that the plot is about a white man working for the government, who has roots "in South Africa's apartheid culture", involuntarily joins the "victims of apartheid". In this case, instead of black people, it's prawns.&lt;ref&gt;Emilye Denny (2017). [https://www.challengingborders.com/there-is-no-need-for-a-white-savior-in-district-9/ "There is no need for a White Savior"]. Challening Borders.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Shohini Chauduri wrote that ''District 9'' even echoes apartheid in its title, as it is reminiscent "of District 6 in Cape Town, declared a whites-only area under the Group Areas Act…" She also discusses how the wide shots used in ''District 9'' strongly emphasize the idea of exclusion under apartheid. The separation of people and "prawns" into human and non-human zones mark South Africa's social divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Shohini Chaudhuri, [https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/661999/mod_resource/content/1/Chaudhuri%2C%20Uninvited%20visitors.pdf ''Cinema of the Dark Side'']. 2014 (Uninvited Visitors pp.135-143)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential sequel ==
On 1 August 2009, two weeks before ''District 9'' was released to cinemas, Neill Blomkamp hinted that he intended to make a sequel if the film was successful enough. During an interview on the ''Rude Awakening'' [[947 (radio station)|94.7 Highveld Stereo]] breakfast radio show, he alluded to it, saying "There probably will be." Nevertheless, he revealed that his next project is unrelated to the ''District 9'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/07/district-9-director-alrea.php |title=District 9 director already thinking about a sequel |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |work=SCI FI Wire |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919033742/http://scifiwire.com/2009/07/district-9-director-alrea.php |archivedate=19 September 2009 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview with [[Rotten Tomatoes]], Blomkamp stated that he was "totally" hoping for a follow-up: "I haven't thought of a story yet but if people want to see another one, I'd love to do it."&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Matt. [http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/news/1842105/neill_blomkamp_talks_district_9_rt_interview "Neill Blomkamp Talks ''District 9''&amp;nbsp;— RT Interview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906121331/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/news/1842105/neill_blomkamp_talks_district_9_rt_interview |date=6 September 2009 }}, ''Rotten Tomatoes'', 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Blomkamp has posed the possibility of the next movie in the series being a [[prequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=26657 |title=Will The Next District 9 Be A Prequel? |date=10 January 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2010 |work=Empire Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019094245/http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=26657 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview with [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']] magazine posted on 28 April 2010, Sharlto Copley suggested that a follow-up, while very likely, would be about two years away, given his and Neill Blomkamp's current commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=27715 |title=Sharlto Copley On The District 9 Sequel |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |work=Empire Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517132858/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=27715 |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[IGN]] in June 2013, Blomkamp said, "I really want to make a ''District 9'' sequel. I genuinely do. The problem is I have a bunch of ideas and stuff that I want to make. I'm relatively new to this—I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock yourself into a film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me." Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said "[he] want[s] to make ''District 10'' at some point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/neill-blomkamp-talks-district-9-sequel-star-wars.html Neill Blomkamp Talks About A District 9 Sequel And Star Wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616101247/http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/neill-blomkamp-talks-district-9-sequel-star-wars.html |date=16 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fartlek''', which means "speed play" in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]], is  [[continuous training]] with [[interval training]].&lt;ref name="McArdle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McArdle |first1=William D. |last2=Katch |first2=Frank I. |last3=Katch |first3=Victor L. |title=Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance |url= |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |edition=7th |year=2009 |month= |origyear=1981 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location= |isbn=978-0-7817-9781-8 |page=483 |chapter=Training for Anaerobic and Aerobic Power |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOyjZX0Wxw4C&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fartlek runs are a very simple form of a long distance run. Fartlek training “is simply defined as periods of fast running intermixed with periods of slower running."&lt;ref name="kerkman"/&gt; For some people, this could be a mix of jogging and sprinting, but for beginners it could be walking with jogging sections added in when possible. A simple example of what a runner would do during a fartlek run is  “sprint all out from one light pole to the next, jog to the corner, give a medium effort for a couple of blocks, jog between four light poles and sprint to a stop sign, and so on, for a set total time or distance."&lt;ref name="kerkman"/&gt; The variable [[exercise intensity|intensity]] and continuous nature of the exercise places stress on both the [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] systems. It differs from traditional interval training in that it is unstructured; intensity and/or speed varies, as the athlete wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Making+leap+from+lazy+jogging+real+racing/4522367/story.html |title=Making the leap from lazy jogging to real racing |first=Jill |last=Barker |newspaper=Vancouver Sun |date=29 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404221258/http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Making+leap+from+lazy+jogging+real+racing/4522367/story.html |archivedate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{Cite book | last = McDonald | first = Lyle | title = The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and Practitioner  | publisher = | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 247 | isbn = 978-0-9671456-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fartlek training is generally associated with running, but can include almost any kind of exercise.

== History ==
=== Gösta Holmér ===
[[Sweden|Swedish]] coach [[Gösta Holmér]] developed fartlek in 1937, and, since then, many [[physiologists]] have adopted it. It was designed for the downtrodden Swedish [[cross country running]] teams that had been beaten throughout the 1920s by [[Paavo Nurmi]] and the [[Finnish people|Finns]]. Holmér's plan used a faster-than-race pace and concentrated on both speed and endurance training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=5554 |title=Finding Fartlek: The history and how-to of speed play |first=Joe |last=Schatzle, Jr. |work=Running Times Magazine |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First fartlek sessions ===
This is the first session that was designed by Gösta Holmér for a cross country (multi-terrain) runner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runnersworld.com/workouts/finding-fartlek Schatzle, Jr., Joe (November 2002), Runner's World, "Finding Fartlek"]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also an example of what a fartlek session might look like, but fartlek sessions should be designed for an athlete's own event or sport, as well as catering to their individual needs. Sessions should be at an intensity that causes the athlete to work at 60% to 80% of his or her maximum heart rate.  This should mean that the body will not experience too much discomfort while exercising. An athlete should also include a good [[warming up|warm up]] at the beginning of the session, and a [[cool down]] at the end of the session, to improve performance, minimize post-workout muscle soreness, to decrease the chances of injury and for other reasons.
*Warm up: easy running for 5 to 10 minutes.
*Steady, hard speed for {{Convert|1.5|–|2.5|km|mi|1}}; like a long repetition.
*Recovery: rapid walking for about 5 minutes.
*Start of speed work: easy running interspersed with sprints of about {{Convert|50|&amp;ndash;|60|m|ft}}, repeated until a little tired.
*Easy running with three or four "quick steps" now and then (simulating suddenly speeding up to avoid being overtaken by another runner).
*Full speed uphill for {{Convert|175|–|200|m|ft|-1}}.
*Fast pace for 1 minute.
*The whole routine is then repeated until the total time prescribed on the training schedule has elapsed.

== Fartlek variations ==
=== Mailbox version ===
Runners hypothetically “run hard for two mailboxes, recover for three, run hard for three, recover for two." When executing this type, the runner continues like this for the allotted time or distance determined. &lt;ref name=shaw&gt;Shaw, Jené. "9 Ways To Fartlek." Triathlete.com. N.p., 11 Feb. 2014. Web. http://triathlon.competitor.com/2014/02/training/9-ways-to-fartlek_51140&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dog park version===
Runners speed up when they get close to a dog in order to pass them; after passing the dog, they would then slow down for the recovery period. &lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

=== Music version ===
Many runners use music while they run. &lt;ref&gt;Bean, Adam. "Running With Music." Runner's World &amp; Running Times. Runner's World, 1 Dec. 2010. Web. http://www.runnersworld.com/workout-music/running-music-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Runners can use their music as a template for their fartlek run by changing their speed according to different parts of a song. For example, they can speed up during the chorus and slow down for the rest of the song.

=== Three speeds version ===
In order to add more variety and complexity, runners can add another speed into the run. Within any run, “there is no reason why three different paces should not be included."&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Brain. "Fartlek Training." BrainMac Sports Coach. N.p., 10 Oct. 2014. Web. http://www.brianmac.co.uk/fartlek.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This would change a normal fartlek by doing a jog, run, and a full out sprint.

=== Mona fartlek ===
[[Steve Moneghetti]] (Mona) devised this session with his coach Chris Wardlaw over the phone back in 1983 when he was just 20. He wanted a solid fartlek session, one that would help improve his speed as well as endurance and stimulate an ability to change pace mid-run, something that helped later on his career when competing against African athletes, who tended to speed up mid-race. A session would consist of: 2×90sec, 4×60sec, 4×30sec, 4×15sec with a slower tempo for recovery of the same time between each repetition. The session takes 20&amp;nbsp;minutes in total.

== Benefits ==
=== Easily adjustable ===
Since this workout is very easily manipulated, “fartlek training allows you to add an endless variety of intervals to your aerobic workouts, which helps to keep you stimulated."&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;Hutchins, Michael. "What Are the Benefits of Fartlek Training?" LIVESTRONG.COM. LIVESTRONG.COM, 21 Oct. 2013. Web. http://www.livestrong.com/article/471208-what-are-the-benefits-of-fartlek-training/&lt;/ref&gt; A great plus to performing this workout is the variety it adds to fitness regimens; it is possible to change the amount of distance, time, fast bursts, recovery periods, and even the time at which you do each component.

=== Race day readiness ===
For competitive runners, fartleks and all other types of interval runs are the key for race day readiness. The alternating speeds that are the defining point of fartleks allow runners to work “both the aerobic and anaerobic training systems while simulating the ebb and flow nature of competitive running." &lt;ref name=kerkman&gt;Kerkman, Jill. "What the Fartlek?!" Breaking Muscle. Breaking Muscle, 2012. Web. http://breakingmuscle.com/running/what-the-fartlek&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body strengthening ===
Fartleks keep runners' bodies at top shape so that they can keep racing. Putting fartlek runs in a workout routine keeps “muscles, tendons, nerves, etc. used in running going at top capacity."&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Jeff. Cross-country Running. Aachen: Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, regularly implementing fartleks keeps your body strong enough to maintain the mechanics of racing.

=== Fat burn ===
By alternating the “intensity of your workouts, you will burn more calories than you would by keeping a steady pace."&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt; While running, the runner's body first burns the stored sugars and then begins to burn fat after the sugar is depleted. During a fartlek workout while the body is trying to replace the sugar storage, “fat stores are burned in a metabolic effect that lasts long after your workout."&lt;ref name="kerkman"/&gt; Fartleks are a great option for people that run for their health because the fat burning portion makes it a very efficient exercise.

=== Sports training variability ===
Fartleks can be specially tailored to fit the needs of different types of athletes. An example includes basketball, where “you must exert maximum effort while running a fast break, while you exert very little effort while standing at the foul line."&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt; It is possible to alter the type and timing of the fartlek in order to mimic the intensity of an average basketball game. This can be done for other sports such as tennis, soccer, and football as well.

== Comparing other running exercises ==
Comparable runs include the traditional interval training, tempo runs, and ladders. These workouts are very similar to fartleks, but there are slight differences that distinguish one from another.

=== Tempo runs === 
Tempo runs are typically run for 20 to 25 minutes at a 6 or 7 [[Rating of perceived exertion|RPE]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avenueform.com/benefits-of-long-distance-running-vs-sprints/ |title=Which Is Better between Running Faster or Longer? |last=Santos |first=Larissa |website=Avenue Form |date=14 June 2016 |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exercise is “like an Oreo cookie, with the warmup and cooldown as the cookie, and a run at an effort at or slightly above your anaerobic threshold (the place where your body shifts to using more glycogen for energy) as the filling."&lt;ref name=compare&gt;Hadfield, Jenny. "What's the Difference Between Fartlek, Tempo, and Interval Runs?" Runner's World &amp; Running Times. N.p., 21 Nov. 2012. Web. http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/whats-difference-between-fartlek-tempo-and-interval-runs&lt;/ref&gt; What runners do here is warm up at a slow and steady pace, then run harder than they would on a normal distance jog for an allotted amount of time, and then do a cool down with a very similar speed to the warm up. 

=== Interval runs === 
Intervals “are short, intense efforts followed by equal or slightly longer recovery time."&lt;ref name="compare"/&gt; By the end of a short burst of speed, the runner is barely able to keep up that pace. Unlike fartleks, interval runs are much more structured; usually running the fast and slow spurts at exact times or distances. Interval runs and tempo runs differ in the fact that tempo runs maintain a slightly fast pace for a set amount of time, while interval runs consist of alternating between sprints and slow sections instead of keeping one speed.

=== Ladders === 
This workout is defined as “a speed workout in which the fast parts vary in length." Basically, athletes will run a small amount at a hard pace, work their way up, and work their way back down with timed breaks in between. Ladders are similar to interval training in that they require more structure, but they are different because the faster speed sections vary in time or distance. Although ladders are most similar to interval runs, the fact that the portions performed at the faster speed vary in length or time mirrors fartlek runs.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Bill, and Scott Douglas. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jogging and Running. New York, NY: Alpha, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ballet|History of dance}}[[File:Sleeping beauty cast.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|A publicity photo for the premiere of Tchaikovsky's ballet [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]] (1890).]]
'''Ballet''' is a formalized form of dance with its origins in the [[Italian Renaissance]] courts of 15th and 16th centuries.  Ballet spread from [[Italy]] to [[France]] with the help of [[Catherine de' Medici]], where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence.  An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, [[Margaret of Valois|Marguerite de Valois]] to [[Henry of Navarre]].  Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time.  The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'.  In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the [[Poland|Polish]] ambassadors who were visiting [[Paris]] upon the accession of [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]] to the throne of Poland.  In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', however it was her compatriot, [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]], who organized the ballet. Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline.  Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.

In the late 17th century [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] founded the Académie Royale de Musique (the [[Paris Opera]]) within which emerged the first professional theatrical [[ballet company]], the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]. The predominance of French in the [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary of ballet]] reflects this history. Theatrical ballet soon became an independent form of art, although still frequently maintaining a close association with opera, and spread from the heart of Europe to other nations. The [[Royal Danish Ballet]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of the [[Russian Empire]] were founded in the 1740s and began to flourish, especially after about 1850. In 1907 the Russian ballet in turn moved back to France, where the [[Ballets Russes]] of [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and its successors were particularly influential. Soon ballet spread around the world with the formation of new companies, including London's [[The Royal Ballet]] (1931), the [[San Francisco Ballet]] (1933), [[American Ballet Theatre]] (1937), The [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]] (1939), [[The Australian Ballet]] (1940), the [[New York City Ballet]] (1948), the [[National Ballet of Canada]] (1951), and the [[National Ballet Academy and Trust of India]] (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delhiballet.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/national-ballet-academy-trust-of-india.html?m=1 National Ballet Academy &amp; Trust of India] in [[New Delhi, India]]. Retrieved March 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century styles of ballet continued to develop and strongly influence broader [[concert dance]], for example, in the United States choreographer [[George Balanchine]] developed what is now known as [[neoclassical ballet]], subsequent developments have included [[contemporary ballet]] and [[post-structuralism|post-structural]] ballet, for example seen in the work of [[William Forsythe (dancer)|William Forsythe]] in Germany.

The [[etymology]] of the word "ballet" reflects its history. The word ''ballet'' comes from French and was borrowed into English around the 17th century. The French word in turn has its origins in Italian ''balletto'', a [[diminutive]] of ''ballo'' (dance). ''Ballet'' ultimately traces back to [[Italian language|Italian]] ''ballare'', meaning ''"to dance"''.&lt;ref&gt;Chantrell (2002), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Renaissance – Italy and France===
{{Main|Renaissance dance}}
[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumbnail|right|180px|Engraving of the second scene of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', staged in Paris in 1581 for the French court.]]
Ballet originated in the [[Renaissance]] [[royal court|court]] as an outgrowth of court pageantry in [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;Kirstein (1952), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. [[Tutu (ballet)|Tutus]], ballet slippers and pointe work were not yet used. The choreography was adapted from court dance steps.&lt;ref&gt;Thoinot Arbeau, _Orchesography_, trans. by Mary Steware Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton (New York: Dover, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Performers dressed in fashions of the times. For women that meant formal gowns that covered their legs to the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story/content/chronicle/ae/books/9798/05/03/greskovicch1.html |title=BALLET 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet by Robert Greskovic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early ballet was participatory, with the audience joining the dance towards the end.

[[Domenico da Piacenza]] (c. 1400–c. 1470) was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students, [[Antonio Cornazzano]] and [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]], he was trained in dance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work: '' De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi'' (On the art of dancing and conducting dances), which was put together by his students.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2002), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1489 [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza|Galeazzo, Duke of Milan]], married [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]] in [[Tortona]]. An elaborate dance entertainment was arranged for the celebrations by the Italian dance master Bergonzio di Botta. The dances were linked by a slim narrative concerning [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], and each corresponded to a different course for the dinner. Tristano Calco of Milan wrote about the event, and it was considered so impressive, that many similar spectacles were  
organized elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Andros&gt;[http://michaelminn.net/andros/biographies/de_medici_catherine «Catherine de' Medici (1519-1589)»], article from September 1990, published on "Andros on Ballet" page, on Michael&amp;nbsp;Minn website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vuillier, Gaston (1898). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xNnZzTJTWLEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false''History of Dancing from the Earliest Ages to Our Own Times''], pp. 65–69. New York: D. Anderson and Company. [Facsimile reprint (2004): Whitefish, Montana: Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-7661-8166-3}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballet was further shaped by the French ''[[ballet de cour]]'', which consisted of social dances performed by the nobility in tandem with music, speech, verse, song, pageant, decor and costume.&lt;ref&gt;Bland (1976), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Catherine de' Medici]], an Italian aristocrat with an interest in the arts, married the French crown heir [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], she brought her enthusiasm for dance to France and provided financial support. [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|Catherine's glittering entertainments]] supported the aims of court politics and usually were organized around mythological themes.&lt;ref&gt;Frances A. Yates, _The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century_, 2nd ed. (London: Routledge, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''ballet de cour'' was the ''Ballet de Polonais.'' This Ballet was performed in 1573 on the occasion of the visit of the Polish Ambassador. It was choreographed by Balthasar de Beaaujoyeulx and featured an hour-long dance for sixteen women, each representing a French province. ''Ballet Comique de la Reine'' (1581), which was also choreographed and directed by [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]], was commissioned by [[Louise of Lorraine]], queen consort of [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]], son of Catherine, to celebrate the marriage of Henry's favorite the [[Anne de Joyeuse|Duke de Joyeuse]] to Marguerite de Lorraine, the sister of Queen Louise. The ballet lasted for more than five hours and was danced by twenty four dancers: twelve [[naiad]]es and twelve pages.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Elizabeth (2004). [http://depts.washington.edu/uwdance/dance344reading/bctextp1.htm "Le Balet Comique de la Reine, 1581: An Analysis"]. University of Washington website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the publication of [[Fabritio Caroso]]'s ''Il Ballarino'', a technical manual on court dancing, both performance and social, helped to establish [[Italy]] as a centre of technical ballet development.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2002), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century – France and Court Dance===
{{Main|French ballet}}
[[File:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Louis XIV]] in [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s ''[[Ballet Royal de la Nuit]]'' (1653).]]
Ballet developed as a performance-focused art form in France during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], who was passionate about dance.&lt;ref name=Bland49&gt;Bland (1976), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Beauchamp]], the man who codified the five basic positions of the [[Positions of the feet in ballet|feet]] in ballet, was the king's personal dance teacher and favorite partner in ''[[ballet de cour]]'' in the 1650s.&lt;ref name=Costonis&gt;Costonis, Maureen Needham (1992). "Beauchamps [Beauchamp] Pierre" in Sadie (1992) '''1''': 364.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661 Louis XIV, who was determined to reverse a decline in dance standards that began in the 17th century, established the [[Académie Royale de Danse]].&lt;ref name=Bland49/&gt; Beauchamp was appointed ''Intendant des ballets du roi'' and in 1680 became the director of the dance academy, a position he held until 1687.&lt;ref name=Costonis/&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], an Italian violinist, dancer, choreographer, and composer, who joined the court of Louis XIV in 1652,&lt;ref name=Rosow&gt;Rosow, Lois (1992). "Lully" in Sadie (1992) '''3''': 82–89.&lt;/ref&gt; played a significant role in establishing the general direction ballet would follow for the next century. Supported and admired by King Louis XIV, Lully often cast the king in his ballets. The title of ''Sun King'' for the French monarch, originated in Louis XIV's role in Lully's ''[[Ballet de la Nuit]]'' (1653). The fourteen-year-old Louis XIV danced five roles in this 12-hour ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2002), pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; This Ballet was lavish and featured a scene where a set piece of a house was burned down, included witches, werewolves, gypsies, shepherds, thieves, and the goddesses Venus and Diana. Lully's main contribution to ballet were his nuanced compositions. His understanding of movement and dance allowed him to compose specifically for ballet, with musical phrasings that complemented physical movements.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2002)., p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Lully also collaborated with the French playwright [[Molière]]. Together, they took an Italian theatre style, the ''commedia dell'arte'', and adapted it into their work for a French audience, creating the ''[[comédie-ballet]]''. Among their greatest productions, with Beauchamp as the choreographer,&lt;ref name=Costonis/&gt; was ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]'' (1670).&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2002), p. 74. Anderson (1992), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work created a legacy which would define the future of ballet.

France's court was in some ways the leading source of fashionable culture for many other royal courts in Europe. Styles of entertainment were imitated, including the royal ballets. Courts in Spain, Portugal, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere all became audiences and participants in ballets. In addition to France, Italy became an important influence on the art form, predominantly [[Venice]].

Professional ballet troupes began to organize and tour Europe, performing for aristocratic audiences. In Poland, King [[Władysław IV Vasa]] (1633–1648) hosted Italian opera productions, which included ballet performers in some scenes. The famous European ballet-masters who worked for the Polish court include [[Louis de Poitiers (ballet master)|Louis de Poitiers]], [[Charles Duparc]], [[Jean Favier]], [[Antoine Pitrot]], [[Antonio Sacco]] and [[Francesco Caselli]].&lt;ref name="Polish National Ballet History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Polish National Ballet History|url=http://www.teatrwielki.pl/en/polish_national_ballet/history/our_story.html|publisher=Polish National Theatre|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

===France and development as an art form===
&lt;!--following unverified--&gt;
The 18th century was a period of advance in the technical standards of ballet and the period when ballet became a serious dramatic art form on par with the opera. Central to this advance was the seminal work of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]], ''Lettres sur la danse et les ballets'' (1760), which focused on developing the [[ballet d'action]], in which the movements of the dancers are designed to express character and assist in the narrative. Noverre believed that: ballet should be technical but also move the audience emotionally, plots need to be unified, the scenery and music need to support the plot and be unified within the story, and that pantomime needs to be simple and understandable.&lt;ref&gt;Kassing, Gayle. History of dance : an interactive arts approach. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms were made in ballet composition by composers such as [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. Finally, ballet was divided into three formal techniques ''sérieux'', ''demi-caractère'' and ''comique''. Ballet also began to be featured in operas as interludes called divertissements.

===Outside France===
Venice continued to be a centre of dance in Europe, particularly during the [[Venice Carnival]], when dancers and visitors from across the continent would travel to the city for a lively cultural exchange. The city's [[Teatro San Benedetto]] became a famous landmark largely due to the ballets performed there. Italian ballet techniques remained the dominant influence in much of southern and eastern Europe until Russian techniques supplanted them in the early 20th century.

Ballet performances spread to Eastern Europe during the 18th century, into areas such as Hungary, where they were held in private theatres at aristocratic castles. Professional companies were established that performed throughout Hungary and also toured abroad. The Budapest National Theatre increasingly serving a role as a home for the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hungarian National Ballet|url=http://www.opera.hu/en/balett/magyar_nemzeti_balett_tortenete|publisher=Hungarian State Opera House|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the leading dancers of the time who performed throughout Europe were [[Louis Dupré (dancer)|Louis Dupré]], [[Charles Le Picque]] with [[Anna Binetti]], [[Gaetano Vestris]], and [[Jean-Georges Noverre]].&lt;ref name="Polish National Ballet History"/&gt;

The [[ballerina]] became the most popular dance performer in Europe in the first half of the 19th century, gradually turning the spotlight away from the male dancer. In many performances, ballet heroes were played by a woman, like the Principal Boy in [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAD. DESARGUS-LEMAIRE ET MDELLE.

The professionalism of ballet companies became a focus for a new generation of ballet masters and dancers. Vienna was an important source of influential ballet coaches. The first ballet master of Hungary's National Theatre and Royal Opera was the [[Vienna]]-born [[Frigyes Campilli]], who worked in [[Budapest]] for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Buranbaeva, Oksana  |author2=Vanja Mladineo|title=Culture and Customs of Hungary|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-38370-0|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century was a period of great social change, which was reflected in ballet by a shift away from the aristocratic sensibilities that had dominated earlier periods through [[romantic ballet]]. Ballerinas such as [[Geneviève Gosselin]], [[Marie Taglioni]] and [[Fanny Elssler]] experimented with new techniques such as [[pointework]] that gave the ballerina prominence as the ideal stage figure. Taglioni was known as the "Christian Dancer," as her image was light and pure (associated with her role as the sylph in La Sylphide). She was trained primarily by her father, Filipo Taglioni. In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known as the "Pagan Dancer," because of the fiery qualities of the ''Cachucha'' dance that made her famous.  Professional librettists began crafting the stories in ballets. Teachers like [[Carlo Blasis]] codified ballet technique in the basic form that is still used today. The ballet boxed toe shoe was invented to support pointe work.

===Romantic movement===
{{Main|Romantic ballet}}
[[File:Marie-taglioni-in-zephire.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Marie Taglioni]] as Flore in [[Charles Didelot]]'s ballet ''[[Flore et Zéphire]]'' (ca. 1831). She was a pioneer of [[en pointe|pointework]].]]
The [[Romantic movement]] in art, literature, and theatre was a reaction against formal constraints and the mechanics of industrialization.[22] The [[zeitgeist]] led choreographers to compose romantic ballets that appeared light, airy and free that would act as a contrast to the spread of reductionist science through many aspects of daily life that had, in the words of Poe, "driven the hamadryad from the woods". These "unreal" ballets portrayed women as fragile unearthly beings, ethereal creatures who could be lifted effortlessly and almost seemed to float in the air. Ballerinas began to wear costumes with pastel, flowing skirts that bared the shins. The stories revolved around uncanny, folkloric spirits. An example of one such romantic ballet is ''[[La Sylphide]]'', one of the oldest romantic ballets still performed today.

One strain of the Romantic movement was a new exploration of folklore and traditional ethnic culture. This influence was seen in the emergence of European folk dance and western portrayals of African, Asian, and Middle East peoples on European stages.  In ballets from this period, non-European characters were often created as villains or as silly divertisements to fit the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] western understanding of the world.&lt;ref name=Macaulay/&gt;  The [[National Opera of Ukraine]], a performing arts theatre with a resident opera company, was established in [[Kiev]] in 1867. It also included a small resident troupe of ballet dancers, who would perform mainly folk-style dancing during opera productions. By 1893, this grew to a troupe large enough to stage large ballets. Folk dancing and ballets with Ukrainian stories were among the early productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bleiberg|first=Laura|title=Kiev Ballet cleaves to the classics|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ballet-83686-kiev-nutcracker.html|accessdate=March 10, 2012|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many leading European professional ballet companies that survive today were established at new theatres in Europe's capital cities during the mid- to late- 19th century, including the [[Kiev Ballet]], the [[Hungarian National Ballet]], the [[National Theatre Ballet (Prague)]] and the [[Vienna State Ballet]] (formerly the [[Vienna State Opera]] Ballet). These theatres usually combined large opera, drama and ballet companies under the same roof. Composers, dramatists, and choreographers were then able to create works that took advantage of the ability to collaborate among these performance troupes.

===Russia===
{{Main|Russian ballet}}
[[File:Swanlakemordkin.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Mikhail Mordkin]] as Prince Siegfried and [[Adelaide Giuri]] as Odette with students as the little swans in the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre's production of the Petipa/Ivanov/Tchaikovsky ''[[Swan Lake]]''. 1901]]
While France was instrumental in early ballet, other countries and cultures soon adopted the art form, most notably Russia. Russia has a recognized tradition of ballet, and Russian ballet has had great importance in its country throughout history. 
After 1850, ballet began to wane in Paris, but it flourished in [[Denmark]] and [[Russia]] thanks to masters such as [[August Bournonville]], [[Jules Perrot]], [[Arthur Saint-Léon]], [[Enrico Cecchetti]] and [[Marius Petipa]]. In the late nineteenth century, [[orientalism]] was in vogue. Colonialism brought awareness of Asian and African cultures, but distorted with disinformation and fantasy. The East was often perceived as a faraway place where anything was possible, provided it was lavish, exotic and decadent. 
Petipa appealed to popular taste with ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' (1862), and later ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]'' (1889), and ''[[La Bayadère]]'' (1877). Petipa is best remembered for his collaborations with [[Tchaikovsky]]. He used his music for his choreography of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (1892, though this is open to some debate among historians), ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1890), and the definitive revival of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (1895, with [[Lev Ivanov]]). These works were all drawn from European folklore.

The female dancers' classical [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] as it is recognized today began to appear at this time. It consisted of a short, stiff skirt supported by layers of crinoline or tulle that revealed the acrobatic legwork, combined with a wide gusset that served to preserve modesty.

===Argentina===
Ballet companies from Europe began lucrative tours of theatres in North, Central and South America during the mid-19th century. The prestigious  [[Colon Theater]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina had hosted foreign ballet artists on its stage, with touring companies from Europe presenting full ballets as early as 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Foster, David William |author2=Melissa Fitch Lockhart, |author3=Darrell B. Lockhart |title=Culture and Customs of Argentina|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30319-7|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, the Colon Theater had its own professional ballet company. It would still be several decades before most countries outside of Europe could claim their own professional ballet companies, however.

==20th century and modernism==

===Russia and the Ballets Russes===
[[File:Pavlova Anna as a bacchante in The Seasons.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Anna Pavlova]] as a [[bacchante]] in ''[[Bacchanale]]'' by [[Mikhail Mordkin]].]]

[[Sergei Diaghilev]] brought ballet full-circle back to Paris when he opened his company, [[Ballets Russes]]. It was made up of dancers from the Russian exile community in Paris after the Revolution.

Diaghilev and composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] merged their talents to bring Russian folklore to life in ''[[The Firebird]]'' and ''[[Petrushka]]'' choreographed by Fokine. Diaghilev's next choreographic commissions went to Nijinsky. His First ballet was ''L'apres-midi d'un Faune'' (Afternoon of a Faun) to music by Debussy. It was notable for its two dimensional shapes and lack of ballet technique. It caused controversy by depicting the faun rubbing the scarf of one of the maidens on himself, in simulated masturbation. The most controversial work of the Ballets Russes however, was ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', choreographed by Nijinsky with music by Stravinsky. The ballet's modern music, pigeon toed stomping and theme of human sacrifice shocked audiences so much they rioted.

After the “golden age” of Petipa, [[Michel Fokine]] began his career in St. Petersburg but moved to Paris and worked with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.

[[File:Vaslav Nijinsky in Le spectre de la rose 1911 Royal Opera House.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in ''[[The Spectre of the Rose]]'', 1911.]]
Russian ballet continued development under Soviet rule. There was little talent left in the country after the Revolution, but it was enough to seed a new generation. After stagnation in the 1920s, by the mid-1930s that new generation of dancers and choreographers appeared on the scene. The technical perfection and precision of dance was promoted (and demanded) by [[Agrippina Vaganova]], who had been taught by Petipa and Cecchetti and headed the [[Vaganova Ballet Academy]], the school to prepare dancers for the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg/Leningrad.

Ballet was popular with the public. Both the Moscow-based Bolshoi and the St. Petersburg (then Leningrad)-based Kirov ballet companies were active. Ideological pressure forced the creation of many [[socialist realist]] pieces, most of which made little impression on the public and were removed from the repertoire of both companies later.

Some pieces of that era, however, were remarkable. The ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[Prokofiev]] and [[Lavrovsky]] is a masterpiece. The ''[[Flames of Paris]]'', while it shows all the faults of socialist realist art, pioneered the active use of the corps de ballet in the performance and required stunning virtuosity. The [[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (ballet)|ballet version]] of the [[Pushkin]] poem, ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]]'' with music from [[Boris Asafiev]] and choreography by [[Rostislav Zakharov]] was also a hit.

The well-known ballet ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]'', for which Prokofiev provided the music, is also the product of the Soviet ballet. During the Soviet era, these pieces were mostly unknown outside the [[Soviet Union]] and later outside of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union they received more recognition.

The 1999 North American premiere of ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (ballet)|The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]]'' by the Kirov Ballet in New York was an outstanding success, for example. The Soviet era of the Russian Ballet put a lot of emphasis on technique, virtuosity and strength. It demanded strength usually above the norm of contemporary Western dancers. When watching restored old footage, one can only marvel at the talent of their prima ballerinas such as [[Galina Ulanova]], [[Natalya Dudinskaya]] and [[Maya Plisetskaya]] and choreographers such as [[Pyotr Gusev]].

Russian companies, particularly after World War II engaged in multiple tours all over the world that revitalized ballet in the West.

===United States of America===
Following the move of the Ballets Russes to France, ballet began to have a broader influence, particularly in the United States of America.

From Paris, after disagreements with Diaghilev, Fokine went to Sweden and then the USA and settled in New York. Diaghilev believed that traditional ballet offered little more than prettiness and athletic display. For Fokine that was not enough. In addition to technical virtuosity he demanded drama, expression and historical authenticity. The choreographer must research the period and cultural context of the setting and reject the traditional tutu in favour of accurate period costuming.

Fokine choreographed ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Sheherazade]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra ballet|Cleopatra]]''. He also reworked ''Petrouchka'' and ''The Firebird''. One of his most famous works was ''[[The Dying Swan]]'', performed by [[Anna Pavlova]]. Beyond her talents as a ballerina, Pavlova had the theatrical gifts to fulfill Fokine's vision of ballet as drama. Legend has it that Pavlova identified so much with the swan role that she requested her swan costume from her deathbed.

[[Anna Pavlova]] (7 seconds) 2. [[Yvette Chauvire]] (10 seconds) 3. [[Natalia Makarova]] (14 seconds).]]

[[George Balanchine]] developed state-of-the-art technique in America by opening a school in Chicago and more importantly, in New York. He adapted ballet to the new media, movies and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balanchine.org/01/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113123111/http://balanchine.org/01/index.html |archivedate=November 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }} George Balanchine&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific worker, Balanchine rechoreographed classics such as ''Swan Lake'' and ''Sleeping Beauty'' as well as creating new ballets. He produced original interpretations of the dramas of [[William Shakespeare]] such as ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and also of Franz Léhar's ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.

In 1967, Balanchine's ''[[Jewels (ballet)|Jewels]]'' broke with the narrative tradition and dramatized a theme rather than a plot.  This focus fits with the state-sponsored funding sources in the United States which sought to encourage "liberty and freethinking" in contrast to narrative-driven dance, which was seen as to be connected too closely with socialism, especially [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]].&lt;ref name=Kiley&gt;{{cite news

Barbara Karinska was a Russian emigree and a skilled seamstress who collaborated with Balanchine to elevate the art of costume design from a secondary role to an integral part of a ballet performance. She introduced the [[bias cut]] and a simplified classic tutu that allowed the dancer more freedom of movement. With meticulous attention to detail, she decorated her tutus with beadwork, embroidery, crochet and appliqué.

==Neoclassical ballet==
{{Main|Neoclassical ballet}}
[[File:Ballets Russes - Apollo musagète.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ballets Russes]] with ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' (1928) choreographed by [[George Balanchine]]. Dancers are [[Alexandrova Danilova]] and [[Serge Lifar]].]]
[[George Balanchine]] is often considered to have been the first pioneer of what is now known as [[neoclassical ballet]], a style of dance between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet. Tim Scholl, author of ''From Petipa to Balanchine'', considers Balanchine's ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' (1928) to be the first neoclassical ballet. It represented a return to form in response to [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s abstract ballets. ''Apollo'' and other works are still performed today, predominantly by the [[New York City Ballet]]. However, other companies are able to pay a fee for performance rights to George Balanchine's works.

[[Frederick Ashton]] is another prominent choreographer associated with the neoclassical style. Three of his works have become standard pieces in the international repertoire: ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' (1952), ''[[Romeo and Juliet (ballet)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1956), and ''[[Ondine (ballet)|Ondine]]'' (1958), the last of which was created as a vehicle to showcase [[Margot Fonteyn]].

==Contemporary==
{{Main|Contemporary ballet}}
[[File:Allah Garibou.jpg|thumb|200px|A 2010 performance of [[Irène Tassembédo]]'s [[contemporary ballet]] piece [[Allah Garibou]].]]
One dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neo-classical style was [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably [[Twyla Tharp]]. Tharp choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.

Tharp also worked with the [[Joffrey Ballet]] company, founded in 1957 by [[Robert Joffrey]]. She choreographed ''[[Deuce Coupe]]'' for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder [[Gerald Arpino]].

Today there are many  contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include [[Madrid Ballet]]; [[Royal Ballet of Flanders]]; [[Alonzo King]] and his company, [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]]; Nacho Duato and [[Compañia Nacional de Danza]]; William Forsythe, who has worked extensively with the [[Frankfurt Ballet]] and today runs [[The Forsythe Company]]; and [[Jiří Kylián]], formerly the artistic director of the [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. Traditionally "classical" companies, such as the [[Kirov Ballet]] and the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], also regularly perform contemporary works.

==Development of ballet method==
{{Main|Ballet training}}
Several well-known ballet methods are named after their originators. For example, two prevailing systems from Russia are known as the [[Vaganova method]] after [[Agrippina Vaganova]], and the Legat Method, after [[Nikolai Legat]]. The [[Cecchetti method]] was invented by Italian dancer [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850–1928), and the Bournonville method, which was invented by [[August Bournonville]] (1805–1879), is employed chiefly in Bournonville's own country of Denmark.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Horror Victorianorum''' (terror of the Victorian), coined by the philosopher [[David Stove]], is an extreme distaste or condemnation of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] culture, art and design. The term was used in Stove's book ''[[David Stove#The Plato Cult|The Plato Cult]]'' as part of his argument against [[Karl Popper]] and other philosophers whom he characterised as "[[modernism|modernist]]s". For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s book ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of "Victorian" conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] to a [[tribal chief]].

For Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion &amp;ndash; rather than a reasoned scepticism &amp;ndash; to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science [[William Whewell]].

Following Stove's usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for [[Victorian architecture]] and design. Wilson argued that "Palissyite" design, influenced by the methods of [[Bernard Palissy]], had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of "Puginite" design, following the proto-modernist principles of [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]]. Wilson's argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the [[grotesque]].

The argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values ('[[Anti-victorianism]]') is irrational has been adopted by other writers,{{ref|nation}}either following Stove's politically conservative attack on [[liberalism|liberal thought]], or Wilson's critique of modernism.

{{other uses2|House Party}}

[[File:House party in Denver Colorado.JPG|thumb|A house party in [[Denver, Colorado]].]]
A '''house party''' is typically a type of [[party]] where medium to large groups of people gather at the residence of the party's host. In modern usage, a house party is typically associated with teenage or young adult crowds, loud music, dancing, and the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[recreational drugs]]. Historically, the term has also referred to more genteel gatherings at country estates, lasting anywhere from several days to weeks.

==Organization==
A house party might be organized several months, down to just a few hours, in advance. News of a party is often spread by word of mouth, the sending of formal invitations, or on social networking websites like [[Facebook]]. In the case of the latter, the host must be particularly careful of how public the information regarding the party is made. There have been cases where hundreds of people have turned up to a party they found out about on the internet without knowing the host personally, causing massive damage to the house or the items within it. In the [[United Kingdom]], such an occurrence may be referred to as a 'Skins' party, named after a well-known [[Skins (2007 TV Series)|TV show]] set in the English city of [[Bristol]] focusing on the lives of teenagers who often participate in and host such parties.

A person who attends a house party, but has not been invited, is typically referred to as a "[[Gate crashing|gatecrasher]]". Such an activity is usually perceived negatively, although more liberal hosts may permit gatecrashers, depending on their behaviour.   

In some instances house parties do not attract large crowds, and with ten or fewer people are often referred to as a 'gathering'.{{Fact|date=August 2015}}

==House parties in history==
An early example of a house party can be seen in the play ''[[Mostellaria]]'' (''The Haunted House'') by the Roman playwright [[Plautus]]. In it a young man called Philolaches is having a great time while his father is away on business.

House parties have become a prominent feature in popular movies, particularly movies aimed at teenagers. While many have probably been present before the movie, ''[[Animal House]]'' is one of the first to properly provide a scene of a house party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)
* [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]], between Venezuela and the United Kingdom
* [[Fashoda Incident]] (1898–1899)
*[[Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03]], between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy
* [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (1904–1906)
*[[Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908]], between Venezuela and the Netherlands
* [[Bosnian crisis]] (1908–1909)

The '''Great Library of Alexandria''' in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], was one of the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|libraries of the ancient world]]. The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired a large number of [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.

Alexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277203534|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart,|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|year=|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].

Despite the widespread modern belief that the Library was "burned" once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.

The Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270–275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].

The Library of Alexandria was not the first library of its kind.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1–2, 10–11}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} A long tradition of libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=13}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The earliest recorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Uruk]] in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The ancient [[Hittites]] and [[Assyria]]ns had massive archives containing records written in many different languages.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in [[Nineveh]], founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] (ruled 668–{{circa}} 627 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} A large library also existed in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ({{circa}} 605–{{circa}} 562 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} In Greece, the Athenian tyrant [[Peisistratos]] was said to have founded the first major public library in the sixth century BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1}} It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}

The Macedonian kings who succeeded [[Alexander the Great]] as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2–3}} Historian [[Roy MacLeod]] calls this "a programme of cultural imperialism".{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}} These rulers therefore had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2–3}} Libraries enhanced a city's prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=341}} Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=340}} The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies' ambitions;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|pages=340–341}} unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all knowledge.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=35}}

== Under Ptolemaic patronage ==
=== Founding ===
[[File:Ptolemy II MAN Napoli Inv5600.jpg|thumb|Bust of excavated at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] depicting [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who is believed to have been the one to establish the Library as an actual institution, although plans for it may have been developed by his father [[Ptolemy I Soter]]{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343–344}}]]

The Library was one of the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|libraries of the ancient world]], but details about it are a mixture of history and legend.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1–2}} The earliest known surviving source of information on the founding of the Library of Alexandria is the [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''[[Letter of Aristeas]]'', which was composed between {{circa}} 180 and {{circa}} 145 BC.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980" /&gt;{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} The ''Letter of Aristeas'' claims that the Library was founded during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] ({{circa}} 323–{{circa}} 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], a student of [[Aristotle]] who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;''Letter of Aristeas'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/aristeas1.html#9 9–12] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917162816/http://attalus.org/translate/aristeas1.html#9 |date=17 September 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the ''Letter of Aristeas'' is very late and it contains information that is now known to be inaccurate.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} Other sources claim that the Library was instead created under the reign of Ptolemy I's son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (283–246 BC).{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}

Modern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343–344}} Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343–344}} In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and [[Theophrastus]], which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the [[Peripatetic school]].{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=344–345}}

The Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in the style of Aristotle's [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], adjacent to (and in service of) the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]] (a Greek Temple or "House of Muses", whence the term "museum").&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 Μουσείον] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912160936/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 |date=12 September 2007 }} at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,&lt;ref name="Lindberg1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=David C. Lindberg|title=Science in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=15 March 1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its contents were used to aid the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pp=1–}}

The exact layout of the library is not known, but ancient sources describe the Library of Alexandria as comprising a collection of scrolls, Greek columns, a {{wikt-lang|en|Peripatetic|peripatos}} walk, a room for shared dining, a reading room, meeting rooms, gardens, and lecture halls, creating a model for the modern university [[campus]].{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=26}} The Library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department (possibly built near the stacks, or for utility closer to the harbor) and a cataloguing department. A hall contained shelves for the collections of papyrus scrolls known as ''bibliothekai'' (''βιβλιοθῆκαι''). According to popular description, an inscription above the shelves read: "The place of the cure of the soul."&lt;ref name="Alberto2008"&gt;Manguel, Alberto, The Library at Night. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early expansion and organization ===
[[File:Antikes Alexandria Karte.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of ancient Alexandria. The Mouseion was located in the royal Broucheion quarter (listed on this map as "Bruchium") in the central part of the city near the Great Harbor ("Portus Magnus" on the map).{{sfn|Barnes|2000|page=62}}]]

The Ptolemaic rulers intended the Library to be a collection of all knowledge{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pp=1–}} and they worked to expand the Library's collections through an aggressive and well-funded policy of book purchasing.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} They dispatched royal agents with large amounts of money and ordered them to purchase and collect as many texts as they possibly could, about any subject and by any author.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Older copies of texts were favored over newer ones, since it was assumed that older copies had undergone less copying and that they were therefore more likely to more closely resemble what the original author had written.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} This program involved trips to the book fairs of [[Rhodes]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Erksine, Andrew. 1995. "Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: The Museum and Library of Alexandria". ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 2nd ser., 42(1), 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Greek medical writer [[Galen]], under the decree of Ptolemy II, any books found on ships that came into port were taken to the library, where they were copied by official scribes.&lt;ref name="Galen"&gt;[[Galen]], xvii.a, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html#1.606 p.606] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514005420/http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html#1.606 |date=14 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=4–5}}{{sfn|Haughton|2011}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=341}} The original texts were kept in the library, and the copies delivered to the owners.&lt;ref name="Galen" /&gt;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Haughton|2011}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=341}} The Library particularly focused on acquiring manuscripts of the Homeric poems, which were the foundation of Greek education and revered above all other poems.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=36}} The Library therefore acquired many different manuscripts of these poems, tagging each copy with a label to indicate where it had come from.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=36}}

In addition to collecting works from the past, the Mouseion which housed the Library also served as home to a host of international scholars, poets, philosophers, and researchers, who, according to the first-century BC Greek geographer [[Strabo]], were provided with a large salary, free food and lodging, and exemption from taxes.&lt;ref name="Kennedy1999"&gt;Kennedy, George. ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: Classical Criticism,'' New York: University of Cambridge Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=33–34}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} They had a large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a [[:wikt:σύνοδος|σύνοδος]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, "community").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}

=== Early scholarship ===
The Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades|Sotades of Maronea]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3–4}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}

The first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus|Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325–{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}

Meanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39–40}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39–40}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39–40}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}

[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]

After Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295–{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}

According to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}} 287 –{{circa}} 212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}

According to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109–110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}

=== Later scholarship and expansion ===

The third head librarian, [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (lived {{circa}} 280–{{circa}} 194 BC), is best known today for his scientific works, but he was also a literary scholar.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=114}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Eratosthenes's most important work was his treatise ''Geographika'', which was originally in three volumes.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} The work itself has not survived, but many fragments of it are preserved through quotation in the writings of the later geographer [[Strabo]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Eratosthenes was the first scholar to apply mathematics to geography and map-making{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=116}} and, in his treatise ''Concerning the Measurement of the Earth'', he calculated the circumference of the earth and was only off by less than a few hundred kilometers.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=116}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=41}} Eratosthenes also produced a map of the entire known world, which incorporated information taken from sources held in the Library, including accounts of [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's campaigns in India]] and reports written by members of Ptolemaic elephant-hunting expeditions along the coast of [[East Africa]].{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=41}}

Eratosthenes was the first person to advance geography towards becoming a scientific discipline.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=116–117}} Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was "to capture the soul", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, "a man might find the places of Odysseus's wanderings if the day were to come when he would find the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds."{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientific subjects.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=6–7}} [[Bacchius of Tanagra]], a contemporary of Eratosthenes, edited and commented on the medical writings of the [[Hippocratic Corpus]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} The doctors [[Herophilos|Herophilus]] (lived {{circa}} 335–{{circa}} 280 BC) and [[Erasistratus]] ({{circa}} 304 –{{circa}} 250 BC) studied [[human anatomy]], but their studies were hindered by protests against the [[dissection]] of human corpses, which was seen as immoral.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}}

According to Galen, around this time, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original manuscripts of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]], for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] ({{convert|1000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) of a precious metal as guarantee that he would return them.&lt;ref name="Galenxviia"&gt;[[Galen]], xvii.a, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html#1.607 p.607] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514005420/http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html#1.607 |date=14 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=35}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|pages=147–148}} Ptolemy III had expensive copies of the plays made on the highest quality papyrus and sent the Athenians the copies, keeping the original manuscripts for the library and telling the Athenians they could keep the talents.&lt;ref name="Galenxviia"/&gt;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=35}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|pages=147–148}} This story may also be construed erroneously to show the power of Alexandria over Athens during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}} As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to house the scrolls in its collection, so, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, it opened a satellite collection in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]] located near the royal palace.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}}{{sfn|Haughton|2011}}

=== Peak of literary criticism ===

[[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] (lived {{circa}} 257–{{circa}} 180 BC) became the fourth head librarian sometime around 200 BC.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}} According to a legend recorded by the Roman writer [[Vitruvius]], Aristophanes was one of seven judges appointed for a poetry competition hosted by Ptolemy III Euergetes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|pages=148–149}} All six of the other judges favored one competitor, but Aristophanes favored the one whom the audience had liked the least.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}} Aristophanes declared that all of the poets except for the one he had chosen had committed plagiarism and were therefore disqualified.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}} The king demanded that he prove this, so he retrieved the texts that the authors had plagiarized from the Library, locating them by memory.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}} On account of his impressive memory and diligence, Ptolemy III appointed him as head librarian.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}}

The librarianship of Aristophanes of Byzantium is widely considered to have opened a more mature phase of the Library of Alexandria's history.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} During this phase of the Library's history, [[literary criticism]] reached its peak{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}} and came to dominate the Library's scholarly output.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=7–8}} Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 93}} He also invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 92–93}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} wrote important works on [[lexicography]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=93}} He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} The fifth head librarian was an obscure individual named Apollonius, who is known by the epithet {{lang-grc-gre|ὁ εἰδογράφος}} ("the classifier of forms").{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=129}} One late lexicographical source explains this epithet as referring to the classification of poetry on the basis of musical forms.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=129}}

During the early second century BC, several scholars at the Library of Alexandria studied works on medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} Zeuxis the Empiricist is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the [[Battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with [[Upper Egypt]] became largely disrupted.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}

[[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] (lived {{circa}} 216–{{circa}} 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full ''[[hypomnema]]ta'', or long, free-standing commentaries, on them.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} A portion of one of Aristarchus's commentaries on the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] has survived in a papyrus fragment.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported [[Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator]] as the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}} Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of [[Cyprus]], where he died shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern Mediterranean.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}

== Decline ==
=== After Ptolemy VIII's expulsions ===
Ptolemy VIII Physcon's expulsion of the scholars from Alexandria brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5–6}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5–6}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5–6}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170–{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek grammar]], a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180–{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}

Meanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88–81 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}

A shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Classical Greece|Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the first century BC by [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] ({{circa}} 100–{{circa}} 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}

=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===
[[File:César (13667960455).jpg|thumb|The Roman general [[Julius Caesar]] was forced to set fire to his own ships during the [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|Siege of Alexandria]] in 48 BC.{{sfn|Haughton|2011}} Many ancient writers report that the fire spread and destroyed at least part of the Library of Alexandria's collections;{{sfn|Haughton|2011}} however, the Library seems to have either at least partially survived or been quickly rebuilt.{{sfn|Haughton|2011}}]]

In 48 BC, during [[Caesar's Civil War]], [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|besieged at Alexandria]]. His soldiers set fire to his own ships while trying to clear the wharves to block the fleet belonging to [[Cleopatra]]'s brother [[Ptolemy XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Justin, and Reid, Howard. 2006.

Scholars have interpreted Cassius Dio's wording to indicate that the fire did not actually destroy the entire Library itself, but rather only a warehouse located near the docks being used by the Library to house scrolls.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Haughton|2011}}{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=256}} Whatever devastation Caesar's fire may have caused, the Library was evidently not completely destroyed.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Haughton|2011}}{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=256}} The geographer [[Strabo]] ({{circa}} 63 BC–{{circa}} 24 AD) mentions visiting the Mouseion, the larger research institution to which the Library was attached, in around 20 BC, several decades after Caesar's fire, indicating that it either survived the fire or was rebuilt soon afterwards.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}}{{sfn|Haughton|2011}} Nonetheless, Strabo's manner of talking about the Mouseion shows that it was nowhere near as prestigious as it had been a few centuries prior.{{sfn|Haughton|2011}} Despite mentioning the Mouseion, Strabo does not mention the Library separately, perhaps indicating that it had been so drastically reduced in stature and significance that Strabo felt it did not warrant separate mention.{{sfn|Haughton|2011}} It is unclear what happened to the Mouseion after Strabo's mention of it.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}}

Furthermore, Plutarch records in his ''Life of Marc Antony'' that, in the years leading up to the [[Battle of Actium]] in 33 BC, [[Mark Antony]] was rumored to have given Cleopatra all 200,000 scrolls in the Library of Pergamum.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}} Plutarch himself notes that his source for this anecdote was sometimes unreliable and it is possible that the story may be nothing more than propaganda intended to show that Mark Antony was loyal to Cleopatra and Egypt rather than to Rome.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}} Casson, however, argues that, even if the story was made up, it would not have been believable unless the Library still existed.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}} Edward J. Watts argues that Mark Antony's gift may have been intended to replenish the Library's collection after the damage to it caused by Caesar's fire roughly a decade and a half prior.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}

Further evidence for the Library's survival after 48 BC comes from the fact that the most notable producer of composite commentaries during the late first century BC and early first century AD was a scholar who worked in Alexandria named [[Didymus Chalcenterus]], whose epithet {{lang|grc|Χαλκέντερος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Chalkénteros}}) means "bronze guts".{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=7}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}} Didymus is said to have produced somewhere between 3,500 and 4,000 books, making him the most prolific known writer in all of antiquity.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=7}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} He was also given the nickname {{lang|grc|βιβλιολάθης}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Biblioláthēs}}), meaning "book-forgetter" because it was said that even he could not remember all the books he had written.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=7}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|pages=149–150}} Parts of some of Didymus's commentaries have been preserved in the forms of later extracts and these remains are modern scholars' most important sources of information about the critical works of the earlier scholars at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=7}} Lionel Casson states that Didymus's prodigious output "would have been impossible without at least a good part of the resources of the library at his disposal."{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=46}}

=== Roman Period and destruction ===
[[File:Alexandria Library Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|This Latin inscription regarding [[Tiberius Claudius Balbilus]] of Rome (d. c. AD 79) mentions the "ALEXANDRINA BYBLIOTHECE" (line eight).]]

Very little is known about the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman [[Principate]] (27 BC–284 AD).{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}} The emperor [[Claudius]] (ruled 41–54 AD) is recorded to have built an addition onto the Library,{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=46–47}} but it seems that the Library of Alexandria's general fortunes followed those of the city of Alexandria itself.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} After Alexandria came under Roman rule, the city's status and, consequently that of its famous Library, gradually diminished.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} While the Mouseion still existed, membership was granted, not on the basis of scholarly achievement, but rather on the basis of distinction in government, the military, or even in athletics.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}}

The same was evidently the case even for the position of head librarian;{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} the only known head librarian from the Roman Period was a man named [[Tiberius Claudius Balbilus]], who lived in the middle of the first century AD and was a politician, administrator, and military officer with no record of substantial scholarly achievements.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Members of the Mouseion were no longer required to teach, conduct research, or even live in Alexandria.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=148}} The Greek writer [[Philostratus]] records that the emperor [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117–138 AD) appointed the ethnographer Dionysius of Miletus and the sophist [[Polemon of Laodicea]] as members of the Mouseion, even though neither of these men are known to have ever spent any significant amount of time in Alexandria.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=148}}

Meanwhile, as the reputation of Alexandrian scholarship declined, the reputations of other libraries across the Mediterranean world improved, diminishing the Library of Alexandria's former status as the most prominent.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} Other libraries also sprang up within the city of Alexandria itself{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}} and the scrolls from the Great Library may have been used to stock some of these smaller libraries.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}} The [[Caesareum of Alexandria|Caesareum]] and the Claudianum in Alexandria are both known to have had major libraries by the end of the first century AD.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}} The Serapeum, originally the "daughter library" of the Great Library, probably expanded during this period as well, according to classical historian Edward J. Watts.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=149–150}}

By the second century AD, the Roman Empire grew less dependent on grain from Alexandria and the city's prominence declined further.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} The Romans during this period also had less interest in Alexandrian scholarship and so the Library's reputation continued to decline as well.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} The scholars who worked and studied at the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman Empire were less well known than the ones who had studied there during the Ptolemaic Period.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} Eventually, the word "Alexandrian" itself came to be synonymous with the editing of texts, correction of textual errors, and writing of commentaries synthesized from those of earlier scholars—in other words, taking on connotations of pedantry, monotony, and lack of originality.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} Mention of both the Great Library of Alexandria and the Mouseion that housed it disappear after the middle of the third century AD.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}} The last known references to scholars being members of the Mouseion date to the 260s.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}} 

In 272 AD, the emperor [[Aurelian]] fought to recapture the city of Alexandria from the forces of [[Zenobia|Queen Zenobia]] of the [[Palmyrene Empire]].{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} During the course of the fighting, Aurelian's forces destroyed the Broucheion quarter of the city in which the main library was located.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} If the Mouseion and Library still existed at this time, they were almost certainly destroyed during the attack as well.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} If they did survive the attack, then whatever was left of them would have been destroyed during the emperor [[Diocletian]]'s siege of Alexandria in 297.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}

=== Serapeum ===
Scattered references indicate that, sometime in the fourth century, an institution known as the "Mouseion" may have been reestablished at a different location somewhere in Alexandria.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}} Nothing, however, is known about the characteristics of this organization.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}} It may have possessed some bibliographic resources, but whatever they may have been, they were clearly not comparable to those of its predecessor.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=150–151}} For much of the late fourth century AD, the library of the Serapeum was probably the largest collection of books in the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=150, 189}} In the 370s and 380s, the Serapeum was still a major pilgrimage site for many pagans.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=189}}

In addition to possessing the largest library in Alexandria, the Serapeum remained a fully functioning temple and it even had classrooms for philosophers to teach in.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=189}} It naturally tended to attract followers of [[Iamblichus|Iamblichean]] [[Neoplatonism]].{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=189}} Most of these philosophers were primarily interested in [[theurgy]], the study of cultic rituals and esoteric religious practices.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=189}} The Neoplatonist philosopher [[Damascius]] (lived {{circa}} 458–after 538) records that a man named Olympus came from [[Cilicia]] to teach at the Serapeum, where he enthusiastically taught his students the rules of traditional divine worship and ancient religious practices.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=189–190}} He enjoined his students to worship the old gods in traditional ways, and he may have even taught them theurgy.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}}

In 391 AD, a group of Christian workmen in Alexandria uncovered the remains of an old [[Mithraeum]].{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}} They gave some of the cult objects to the Christian bishop of Alexandria, [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]].{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}} Theophilus had the cult objects paraded through the streets so they could be mocked and ridiculed.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}} The pagans of Alexandria were incensed by this act of desecration, especially the teachers of Neoplatonic philosophy and theurgy at the Serapeum.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}} The teachers at the Serapeum took up arms and led their students and other followers in a [[Guerilla warfare|guerilla attack]] on the Christian population of Alexandria, killing many of them before being forced to retreat and take refuge in the Serapeum itself.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}}

Since the Serapeum was built on top of a large hill and was surrounded by high walls, the teachers and their students were able to withstand a lengthy siege by the Christians of Alexandria and were even able to launch [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sorties]] against them on several occasions.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=190}} According to Damascius, Olympus was the leader of the pagan guerilla fighters inside the Serapeum and he encouraged all the others to continue the vigilant worship of Serapis.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=191}} Finally, the pagan guerilla fighters in the Serapeum were offered official amnesty from the emperor [[Theodosius I]] himself if they would agree to leave the temple.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=190–191}} Olympus led a ceremony in which Serapis abandoned the temple and then they left, abandoning the Serapeum for the Christians to plunder.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=190–191}} The Christians vandalized and demolished the temple to the ground,{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=191}}{{sfn|Theodore|2016|pages=182–183}} although some parts of the [[colonnade]] were still standing as late as the twelfth century.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=191}} However, none of the accounts of the Serapeum's destruction mention anything about it having a library and sources written before its destruction speak of its collection of books in the past tense, indicating that it probably did not have any significant collection of scrolls in it at the time of its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulus Orosius]], [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius6B.html#15 vi.15.32] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917192818/http://attalus.org/latin/orosius6B.html#15 |date=17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=El-Abbadi |first=Mostafa |year=1990 |title=The Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria|edition= 2nd, illustrated|publisher=Unesco/UNDP|pages=159, 160|isbn=92-3-102632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Theodore|2016|pages=182–183}}

Watts, however, Theon was probably the head of a school called the "Mouseion", which was named in emulation of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] Mouseion that had once included the Library of Alexandria, but which had little other connection to it.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=191–192}} Theon's school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=192}} Neither Theon nor Hypatia seem to have had any connections to the militant Iamblichean Neoplatonists who taught in the Serapeum.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=191}} Instead, Theon seems to have rejected the teachings of Iamblichus{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=192}} and may have taken pride in teaching a pure, [[Plotinus|Plotinian]] Neoplatonism.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=192}} In around 400 AD, Theon's daughter [[Hypatia]] (born c. 350–370; died 415 AD) succeeded him as the head of his school.{{sfn|Oakes|2007|page=364}} Like her father, she rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and instead embraced the original Neoplatonism formulated by Plotinus.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=192}}

Theophilus, the same bishop who ordered the destruction of the Serapeum, tolerated Hypatia's school and even encouraged two of her students to become bishops in territory under his authority.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=196}} Hypatia was extremely popular with the people of Alexandria{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=195-196}} and exerted profound political influence.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=195–196}} Theophilus respected Alexandria's political structures and raised no objection to the close ties Hypatia established with Roman prefects.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=196}} Hypatia was later implicated in a political feud between [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], the [[List of governors of Roman Egypt|Roman prefect of Alexandria]], and [[Cyril of Alexandria]], Theophilus's successor as bishop.{{sfn|Novak|2010|page=240}}{{sfn|Cameron|Long|Sherry|1993|pages=58–61}} Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril{{sfn|Novak|2010|page=240}}{{sfn|Cameron|Long|Sherry|1993|page=59}} and, in March of 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians, led by a [[Reader (liturgy)|lector]] named Peter.{{sfn|Novak|2010|page=240}}{{sfn|Cameron|Long|Sherry|1993|pages=59–61}} She had no successor and her school collapsed after her death.{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=117}}

=== Later schools and libraries in Alexandria ===
Nonetheless, Hypatia was not the last pagan in Alexandria, nor was she the last Neoplatonist philosopher.{{sfn|Booth|2017|pages=151–152}}{{sfn|Watts|2017|pages=154–155}} Neoplatonism and paganism both survived in Alexandria and throughout the eastern Mediterranean for centuries after her death.{{sfn|Booth|2017|pages=151–152}}{{sfn|Watts|2017|pages=154–155}} British Egyptologist [[Charlotte Booth]] notes that a large number of new academic lecture halls were built in Alexandria at Kom el-Dikka shortly after Hypatia's death, indicating that philosophy was clearly still taught in Alexandrian schools.{{sfn|Booth|2017|page=151}} The late fifth-century writers [[Zacharias Scholasticus]] and [[Aeneas of Gaza]] both speak of the "Mouseion" as occupying some kind of a physical space.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}} Archaeologists have identified lecture halls dating to around this time period, located near, but not on, the site of the Ptolemaic Mouseion, which may be the "Mouseion" to which these writers refer.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}

In AD 642, Alexandria was [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|captured by the Muslim army]] of [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Several later Arabic sources describe the library's destruction by the order of [[Caliph Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;De Sacy, ''Relation de l’Egypte par Abd al-Latif'', Paris, 1810: "Above the column of the pillars is a dome supported by this column. I think this building was the portico where Aristotle taught, and after him his disciples; and that this was the academy that Alexander built when he built this city, and where was placed the library which Amr ibn-Alas burned, with the permission of Omar."

Pococke, p.181, translation on p.114.

Latin: “Quod ad libros quorum mentionem fecisti: si in illis contineatur, quod cum libro Dei conveniat, in libro Dei [est] quod sufficiat absque illo; quod si in illis fuerit quod libro Dei repugnet, neutiquam est eo [nobis] opus, jube igitur e medio tolli.” Jussit ergo Amrus Ebno’lAs dispergi eos per balnea Alexandriae, atque illis calefaciendis comburi; ita spatio semestri consumpti sunt. Audi quid factum fuerit et mirare."&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars, including Father [[Eusèbe Renaudot]] in 1793, are skeptical of these stories, given the range of time that had passed before they were written down and the political motivations of the various writers.&lt;ref&gt;E. Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', chapter 51: "It would be endless to enumerate the moderns who have wondered and believed, but I may distinguish with honour the rational scepticism of Renaudot, (Hist. Alex. Patriarch, p. 170: ) historia ... habet aliquid ut απιστον ut Arabibus familiare est." However Butler says: "Renaudot thinks the story has an element of untrustworthiness: Gibbon discusses it rather briefly and disbelieves it." (ch.25, p.401)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The civilisation of Arabs'', Book no III, 1884, reedition of 1980, page 468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3517|title=The Vanished Library by Bernard Lewis|work=nybooks.com|access-date=26 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116003731/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3517|archive-date=16 November 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003|p=51|ps=.&amp;nbsp;"Today most scholars have discredited the story of the destruction of the Library by the Muslims."}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|p=71|ps=.&amp;nbsp;"The story first appears 500 years after the Arab conquest of Alexandria. John the Grammarian appears to be John Philoponus, who must have been dead by the time of the conquest. It seems, as shown above, that both of the Alexandrian libraries were destroyed by the end of the fourth century, and there is no mention of any library surviving at Alexandria in the Christian literature of the centuries following that date. It is also suspicious that Omar is recorded to have made the same remark about books found by the Arab during their conquest of Iran."}}

== Collection ==
It is not possible to determine the collection's size in any era with certainty. [[Papyrus]] scrolls constituted the collection, and although [[codex|codices]] were used after 300 BC, the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to [[parchment]], perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade. (The Library of Alexandria in fact was indirectly causal in the creation of writing on parchment&amp;nbsp;— due to the library's critical need for papyrus, little was exported and thus an alternate source of copy material became essential.)&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls, and this division into self-contained "books" was a major aspect of editorial work. King [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (309–246 BC) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, W.W. 1928. Ptolemy II. ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', 14(3/4), 246–260. The Byzantine writer [[Tzetzes]] gives a similar figure in his essay [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poets.html#lycophron2 On Comedy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120080207/http://www.attalus.org/translate/poets.html#lycophron2 |date=20 January 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The library's index, [[Callimachus]]'s ''[[Pinakes]]'', has only survived in the form of a few fragments, and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been. At its height, the library was said to possess nearly half a million scrolls, and, although historians debate the precise number, the highest estimates claim 400,000 scrolls while the most conservative estimates are as low as 40,000, which is still an enormous collection that required vast storage space.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009-07-27|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|isbn=978-1-60239-706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=}}

As a research institution, the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural sciences and other subjects. Its empirical standards were applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious [[textual criticism]]. As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity. Once ascertained, canonical copies would then be made for scholars, royalty, and wealthy bibliophiles the world over, this commerce bringing income to the library.&lt;ref name="Kennedy1999" /&gt;

=== In antiquity ===
The Library of Alexandria was one of the largest and most prestigious libraries of the ancient world, but it was far from the only one.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3, 10–11}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=48}} By the end of the Hellenistic Period, almost every city in the Eastern Mediterranean had a public library and so did many medium-sized towns.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}} During the Roman Period, the number of libraries only proliferated.{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}} By the fourth century AD, there were at least two dozen public libraries in the city of Rome itself alone.{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}} Although the Library of Alexandria was destroyed, in fact the centers of academic excellence had already moved to various capital cities. Furthermore, it is possible that most of the material from the Library of Alexandria actually survived, by way of the [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]], the [[Academy of Gondishapur]], and the [[House of Wisdom]]. This material may then have been preserved by the [[Reconquista]], which led to the formation of [[Medieval university|European Universities]] and the [[Research library#Renaissance|recompilation of ancient texts]] from formerly scattered fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00j0q53|title=BBC UK radio program In Our Time: The Library of Alexandria|editor=Melvin Bragg|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704051818/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00j0q53|archive-date=4 July 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late antiquity, as the Roman Empire became Christianized, Christian libraries modeled directly on the Library of Alexandria and other great libraries of earlier pagan times began to be founded all across the Greek-speaking eastern part of the empire.{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}} Among the largest and most prominent of these libraries were the [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima]], the Library of Jerusalem, and a Christian library in Alexandria.{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}} These libraries held both pagan and Christian writings side-by-side{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}} and Christian scholars applied to the Judeo-Christian scriptures the same philological techniques that the scholars of the Library of Alexandria had used for analyzing the Greek classics.{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}} Nonetheless, the study of pagan authors remained secondary to the study of the Christian scriptures until the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Nelles|2010|page=533}}

Ironically, the survival of ancient texts owes nothing to the great libraries of antiquity and instead owes everything to the fact that they were exhaustingly copied and recopied, at first by professional scribes during the Roman Period onto papyrus and later by monks during the [[Middle Ages]] onto parchment.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=61}}{{sfn|Nelles|2010|pages=533–534}}

{{main|Bibliotheca Alexandrina}}
The idea of reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria in the modern era was first proposed in 1974, when Lotfy Dowidar was president of the [[University of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=265}} In May 1986, Egypt requested the Executive Board of [[UNESCO]] to allow the international organization to conduct a feasibility study for the project.{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=265}} This marked the beginning of UNESCO and the international community's involvement in trying to bring the project to fruition.{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=265}} Starting in 1988, UNESCO and the [[UNDP]] worked to support the international architectural competition to design the Library.{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=265}} Egypt devoted four hectares of land for the building of the Library and established the National High Commission for the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|pages=265–266}} Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] took a personal interest in the project, which greatly contributed to its advancement.{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=266}} Completed in 2002, the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] now functions as a modern library and cultural center, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibalex.org/en/Page/About|title=About the BA – Bibliotheca Alexandrina|website=www.bibalex.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129140436/http://www.bibalex.org/en/page/about|archive-date=29 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the mission of the Great Library of Alexandria, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina also houses the [[International School of Information Science]] (ISIS), a school for students preparing for highly specialized post-graduate degrees, whose goal is to train professional staff for libraries in Egypt and across the Middle East.{{sfn|Tocatlian|1991|page=259}}

''The following languages are either extinct, or no longer used on the North Sea coast''
* [[Old Norse]] (North Germanic).  This evolved into the modern North Germanic language group, of which most except for Norn still survive.
** [[Norn language]].  This was spoken in the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands but was replaced by English/Scots in the 18th and 19th centuries.  The last speaker died in the 19th century.
* [[Pictish language]] (Celtic).  This was spoken in what's now [[Scotland]] in the early Middle Ages by a people called the [[Picts]].  It was replaced by Scottish Gaelic and Old Norse in the 9th and 10th centuries.
* [[Scottish Gaelic language]] (Celtic)  After it replaced pictish, it was spoken all over Scotland, where it was the national language.  It was replaced by English/Scots in the lowlands from the High Middle Ages but until recently it was spoken on the north sea coast of the Highlands, from Nairn to John O' Groats.  With the [[Highland Clearances]] of the early 19th century and due to other factors, it lost ground to English in those areas.  Although a few speakers of those dialects of Gaelic remain as of the early 21st century, they are among the elderly and Gaelic is no longer the predominant language of anywhere on the north sea coast.  Attempts are being made to revive it.
*  [[Old Brythonic language]] (Celtic) was spoken in Britain in the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], the [[Roman Britain|Roman Era]] and the [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman Period]]. It was replaced by the Germanic dialects of the Anglo-Saxon invaders that would later be [[Old English]].

'''''Louder Than War''''' is a music and culture website and magazine focusing on mainly alternative arts news, reviews, and features. The site is an editorially independent publication that was started by journalist [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]] in 2010 and is now run by a team of other journalists with a worldwide team of freelancers.  There has been a print edition since 2015

The site is built around live reviews, album reviews and exclusive in-depth interviews with many key musicians including [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[John Lydon]], [[Peter Hook]], [[The Stranglers]], [[The Charlatans (UK band)|The Charlatans]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and [[Happy Mondays|The Happy Mondays]]. In 2012, ''Louder Than War'' launched a record label&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Louder Than War Launches Label |url = http://thequietus.com/articles/08372-louder-than-war-record-label/|work = The Quietus|accessdate = 15 January 2016|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote and champion lesser known bands and artists.

The website broke the story of [[The Stone Roses]]' reformation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Stone Roses reformation is definite, and new album as well...|url = http://louderthanwar.com/stone-roses-reformation-definite-and-new-album-as-well/|work = Louder Than War|accessdate = 15 January 2016|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a supporter of the "Justice Tonight for the 96" [[Hillsborough disaster|Hillsborough]] tour.

John Robb is also a member of the English punk rock bands [[The Membranes]] and [[Goldblade]].

==History==
In its first year, in November 2011, Robb was voted to win the UK Association of Independent Music "Indie Champion" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AIM Independent Music Awards : 2011&amp;nbsp;– The Association of Independent Music |url=http://www.musicindie.com/awards/awards2011 |website=www.musicindie.com |accessdate=13 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913160612/http://www.musicindie.com/awards/awards2011 |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the creation of the website, the ''Louder Than War'' team wrote their own manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Manifesto |url = http://louderthanwar.com/about-us/|work = Louder than War|accessdate = 15 January 2016|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would guide their editorial content.

In 2014 Louder Than War created the record label '''Louder Than War Records''' to act as a platform for bands and artists to reach a wider audience; the first release being Evil Blizzard 'The Dangers Remixes', a 300 copy CD only release without a catalogue number, each being hand numbered; the 8 track releases being a remix of the at that point still to be released Evil Blizzard debut 'The Dangers of Evil Blizzard' (LOUD001).
The label has since gone on to release material by King Champion Sounds, Faerground Accidents, The Nightingales, Super Besses, Get Your Gun, and The Membranes.

In August 2015, ''Louder Than War'' announced they were also creating a print/magazine version of the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Louder Than War announces launch of print/magazine version of website |url = http://louderthanwar.com/louder-than-war-announces-launch-of-printmagazine-version-of-website/|work = Louder than War|accessdate = 15 January 2016|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of ''Louder Than War'' magazine was published by Big Cheese Publishing Ltd in autumn 2015 and followed a similar style and format to the website.

In September 2015, Sarah Lay became Editor with John Robb becoming Editor-in-Chief of the online and offline publications.

In July 2017 Lay left. The website continues to be run by Robb and Associate Editor Phil Newall and a team of other section editors, journalists and contributors worldwide.

'''Mantle of the Expert''' is an education approach that uses imaginary contexts to generate purposeful&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) A Beginner's Guide to Mantle of the Expert. Singular. p.51.(Due for publication July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and engaging&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; activities for learning. Within the fiction the students are cast as a team of experts working for a client on a commission. The commission is designed by the teacher to generate tasks and activities that fulfil the requirements of the client as well as create opportunities for students to study wide areas of the curriculum. For example, a class of students are cast (within the fiction) as a team of [[archaeologists]] [[excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] an Egyptian tomb for the [[Cairo Museum]]. To complete the commission they research ancient Egyptian history – learning about tombs, artefacts, and rituals – and in the process study history, geography, art, design and other subjects, as well as develop their skills in reading, writing, problem solving, and inquiry. Mantle of the Expert is not designed to teach the entire curriculum, all the time, but is rather an approach to be used selectively by the teacher along with a range of other methods.

Mantle of the Expert was developed by [[Dorothy Heathcote]] at [[Newcastle University]] in the 1970s and 80's. An internationally renowned authority&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, B.J. (1976) Dorothy Heathcote: Drama as a Learning Medium. London: Trentham Books.&lt;/ref&gt; on drama for learning,&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. (2003) Dorothy Heathcote's Story: the biography of a remarkable drama teacher. London: Trentham Books, introduction p.x&lt;/ref&gt; Heathcote's aim was to provide non-drama specialists with an approach that would support them in using drama across the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.126.&lt;/ref&gt; Heathcote believed drama was an underused approach outside drama studios and could be used as a powerful medium for learning across the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Heathcote said she didn't as much invent Mantle of the Expert as "find herself doing it."&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Sandra Hesten]] in 1993, Heathcote recounts working with a small group of children on a drama context about the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] – "…thinking about it later I thought that's really important – they were expert kings. And then it began to dawn on me. People had to have a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. So when I reviewed the week I thought – the point of view of inn-keeping, the point of view of soldiers who are working for [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the point of view of [[angels]], the point of view of kings. And that's when it started coming together."&lt;ref&gt;Hesten, S. (1986) The Heathcote Archive. PhD thesis. p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

This conversation is recorded by Hesten in her [[PhD thesis]] and is recounted by Heathcote at least two further times, once in the documentary "Pieces of Dorothy" and in an interview for the Mantle of the Expert website in 2009 - "That was the start, I then started to think, what do I call it? That's when I got this crazy name. Which is extreme not crazy, just fanciful. I can't find a better name." Although Heathcote doesn't put a date on the 'Nativity' context in any of these interviews, it was likely to be around the mid-1970s, since soon after this time she began talking about Mantle of the Expert as a distinct approach and incorporated it into her courses at Newcastle University.&lt;ref&gt;Hesten, S. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with her graduate students at Newcastle University, Heathcote spent much of the late 1970s and 80's researching, developing, and evaluating Mantle of the Expert across a range of settings – [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, [[Special school|special schools]], [[Borstal|borstals]], and adult and child [[mental hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.125.&lt;/ref&gt; Her method was to teach week long sessions, planned in advance with her students, which involved them playing different roles in the classroom. Although often involving a great deal of improvisation and discussion, Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert contexts were carefully planned and often elaborately embellished with resources, props, and costumes created by the graduate students. Essentially experimental in nature, these sessions were discussed, analysed, and evaluated by Heathcote and her students, and formed the foundations for the student's studies of the approach. In some cases these 'experiments' were documented.&lt;ref&gt;Hesten, S. (1986) p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring in 1987, Heathcote continued to work on Mantle of the Expert, and used the approach in various settings and in different parts of the world.

In 1995 she co-wrote, "Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education" with Gavin Bolton.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, D. and Bolton, G. (1995) Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education. Portsmouth: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later Developments ==

Among her students in the early 1980s was Luke Abbott. Abbott was a secondary school drama teacher at the time and took a year out to study with Heathcote on her graduate drama course. After completing his M.A. Abbott switched jobs and became a Local Authority advisor for Essex County Council and began working in schools – both primary and secondary – across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles|url=http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/about-moe/articles/|website=Mantle of the Expert|date=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this new role Abbott used Mantle of the Expert with teachers in their classrooms, using Heathcote's laboratory method. His aim was to demonstrate how Mantle of the Expert worked with students in authentic classroom settings, using few props or elaborate resources. His approach was more pragmatic than Heathcote's and designed to be easier for teachers to implement.

In the early 2000s Abbott organised a series of conferences, both nationally and internationally, to promote the approach and its use as a pedagogy. With Heathcote as the keynote speaker and classroom teachers running workshops, Abbott's aim was to demystify Mantle of the Expert and turn the approach into something non-specialist drama teachers could use across the curriculum (as Heathcote had always planned). Schools such as Bealings Primary in Suffolk, Pound Lane Infants in Sussex, and Recreation Road Infants in Norwich began to use Mantle of the Expert as their main teaching approach and gained 'outstanding' grades from [[Ofsted]], as well as excellent [[National Curriculum assessment|SATs]] results.

Since this time, Abbott and others have continued to develop Mantle of the Expert, working to train teachers in the UK, New Zealand, USA, and Palestine. Since 2012 eight schools in different regions of England have become '[http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/training/mantle-of-the-expert-quality-mark-training-schools/ training schools]' for Mantle of the Expert. And the approach is included in several university teacher training courses (including Newcastle).

== Method ==

[[File:SBP 6352.jpg|thumb|Using Heathcote's drama conventions, students explore why so many male passengers died during the sinking of the Titanic.]]
Mantle of the Expert works&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.25&lt;/ref&gt; by the teacher planning a fictional context where the students take on the responsibilities of an expert team. As the team, they are commissioned by a client (within the fiction) to work on a commission, which has been planned by the teacher to generate tasks and activities that involve them in studying and developing wide areas of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning the students are aware that they are involved in a fiction. Mantle of the Expert is not a simulation invented by the teacher to trick them into thinking they are involved in something real.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consciously going in and coming out of the fiction is an important dimension of the Mantle of the Expert approach. Like imaginative play&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; the participants are always aware that the fiction is something that can stop and start as and when they or the teacher decide. In this way, an activity inside the fiction can create a purpose for curriculum learning outside the fiction. The teacher can introduce the task to the students 'as if' they are the expert team, such as writing a report to the museum, and then stop the story and come out of the fiction to teach them directly the knowledge and skills they need to complete the task. Once the task is complete, the teacher can restart the story and the students can see how their work has an effect inside the fiction. It is this process of going in and coming out of the fictional context that defines Mantle of the Expert as a teaching and learning approach.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'mantle' in Mantle of the Expert is a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not mean the students are endowed with expertise in the real world. Heathcote was clear about this.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, C. (2015) Dorothy Heathcote on Education and Drama: Essential Writing. Routledge, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; They are only experts inside the fiction, in the sense that they are taking on the powers and responsibilities of the team; they are not experts outside the fiction. Both the teacher and the students work collaboratively inside the fiction as people working for the same team. This means the teacher deliberately changes her power relationship with the students to one of equal power and authority. In this way decisions are made through discussion and distributed leadership. Outside the fiction, the teacher's authority remains unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of a fictional context where the students experiment with making decisions, taking on responsibilities, and meeting challenging situations, is a kind of 'safe zone' within the classroom. Unlike the real world where children would rarely, if ever, have these experiences, in an imaginary world they can explore, discuss, and evaluate them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heathcote this is what she meant when she described her ideal classroom as a laboratory - "when you enter such a lab you bring in your knowledge and training with you and take on the mantle of responsibility that goes with the character of the setting. Above all, you know that the result of what you do there matter to someone other than yourself. Such settings are cells effecting change in society."&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==

Tim Taylor in his book, "A Beginner's Guide to Mantle of the Expert"&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; identifies nine elements to the Mantle of the Expert approach. These are:

# The creation of a fictional context – planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. The main functions of the fictional context are to create wider opportunities for curriculum learning; to make curriculum learning meaningful and purposeful; and to engage the students in curriculum study.
# The use of a narrative – planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. The main functions of the narrative are to set up the context for the students; to offer the students a way into the fiction; and to make curriculum activities memorable, understandable, and coherent.
#  The use of inquiry questions. The main functions of inquiry questions are for students to explore, study, and analyse the curriculum; for students and teachers to work together in a community of learning; and for the teacher to create opportunities for students to assess, rethink, and shape the direction of the work as it develops.
# The Expert Team. Planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. Expert teams are people with authority, power, and status; people with responsibilities and duties to others; a community with agreed values and a defined purpose; colleagues with a shared history of challenges, mistakes, and success; experts with training and experience
# The client. Planned by the teacher. The purpose of the client is to generate purposeful activities for the team; create a focus for the team; reflect back to the team how they are performing and what they need to do to improve and develop; assess and evaluate the work of the team, requiring high standards and a focus on the commission; provide information, specialist knowledge, and experiences; make demands of the team.
# The commission. Planned by the teacher and developed with the students. The function of the commission is to give purpose to the work of the team and, by extension, to the students' curriculum studies; focus the work and keep it on course; provide a goal for the work, something to strive for; create a sense of responsibility; generate self-worth and a sense of achievement.
# Different points view. The purpose of providing the students with different points of view is to look at events from multiple perspectives; provide alternative attitudes, values, and beliefs; generate opportunities for exploring people's motivations; challenge the student's views and orthodox thinking; create opportunities to explore people and events in depth and complexity; experiment with different ways of dealing with challenges and problems.
# Tension. Planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. The purpose of tension is to create excitement and interest; create productive energy, drawing on the students' excitement and commitment to events; generate opportunities to examine people's actions, motivations, and values; build resilience.
# Drama conventions. Planned by the teacher and used in collaboration with the students. The purpose of drama conventions is to play with time – hold it, rewind it, jump forward; create opportunities for exploration, examination, discussion, and reflection; investigate people's actions, motivations, and values; give students the power to influence events; create a 'safe zone' that gives students the opportunity to experiment and explore different possibilities and choices.

Both events are scheduled to be held in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The checkered design on both mascots was inspired by [[2020 Summer Olympics#Emblem|the Tokyo 2020 official logo]], while Someity's pink design was inspired by [[Cherry blossom|cherry blossom flowers]]. Both fictional characters have various superpowers, such as [[teleportation]].

Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the [[Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games|Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee]], which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for "future" and "eternity", and Someity is named after ''[[someiyoshino]]'', a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also references the English phrase "so mighty". The mascots are expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandising and licensing deals.

== History ==

=== Selection and naming process ===
In late 2017 and early 2018, the [[Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games|Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee]] held a competition to determine the design of the 2020 mascots. A total of 2,042 design submissions were accepted between 1 August and 14 August 2017. The entries were then subjected to a series of format and design examinations led by media specialists and the Organising Committee's Mascot Selection Panel to determine whether they "would appeal to elementary school-aged children" and whether they "amply reflected the spirit of the Tokyo 2020 Games Vision".&lt;ref name="tokyo2020_mascots"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tokyo2020.jp/en/games/mascot/|title=Tokyo 2020 Games Mascots|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164629/https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/mascot/|archive-date=1 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-October 2017, this process reduced the pool to a shortlist of three sets of mascot candidates, which were unveiled on 7 December 2017. Each set included two mascots: one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games.&lt;ref name="tokyo2020_mascots" /&gt; Between 11 December 2017 and 22 February 2018, an election was conducted across 16,769 [[Elementary schools in Japan|Japanese elementary schools]] to choose the winning entry, with each participating elementary school class allocated one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/01/national/2020-tokyo-olympic-organizers-begin-soliciting-mascot-ideas/ |title=2020 Tokyo Olympic organizers begin soliciting mascot ideas |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |date=1 August 2017 |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/12/07/tokyo-olympic-mascot-photos-2020/ |title=Tokyo 2020 lets children choose mascots from 3 finalists |publisher=''[[NBC Sports]]'' |date=7 December 2017 |accessdate= 17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In total, 205,755 elementary school classes participated in the election.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Miraitowa, the Olympic mascot, is a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by [[2020 Summer Olympics#Emblem|the Games' official logo]]. It is intended to embody "both old tradition and new innovation". The character has a "strong sense of justice" and is described as "very athletic". It has the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] anywhere instantly.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tokyo 2020 Games Mascots |url=https://tokyo2020.org/en/special/mascot/ |website=Tokyo 2020 |publisher=The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games |accessdate=30 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words ''mirai'' (future) and ''towa'' (eternity) combined.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to the Tokyo 2020 organizers, the name "was chosen to promote a future full of eternal hope in the hearts of people all over the world".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Cerasus × yedoensis Akebono 01.jpg|thumb|Flowers of the [[cherry blossom]] ''[[Prunus × yedoensis]]'' ({{lang-ja|染井吉野|someiyoshino}}), the namesake of the Paralympic mascot]]
Someity, the Paralympic mascot, is a figure with pink-checkered patterns inspired by [[Cherry blossom|cherry blossom flowers]] and also the Games' official logo. The character is described as "usually calm" but can become "very powerful when needed". The character has the special ability to flight using a pink-checkered cape and cherry blossom-shaped antenna to "talk to stones and the wind" and can also [[Telekenesis|move objects by looking at them]].&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; Someity is named after ''[[someiyoshino]]'', a type of cherry blossom, and it is also intended to refer to the English phrase "so mighty".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Although the two mascots have conflicting personalities, they nonetheless have a strong friendship and respect for each other.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt;  According to their fictional backgrounds, Miraitowa and Someity "live in the digital world", and through the Internet, they can transport themselves between the digital world and the [[real life|real world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tokyo 2020 Paralympic mascot named Someity |url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/tokyo-2020-paralympic-mascot-named-someity |website=Official website of the Paralympic Movement |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |accessdate=22 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.paralympic.org/news/tokyo-2020-paralympic-mascot-named-someity |archivedate=22 July 2018 |dead-url=no |date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sadashige Aoki, an [[Advertising|advertising theory]] professor at [[Hosei University]], the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of "creating personalized characters out of nature — mountains, rivers, animals and plants", as well as a "tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The mascots were designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, who lives in the [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] in southern Japan. Taniguchi was persuaded by his father, who is also an illustrator, to study art at [[Cabrillo College]] in California.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/05/ad717c3d31b2-feature-tokyo-2020-mascot-designer-draws-inspiration-from-the-scenic-route.html|title=Tokyo 2020 mascot designer draws inspiration from the scenic route|last=Hueston|first=Dave|date=3 May 2018|website=Kyodo News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708083708oe_/https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/05/ad717c3d31b2-feature-tokyo-2020-mascot-designer-draws-inspiration-from-the-scenic-route.html|archive-date=8 July 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has illustrated English-language textbooks for Japanese children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adelstein |first1=Jake |title=Japan's Cute Blue And Pink Mascots Are Here To Boost The Tokyo 2020 Olympics |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adelsteinjake/2018/03/01/japans-cute-blue-and-pink-mascots-are-here-to-boost-the-tokyo-2020-olympics/#1d87970776e9 |website=Forbes |accessdate=8 July 2018|archive-url=http://archive.today/2018.07.08-082056/https://www.forbes.com/sites/adelsteinjake/2018/03/01/japans-cute-blue-and-pink-mascots-are-here-to-boost-the-tokyo-2020-olympics/%231d87970776e9|archive-date=8 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taniguchi was uninvolved in the naming of the mascots, though he did attend a screening at which various naming proposals were introduced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred [[intellectual property]] rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, he will not receive any [[royalty payment]]s from mascot-related licensing.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gallagher |first1=Chris |title=Olympics: Futuristic pointy-eared mascots chosen for Tokyo 2020 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-mascots/olympics-futuristic-pointy-eared-mascots-chosen-for-tokyo-2020-idUSKCN1GC0Q5 |website=Reuters |accessdate=9 July 2018 |date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merchandising ===
The mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million ({{JPY|14.4 billion}}) in revenue from licensing and merchandising.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The organizers of Tokyo 2020 had been criticized for its budget management.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reutersbudget" /&gt; According to ''[[Reuters]]'', a 2016 study found that overall expenses for the Olympics could be "four times the initial estimate made in the bid process".&lt;ref name="reutersbudget"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-briefing/tokyo-2020-must-address-questions-says-iocs-coates-idUSKBN1HU0B9|title=Tokyo 2020 must address questions, says IOC's Coates|last=Tarrant|first=Jack|date=22 April 2018|website=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135407/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-briefing/tokyo-2020-must-address-questions-says-iocs-coates-idUSKBN1HU0B9|archive-date=24 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo 2020 must transfer [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] to the mascots to the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/01/23/business/cuddly-cute-will-japans-olympic-mascots-cash-cows/|title=Cuddly and cute, but will Japan’s Olympic mascots be cash cows?|last=|first=|date=23 January 2018|website=The Japan Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123123831/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/01/23/business/cuddly-cute-will-japans-olympic-mascots-cash-cows/|archive-date=23 January 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From late July to early September 2018, a "Mascot House" was located on the first floor of the [[Tokyo Midtown Hibiya]] building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tokyo2020.org/en/special/mascot/|title=Tokyo 2020 Mascots|website=Tokyo 2020|publisher=Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816205001/https://tokyo2020.org/en/special/mascot/|archivedate=16 August 2018|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The public reaction to the mascot selection was "generally positive", according to an article published on ''[[Forbes]]''' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein. Adelstein described the mascots as "cute", though he commented that "there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles". Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-tokyo-olympic-mascots-look-like-pokemon-1823383301|title=The Tokyo Olympic Mascots Look Like Pokémon|last=Ashcraft|first=Brian|date=28 February 2018|website=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307160208/https://kotaku.com/the-tokyo-olympic-mascots-look-like-pokemon-1823383301|archive-date=7 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadspin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McQuade |first1=Dan |title=Will Japan’s Olympic Mascot Be A Soohorang Or An Izzy? |url=https://deadspin.com/will-japan-s-olympic-mascot-be-a-soohorang-or-an-izzy-1823406254 |website=Deadspin |publisher=Gizmodo Media Group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301004148/https://deadspin.com/will-japan-s-olympic-mascot-be-a-soohorang-or-an-izzy-1823406254 |archive-date=1 March 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=12 July 2018 |date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by [[Agence France-Presse]] described the [[social media]] reaction to the mascot selection on as "mixed". Some users commented that the mascots were "very Japanese and very cute", while others commented that the mascots should have been "more round" or "more huggable". Other commentators said that the selected design "appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/doe-eyed-superhero-picked-for-tokyo-2020-mascot|title=Doe-eyed superhero picked for Tokyo 2020 mascot|date=28 February 2018|work=The Straits Times|accessdate=11 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228092454/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/doe-eyed-superhero-picked-for-tokyo-2020-mascot|archive-date=28 February 2018|dead-url=no|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website ''[[Deadspin]]'' that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of [[Soohorang and Bandabi]], the mascots of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], citing statements from the [[BBC]], which wrote that the 2020 mascots "have a tough act to follow", and ''[[The Japan Times]]'', which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi "leaves Japan in a bind".&lt;ref name="deadspin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tokyo 2020 Olympic mascots unveiled after children's vote |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43221985 |website=BBC |accessdate=12 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228163418/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43221985 |archivedate=28 February 2018 |dead-url=no |date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tanaka |first1=Yukari |title=Success of Pyeongchang Olympic mascots leaves Japan in a bind |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/02/24/national/media-national/success-pyeongchang-olympic-mascots-leaves-japan-bind/ |website=The Japan Times |accessdate=12 July 2018 |archiveurl=http://archive.today/2018.07.12-084402/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/02/24/national/media-national/success-pyeongchang-olympic-mascots-leaves-japan-bind/%23.W0cUudLLfK4 |archivedate=12 July 2018 |dead-url=no |date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website ''[[SB Nation]]'', wrote that there is "nothing functionally wrong" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead. Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/28/17061668/tokyo-2020-mascots-the-kids-are-wrong|title=Tokyo 2020 mascots aren’t Stoned Cat and Leaf Bear because kids have no taste|last=Dator|first=James|date=28 February 2018|website=SB Nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228202528/https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/28/17061668/tokyo-2020-mascots-the-kids-are-wrong|archive-date=28 February 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese [[pedagogy]] expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a "a very Japanese [[anime]] like quality", describing them as "brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics".&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">'''Modesty in medical settings''' refers to the practices and equipment used to preserve patient [[modesty]] in medical examination and clinics.

==Tools for modesty==

Prior to the invention of the [[stethoscope]], a physician who wanted to perform [[auscultation]] to listen to [[heart sounds]] or noise inside a body would have to physically place their ear against the body of the person being examined.&lt;ref name="Roguin"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Ariel Roguin | title = Rene Theophile Hyacinthe Laennec (1781-1826): the man behind the stethoscope | journal = Clinical Medicine &amp; Research | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–235 | date=September 2006 | pmid = 17048358 | doi=10.3121/cmr.4.3.230 | pmc=1570491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, male physician [[René Laennec]] invented the stethoscope as a way to respect the modesty of a female patient, as it would have been awkward for him to put his ear on her chest.&lt;ref name="Roguin"/&gt;

[[Hospital gowns]] increase modesty as compared to the patient presenting nude, but in the past have been odd clothing which exposes the body.&lt;ref name="Shefali"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/hospital-gowns-get-a-makeover/389258/ |title=Hospital Gowns Get a Makeover — The Atlantic |first=Shefali |last=Luthra |work=theatlantic.com |date=4 April 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary changes to the design of hospital gowns are proposed.&lt;ref name="Shefali"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
In places with more [[cultural diversity]] it becomes more likely that people will make new and different requests for modesty in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seibert|first1=PS|last2=Stridh-Igo|first2=P|last3=Zimmerman|first3=CG|title=A checklist to facilitate cultural awareness and sensitivity.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=June 2002|volume=28|issue=3|pages=143–6|pmid=12042396|doi=10.1136/jme.28.3.143|pmc=1733575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special populations==
Sometimes women do not access healthcare because of modesty concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoueri-Mychasiw|first1=N|last2=Campbell|first2=S|last3=Mai|first3=V|title=Increasing screening mammography among immigrant and minority women in Canada: a review of past interventions.|journal=[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]|date=February 2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=149–58|doi=10.1007/s10903-012-9612-8|pmid=22466249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims in non-Muslim societies sometimes make requests for modesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rassool|first1=GH|title=Cultural competence in nursing Muslim patients.|journal=Nursing times|date=April 2015|volume=111|issue=14|pages=12–5|pmid=26182584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boucher|first1=NA|last2=Siddiqui|first2=EA|last3=Koenig|first3=HG|title=Supporting Muslim Patients During Advanced Illness.|journal=The Permanente journal|date=2017|volume=21|doi=10.7812/TPP/16-190|pmid=28609264|pmc=5469433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moretum''' is a type of herb cheese [[Spread (food)|spread]] that the [[Ancient Roman]]s ate with bread.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Cookery: Ancient Recipes for Modern Kitchens'' by Mark Grant, {{ISBN|1-897959-39-7}}, by Serif, 47 Strahan Rd, London E3 5DA&lt;/ref&gt; A typical moretum was made of [[herb]]s, fresh [[cheese]], [[salt]], [[oil]] and some [[vinegar]]. Optionally, different kinds of nuts could be added. The contents were crushed together in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]], hence the name.

==Recipes==
A recipe can be found in the poem of the same name in the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virgil.org/appendix/moretum.htm Appendix Vergiliana in English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Re Rustica'', book XII of [[Columella]] contains further recipes of moretum. The variant with pine nuts is very similar to modern [[pesto]].

A '''mushroom hat''' (also sometimes referred to as a '''mushroom brim hat''' or '''dish hat''') is a millinery style in which the brim of the hat tilts downwards, resembling the shape of a mushroom (or dish). It is a style that first emerged in the 1870s and 1880s, when it was usually made of straw. It became fashionable again from around 1907 to the late 1920s; these versions featured a distinctly downturned brim although the size and shape of the crown varied according to prevailing fashions.

A new and exaggerated version of the mushroom hat was popularised by [[Christian Dior]] in 1947 as part of his [[Christian Dior S.A.#The .22New Look.22|"New Look"]] collection. This style generally had a minimal crown and a very wide brim, with some models resembling a [[flying saucer]].

==History of the design==

The defining characteristic of mushroom hats is their downturned brim, resembling a mushroom or toadstool.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken |first1=Mary |title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|date=2010|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States |isbn=0486402940 |pages=138 |edition=1999 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=mary+brooks+picken+%2B+mushroom+hat#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20brooks%20picken%20%2B%20mushroom%20hat&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, designs in straw shaped like a mushroom became popular. These had a small crown trimmed with ribbons, flowers and – in the 1880s – bird decorations.&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Fashion History"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cumming |first1=Valerie |last2=Cunnington|first2=C.W. |last3=Cunnington |first3=P. |title=The Dictionary of Fashion History |date=2010 |publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=9781847887382|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e3evAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=valerie+cumming+%2B+mushroom+hat#v=onepage&amp;q=valerie%20cumming%20%2B%20mushroom%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Iluzie optică, Furnica, 30 oct 1908.JPG|thumb|150px|A 1908 cartoon by [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]] satirising the popularity of mushroom hats]]

In 1907, mushroom hats in both straw and felt became popular. Such was their ubiquity that [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] lambasted them in an editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'', writing: "For about six months have we endured the sight of mushroom shapes in every kind of straw trimmed with a fringed silk scarf. I suppose there was some attraction in the mushroom hat when it was first designed, and I can still see its charms when it is very small and very flexible....worn by somebody in a motor car. But this autumnal growth of felt fungi deserves nothing but condemnation".&lt;ref name="The Guardian Sharp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Evelyn|title=The Felt Hat: contrasts in the field of choice|publisher=The Guardian|date=10 October 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her words fell on deaf ears as the popularity of mushroom shapes persisted. In 1909, a full-page advertisement in ''[[The Times]]'' describing [[Selfridges|Selfridge &amp; Co]]'s millinery choices detailed a mushroom brim hat decorated with [[Ostrich#Hunting and farming|ostrich feathers]].&lt;ref name="The Times 38936"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Millinery Department at Selfridge's|issue=38936|publisher=The Times|date=17 April 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Dickins &amp; Jones]] offered a: "becoming mushroom hat...trimmed with wide Velvet Ribbon and a Large Posy of Flowers at side".&lt;ref name="The Times 38950"&gt;{{cite news|title=Millinery|issue=38950|publisher=The Times|date=4 May 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, variations on the design for younger girls included almost brimless mushroom models – similar to a [[Cloche hat|cloche]] or [[Bucket hat|bucket]] hat.&lt;ref name="The Times 40798"&gt;{{cite news|title=Children's hats|issue=40798|publisher=The Times|date=10 March 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s variations===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10749, Isabelle Rockefeller.jpg|thumb|150px|1920s mushroom hats often resembled the [[cloche hat]], but with the addition of a neat brim, such as this model worn by [[Isabel Rockefeller]]]]
The mushroom hat was fashionable throughout the 1920s, with [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]] choosing a mushroom shape with a blue lace-covered brim for the opening day of [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="The Times 42438"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ascot: Brilliant First Day|issue=42438|publisher=The Times|date=16 June 1920|ref=p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, the [[Queen Mother|Duchess of York]] chose a mushroom design trimmed with vivid orange [[osprey]] feathers tucked at either side of the brim for Ascot's Ladies' Day race meeting.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ladies' Day at Ascot|issue=43992|publisher=The Times|date=19 June 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a style that could incorporate the fashions for snug-fitting cloche-like designs or taller crowned hats. A fashion editorial of 1921 noted the value of wider-brimmed models: "Plentiful sunshine has served to emphasize the advantages of a mushroom hat, which with its adequate protection often makes a sunshade unnecessary".&lt;ref name="The Times 42777"&gt;{{cite news|title=London fashions: some holiday dresses|issue=42777|publisher=The Times|date=20 July 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, velvet for babies were described as among the newest children's millinery.&lt;ref name="The Times 42816"&gt;{{cite news|title=Autumn campaign of the shops: Fashions for nursery and ballroom|issue=42816|publisher=The Times|date=3 September 1921|ref=pg.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hat design lent itself to ornate decorations with ribbon and feather trims and veils. It could also be made in a variety of materials, from straw for summer to felt or stiffened silk for winter; in 1925, [[Harvey Nichols]] offered a selection of mushroom hats for the autumn season in the latest [[velour]] fabric.&lt;ref name="The Times 44024"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Velour Hats|issue=44024|publisher=The Times|date=27 July 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s "New Look" adaptation==
A new variety of mushroom hat (also known as the dish hat) appeared at Dior's first fashion show on 12 February 1947.&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|pages=72–3|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=hatatorium+%2B+cossack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cN_dDYIZ6O&amp;sig=wqKfSvKReaPp2IOyTYfS6S_VcLw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BseyVJbkFOeP7AaS6IGoDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hatatorium%20%2B%20cossack&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hat balanced the neat jacket with nipped-in waist and full [[Tulle|tulle-lined]] skirt, heralding a new lavishness in fabric and silhouette – what editor of American ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' [[Carmel Snow]] described at first viewing as a "new look".&lt;ref name="Vogue Italy Pizzi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pizzi|first1=Sarah|title=Italian Vogue Encyclo: Christian Dior|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/encyclo/designers/d/christian-dior|accessdate=9 January 2015|publisher=Vogue Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1956, the fashion for new shapes meant a huge variety of options, as noted by ''The Guardian'''s fashion correspondent Phyllis Heathcote: "Flower-pots, sugar-loaves, mushrooms, melons, muffins – all these have inspired Paris milliners this season". Of the mushroom look, she added: "This may be small and snugly rounded, like the little pink 'Champignon de Paris' (Chabeau makes one of these in fine straw with a goffered frill of organdy under the brim that somehow carries the model away back to the source of its inspiration)...or it is wide and gently curving at the brim like the larger and flatter field variety. On these wider shapes go flat the airier techniques that the spring hat demands. Laizes of all kinds; fine picot straws, satin straws, gros-grain, short-pile summer velvet, raffia, coarse tulle, jersey, printed taffeta, crin, organdy, chiffon, and a great many flowers".&lt;ref name="The Guardian Heathcote"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heathcote|first1=Phyllis|title=Paris hats in variety: Flower-pot, sugar-loaf and mushroom inspiration|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 January 1956|ref=pg. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for the variations that emerged include the mushroom cloche, a diminutive version of Dior's oversized dish.&lt;ref name="Hatatorium Grantland 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grantland|first1=Brenda|last2=Robak|first2=Mary|title=Hatatorium: An essential guide for hat collectors|date=2011|publisher=Brenda Grantland|location=Mill Valley, CA|isbn=9780984785902|page=78|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLEK49A-LUAC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=hatatorium+%2B+mushroom+cloche&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cN_dDYI0aT&amp;sig=K9vVcHdTZ0EITbCPRZR1igS2cbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X8iyVJLtHoPV7gaInYHIAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hatatorium%20%2B%20mushroom%20cloche&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wide-brimmed mushroom hats continued to be popular throughout the 1950s and early '60s, with other designers incorporating the wide hat profile. Adaptations included [[Pierre Balmain|Balmain's]] spring 1955 side-swept mushroom hat – a design in which the downward-curved brim of the hat dipped low on one side of the face and was tilted upwards on the other, forming an almost triangular profile.&lt;ref name="The Times 53159"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris Hat Fashions|issue=53159|publisher=The Times|date=7 February 1955|ref=p.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that mushroom hats were big news at Ascot for milliners such as [[Rose Vernier]]: "The majority of her clients wanted big tulle mushrooms, but the younger girls asked for the youthful tailored shapes of medium size – when they were not demanding outsize Gigi bretons".&lt;ref name="The Observer 140659"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mushroom look for hats at Ascot|publisher=The Observer|date=14 June 1959|ref=pg. 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, [[Cristóbal Balenciaga|Balenciaga]] included extreme saucer-shaped versions of the design in velvet, worn with a tapered [[Raglan sleeve|raglan-sleeved]] black [[Crêpe (textile)|wool crepe]] dress and lime yellow [[Twill|twill coat]] with pleated shoulder.&lt;ref name="The Times  55807."&gt;{{cite news|title=Balenciaga and Givenchy designs for autumn|issue=55807|publisher=The Times|date=16 September 1963|ref=pg. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, a more [[Bucket hat|bucket-shaped]] line had re-emerged. [[Nina Ricci (designer)|Ricci]] showed a high-crowned white mushroom hat worn with a double-breasted [[gaberdine]] suit in the spring shows.&lt;ref name="The Times  55925"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion in Paris|issue=55925|publisher=The Times|date=3 February 1964|ref=pg. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Revivals===
The mushroom shape has had a number of revivals in high fashion. During the mid 1980s, [[Frederick Fox (milliner)|Frederick Fox]] created a much-photographed mushroom-style design for [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] – worn tilted and known as the 'flying saucer'.&lt;ref name="DT 131213"&gt;{{cite news|title=Frederick Fox – milliner|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/10516984/Frederick-Fox-obituary.html|accessdate=12 January 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Stephen Jones (milliner)|Stephen Jones]] designed oversized hats in fur – including mushroom-like designs – for the fall/winter 2012 [[Marc Jacobs]]' show at [[New York Fashion Week]].&lt;ref name="Vogue April 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Easter Hats|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/favourites-of-vogue/2012/4/easter-hats/gallery/737186|accessdate=12 January 2015|work=Vogue|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9594">'''Seoul''' has been known in the past by the successive names '''[[Wiryeseong]]''' ({{Korean|hangul=위례성 |hanja={{lang|ko|慰禮城}}}}, [[Baekje]] era), '''Namgyeong''' ({{Korean|labels=no|hangul=남경 |hanja={{lang|ko|南京}}}}, [[Goryeo]] era), '''Hanseong''' ({{Korean|labels=no|hangul=한성 |hanja={{lang|ko|漢城}}}}, [[Joseon]] era) or '''Hanyang''' ({{Korean|labels=no|hangul=한양 |hanja={{lang|ko|漢陽}}}}). During the period of Japanese invasion and colonization (1910-1945), [[Seoul]] was named to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{Nihongo|'''[[Keijō]]'''|けいじょう or 京城}} or '''Gyeongseong''' ({{Korean|labels=no|hangul=경성  |hanja={{lang|ko|京城}}}}) (in Korean).  Its current name is ''Seoul'', and this name has been in use since at least 1882, at times concurrently with other names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=the Seoul Searcher |url=http://theseoulsearcher.com/wordpress/index.php/2010/07/28/seoul-the-name-of-the-city/ |title=Was Seoul Always Called Seoul? |publisher=Wordpress |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100807202603/http://theseoulsearcher.com/wordpress/index.php/2010/07/28/seoul-the-name-of-the-city/ |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology of "Seoul"==
Seoul originated from the [[Korean language|Korean]] word “seo'ul” meaning "[[capital city]]". An etymological hypothesis presumes that the origin of the native word “seo'ul” derives from the native name ''Seorabeol'' ({{Korean |hangul=서라벌 |hanja={{lang|ko|徐羅伐}}}}), which originally referred to [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Silla]], then called ''Geumseong'' ({{Korean|labels=no|hangul=금성 |hanja={{lang|ko|金城}}}}).

==Chinese name for Seoul==
Unlike most place names in Korea, "Seoul" has no corresponding [[hanja]] ([[Chinese characters]] used in the [[Korean language]]), although its name is presumed to derive from {{lang|ko|徐羅伐}} (''Seorabeol''), so Chinese-speaking countries for decades have referred to the city by its former name: {{lang|zh-hant|漢城}} ("{{lang|zh-Latn|Hànchéng}}" in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], "Hon Sing" in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] and "Hoe Zen" in [[Shanghainese]]). On a 1751 map of China and Korea prepared in France, Seoul was marked as "King-Ki-Tao, Capitale de la Coree", using an approximation of the Chinese pronunciation of [[Gyeonggi Province]] ({{lang|zh-hant|京畿道}}). The use of "King-Ki-Tao"  to refer to Seoul was repeated again on the 1851 Tallis/Rapkin map of both Japan and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/japan--corea-yedo-tokyo-king-ki-tao-seoul-koreatallisrapkin-1851-map-209620-p.asp |title=JAPAN &amp; COREA': Yedo (Tokyo) King-ki-Tao (Seoul). Korea.TALLIS/RAPKIN 1851 map |website=Antiquemapsandprints.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the transliterated name {{lang|zh-Latn|Sūwū}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=蘇烏}}), which closely resembles to the English pronunciation for Seoul, was used. 

This often caused problems in translation, as in [[Korean Language|Korean]], the terms "Seoul" and "Hanseong" are considered different. There exist many institutions and entities, most of them having no connections whatsoever, which use the two names. When the names of these institutions and entities are translated into Chinese, both "Seoul" and "Hanseong" were automatically translated to {{lang|zh-hant|漢城}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Hànchéng}}). Typical examples of such errors in translation included [[Seoul National University]] versus [[Hansung University]], which both would be translated to {{lang|zh-hant|漢城大學}}, as well as [[Seoul Science High School]] versus [[Hansung Science High School]].

The problem, along with the confusion it caused for years, was solved in January 2005, when the Seoul City Government under then mayor Lee Myung Bak publicly requested that the Chinese name of the city be changed to {{lang|zh-hant|首爾}} ({{zh|p=Shǒu'ěr}}), written as {{lang|zh-hans|首尔}} in [[Simplified Chinese character|simplified Chinese]] in mainland China. The name was chosen by a select committee out of two names, the other being {{lang|zh-hant|首午爾}} ({{zh|links=no |p=Shǒuwu'ěr}}).

The chosen name is a close [[transliteration]] of Seoul in [[Mandarin Chinese]]; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|首}}}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|shǒu}}) can also mean "first" or "capital". For a some time after the name change, Chinese-language news media have used both names interchangeably during their publications or broadcasts ({{lang|zh-hant|首爾 [漢城]}} in print,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:壹蘋果旅遊網－南韓－首爾﹝漢城﹞ |trans-title=NextMedia Travel: Seoul, South Korea)|url=http://hk.travel.nextmedia.com/index.php?fuseaction=cityguide.CityFact&amp;cityID=4307 |language=zh-hk |accessdate=30 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714202836/http://hk.travel.nextmedia.com/index.php?fuseaction=cityguide.CityFact&amp;cityID=4307|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|zh-hant|首爾, 以前的漢城}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrHBu4rfjU&lt;/ref&gt; [literally: Shouer, formerly Hancheng] in television and radio). Despite the adoption of {{lang|zh-Latn|Shǒu'ěr}} ({{lang|zh-hant|首爾}}) in Chinese media, the name {{lang|zh-Latn|Hànchéng}} ({{lang|zh-hant|漢城}}) is still widely used by some Chinese people.

For some time,{{when|date=May 2018}} [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] media refused to adopt the new name, claiming that Chinese people have the right to choose how they name other cities around the world (see [[Exonym and endonym]]). They relented by the end of the year.{{year needed|date=May 2018}}

This change was intended for Chinese speakers only, and has no effect on the Korean language name. The new name would be written and pronounced 수이 (Su-i) in Korean. Some linguists have criticized the selection of the new name, claiming that its pronunciation in Korean bears no resemblance to the native name at all, and that its intended representation of the Korean pronunciation, while effective in Mandarin, is lost in other regional dialects, such as in [[Cantonese]], where the name is pronounced "sau2 yi5", or in [[Shanghainese]], in which the new name ({{lang|zh-hant|首爾}}) is pronounced "sew2 el3". These critics have said that the names "{{lang|zh|西蔚}}" or "{{lang|zh|徐蔚}}" (the latter being the ancient name of Seoul) would have been much more effective in representing the city's Korean name.

==Gyeongseong==
{{Infobox Korean name
|title=Gyeongseong

|hanja={{lang|ko|京城}}

}}
"Gyeongseong" is a [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean word]] for "capital city" (''Gyeong'' ({{lang|ko|경; {{linktext|京}}}}) means "capital" and ''seong'' ({{lang|ko|성; {{linktext|城}}}}) means "walled city"). It was in occasional use to refer to Seoul throughout the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]], having earlier referred to the capitals of [[Goryeo]] and [[Silla]]. The term came into much wider use during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|period of Japanese rule]], because it is also the [[Korean language|Korean]] form of {{Nihongo|Keijō|京城}}, the former [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name used for Seoul during [[Korea under Japanese rule|the colonial rule]].

Seoul was called Hanseong ({{lang|ko|漢城}}) or Hanyang ({{lang|ko|漢陽}}) during the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]], but the city's main railway station, [[Seoul Station]], opened with the name "Gyeongseong Station" ({{lang|ko|京城驛}}) in 1900, which it retained until 1905. It was called Gyeongseong Station again from 1915 to 1947, when it assumed its current name.

''Gyeong'' is still used to refer to Seoul in the names of various railway lines and freeways, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">'''National Philanthropy Day''' (November 15) is an observance designated by the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]] (AFP). It is a day to celebrate [[Charity_(practice)|charitable activities]], in the form of donated financial, in-kind and [[volunteering]] support. It is celebrated with blog postings by AFP highlighting outstanding charitable activities, as well as luncheons and awards throughout the USA by different AFP chapters. 

==Background==
The association has been celebrating National Philanthropy Day since 1986, when then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed a proclamation recognizing November 15 as National Philanthropy Day in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=36729|title=Ronald Reagan: Remarks on the Observance of National Philanthropy Day|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Canadian government]] signed into law a proclamation celebrating November 15 as National Philanthropy Day annually. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npdlove.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517232753/http://npdlove.com/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df= }}, National Philanthropy Day, nplove.com, retrieved 19 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Music Seminar''' (NMS) is a Music Conference and Festival held annually each June in [[New York City]]. The New Music Seminar originally ran from 1980 to 1995 and was relaunched in 2009. NMS features over 150 [[CEO]]s and other executives, presidents, and other leaders in the emerging music business along with over 100 artist performances.

In 2012, NMS hosted the first New York Music Festival in collaboration with the [[New York City Mayor]]'s Office of Media &amp; Entertainment declaration of the city’s first [[New York Music Week]]. The festival took place in 17 venues throughout [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]].

New Music Seminar 2015 took place June 21-23 in New York City.

==History==

===1980–95===
In June 1980, [[Tom Silverman]], [[Mark Josephson]], [[Danny Heaps]], and Scott Anderson brought 220 people together at a New York City rehearsal studio to discuss challenges in the music business. The event grew in subsequent years to act as a catalyst for change in it. The New Music Seminar added music showcases and a [[festival]], initially called "New York Nights" and later, "New Music Nights." These were held in various New York City clubs. At its peak, the first series of seminars attracted more than 8,000 participants from 35 countries.

[[Haoui Montaug]] was panel director of the NMS at the time of his 1991 death.&lt;ref name="NYC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Haoui Montaug; Disco Doorman, 39|work=The New York Times|page=25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/12/obituaries/haoui-montaug-disco-doorman-39.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, the NMS inaugurated the Haoui Montag New Music Awards in his honour.&lt;ref name="Inc.1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=30 May 1992|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=13–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
In 2009, the New Music Seminar was relaunched by [[Tom Silverman]] and former New Music Seminar staffer [[Dave Lory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/news/e3ida99bf36787f149a7c5d6345eccffc00/ NMS Returns 2009 Billboard]&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York CIty====

The New Music Seminar returned as a one-day event to its hometown in the 2009 summer on July 21. It was an event that created the template for music conferences by combining business and shows.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Held at the [[New York University]] [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development|Steinhardt]]'s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the program consisted of a keynote, four educational sessions on how to combine new and old methods with technology for career success, and an artists' showcase.

====Chicago====

Following reviews from the New York City conference on July 21, the New Music Seminar went to Chicago for the first time on October 6 at the historic [[Park West (music venue)|Park West]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiphoppress.com/tag/new-music-seminar/ NMS Comes to Chicago 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6 in Chicago, the reincarnated New Music Seminar kicked off with keynote address by [[Michael Spiegelman]], head of [[Yahoo! Music]], and was followed by four panel discussions:
* Welcome to the Music Business; everything you know is wrong. Redefining Success. 1000 True Fans and the Fan Relationship Pyramid.

===2010===

====Los Angeles====

New Music Seminar came to [[L.A.]]’s [[Henry Fonda Theater]] on Feb 2 as a one-day music, networking and educational extravaganza for industry professionals seeking to learn and understand how to help artists “rise above the noise floor” in a shifting musical landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickmag.net/2010/01/the-new-music-seminar-hits-los-angeles-february-2nd-2010/ Kickmag New Music Seminar PR 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 4th Movement: The Live Show and Tour; How to Cut through the Glut and reach the Magic 300 Ticket Mark

====New York City====

New Music Seminar announced that it would no longer remain a one-day conference and expand into a multi-day event from July 19 to 21 in New York City. The two-day, three-night conference included a symphony of five "movements" (focused discussions) over the course of two days, 8 TED-style presentations from key industry leaders, 22 mentoring sessions, nightly musical performances and ongoing networking opportunities. This seminar address both the artists’ dilemma of breaking out from the ever-growing glut of music releases and the development of a new business model for a sustainable music business.

NMS featured speakers included: Eric Garland (Big Champagne), Joe Kennedy ([[Pandora Music|Pandora]]), Mike Doernberg ([[Reverbnation]]), Courtney Holt ([[Myspace|Myspace Music]]), David Goodman ([[CBS Interactive]]), [[Little Steven]] ([[Underground Garage]] and the [[E Street Band]]), [[Ariel Hyatt]] (Ariel PR), Corey Denis (Not Shocking), Linda Lorence ([[SESAC]]), Jay Frank (CMT), Gwen Lipsky (Sound Thinking), Tom Jackson (onstagesuccess.com), [[Martin Atkins]] (Tour: Smart), John Simson (Soundexchange), Corrie Christopher (APA), Chris Vinson ([[Bandzoogle]]), and Tony Van Veen (Discmakers). The Artist Movement “conducted” by [[Margaret Cho]] featured star artists discussing how they got their break and tips on how to apply what worked for them.

===2011–13===
After a sold-out event in New York City on July 19–21, 2010, New Music Seminar returned to Los Angeles one day after the Grammys, with its 3-day event from February 14 through 16th, 2011, at the Sheraton Universal Hotel. The kickoff red carpet event, The After Grammy Jammy (the NMS Opening Night Party), was held at The Music Box in Hollywood on Monday night, February 14 with the “Artist on the Verge Finals”, which selects one artist who will walk away with over $50K in promotion and marketing, Tuesday, February 15 at The Roxy. The two-day, three-night conference included a symphony of five "movements" (focused discussions) over the course of two days, 12–18 minute Intensives (presentations) from key industry leaders, 22 mentoring sessions, daily and nightly musical performances, Summit Meetings and workshops on Rock, Hip Hop, Producers and Songwriting along with ongoing networking opportunities throughout.

On June 17–19, 2012, the New Music Seminar explored the exciting future of the music business with the [[SoundExchange]] Digital Broadcasting Summit and the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] Creative Conclave; which took place at Webster Hall in New York City. The creative community and their label partners met the digital broadcasters, music bloggers, music technologists and all of the new music exposure and monetization players. Clear Channel CEO, Bob Pittman and [[Sean Parker]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berkleegroove.com/2012/07/17/the-best-of-the-best-top-insight-from-the-2012-new-music-seminar/&lt;/ref&gt; were the keynote speakers and shared their vision for the future. Many sectors of the evolving new music business convened to discuss their perspectives for the exciting new future for the music business.

In 2013, the New Music Seminar, along with the [[SoundExchange]] Digital Broadcasting Summit, moved to the iconic [[New Yorker Hotel]] and held its opening night party at [[Webster Hall]]. 2013 marked a growth in international relationships spearheaded by the newly appointed General Manager, Peter Schwinge. Music showcases from [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Sweden]] – an International Movement conducted by [[MIDEM]], and an uptick in international sponsors and delegates enhanced the discussion throughout the global music community.&lt;br /&gt;
A new addition, to the benefit of artists, was the Music Xray A&amp;R Listening and Critique room where artists had the opportunity to have their music listened to, and critiqued by reps from [[Atlantic Records]], [[Republic Records]], [[RCA Records]], [[Virgin Records]], Label Recruit, LOCAL VIBES, [[Glassnote Records]], [[Razor &amp; Tie]], [[Robbins Entertainment]], [[Island Def Jam]], and [[Columbia Records]].

There was a 2015 event.&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6436548/new-music-seminar-set-for-june-in-nyc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar events==

'''Old Home Week''' or '''Old Home Day''' is a practice that originated in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]] similar to a harvest holiday or festival.  In its beginning in the 19th–20th century it involved a municipal effort to invite former residents of a village, town, or city—usually individuals who grew up in the municipality as children and moved elsewhere in adulthood—to visit the "Old Home", the parental household and home town. Some municipalities celebrate the holiday annually, while others celebrate it every few years.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the practice has spread to other parts of [[North America]] and has become a broader celebration with an emphasis on local culture and history. From the [[Wilmington, Vermont]] town web site:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Town of Wilmington | authorlink = Wilmington, Vermont | title = Old Home Week 2010 | url = http://www.wilmingtonvermont.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B7F6E5A89-A189-4E95-8300-50B76E0DC660%7D | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Old Home Week is a town event held every 10 years. It is best described as a town reunion, a celebration of Wilmington's citizens, past, present and future, and a honoring of its history. Events traditionally include a parade, a town dinner, class and family reunions and tours of local points of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…Old Home Week is a decennial celebration and gathering of friends and acquaintances, all sharing the common experience of having resided and/or attended school, in Wilmington. It is also a celebration for all those who now live in and love their town.  Nobody is an outsider during Old Home Week.|40px|40px}}

A '''one-syllable article''' ({{zh|c=同音文章|p=Tóngyīn wénzhāng}}) is a type of [[constrained writing]] found in [[Chinese literature]]. It takes advantage of the large number of [[Chinese language#Homophones|homophones in the Chinese language]], particularly when writing in [[Classical Chinese]] due to historic sound changes. While the [[Chinese character|characters]] used in a one-syllable article have many different meanings, they are all pronounced as the same syllable, although not with the same [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Therefore, a one-syllable article is comprehensible in writing but becomes an incomprehensible [[tongue twister]] when read aloud, especially in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation. In other regional pronunciations not all syllables may sound alike.

==Notable examples==
&lt;!--Someone who is more competent in Classical Chinese should check these English translations and fix any issues that are present, as they might not be as good as they should be.--&gt;
&lt;!--we should clarify the part about reading them aloud and reading. Can one comprehend a spoken form?--&gt;

'''Petrine Archer-Straw''' (26 December 1956 – 5 December 2012) was a British artist and influential [[art historian]] and [[curator]] who specialised in the art of the [[Caribbean#Demographics|Caribbean people]].&lt;ref name=jamaicaobserver&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Dr-Petrine-Archer-Straw--a-gentle-soul-with-a-steely-grip-on-reality_13260628 "A tribute to Petrine Archer-Straw"], ''Jamaica Observer'', 23 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Eddie Chambers (writer and artist)|Eddie Chambers]]: "In her work as an artist, academic, art historian, writer and curator, Archer-Straw consistently challenged the prevailing orthodoxies that treat Caribbean artists and cultural practice in geographical, racial and artistic isolation. In essence, her position was that we cannot fully understand or appreciate the practice of Caribbean artists without due consideration of broader factors such as migration, history, identity and, above all diaspora – the scattering of many black people beyond their ancestral homeland of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Chambers, [http://www.eddiechambers.com/texts/petrine-archer-straw-memoriam-1956-2012/ "Petrine Archer-Straw, In Memoriam, (1956–2012)"]. Extracted from obituary in ''Nka Journal of Contemporary African Art'', 32, Spring 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Petrine Archer-Straw was born in [[Birmingham]], England, to [[Jamaica]]n parents,&lt;ref name=jamaicaobserver/&gt; and raised during the 1960s in an atmosphere of "... [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]], and activism".&lt;ref name=BTB35&gt;''Back to Black'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father arrived England in 1955 as a linotype press operator and subsequently sent for his family to join him.&lt;ref name=BTB35 /&gt; Archer-Straw notes that her home was a hub for the community.&lt;ref name=BTB36&gt;''Back to Black'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; These were extremely formative experiences for the young Archer-Straw who also recalls how she "would do the rounds [on Sunday] with my father, .... joining in house to house campaigning and, in the summer, attending the numerous rallies and protest marches.&lt;ref name=BTB36 /&gt; However, this community work eventually drew the ire of the right-wing [[British National Front]] and the family subsequently moved to [[Jamaica]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref name=jamaicaobserver/&gt; where Dr. Archer-Straw finished high school and started university.&lt;ref name=BTB36 /&gt;

== Education ==
Petrine Archer-Straw earned a Theology, History, Sociology B.A. at the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) B.A. (1975–78) and later earned a Cultural History M.Phil (1983–87) at the same institution. She was also trained as an artist at the [[Jamaican School of Art]] (Diploma, Painting, 1979–82). She also received degrees from the [[Courtauld Institute]] at the [[University of London]], where she earned an M.A. in Art History and PhD (Art History Modern, [[Negrophilia]], 1994–95).&lt;ref&gt;[http://petrinearcher.com/about from Archer-Straw’s official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Petrine Archer-Straw published numerous books and catalogues, including ''Eugene Palmer'' (October 1993, in collaboration with Jane Norrie), ''New World Imagery'' (October 1995), ''Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s'' (November 2000),&lt;ref name=rogin&gt;Michael Rogin, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n04/michael-rogin/mon-pays "Mon Pays"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 23, No. 4, 22 February 2001, pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fifty Years, Fifty Artists'' (May 2001), and ''Back to Black: Art, Cinema and the Racial Imaginary'' (June 2005, in collaboration with [[David A.

== ''Negrophilia'' ==
Archer-Straw's book ''Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s'' focused on the fashion for African artefacts, themes and emblems in [[Paris]] of the 1920s, including figures such as [[Josephine Baker]].&lt;ref name=rogin/&gt; The book inspired a jazz album by [[Mike Ladd]], ''Negrophilia: The Album'' (2005), on [[Thirsty Ear Recordings|Thirsty Ear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dave Segal, [http://jazztimes.com/articles/15314-negrophilia-the-album-mike-ladd "Mike Ladd: Negrophilia: The Album" (review)], ''Jazz Times'', March 2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitchfork&gt;Joe Tangari, [http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4624-negrophilia/ "Mike Ladd: Negrophilia" (review)], Pitchfork, 30 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The album's lyrics combine references to the milieu that Archer-Straw defines with references to the civil rights struggle in the US and more recent pop music; [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] said: "its best moments are stellar and exhilarating" and scored it 7.2/10.&lt;ref name=pitchfork/&gt;

== Curator ==
In addition to her academic work, Petrine Archer-Straw was a consultant for the development of the [[National Art Gallery of the Bahamas]],&lt;ref&gt;Erica Wells, [http://www.thenassauguardian.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35895:art-historian-who-worked-closely-with-nagb-dies&amp;catid=38:arts-a-culture&amp;Itemid=59 "Art historian who worked closely with NAGB dies"], ''The Nassau Guardian'', 8 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and also curated numerous exhibits mainly related to [[Caribbean art]] and [[Jamaican art]], including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps.mobilemedia.com.jm/files/ps/TenureCV06.pdf |title=Petrine Archer-Straw's Curriculum Vitae |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815120138/http://ps.mobilemedia.com.jm/files/ps/TenureCV06.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10707">'''Progymnasmata''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] προγυμνάσματα "fore-exercises"; [[Latin]] ''praeexercitamina'') are a series of preliminary [[rhetorical]] exercises that began in [[ancient Greece]] and distended during the [[Roman Empire]]. These exercises were implemented by students of [[rhetoric]], who began their schooling between ages twelve and fifteen. The purpose of these exercises was to prepare students for writing [[declamations]] after they had completed their education with the [[Linguist|grammarians]].
There are only four surviving handbooks of progymnasmata, attributed to [[Aelius Theon]], [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]], [[Aphthonius of Antioch]], and Nicolaus the [[Sophism|Sophist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A. A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Composition was not a primary subject taught in schools until the fifth century. In fact, the term “progymnasmata” first appeared in Chapter 28 of [[Rhetoric to Alexander]], most likely written by [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] in the late fourth century. This work is preserved alongside those of [[Aristotle]], yet he never mentions the use of preliminary exercises. But Aristotle does touch on the rhetorical forms, which became an aspect within the nature of progymnasmata. The use of preliminary rhetorical exercises is discussed briefly in some Greek and Roman dialogues, but all handbooks from that time remain lost today.
There are only four known surviving handbooks of progymnasmata. The earliest one is that of Theon, written some time during the first century A.D. In his introduction, Theon addresses teachers rather than students and criticizes students who skip out on these preliminary exercises.
The second handbook is attributed to one of the most influential rhetoricians of the second century, Hemogenes of Tarsus. But there is no preface to his work and the exercises are brief; therefore, many doubt its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A., p.203 A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; But the third handbook is attributed to Aphthonius of Antioch, student of the great sophist Libanius during the second half of the fourth century. This is the most widely used and referenced handbook that became the standard on the practice of progymnasmata. His treatises were combined with rhetorical treatises of Hermogenes on stasis theory and style to create the “Hermogenic Corpus.”
The final handbook is attributed to Nicolaus of Myra, who taught rhetoric in [[Constantinople]] during the late fifth century.

==Progymnasmata of Aphthonius==

Although the exercises expressed in each known handbook are very similar, there are several minor variations between them. But because the work of Aphthonius is the one most widely recognized and practiced, these variations are often unrecognized. All students were asked to write out each assignment, memorize it, and then perform a class oration. The progymnasmata were taught in order, increasing in difficulty as the course advances. The courses were organized to begin with story-telling and end with making an argument. There was a focus on literature as a supplement to the course, paying close attention to models of rhetoric and literature. The progymnasmata of Aphthonius was first translated to Latin in the fifteenth century by [[Rudolphus Agricola]].

===Fable (mythos)===

[[Aesop's fables]] were popular at the time rhetoric became a common topic of study. There are three forms of [[fable]]: the rational form (where characters are men and women), the ethical form (where animals are protagonists), and a third form involving both. What all three have in common is they each have a [[moral]], stated before the story begins or after it has concluded. In Aphthonius's handbook, the first exercise was to create a fable that followed the three forms.

===Narrative (diēgēma)===

This elementary assignment was to simply write a [[narrative]] (not to be confused with fable). It is assumed that this training is a result of Aristotle's theory of categories and introduces students to the four values of narrative, which is perspicuity, incisiveness, persuasiveness, and purity of language. The content of the narrative exercise in the progymnasmata is either political, historical, or based on fiction. Just as diegesis indicates the narrative plot of a film, the so-called narrative of a speech or oration moves the content forth.

===Anecdote (chreia)===

Students were asked to take an action or saying of a famous person and elaborate on it. They were to develop the meanings of these actions or quotes with the framing under the headings of praise, paraphrase, cause, example of meaning, compare and contrast, testimonies, and an epilogue; [[anecdote]] is something that is frequently used in the Bible.

===Maxim (gnōmē)===

[[Maxim (saying)|Maxim]] or [[proverbs]] were first described by Aristotle, and in Aphthonius's book are divided into, protheptic, apotreptic, declarative, simple, and compound. A moral generalization was given to students about a writer, and they were asked to create something similar to an anecdote about the writer.

===Refutation (anaskeuē)===

This exercise required the student to logically reason against something drawn from myths, narratives, or fables. The student's argument was that something was either impossible, illogical, unsuitable, and inexpedient.

===Confirmation (kataskeuē)===

The confirmation exercise is the opposite of refutation. The student was asked to reason in favor of something drawn from legends and literature.

===Commonplace (koinos topos)===

Working out the commonplace involved attacking vice by envisioning criticism of stereotypes rather than individuals. Students do this by using contradiction, comparison, and maxim attacking the motivation of the demographic described.

===Encomium (enkōmion)===

Students used [[encomium]] to praise persons, things, times, places, animals, and growing things. Each praise could be engendered from the headings upbringing, deeds, skills, and sometimes was in the form of a comparison with another person, an epilogue, or a prayer.

===Invective (psogos)===

[[Invective]] opposes commonplace. It attacks a specific, named individual, usually a political or cultural figure.

===Comparison (synkrisis)===

The [[comparison (grammar)|comparison]] exercise acts as a double encomium or a combination of an encomium of one person or thing and the invective against another.

===Personification (ēthopoeia)===

Students used [[personification]] or [[ethopoeia]] by forming a speech ascribed to the ghost of a known person or of an imaginary or mythological character from past, present, or future times. This exercise was intended to request students to perform it with clarity, conciseness, and floridity.

===Description (ekphrasis)===

When asked to use [[ekphrasis]] to describe a person, place, thing, or time, students were obliged to produce a description that was complete. Included was detailed information about a person from head-to-toe, an action from start to finish, etc. This form is seen in many classical literature and historical writings.

===Argument (thesis)===

Because this exercise is an introduction to argument in the philosophical schools, the use of [[thesis]] was not performed until first completing all previous exercises. Students had to come up with a thesis argument of their own nature; these questions were often ones difficult to answer.

===Introduction to law (nomou eisphora)===

Aphtonius calls this final exercise a gymnasma rather than progymnsasmata. This exercise is in the form of advocacy of a proposed law or opposition of it. The argument is first stated, a counterargument follows, and then the headings are discussed

==Progymnasmata for schools==
In the past few years there has been considerable effort expended to see if the Progymnasmata could be adapted for use in elementary, middle and high school education. One of the leaders in this effort is James Selby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selby|first1=James|title=James Selby|url=http://whitefieldacademy.org/teams/james-selby/|website=Whitefield Academy|publisher=Whitefield Academy|accessdate=17 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023215734/http://whitefieldacademy.org/teams/james-selby/|archivedate=23 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the Classical Composition series, who has reduced the composition curriculum used by Quintilian and Cicero, to a level that can be effectively used by fourth through twelfth grade students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Composition|url=http://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/writing/classical-composition|website=Memoria Press|publisher=Memoria Press|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorica and Progymnasmata is taught as a mandatory class in Sremski Karlovci, Serbia at [[Gymnasium of Karlovci]] high school, focusing on preparing students at early age for public speaking, as well as teaching classical rhetorics.

The progymnasmata is also taught at Highlands Latin School in Louisville, KY, as well as at Highlands Latin Cottage Schools (homeschooling support tutorials) around the United States.

'''Shallow reading''' refers to social practices in which people acquire information or entertainment quickly from texts, images or other meaningful forms, individual or combination, by using various modern media. Shallow reading as a representational form of [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] [[Media culture|mass culture]] reflects a transition of expense principle tendency from [[print culture]] towards [[visual culture]].

== Background ==
With the continuous update of advanced media technology and popularization of [[Internet]], people are stepping into mobile Internet era shifting. In this process, an obvious change is that traditional reading mode is gradually shifting to shallow reading. The prevalence of shallow reading has attracted attention of media, publishing and library fields.

== Features ==
'''1. Superficial'''

In order to enable people obtain useful information during the process of quick browsing, the target materials of shallow reading are usually very clear and easy to understand as well as with clear-cut topics.

'''2. Visual'''

Objectives of shallow reading are often short texts with illustrations and pictures even images and/or video without text captions.

'''3. Recreational'''

For deep readers, traditional reading is a process of thinking training and a cultivation of aesthetic culture while Shallow reading gets rid of the seriousness of deep reading and mainly aim at facilitating readers acquire information and entertainment in a relaxing and interactive atmosphere.

'''Shukko''' (出向, from 出るmeaning to leave and 向う meaning to go towards) is a form of job transfer occurring in [[Japanese companies]]. A “Shukko” most often stands for a transfer of an employee from a main branch of a company to a branch office of the same company or an associated company. Rarely, it might be towards a non-affiliated company.&lt;ref&gt;Futagami , S., Waragai, T., &amp; Westphal, T.　(June 1998).　[http://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/1998/iv98-5.pdf Shukko in Japanese Companies and Its Economic and Managerial Effects], WZB SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER BERLIN, FS IV 98 - 5 , 1-4 page. Retrieved July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characteristic of the so-called “Japanese style of business administration” is [[lifetime employment]] (or 終身雇用). Shukko has a key role in the support and sustainment of this Japanese style of long term employment.

In Japan, Shukko has a negative reputation, because it is often used as a way to reduce personnel expenses. However Shukko has positive aspects – cases in which is used as a way to give employees the chance to gather corporate experience and broaden their careers.&lt;ref&gt;Futagami et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Shukko ==

Each [[company]] makes their own conditions for Shukko.

=== Demotion ===

This type is the main reason for the negative reputation of Shukko, because of its effect on personnel expenses. The [[Nenko System]] (seniority-based compensation) is the opposite of the merit-based wage system. Because pay is based solely on seniority, employees' salaries may not correspond with their job performance or ability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">A '''supergroup''' is a [[Musical ensemble|music group]] whose members have successful solo careers or are part of other groups or well known in other musical professions. Usually used in the context of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Popular music|pop music]], the term has been applied to other musical genres such as [[opera]] ([[The Three Tenors]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Americana annual: an encyclopedia of current events|editor=Alexander Hopkins McDannald|publisher=Americana corporation|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supergroups are sometimes formed as [[side project]]s and thus not intended to be permanent, while other times can become the primary project of the members' careers. It became popular in late 1960s [[rock music]] for members of already successful groups to record albums together, after which they normally split up.&lt;ref name="Landscape"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rock and Roll and the American Landscape|first=Stuart|last=Rosenberg|date=2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4401-6458-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charity supergroup]]s, where prominent musicians perform or record together in support of a particular cause, have been common since the 1980s.

==History==
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Jann Wenner]] credited [[Cream (band)|Cream]], which came together in 1966, as the first supergroup.&lt;ref name="pc53"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19835/m1/ |title=Show 53 - String Man. : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |year=1969 |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Clapton]] formerly of [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers]], along with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Ginger Baker]], ex of [[the Graham Bond Organization]], formed the band in 1966, recorded four albums, and split up in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/cream/biography  "Cream Bio," Rolling Stone.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Strange Brew," John McDermott, Guitar World Magazine, November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker went on to form [[Blind Faith]], another blues rock supergroup which recruited former [[The Spencer Davis Group|Spencer Davis Group]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] singer [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Family (band)|Family]] bassist [[Ric Grech]]. The group recorded [[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|one studio album]] before dissipating less than a year after formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cream: The World's First Supergroup|first=Dave|last=Thompson|date=2005|publisher=Virgin|isbn=1-85227-286-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may have come from the 1968 album ''[[Super Session]]'' with [[Al Kooper]], [[Mike Bloomfield]], and [[Stephen Stills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Michael Bloomfield: The Rise and Fall of an American Guitar Hero|last=Ward|first=Ed|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2016|isbn=9781613733318|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=43WADAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT150&amp;ots=BVA_eeKzaj&amp;dq=supergroup%20%22super%20session%22&amp;pg=PT150#v=onepage&amp;q=supergroup%20%22super%20session%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]] (later Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; [[Neil Young|Young]]) in 1969 is another early example, given the success of their prior bands ([[The Byrds]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[The Hollies]] respectively).

==Criticism==
In 1974, a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article titled "Return of a Supergroup" quipped that the supergroup was a "potent but short-lived rock phenomenon" which was an "amalgam formed by the talented malcontents of other bands." The article acknowledged that groups such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Blind Faith]] "played enormous arenas and made megabucks, and sometimes megamusic", with the performances "fueled by dueling [[egos]]." However, while this "musical infighting built up the excitement&amp;nbsp;... it also made breakups inevitable."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879436,00.html | work=Time | title=Music: Return of a Supergroup | date=1974-08-05 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swamp Thing''' is a [[fictional character]] and hero in comic books published by American company  [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dccomics.com/characters/swamp-thing |title=DC Comics: Swamp Thing |access-date=September 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916225344/http://www.dccomics.com/characters/swamp-thing |archive-date=September 16, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A humanoid/[[plant]] [[elemental]] creature, created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Bernie Wrightson]], the Swamp Thing has had several humanoid or monster incarnations in various different storylines. The character [[first appeared]] in ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'' #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 146 |quote = 'Swamp Thing' was the name of Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson's turn-of-the-century tale, and its popularity with readers led a modernized version of the character into its own series a year later.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character then returned in a solo series, set in the contemporary world and in the general DC continuity.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 153: "Following his debut in ''House of Secrets'' #92 in 1971, the Swamp Thing grew into his own series, albeit with a reimagining of his origins by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson."&lt;/ref&gt; The character is a [[swamp monster]] that resembles an anthropomorphic mound of [[vegetable]] matter, and fights to protect his [[swamp]] home, the environment in general, and humanity from various supernatural or terrorist threats.

The character found perhaps its greatest popularity during the 1970s and early 1990s. Outside of an extensive comic book history, the Swamp Thing has inspired two [[Swamp Thing (film)|theatrical films]], a live-action [[Swamp Thing (TV series)|television series]], and a five-part [[Swamp Thing (1991 TV series)|animated series]], among other media. [[IGN]] ranked him 28th in the "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" list. He appeared in his first live adaptation in the 1982 [[Swamp Thing (film)|film]]. [[Dick Durock]] portrayed Swamp Thing while [[Ray Wise]] played Alec Holland. Durock reprised the role in the sequel film ''[[The Return of Swamp Thing]]'' along with playing Holland. Durock reprised the role again in the 1990 [[Swamp Thing (1990 TV series)|television series]]. The new Swamp Thing will be played by [[Derek Mears]] with [[Andy Bean (actor)|Andy Bean]] playing his human form Alec Holland in the television series for the new [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC streaming service]].

==Concept and creation==
Len Wein came up with the idea for the character while riding a subway in [[Queens]]. He later recalled, "I didn't have a title for it, so I kept referring to it as 'that swamp thing I'm working on.' And that's how it got its name!"&lt;ref name=WeinDaddy/&gt; Bernie Wrightson designed the character's visual image, using a rough sketch by Wein as a guideline.&lt;ref name=WeinDaddy/&gt;

==Publication history==
{{Main|Swamp Thing (comic book)}}

=== Volume 1 ===
Len Wein was the writer for the first 13 issues, before [[David Michelinie]] and Gerry Conway finished up the series. Burgeoning horror artist [[Bernie Wrightson]] drew the first 10 issues of the series while [[Nestor Redondo]] drew a further 13 issues, the last issue being drawn by [[Fred Carrillo]]. The original creative team worked closely together; Wrightson recalled that during story conferences, Wein would walk around the office acting out all the parts.&lt;ref name=WeinDaddy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=Richard |last2= |first2= |date=November 2004 |title=Who's Your Daddy?? |journal=Wizard |volume= |issue=#140 |pages=68–74 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]] |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swamp Thing fought against evil as he sought the men who murdered his wife and caused his monstrous transformation, as well as searching for a means to transform back to human form.

The Swamp Thing has since fought many villains. Though they only met twice during the first series, the mad Dr. [[Anton Arcane]] (with his obsession with gaining immortality) became the Swamp Thing's nemesis, even as the Swamp Thing developed a close bond with Arcane's niece [[Abby Holland (comics)|Abigail Arcane]]. Arcane was aided by his nightmarish army of [[Un-Men]] and the [[Patchwork Man]], alias Arcane's brother Gregori Arcane, who after a [[land mine]] explosion was rebuilt as a [[Frankenstein's Monster]]-type creature by his brother. Also involved in the conflict was the Swamp Thing's close friend-turned-enemy [[Matthew (DC Comics)|Matthew Cable]], a federal agent who mistakenly believed the Swamp Thing to be responsible for the deaths of Alec and Linda Holland.

As sales figures plummeted towards the end of the series, the writers attempted to revive interest by introducing fantastical creatures, aliens, and even Alec Holland's brother, Edward (a plot point ignored by later writers), into the picture.

The last two issues saw the Swamp Thing transformed back into a human being and having to fight one last menace as an ordinary human. The series was cancelled and a blurb for an upcoming team-up with [[Hawkman]] led nowhere.

=== Volume 2 ===
[[File:Swampthingmoore21.jpg|thumb|left|''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #21 (Feb. 1984). Cover art by [[Tom Yeates]].]]
In 1982, DC Comics revived the ''Swamp Thing'' series,&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 197: "Swamp Thing returned to the pages of a new ongoing series, written by Martin Pasko and drawn by artist Tom Yeates."&lt;/ref&gt; attempting to capitalize on the summer [[1982 in film|1982]] release of the [[Wes Craven]] [[Swamp Thing (film)|film of the same name]]. A revival had been planned for [[1978 in comics|1978]], but was a victim of the [[DC Implosion]]. The new series, called ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'', featured an adaptation of the Craven movie in its first annual. Now written by [[Martin Pasko]], the book loosely picked up after the Swamp Thing's appearance in ''Challengers of the Unknown'', with the character wandering around the swamps of Louisiana seen as an urban legend and feared by locals. Pasko's main arc depicted the Swamp Thing roaming the globe, trying to stop a young girl (and possible [[Anti-Christ]]) named Karen Clancy from destroying the world.

When Pasko had to give up work on the title due to increasing television commitments, editor Len Wein assigned the title to British writer [[Alan Moore]]. When Karen Berger took over as editor, she gave Moore free rein to revamp the title and the character as he saw fit. Moore reconfigured the Swamp Thing's origin to make him a true monster as opposed to a human transformed into a monster. In his first issue, he swept aside most of the supporting cast Pasko had introduced in his year-and-a-half run as writer and brought the Sunderland Corporation to the forefront, as they hunted the Swamp Thing and "killed" him in a hail of bullets. The subsequent investigation revealed that the Swamp Thing was not Alec Holland transformed into a plant, but actually a wholly plant-based entity created upon the death of Alec Holland, having somehow absorbed Holland's memory and personality into himself. He is described as "a plant that thought it was Alec Holland, a plant that was trying its level best to ''be'' Alec Holland." This is explained as a result of the plant matter of the swamp absorbing Holland's serum, with the Swamp Thing's appearance being the plants' attempt to duplicate Holland's human form. This revelation resulted in the Swamp Thing suffering a temporary mental breakdown and identity crisis, but he eventually reasserted himself in time to stop the latest scheme of the [[Floronic Man]].

Issue #32 was a strange twist of comedy and tragedy, as the Swamp Thing encounters [[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]], [[Walt Kelly]]'s character.

Moore would later reveal, in an attempt to connect the original one-off Swamp Thing story from ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'' to the main ''Swamp Thing'' canon, that there had been dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Swamp Things since the dawn of humanity, and that all versions of the creature were designated defenders of the [[Parliament of Trees]], an elemental community which rules a dimension known as "the Green" that connects all plant life on Earth. Moore's ''Swamp Thing'' broadened the scope of the series to include ecological and spiritual concerns while retaining its horror-fantasy roots. In issue #37, Moore formally introduced the character of [[John Constantine]] as a magician/con artist who would lead the Swamp Thing on the "American Gothic" storyline. Alan Moore also introduced the concept of the DC characters Cain and Abel being the Biblical Cain and Abel caught in an endless cycle of murder and resurrection.

''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' was the first mainstream comic book series to completely abandon the [[Comics Code Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comics Code Rejects ''Saga of Swamp Thing'' Story; ''Swamp Thing'' Rejects Code", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #93 (September 1984), pp. 12/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

With issue #65, regular penciler [[Rick Veitch]] took over from Moore and began scripting the series, continuing the story in a roughly similar vein for 24 more issues. Veitch's term ended in 1989 in a widely publicized creative dispute, when DC refused to publish issue #88 because of the use of [[Jesus Christ]] as a character despite having previously approved the script in which the Swamp Thing is a cupbearer who offers Jesus water when he calls for it from the cross.&lt;ref&gt;"''Swamp Thing'' Cancellation Begets Protest, Media Attention," ''The Comics Journal'' #130 (July 1989), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rick Veitch Quits ''Swamp Thing''," ''The Comics Journal'' #129 (May 1989), pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was handed to Doug Wheeler, who made the cup that the [[Shining Knight]] believed to be the [[Holy Grail]] to be a cup used in a religious ceremony by a [[Neanderthal]] tribe that was about to be wiped out by [[Cro-Magnon]]s, in the published version of issue #88. Beginning in issue #90, Wheeler reintroduced the Matango that Stephen Bissette had introduced in ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #4.

After a period of high creative turnover,&lt;ref&gt;"Swamp Thing Team Leaves," ''The Comics Journal'' #139 (December 1990), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991 DC sought to revive interest in ''Swamp Thing'' by bringing horror writer [[Nancy A. Collins]] on board to write the series. Starting with ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #6, Collins moved on to write ''Swamp Thing'' #110–138, dramatically overhauling the series by restoring the pre-Alan Moore tone and incorporating a new set of supporting cast members into the book.&lt;ref&gt;"Nancy Collins: ''Swamp Thing''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s New Scripter Speaks," ''David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview'', #102 (1991), pp. 4–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins resurrected [[Anton Arcane]], along with the Sunderland Corporation, as foils for the Swamp Thing. Her stories tended to be ecologically based and at one point featured giant killer flowers.

With issue #140 (March 1994), the title was handed over to [[Grant Morrison]] for a four-issue arc, co-written by the then-unknown [[Mark Millar]]. As Collins had destroyed the status quo of the series, Morrison sought to shake the book up with a four-part storyline which had the Swamp Thing plunged into a nightmarish dreamworld scenario where he was split into two separate beings: Alec Holland and the Swamp Thing, which was now a mindless being of pure destruction. Millar then took over from Morrison with issue #144, and launched what was initially conceived as an ambitious 25-part storyline where the Swamp Thing would be forced to go upon a series of trials against rival elemental forces. Millar brought the series to a close with issue #171 in a finale where the Swamp Thing becomes the master of all elemental forces, including the planet.

=== Volume 3 ===
Written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and drawn by Roger Petersen and [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]] in 2001, the third ''Swamp Thing'' series focused on the daughter of the Swamp Thing, [[Tefé Holland]]. Even though she was chronologically 11-12, the series had Tefé aged into the body of an 18-year-old with a [[mindwipe]] orchestrated by the Swamp Thing, Constantine and Abby in order to try to control her darker impulses, brought about by her exposure to the Parliament of Trees. Due to the circumstances under which she was conceived, while the Swamp Thing, possessing [[John Constantine]], was not aware he was given a blood transfusion by a demon, she held power over both plants and flesh.

Believing herself to be a normal human girl named Mary who had miraculously recovered from cancer three years prior, she rediscovers her powers and identity when she finds her boyfriend and best friend betraying her on prom night. In a moment of anger, her powers manifest and she kills them both. Tefé then fakes her own death and embarks on a series of misadventures that take her across the country, and ultimately to Africa, in search of a mythical "Tree of Knowledge".

During this series, it seems that the Swamp Thing and Abigail have reunited as lovers and are living in their old home in the Louisiana swamps outside Houma. The home in which they live more closely resembles the one that the Swamp Thing constructs for Abigail during the Moore run than the home in which they dwell during the Collins run. In a confrontation with Tefé, the Swamp Thing explains that he has cut himself off from the Green and there seems to be no trace of the god-like powers he acquired from the Parliaments of Air, Waves, Stone or Flames during the Millar run. Also, Vaughan's Swamp Thing does not seem to have been divorced from the humanity of his Alec Holland self. The disconnection between these two entities, however, emerges as a plot point in Volume 4.

=== Volume 4 ===
A fourth series began in 2004, with writers [[Andy Diggle]] (#1–6), [[Will Pfeifer]] (#7–8) and [[Joshua Dysart]] (#9–29). In this latest series, the Swamp Thing is reverted to his plant-based Earth Elemental status after the first storyline, and he attempts to live an "eventless" life in the Louisiana swamps. Tefé, likewise, is rendered powerless and mortal. Issue #29, intended to be the final issue of the fourth volume, was cancelled due to low sales numbers.

===Return to the DC Universe===

====''Brightest Day''====
{{See also|Vertigo (DC Comics)#Relationship to DC Universe}}
The conclusion of the series "[[Brightest Day]]" revealed that the Swamp Thing had become corrupted by the personality of the villain [[Nekron]] in the wake of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The Swamp Thing now believed himself to be Nekron, similar to how he had once believed himself to be Alec Holland. The Swamp Thing went on a rampage in Star City, ultimately seeking to destroy all life on Earth. The Entity within the [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]] used several heroes, including [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Hawkgirl]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Aquaman]] and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] to slow the rampage and to construct a new Swamp Thing based on the body of Alec Holland. Instead of merely thinking it was Holland, this version of the Swamp Thing would actually be him. The new Swamp Thing defeated and killed the corrupted and original Swamp Thing. The Swamp Thing then restored life to natural areas around the world and declared that those who hurt "the Green" would face his wrath. He also restored Aquaman, Firestorm, Hawkman, and the Martian Manhunter to normal. The book ended with the Swamp Thing killing several businessmen who engaged in deliberate, illegal polluting activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Search for the Swamp Thing''====
This three–issue miniseries follows immediately after the events of "Brightest Day", and follows the actions of [[John Constantine]] as he tries to work out what has changed with the Swamp Thing, and track him down, with the assistance of [[Zatanna]], the [[Batman]], and [[Superman]].

===Volume 5===
DC Comics relaunched ''Swamp Thing'' with issue #1 in September 2011 as part of [[The New 52]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/07/dc-comics-dark-swamp-thing-animal-man DC Comics Announces "Justice League Dark", "Swamp Thing", "Animal Man" and More] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610110410/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/07/dc-comics-dark-swamp-thing-animal-man |date=June 10, 2011 }}, ''Comics Alliance'', June 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of his death in which he was burned alive, he became the Swamp Thing of that era. For years, he walked the Earth, keeping only a small airplane toy with him as the only memory of his former life. In 1954, the creature finally found peace among the Parliament of Trees.

===Tefé Holland===
{{Main|Tefé Holland}}

===Allan Hallman===
Alan Hallman was selected by the Parliament of Trees to be the planet's Earth elemental before Alec Holland became the Swamp Thing. He had been a scientist working on a formula to repair damaged crops when the Parliament chose him, and he died in flames—as all elementals must. However, while traversing the Green, he was captured within a creature of the Grey, which broke him down and converted him into fungus and mold. He was recreated as an emissary of the Grey by Matango, who gathered Hallman's consciousness back together in his Chamber of Dreams. With Matango's return from Hell, Alan Hallman was released into the Green to find and capture the Swamp Thing and his daughter Tefé and force them to surrender their individuality to the Grey.

===Aaron Hayley===
Aaron Hayley is an American soldier in World War II, who was slain and arose as the Swamp Thing. Since there was already an active Plant Elemental at the time (Albert Höllerer), he was only active as Swamp Thing for a short time, and soon took his place among the Parliament of Trees.

===Calbraith A. H. Rodgers===
Calbraith A. H. Rodgers was born in England in 1920. Ever since he was a boy, he had heard whispers from the leaves, the flowers and the trees that something great and terrible would be waiting for him on the other side. Afraid of what would be waiting for him on the other side of death, he enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] to try and escape the pull of the Green. However, on May 3, 1942, on his fourth mission as a pilot during the war, his plane was shot down. Landing in a swamp, the dying Rodgers felt the branches and petals reaching for him, delivering him to his new life as the protector of the Green. By fusing the man with the Green in the final moments of his life, the Swamp Thing was created.

Rodgers served a number of years as the Swamp Thing before taking his place in the Parliament of Trees, the final resting place of his predecessors, where his consciousness would live on as the flesh of the body passed away. Rodgers would later leave the Parliament of Trees to become the Swamp Thing once again in order to warn Alec Holland of the coming of both the Rot and Sethe, the enemy that the Swamp Thing was born to defend the Green against. Rodgers knew that to remove his consciousness from the Parliament of Trees would mean true death. After delivering his message to Alec and warning him to stay away from Abby Arcane, he passed away.

==Powers and abilities==
Swamp Thing can inhabit and animate vegetable matter anywhere, including alien plants, even sentient ones, and construct it into a body for himself. As a result, bodily attacks mean little to him. He can easily regrow damaged or severed body parts, and can even transport himself across the globe by leaving his current form, transferring his consciousness to a new form grown from whatever vegetable matter is present in the location he wishes to reach. He even grew himself a form out of [[John Constantine]]'s meager tobacco supply on one occasion.

Swamp Thing is normally human-sized or slightly larger than average, but he can grow bodies much larger. He once used [[Redwoods|Sequoioideae]] to grow a body the size of an office block.

Swamp Thing possesses superhuman strength. While Swamp Thing's strength has never been portrayed as prominently as many of his other abilities, he is arguably one the most powerful beings in the DCU. DC's New 52 continuity made several changes, though mostly highlighting previous abilities and a physical look not dissimilar from previous incarnations. New 52 continuity did however bring Swamp thing further into the shared universe continuity by placing him permanently in the Justice League Dark team lineup. Partnering with many familiar faces like John Constantine, Zatanna Zatara, and Deadman. Swamp Thing's powers and abilities make him the true powerhouse of the team. His power limits have yet to be established. He has demonstrated sufficient strength to rip large trees out of the ground with ease and trade blows with the likes of [[Etrigan the Demon]].

Swamp Thing can control any form of plant life. He can make it bend to his will or accelerate its growth. This control even extends to alien life, as he once cured [[Superman]] of an infection caused by exposure to a Kryptonian plant that was driving Superman mad and causing his body to burn out its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]]|penciller= [[Rick Veitch|Veitch, Rick]]|inker= [[Al Williamson|Williamson, Al]]|story= The Jungle Line|title= [[DC Comics Presents]]|issue= 85|date= September 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the run of Mark Millar, Swamp Thing had also mastered the elements of Fire, Earth, Water and Air, the Parliaments of each were later killed by [[Word (comics)|The Word]], implying that he has retained these abilities and has the power once held by the Parliaments. This has yet to be explained.

The new Swamp Thing (a resurrected Alec Holland) has no power over a [[White Lantern]] Power Ring but he can control all forms of plant life and even grow every kind even if it is unknown to him. He can also grow from any plant life anywhere, dead or alive. This is seen when Seeder creates a portal to the moon and banishes him there. However, Holland simply resurrects himself back on Earth from the plants growing on Seeder's face.

===Film===
* Swamp Thing's expansion into media outside of comic books began with his first [[Swamp Thing (film)|eponymous film]] in 1982. Directed by [[Wes Craven]], it starred actor/[[stuntman]] [[Dick Durock]] as the title character. A sequel, ''[[The Return of Swamp Thing]]'', was produced in 1989. This was much lower in budget and met with significantly less success than its predecessor. {{Citation needed|reason=Let's see some sales numbers and budget numbers.|date=September 2016}} The film series rejected the popular Alan Moore revision of Swamp Thing's origin and portrayed Swamp Thing with his original origin as a man turned into a plant-like entity. {{Citation needed|reason=When did this event where the films were presented with the option of being based on The Anatomy Lesson but instead chose to be based on Dark Genesis happen? I would love to see the films making a decision on their fates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5344">The '''Tata Duende or El Dueño del Monte''' is a supernatural creature appearing in cultural folklore stories, mostly evident in Mayan and Mestizo cultures. The Tata Duende is considered a powerful spirit that protects animals and the [[jungle]]. There are many stories that have been passed on from generation to generation, to warn against this mischievous spirit. This creature has appeared on a [[postage stamp]] of Belize as part of a series on Belizean folklore.The name Tata Duende comes from the Mayan word "Tata" meaning Grandfather or old and the word "Duende" is Spanish for goblin. In Yucatec Maya the Tata Duende is known as Nukux Tat.

== Origin ==
The Tata Duende is a famous folklore common to the Mayan culture and the Mestizo culture. According to different stories, this "grandfather demon"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belizeadventure.ca/get-to-know-belizean-folklore/|title=Belizean Folklore and Tales|website=Belize Adventure - Trusted Local Advice|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is well known for luring children into the jungle, therefore, the Tata Duende has been used to scare children into behaving.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grisdismation.com/Art/LofB/001-TataDuendeArticle.html | title=Beware of the mythical jungle man called Tata Duende | publisher=grisdismation.com | accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers would blame the Tata Duende if weird things happened on the farm. For example: it was common to see a horse's mane braided and it is claimed that these braids would be difficult to loose, sometimes it had to be cut. The true origin of the 'Tata Duende' seems to be quite unclear since many countries may have similar descriptions but different names. However, the term 'Tata Duende' seems to be coined in the Belizean folklore.

== Description ==
People who claimed to have seen the 'Tata Duende' said he was about 3 feet tall and wore a wide brimmed hat. Sometimes he wore a red hat and animal skin for clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "El Duende"- San Pedro Folklore , 25 Years Ago, History of San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize|url = http://ambergriscaye.com/25years/elduende.html|website = ambergriscaye.com|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described as having his feet pointing backwards and his thumbs missing. Parents would tell their children that if they ever came across this creature to hide their thumbs or the Duende would bite it off. Some stories of people who have encountered the 'Tata Duende' say that they could recognize him because of his distinct whistle. Others say that he smokes cigars and plays the guitar. 
[[File:Tata Duende.jpg|thumb|309x309px|This 1991 60 cent stamp of Belize, features the dreaded 'Tata Duende' or 'Tata Duhende.' People who claim to have had encountered this spiritual creature describe him as only three feet tall, stump built, hairy body and an ugly mean face. His feet point backwards, his hands have no thumbs and he lives deep in forest. From far away he is recognized by a whistling sound and by a fragrance of a flower known as "Lady of the Night." This stamp is on display at the [[Museum of Belize]]. ]]
The creature was investigated on a 5th season episode of ''[[Destination Truth]]'', where it was speculated that Tata Duende sightings might actually be of the indigenous [[spider monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.syfy.com/destinationtruth/episodes/season/5/episode/502/return_to_the_haunted_forest_belize_goblin | title=Return to the Haunted Forest | publisher=syfy.com | accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stories ==
There are many stories warning people to be cautious at farms or jungle when walking alone. The Duende has a special interest in children where he would lure them deeper in the woods and the only way to escape him would be if you hide your thumbs and show only your four fingers. The Duende would think you are like him and would let you go. Other stories say that the Duende would appear mostly during the 'Lenten Season' especially on 'Good Friday.' He is also known for braiding horses' manes and little girls' hair. In addition, the 'Tata Duende' is known to often change into a small animal, or even someone you know.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.larubeya.com/placencia-belize-travel/2013/10/02/the-legends-belize-folklore-myths-broken/|title=The Legends; Belize Folklore Myths Broken {{!}} Placencia Belize Travel Blog|website=www.larubeya.com|access-date=2016-03-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002201030/http://www.larubeya.com/placencia-belize-travel/2013/10/02/the-legends-belize-folklore-myths-broken/|archivedate=2013-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad''''' is a 1958 [[Technicolor]] [[heroic fantasy]] [[adventure film]] from [[Columbia Pictures]], produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]], directed by [[Nathan H. Juran]], that stars [[Kerwin Mathews]], [[Torin Thatcher]], [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]], [[Richard Eyer]], and [[Alec Mango]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-141/141#page/n60/mode/1up|last=Swires|first=Steve|title=Nathan Juran: The Fantasy Voyages of Jerry the Giant Killer Part One|magazine=Starlog Magazine|issue=141|date= April 1989|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first of three [[Sinbad]] [[feature film]]s from Columbia, the much later two being ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973) and ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977). All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by [[Ray Harryhausen]] who used a full color [[widescreen]] [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] technique he created called [[Dynamation]].

While similarly named, the film does not follow the storyline of the tale "[[Sinbad_the_Sailor#Seventh_and_Last_Voyage_of_Sinbad_the_Sailor|The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor]]" but instead has more in common with the [[Sinbad_the_Sailor#Third_Voyage_of_Sinbad_the_Sailor|Third]] and [[Sinbad_the_Sailor#Fifth_Voyage_of_Sinbad_the_Sailor|Fifth]] voyages of Sinbad.

''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' was selected in 2008 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Sinbad the Sailor]] ([[Kerwin Mathews]]) and his crew land their ship on the island of Colossa, where they encounter Sokurah the [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] ([[Torin Thatcher]]) fleeing from a giant [[cyclops]]. Though he escapes, Sokurah loses a [[Aladdin|magic lamp]] to the creature. Sinbad refuses his desperate pleas to return to the island because Parisa, Princess of [[Chandra]] ([[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]]), is aboard. Sinbad has fallen in love with her, and their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between her father's realm and Sinbad's homeland, [[Baghdad]].
[[File:7th voyage of Sinbad - Roc.png|left|thumb|Sinbad and his men confront the [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]].]]
After reaching Baghdad, Sokurah performs [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]] at the pre-wedding festivities, temporarily turning Parisa's handmaiden into a [[Nāga|serpent-like being]]. Despite his prowess and a dark prophecy about war between Baghdad and Chandra, the Caliph of Baghdad ([[Alec Mango]]) refuses to help the magician return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly shrinks the princess, enraging her father, the Sultan of Chandra ([[Harold Kasket]]), who declares war on Baghdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]] is needed for the potion to restore Parisa, and it can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad with the plans for a [[ballista|giant crossbow]] for protection against the island's giant creatures.

Sinbad recruits additional crewmen from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening [[demon]]s from an island south of Colossa drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. One of the men releases Sinbad so he can save the ship, while the mutineers' leader falls to his death from the crow's nest.

On Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and six others enter the valley of the cyclops, followed by Sinbad's loyal aide Harufa (Alfred Brown). Sinbad and Sokurah split their forces. Sinbad and his men find the cyclops' treasure cave, but are captured by one of the creatures and locked in a wooden cage. In the meantime, Sokurah retrieves the magic lamp, but is chased by the cyclops, who kills three of the men. With Parisa's aid, Sinbad manages to escape, then blinds the one-eyed creature and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad decides to keep the lamp until Parisa is returned to normal size.

Sokurah leads Sinbad and his starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs. Sinbad's men, out of hunger, try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends the childlike [[Jinn|Genie]] inside, Barani ([[Richard Eyer]]), who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise of his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the remaining men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but he is grabbed by the Roc, who drops him unconscious into its nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.

Sinbad awakes and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress and helps him evade the chained [[dragon]] that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton warrior]], which Sinbad fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.

Leaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the cyclops. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where his men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing him to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who appoints himself as Sinbad's cabin boy and, in a final act of magic, presents Sinbad and Parisa with the treasure from the cyclops' cave as a wedding gift.

==Production==
It took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad''. Harryhausen's "Dynamation" label was used for the first time on this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The name Dynamation|url=http://www.harryhausenarchive.com/dynamation.php|website=The Official Ray Harryhausen Website|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harryhausen gave the cyclops a horn, [[goat]] legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the [[Greek god]] [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. He lifted much of the creature's design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the [[Ymir]] (the [[Venus|Venusian]] creature from his earlier ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]''). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the ymir, removing the latter's latex body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=John|title=Cheap Tricks and Class Acts: Special Effects, Makeup and Stunts from the Fantastic Fifties|date=1996|publisher=McFarland and Company, Inc.|isbn=0-7864-0093-5|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHzeZZOUD6QC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=ray+harryhausen+cannibalized+ymir+for+cyclops&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2IzzO3t9I3&amp;sig=4nVGJaqKsIISAfcf41Mgz7keoMY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDuIH6l9nRAhXJ8YMKHfMgCVYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ray%20harryhausen%20cannibalized%20ymir%20for%20cyclops&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harryhausen researched the [[cobra]]-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[Sultan]]) by watching a belly dancer in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. During the performance, Harryhausen says, "smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!" The cyclops is the film's most popular character, but Harryhausen's personal favorite was the cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisa's maid, Sadi, and a cobra.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton 2003, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's original script had a climax that involved two cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single cyclops versus a dragon. The model of the dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a [[flamethrower]], shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then [[Superimposition|superimpose]]ing the filmed fire very near the dragon's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton 2005, pp. 160–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword fight scene between Sinbad and the [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] proved so popular with audiences that Harryhausen recreated and expanded the scene five years later, this time having a group of seven armed skeletons fight the Greek hero Jason and his men in 1963's ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/mn/nn/JasonArgonauts.html "'Jason and the Argonauts'."] ''Monstervision'', 2000. Retrieved: January 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stop-motion cobra-woman figure used for the film was cannibalized 20 years later in order to make the [[Medusa]] figure in Harryhausen's final film, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]].''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Film score==
The music score for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], better known at the time for his collaboration with the director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Herrmann went on to write the scores for three other Harryhausen films: ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'', and ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''. Of the four, Harryhausen regarded the score for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' as being the finest, due to the empathy Herrmann's main title composition evoked for the subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting "I would cite ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition, I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own".&lt;ref&gt;Luchs, Kurt. [http://www.bernardherrmann.org/articles/interviews/townson001/ "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad: An Interview with Robert Townson, part 1."] ''The Bernard Herrrmann Society'', October 1998. Retrieved: January 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'' continues to be well-reviewed by critics, with many holding the opinion that it is the best film of the "Sinbad" trilogy. The film carries a 100% approval rating at the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|id=seventh_voyage_of_sinbad}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several reviewers citing its nostalgic value. [[Mountain Xpress]] critic Ken Hanke calls it "Childhood memory stuff of the most compelling kind."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Tron''' is an American science fiction [[media franchise]]. It began in 1982 with the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Tron]]''. It was followed by various film tie-ins, a comic series and the 2010 sequel ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''. More sequels were planned but have now been suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3902476/disney-tron-3/|title= Disney Is Not Moving Forward With Tron 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Tron: Uprising|television series]] premiered on [[Disney XD]] in June 2012.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8549869.stm|title=TV version of Tron 'being made' |work=BBC News | date=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRON also existed as the [[TRON command]] in the early versions of the computer programming language [[BASIC]].  TRON stood for TRace ON, which prompted the program to print or display line numbers for each command line of a program as it ran, in order to assist in the [[debugging]] of the program.  In the TRON film, TRON became a character who worked in programs to defeat evil elements trying to subvert the program.

===''Tron'' (1982)===
{{Main|Tron}}
''Tron'' is a 1982 American action science fiction film by Walt Disney Pictures. It stars [[Jeff Bridges]] as Kevin Flynn, [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Tron and his User Alan Bradley, [[Cindy Morgan]] as Yori and Dr. Lora Baines, and [[Dan Shor]] as Ram. [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] plays all three main antagonists: the program [[Sark (Tron)|Sark]], his User Ed Dillinger, and the voice of the [[Master Control Program]]. It was written and directed by [[Steven Lisberger]]. ''Tron'' has a distinctive visual style, as it was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively.

===''Tron: Legacy'' (2010)===
{{Main|Tron: Legacy}}

Jeff Bridges returns as Kevin Flynn and also, in a digitally de-aged form, plays the film's antagonist, a new version of his CLU program.  [[Bruce Boxleitner]] also returns as Alan Bradley and, likewise de-aged, as Tron.  They are joined by [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Sam Flynn, Kevin's son, the film's primary protagonist; [[Olivia Wilde]] as digital warrior Quorra; [[Michael Sheen]] as Castor, owner of a nightclub within the Grid; and [[Beau Garrett]] as Gem, a program that works within the digital world.  The film deals with Sam investigating the disappearance of his father twenty years earlier, a quest that ultimately leads him into an isolated digital world created by his father after the events of the first film.  Original film director Steven Lisberger acted as a producer and consultant on the film, which was written by [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]] and [[Edward Kitsis]] and directed by first-time director [[Joseph Kosinski]].

===Untitled ''Tron: Legacy'' sequel (TBA)===
While never officially approved, it was announced that a third ''Tron'' film was in the works as of March 2015. It was also reported that Joseph Kosinski would return to direct and Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund would reprise their roles from ''Tron: Legacy''.

However, in May of the same year, the film was abruptly cancelled. It was reported that at the time of the cancellation, pre-production had almost been completed, with production having been planned to begin Fall 2015, likely in Vancouver, British Columbia. Disney had also been interested in adding [[Jared Leto]] to the cast, but an offer and negotiations never commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-not-moving-forward-tron-798941|title=Disney Not Moving Forward With 'Tron 3' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2017, during a Q&amp;A session with Joseph Kosinski, he revealed that Tron 3 isn't totally dead, instead saying it was in "cryogenic freeze".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On October 15, 2017, Jared Leto, in a recent interview with Collider, gave an update on the potential Tron reboot, confirming that the project does exist and he is involved. However, since it is in early planning stages, no other details have been said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/tron-3-reboot-jared-leto-update/|title=Jared Leto Offers Update On Potential TRON Reboot |work=Screen Rant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==

===''Tron''===
{{main|Tron (video game)|Discs of Tron}}
Since video games play a central role in the film, many video games based on ''Tron'' have been produced over the years. [[Atari, Inc.]] had plans to develop a real ''Space Paranoids'' game, but this was canceled due to the [[video game crash of 1983]], along with arcade adaptations of ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''. In 1982, [[Midway Games]] released the ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]'' [[arcade game]], which consisted of four mini-games based on sequences in the film. This game earned more than the film's initial release. In 1983, Midway released ''[[Discs of Tron]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tips.retrogames.com/gamepage/dot.html |title=Discs Of Tron |publisher=Tips.retrogames.com |date=June 14, 2000 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sequel that focused on disc combat.

===Mattel games===

[[Mattel]] Electronics released three separate ''Tron'' games (unrelated to the arcade game) for the [[Mattel Intellivision|Intellivision]] game console in 1982: ''[[Tron: Deadly Discs]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisiongames.com/gamepage.php?gameId=109 |title=TRON Deadly Disks |publisher=Intellivisiongames.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven A.

A special joystick resembling the ''Tron'' arcade game joystick was also created as a free giveaway in a special pack that included both Atari 2600 ''Tron'' video games.

===''Tron 2.0''===
{{Main|Tron 2.0}}
A [[PC game]] sequel released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] was released on August 26, 2003. In this [[first person shooter]] game, the player takes the part of Alan Bradley's son Jet, who is pulled into the computer world to fight a computer virus. A separate version of this game, called ''[[Tron 2.0#Ports|Tron 2.0 Killer App]]'', is available for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and features new multiplayer modes. An almost completely different game of the same name is also available for the [[Game Boy Advance]], where Tron and a Light Cycle program named Mercury (first seen in ''Tron 2.0'' for the PC) fight their way through the ENCOM computer to stop a virus called The Corruptor. This game includes light cycle, battle tank, and recognizer battle modes, several security-related minigames, and the arcade games ''Tron'' and ''Discs of Tron''. While the Game Boy Advance game is only minimally connected to the PC game, one of the 100 unlockable chips shows a picture of Jet Bradley.

===''Space Paranoids''===
{{Main|Space Paranoids}}
In 2009, 42 Entertainment released eight, real-life ''Space Paranoids'' arcade machines during the 2009 San Diego Comic Con. They were placed in a recreated Flynn's Arcade near the convention center. The object of the game is to go through the levels and to achieve as many points as possible by destroying Recognizers. The total number of points a person can achieve is 999,000 pts, which is a reference to the score Flynn got in the film, and is a record currently held by the gamer with the initials FLN. You use a pilot-like joystick and a ball to move the turret and tank.

===''Tron: Evolution''===
{{Main|Tron: Evolution}}
A tie-in video game based upon ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'', titled ''[[Tron: Evolution]]'', released in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61591|title='Tron Evolution' Game Coming Holiday 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaser trailers were released in November 2009, with a longer trailer airing during the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] on December 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spike.com/video/tron-video-game-to/3294095 |title=TRON Video Game to Premiere at Video Game Awards 2009! &amp;#124; Free Video Clips |publisher=SPIKE |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evolution'' was made at the same time as the film, and features heavy cross-over references, with members of the video game developers stating that some of the facts in film have more depth if the game is played first, as the game reveals more about that scene. It will also allow you to explore further parts of the Tron world.

===''Tron Evolution: Battle Grids''===
{{Main|Tron Evolution: Battle Grids}}
Unlike ''Tron: Evolution'', made for PS3, PSP, Xbox 360 and PC, ''Tron Evolution: Battle Grids'' is made exclusively for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS, and its storyline predates that of the other versions. In this game you create your own program, this program will meet Quorra and Tron before the events of ''Tron: Legacy'' and they will train him to be the first ISO to win the Grid Games, but before that can happen you will have to battle and defeat the enemies that kidnapped Quorra and threatened that if you participate in the games she would be Derezzed. The video game is developed by n-Space and published by Disney Interactive Studios.

===Tron RUN/r===
{{main|Tron RUN/r}}
Announced at the [[The Game Awards 2015|Games Award 2015]], and available immediately afterwards in [[Early access|Early Access]]&lt;ref name=IGNRUN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storm|first1=Steven|title=SURPRISE TRON GAME ANNOUNCED FOR PC AT THE GAME AWARDS|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/04/surprise-tron-game-announced-for-pc-at-the-game-awards|website=IGN|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tron RUN/r]] is described as an "Action Arcade" game.&lt;ref name=IGNRUN/&gt;

====''Epic Mickey''====
{{Main|Epic Mickey}}
A game based on Disney history, ''Epic Mickey'' features several Tron elements in its [[Tomorrowland|Tomorrow City]] level. Spatter enemies wear the red suits of Sark's minions and one of the robotic Beetleworx of the area has a Lightcycle inspired torso. The boss of the level is Petetronic, a version of [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] dressed as Sark, who you must defeat by deflecting his disc attacks and using either thinner or paint to defeat him, paint turning his circuitry blue and friendly, thinner derezzing him, only to appear as an MCP like program in the alternate ending.

==Theme parks==
From 1982 to 1995, ''Tron'' was featured in [[Disneyland]]'s [[PeopleMover]] attraction, as part of ''The World of Tron'', in which the light cycle sequence from the film was projected around park guests as their vehicle passed through a tunnel on the upper level of the Carousel Theater, placing the PeopleMover in the role of a light cycle. The attraction was known as PeopleMover Thru the World of Tron after this sequence was added. From 1977 to 1982, this segment was previously home to the "SuperSpeed Tunnel," in which race cars were projected around the vehicles.

In 2010, the [[Epcot]] Monorail on the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] received [[Wrap advertising|wrap advertisements]] featuring blue and yellow light cycles on either side of the train to promote ''Tron Legacy''.

[[ElecTRONica]] was announced on the Disney Parks Blog for [[Disney California Adventure]] in Anaheim, California. Disney's "ElecTRONica" is an interactive nighttime dance party in Hollywood Pictures Backlot. It is a similar experience to Glow Fest, but with a focus on ''Tron: Legacy''. ElecTRONica features lights, lasers, music, and projections to promote the film. On October 29, 2010, the nighttime show ''[[World of Color]]'' began soft-openings after its second show for a ''Tron: Legacy'' themed encore using [[Daft Punk]]'s original music from [[Tron: Legacy (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]], using new effects and projections on Paradise Pier attractions, The segment was added on November 1, 2010 and ended on March 23, 2011. ElecTRONica ended on April 15, 2012 and replaced by [[Mad T Party]].

In 2016, a roller coaster called [[TRON Lightcycle Power Run]] opened in [[Shanghai Disneyland]]. Guests board single-seat [[motorbike roller coaster]]s modeled after light cycles and manufactured by [[Vekoma]]. A cloned version of this ride will open at [[Magic Kingdom]] before 2021.

==Literature==

===Books===
A novelization of ''Tron'' was released in 1982, written by American science fiction novelist [[Brian Daley]]. It included eight pages of color photographs from the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daley|first=Brian|title=Tron|publisher=New English Library Ltd|date=October 1, 1982|isbn=0-450-05550-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Disney Senior Staff Publicist Michael Bonifer authored a book entitled ''The Art of Tron'' which covered aspects of the pre-production and post-production aspects of Tron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bonifer|first=Michael|title=The Art of Tron|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date=November 1982|isbn=0-671-45575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tron-sector.com/bios/michaelbonifer.aspx Tron Sector Biography of Mike Bonifer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609041007/http://www.tron-sector.com/bios/michaelbonifer.aspx |date=June 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To support the film's release in 1982, Disney also published several books targeting children including ''Tron: A Pop-Up Book'', ''Tron: The Storybook'', and ''The Story of Tron'', a book and audio combination (with either 33 RPM 7 inch record or audio cassette).

A nonfiction book about the making of the original film, called ''The Making of Tron: How Tron Changed Visual Effects and Disney Forever'' was published in 2011 and written by William Kallay.

In 2010, to coincide with the release of ''Tron: Legacy'', a range of new books have been released; including a range of junior novels – "''Tron the Junior Novel''" by Alice Alfonsi, "''Tron: Legacy: Derezzed''" by James Gelsey, "''Tron: Legacy: Out of the Dark''" by Tennant Redbank, "''Tron: Legacy: It's Your Call: Initiate Sequence''" by Carla Jablonski. Additional books include "''The Art of Tron: Legacy''" by Justin Springer, Joseph Kosinski, and Darren Gilford, and "''Tron Legacy: The Movie Storybook''" by James Ponti.

===Comics===

To support the release of the film in 1982, Disney briefly ran a Sunday comic strip adaptation of the film.

In 2003, 88 MPH solicited a mini-series titled ''Tron 2.0: Derezzed''. This comic was canceled before any issues were released.

In 2005, [[Slave Labor Graphics]] announced its six-issue limited series comic, ''[[Tron: The Ghost in the Machine]]''. The first issue was released in April 2006, the second issue in November of the same year. The comic book explores the concept of making a backup copy of a User within the computer system, and how that artificial intelligence might be materialized into the real world. The comic book was written by Landry Walker and Eric Jones, with art in the first two issues by Louie De Martinis. The artist on the last three issues is Mike Shoykhet.

The comic from Slave Labor Graphics opens with a detailed history of the ''Tron'' universe, providing this previously unseen background on the events that allowed Ed Dillinger and the MCP to rise to power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1970s, a small engineering company called ENCOM introduced a revolutionary type of software designed to direct and streamline the transfer of data between networked machines. Ed Dillinger, the lead programmer on this project, realized the enormous potential of his team's creation and secretly encoded a secondary function to be activated upon installation: to copy the sub-routines of other programs and absorb their functions. This alteration allowed Dillinger to appropriate research and claim it as his own, and he rose quickly through ENCOM’s corporate ranks. This was the beginning of the Master Control Program.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marvel Comics]] released a two issue mini-series entitled ''[[Tron: Betrayal]]'' in October 2010. The story takes place a year after the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=16681 |title=Tron: Betrayal (2010) No. 1 &amp;#124; Comic Books &amp;#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To coincide with the release of the sequel ''Tron: Legacy'', Marvel also released in 2010 a comic adaptation of the original 1982 film.  It was written by Peter David with art by Mirco Pierfederici.

A manga version of ''Tron: Legacy'' was released by [[Earth Star Entertainment]] in Japan on June 30, 2011.

==Light cycles==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tron Lightcycles.jpg|right|thumbnail|240px|Two light cycles racing head to head.]] --&gt;
'''Light cycles''' were originally fictional vehicles designed by [[Syd Mead]] for the simulated world of the ''Tron'' universe.  5 real-life replica light cycles were created by Parker Brothers Concepts in Florida, one of which was sold by Sotheby's for a reported $77,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/07/25/this-man-spent-his-life-savings-on-a-tron-light-cycle-theres-just-one-slight-problem-4810519/|title=This  Chinese man owns a real life Tron light cycle.

These futuristic two-wheeled vehicles resemble motorcycles and create walls of colored light. The vehicles were primarily used in a competition between humanoid computer programs, similar to the 1976 arcade game ''[[Blockade (video game)|Blockade]]'', which was the first of a genre called ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]''. Players are in constant motion on a playfield, creating a wall of light behind them as they move. If players hit a wall, their light cycle explodes, placing them out of the game; the last player in the game wins. Since the original display in ''Tron'', there have been numerous adaptations, as well as references in popular culture.

A light cycle toy, in red and yellow versions, was produced by [[TOMY]] as part of the merchandising for the ''Tron'' film, along with action figures scaled to fit inside the toy cycles. [[Counterfeit|Bootleg]] versions of TOMY's design were produced by other toy manufacturers that came in a wide variety of colors, including blue and silver, but were noticeably smaller than the TOMY-produced toy, too small in fact to accommodate one of the TOMY action figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyarchive.com/Tron/Tron.html Tron], Rare and Unique toys of the 70's, 80's, and 90's. – Alex Bickmore's SUPER TOY ARCHIVE&lt;/ref&gt;

We also get a glimpse at Kevin Flynn's own cycle, a "Second Generation Light Cycle" designed in 1989 by Flynn and “rumor has it it's still the fastest thing on the grid.” It incorporates some of the look of both films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/07/23/comic-con-tron-2-retitled-tron-legacy-imax-3d-concept-art-and-new-scene-revealed/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911153107/http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/07/23/comic-con-tron-2-retitled-tron-legacy-imax-3d-concept-art-and-new-scene-revealed/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |title=Comic-Con: Tron 2 Retitled TRON Legacy; IMAX 3D; Concept Art and New Scene Revealed &amp;#124; /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=August 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tie-in]] video game ''[[Tron: Evolution]]'', which is set between the events of ''Tron'' and ''Tron: Legacy'', features light cycles in sections of the single-player mode and in certain game maps for the multiplayer mode.  Light cycle use in multiplayer gives players the option to shift back and forth between cycle and foot travel at will, and provides multiple attack and defensive options beyond the classic "boxing in" of an opponent. In addition, the light cycles of ''Evolution'' can pass through their own light trails (and the trails of allied players) unharmed.

A more classic interpretation of the lightcycle game is shown in the Wii-Game ''[[Tron: Evolution - Battle Grids]]'', which is primarily based on offline multiplayer or singleplayer matches. These lightcycle battles don't allow the player to pass through his own trail but do allow passage through teammates' trails. There is also no option to travel on foot.

A vehicle within ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', the X-2 Phantom, is actually based upon a Light Cycle, with a slight variation as it bears a Purple theme.

A motorcycle introduced for ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'''s ''Bikers'' update, the ''Shotaro'', heavily resembles a Light Cycle, with its name acting as an allusion to the 1988 Anime film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|AKIRA]]''.

'''''Yakchim''''' is one of many methods of [[traditional Korean medicine]] treatment. It is also called '''pharmacopuncture''', '''Korean Herb-acupuncture''' and '''[[acupuncture]] with medicinal herbs'''.

==Definition==
Traditional Korean Medicine treatment of injecting herbal medicinal substances on the ''[[gyeonghyeol]]'' (經穴:[[Acupuncture points]] = the points of ''kyungrak''  (=[[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]經絡)) which acts as both acupuncture stimulation and direct medicinal dosage.

==Background==
It is also known as ''Yakchim'' (藥鍼) Immunization, ''Suchim'' (水针), ''Yakchimyobeop''(a method of treatment of ''Yakchim''), ''Hyeolwi'' (穴位) needle therapy. It is a type of medical science of Immunity (免疫医学) injecting to the important ''gyeonghyeol'' (經穴: [[acupuncture points]]) ingredients extracted from oriental medical [[herb]]s.

It can also be said that the therapy of a needle for acupuncture is a method of treatment stimulating the human body externally and the medication therapy is stimulating  the internal organs internally. It has an intention of improving the effectiveness of treatment by enforcing the two therapies simultaneously. 

In western pharmacodynamic sense, direct injection of medicinal substances into the body promotes quicker steadystate levels of substances either in the local tissue or in the blood stream, thus improving time-efficacy of the medicine (which has been a long concern when treating time-critical patients)  

It was developed by Nam Sang Chun (南相千) from [[South Korea]] who had researched the formation of ''kyungrak'' (=meridians經絡) in 1956 and has strengthened the immunity developing into a specialty of acupuncture field and since 1963 he has examined closely the functioning of ''kyungrak'' (=meridians經絡) using a syringe with herbal medication such as ''[[sanjoin]]'' (酸棗仁), ''hwanggi'' (黃芪: Astragalus membranaceus Bunge), [[ginseng]] (人蔘) and ''nokyong'' (鹿茸: the young [[antler]]s of the [[deer]]). 

It is distinguished that ''gyeonghyeol'' (經穴:[[Acupuncture points]]) has an effect by itself only with the stimulation of the needle, but can be achieved greater therapeutic effect with the injection of specific medicinal herbs. It is being researched and developed in several countries like South Korea, [[China]] and [[Japan]] and others, where the oriental therapies are prevalent. The department of the career of ''Yakchim'' has been implemented in the Korean Oriental medicine institute on August 26, 1990 in South Korea and the research and the diffusion about ''Yakchim'' (藥鍼) has been progressing actively.

YakChim (藥鍼) is injecting remedy into the Kyonglak (經絡) system in order to maximize the effects and the time. Nowadays YakChim is used widely all around the world at the same time. Injections can be divided into Kije (氣劑) and Yunje. Kije (氣劑) is medicine injected directly injected into Kyonglak (經絡), and Yunje (潤劑) is a medicine that produces Ki (氣). Yunje works as a lubricating device.

'''''Young Sherlock: The Mystery of the Manor House''''' is an 8-episode television series about the youthful years of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. The show was produced by [[Granada Television]] and premiered on 31 October 1982. Although there was no televised sequel to this story, Gerald Frow penned a follow-up for Granada's [[The Dragon Book (anthology)|Dragon Books]] (who in 1982 published his novelisation of this tale). ''Young Sherlock: The Adventure at Ferryman's Creek'' went on sale in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271933/ Young Sherlock: The Mystery of the Manor House at the Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Until [[Dr. Watson]] listened to the [[Dictaphone|dictaphone cylinders]] Sherlock recorded in his retirement, not even he knew "The Mystery of Manor House." It's the strange happenings at his former childhood home that transform Sherlock ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) from a brilliant and curious 17-year-old schoolboy to a brilliant and accomplished detective. Young Sherlock is the suspenseful eight episode series chronicling "The Mystery of the Manor House." The year is 1871. A [[typhoid]] epidemic forces Sherlock to come home early. What he encounters is anything but a happy homecoming. Mysterious happenings start swirling around Sherlock from the moment he steps foot on the [[Manor house|manor grounds]]. Residents masquerade as honourable. Poison, deceit and greed fill the air. Sherlock's powerful deductive reasoning skills are put to the test. A priceless [[diamond]] will vanish unless Sherlock can foil a conspiracy against [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Young-Sherlock-Mystery-Manor-House/dp/B00008J2I9 Young Sherlock - The Mystery of the Manor House DVD] at [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]&lt;/ref&gt;
