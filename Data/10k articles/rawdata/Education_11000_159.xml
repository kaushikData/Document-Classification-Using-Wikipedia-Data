==Arabic Programs Description==
Programs Types Ali Baba International Center  offers two types of programs: regular programs and special  programs. A short description of each program is given in what follows.

I . Regular programs are offered throughout the year. Two types of regular  programs are offered; 1-month group programs, and private programs.  A 1-month group program is a package consisting of the followings: a 1-month long intensive Arabic language course,  a comfortable accommodation, airpor pickup, and  an optional tour  to a touristic site in Jordan. In the a 1-month group program a student takes 80 hours of Arabic language instruction; 5 times a week, 4-hours each time, for a period of 4 weeks. The 80-hour program is equal to a 4-credit course in most universities. Students wishing to study for longer periods can  cover consecutive levels of Arabic. Private regular programs are offered anytime of the year. These programs are more flexible since students can take as many hours as they wish and for the duration they need. For both types of regular programs students may request the type of Arabic language they wish to learn; MSA (Modern Standard Arabic), Media Arabic, or Colloquial Arabic. Elementary, intermediate and advanced  classes are opened in each month to meet the demands of people having different backgrounds in Arabic.  A placement test will be given to the registered students before the start of the course  to determine the level and accordingly the appropriate class they should enroll in.

II. Special Programs: a special  program is a package consisting of a specialized  course in Arabic or a middle eastern or Islamic field,  accommodation, and  tours around Jordan if desired. The specialized courses are tailored to meet the needs of individuals or groups working in fields like diplomacy, business, culture and others,  and therefore may vary in their contents, durations,  time of offering, and cost. The following possible special courses can be offered:

Special Arabic Courses : individuals or groups may request specialized Arabic courses in certain fields such diplomacy and  political science, economics and business, sports or other professional fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10526">'''Asset-based community development''' ('''ABCD''') is a methodology for the [[sustainable development]] of communities based on their strengths and potentials. It involves assessing the resources, skills, and experience available in a community; organizing the community around issues that move its members into action; and then determining and taking appropriate action.&lt;ref name=NUIPR&gt;{{cite report|last1=McKnight|first1=John|first2=John|last2=Kretzmann|title=Mapping Community Capacity|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/docs/MappingCapacity.pdf|publisher=Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research |location=Evanston, IL |format=PDF |edition=Revised |date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} This method uses the community's own assets and resources as the basis for development; it empowers the people of the community by encouraging them to utilize what they already possess. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathie|first=Alison|last2=Cameron|first2=Jenny|last3=Gibson|first3=Katherine|title=Asset-based and citizen-led development: Using a diffracted power lens to analyze the possibilities and challenges|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464993416674302|journal=Progress in Development Studies|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=54–66|doi=10.1177/1464993416674302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABCD approach was developed by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois.  They co-authored a book in 1993, ''Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing A Community’s Assets'',&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out"/&gt; which outlined their asset-based approach to [[community development]].&lt;ref name="ABCD Institute Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-Based Community Development Institute|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/|publisher=Northwestern University Center for Civic Engagement |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Community Development Program at Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy Research  established the Asset-Based Community Development Institute based on three decades of research and community work by John P. Kretzmann and John L. McKnight.

==Principles==
Whereas needs-based community development emphasizes local deficits and looks to outside agencies for resources, asset-based community development focuses on honing and leveraging existing strengths within the community.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood Transformation"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Stan |last1=Rowland |date=26 April 2008 |title=What is Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) |url=http://www.neighborhoodtransformation.net/pdfs/What_%20is_Asset_Based_Community_Development.pdf |format=PDF |website=Collaborative of Neighborhood Transformation |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Related to tenets of [[empowerment]], it postulates that solutions to community problems already exist within a community’s assets. Principles that guide ABCD include:
* ''Everyone has gifts'': Each person in a community has something to contribute.
* ''Relationships build a community'': People must be connected in order for sustainable community development to take place.
* ''Citizens at the center'': Citizens should be viewed as actors—not recipients—in development.
* ''Leaders involve others'': Community development is strongest when it involves a broad base of community action.
* ''People care'': Challenge notions of "apathy" by listening to people's interests.
* ''Listen'': Decisions should come from conversations where people are heard.
* ''Ask'': Asking for ideas is more sustainable than giving solutions.
* ''Inside-out organization'': Local community members are in control.
* ''Institutions serve the community'': Institutional leaders should create opportunities for community-member involvement, then "step back."&lt;ref name="Neighborhood Transformation"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

== Tools ==
The ABCD approach utilizes several tools to assess and mobilize communities.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kretzmann|first1=John|last2=McKnight|first2=John|title=Building Communities From the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets|date=1993|publisher=ACTA Publications|location=Chicago, IL|page=14|edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-87946-108-9 |oclc=36708153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity inventory===

# ''Skills Information'': lists the many skills that a person has gained at home, work, in the community, or elsewhere.  Examples of these skills can include internet knowledge, hair'''-'''cutting, listening, wallpapering, carpentry, sewing, babysitting, etc.&lt;ref name="The Abundant Community"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKnight|first1=John|last2=Block|first2=Peter|author2-link=Peter Block|title=The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods|date=2010|publisher=Berrett-Koehler|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=1st |isbn=978-1-60509-584-4 |oclc=876604904}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Community Skills'': lists the community work in which a person has participated to determine future work they may be interested in.
# ''Enterprising Interests and Experience'': lists past experience in business and determines interest in starting a business.
# ''Personal Information'': lists minimum information for follow-up.

===Asset mapping===
There are five key assets in any given community: individuals, associations, institutions, physical assets, and connections.&lt;ref name="What is ABCD Toolkit"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Asset-based community development (ABCD)|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/docs/What%20isAssetBasedCommunityDevelopment(1)(3).pdf|website=ABCD Institute|publisher=Collaborative for Neighborhood Transformation|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These assets are broken down into three categories: Gifts of individuals, Citizens’ Associations, and Local Institutions.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt;   Asset maps are used in lieu of needs maps which focus solely on negative aspects of communities.  Asset maps, on the other hand, focus on community assets, abilities, skills, and strengths in order to build its future.

[[File:Asset map.svg|Example asset map]]

===Time banks===
[[Time banks]] are an example of using community assets to connect individuals' assets to one another.&lt;ref name=TimeBanks&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Timebanking? |url=http://timebanks.org/what-is-timebanking/ |website=TimeBanks |publisher=TimeBanks USA |accessdate=22 February 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221100136/http://timebanks.org/what-is-timebanking/ |archive-date=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors and local organizations share skills with one another and earn and spend ‘TimeBank Hours’ or ‘credits’ in the process, allowing an hour of child care to equal an hour of home repair or tax preparation.&lt;ref name=TimeBanks/&gt;

==Ethics==
Since ABCD relies on existing community assets to create change, it has been criticized for implying that disadvantaged communities have all the resources they need to solve community problems.&lt;ref name="Australian Social Work"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ennis|first1=G.|last2=West|first2=Deborah|title=Exploring the potential of social network analysis in asset-based community development practice and research|journal=Australian Social Work|date=2010|volume=64|issue=4|pages=404–417|doi=10.1080/0312407X.2010.508167}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ABCD Institute, however, ABCD methodology recognizes that systemic injustice may require disadvantaged communities to seek assistance from outside the community. ABCD maintains that interventions from exterior sources will be most effective when a community’s assets are leveraged at full capacity.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt;
ABCD is described as a more sustainable model of community development than needs-based community development, because needs-based approaches may perpetuate community problems by emphasizing deficiencies and the necessity for reliance on outside assistance. By contrast, ABCD aims to build capacity within communities by expanding their [[social capital]].&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt; By working with outside resources and simultaneously building trust within the community, more members can make use of a wider array of strengths.&lt;ref name="Development in Practice"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathie|first1=Alison|last2=Cunningham|first2=Gord|title=From clients to citizens: Asset-based Community Development as a strategy for community-driven development|journal=Development in Practice|date=2003|volume=13|issue=5|pages=474-486|doi=10.1080/0961452032000125857}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|480}}

The '''Association for Business Communication''' ('''ABC''') is  a  [[learned society]] for the field of [[business communication]]. Its mission statement states: "The Association for Business Communication (ABC) is an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship, research, education, and practice". The organization is [[interdisciplinary]], with members belonging to academic fields such as [[management]], [[marketing]], [[English language|English]], foreign languages, [[public speaking|speech]], [[communication]], [[linguistics]], and [[information systems]]. Additionally the organization brings together university academicians, business practitioners, and business consultants.

==Organizational structure==
ABC is an international organization, divided into nine regional divisions (Europe, Asia and Pacific Rim, Caribbean and Central America, and five North American regions: Canada plus Eastern, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western United States), each with its own separate academic conferences. Each year, the association holds an International Conference in October or November. Midyear, regional conferences are held—one in the European region and one or two of the North American regions. The Asia and Pacific Rim region holds a conference every two years or more frequently.

A [[board of directors]] and an [[executive committee]] lead the ABC. The board of directors is directly elected with a vice president elected from each of 9 regions and 12 directors at large, with staggered terms. The executive committee consists of a permanent position of executive director and four officers of the association. The members of the executive committee serve for four years in rotating capacity, beginning as second vice president in the first year, then first vice president the next, president the next, and past president the last year on the committee. The organization as a whole elects the second vice president position from among candidates on the board of directors.

The current executive director of the ABC is [[James M. Dubinsky]] ([[Virginia Tech]]). He took office in 2011.

For 2018-2019 the executive committee consists of President Lisa Gueldenzoph Snyder ([[North Carolina A &amp; T University]]), First Vice President Marcel Robles ([[Eastern Kentucky University]]), Second Vice President Geert Jacobs ([[Ghent University]]), and immediate Past President Deborah Roebuck ([[Kennesaw State University]]).

== Publications ==
Two [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]s, ''[[International Journal of Business Communication]]'' and the ''[[Business and Professional Communication Quarterly]]'' are published by [[SAGE Publications]] on behalf of ABC.

== Standing committees, ad hoc committees and interest groups ==

The ABC has standing committees, as follow:

    Academic Environment
    Business Practices
    Conference Procedures
    C.R. Anderson Research Fund
    Diversity and Inclusion
    Employment Opportunities
    Graduate Studies
    International Issues
    Marketing and Membership
    Modern Language Association Liaison (MLA)
    Nominating
    Publications Board
    Research
    Student Competition
    Teaching
    Technology
    Undergraduate Studies

The ABC has ad hoc committees for interests that have not yet warranted a standing committee, but may in the future become so. Many of the standing committees began as ad hoc committees. In 2017, the ABC had these ad hoc committees:

    Finance Committee
    National Communication Association Liaison
    Proceedings Editorial Review Board
    Vision/Mission Review Committee

Additionally, ABC members pursue a number of professional objectives through voluntary interest groups. A Special Interest Group may be convened by the First Vice President or by members’ current interest groups. In 2017, the ABC had the following Special Interest Groups:

    Business Writing and Speaking Centers
    Community College
    Consulting
    Intercultural Communication
    MBA
    Rhetoric
    Teaching with Technology


==History==

ABC was founded in 1936, beginning with a modest membership of 72 members, all but one from the United States (the only exception being from Canada). The organization, based at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], was then named the “Association of College Teachers of Business Writers.” The next year, 1937, that name changed to the “American Business Writing Association.”

By the 1960s, the field had grown considerably and became heavily interested in areas well beyond business writing (such as oral presentations, negotiations, and nonverbal communication among others). In 1967, the Board of Directors voted to change the name of the organization to the “American Business Communication Association” to reflect this change.

By the late 1970s, as the membership of the organization grew to include more members from outside the Americas and as the focus of research expanded heavily into the fields of intercultural communication and cross-cultural business communication practice, the term “American” became increasingly inaccurate of both the membership and focus of the organization. In 1985, the Board of Directors voted to change the name to its current “Association for Business Communication.”

In 1990, ABC moved its headquarters from [[Illinois]] first to the [[University of North Texas]] (1990–1994) and then to [[Baruch College]] [[CUNY]] in [[New York City]] (from 1994–2007) and then to [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]] (from 2007-2011). Presently, the ABC is headquartered at [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5932">The '''Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities''' is an international statement on [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[Access to Knowledge Movement|access to knowledge]].  It emerged from a conference on open access hosted in the [[Harnack House]] in [[Berlin]] by the [[Max Planck Society]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=berlinconf /&gt;

==Background==
Following the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] in 2002 and the [[Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing]] in 2003, the Berlin Declaration was a third influential event in the establishment of the open access movement. [[Peter Suber]] has referred to the three events combined as the "BBB definition" of open access as the three overlap with and inform one another.&lt;ref name=suber&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suber|first1=Peter|title=Open Access|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|pages=7–8|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262517638_Open_Access_PDF_Version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was drafted at an October 2003 conference held by the Max Planck Society and the European Cultural Heritage Online (ECHO) project. More than 120 cultural and political organizations from around the world attended.&lt;ref name=berlinconf&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin Conferences|url=http://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Conferences|website=Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
The statement itself was published on October 22, 2003. Acknowledging the increasing importance of the internet and the previous discussions on the need for open access, it offered the following definition of an open access contribution:

&lt;div class=letterhead&gt;
Open access contributions must satisfy two conditions: The author(s) and right holder(s) of such contributions grant(s) to all users a free, irrevocable, worldwide, right of access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship (community standards, will continue to provide the mechanism for enforcement of proper attribution and responsible use of the published work, as they do now), as well as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for their personal use.

A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials, including a copy of the permission as stated above, in an appropriate standard electronic format is deposited (and thus published) in at least one online repository using suitable technical standards (such as the Open Archive definitions) that is supported and maintained by an academic institution, scholarly society, government agency, or other well-established organization that seeks to enable open access, unrestricted distribution, inter operability, and long-term archiving.
&lt;/div&gt;

It also encouraged researchers and institutions to publish their work in accordance with these principles, advocate for open access and help in the development and assessment of open access related tools and measures.&lt;ref name=berlindeclaration&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin Declaration|url=http://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration|website=Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signatories==
{{Missing information|section|signatories to the Berlin Declaration|date=April 2018}}
{{As of|April 2018}}, there are 609 signatories of the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://openaccess.mpg.de/319790/Signatories |work=Openaccess.mpg.de |title=Berlin Declaration: Signatories |accessdate= 19 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
At a 2005 follow-up conference, the declaration was refined to two key principles: signatories should require researchers to deposit a copy of their work in an [[Disciplinary repository|open access repository]] and encourage the publication of work in [[open access journal]]s when available. Today these two concepts are often called "Green OA" and "Gold OA, " respectively, and the two combined are referred to as an [[open-access mandate]].&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jacobs|editor1-first=Neil|title=Open Access: Key Strategic, Technical and Economic Aspects|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bible in the Schools''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] not-for-profit located in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], that promotes biblical literacy in  [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] and other  Tennessee public school districts.

==Mission==
The organization develops curriculum, training and financial resources for elective, for-credit courses in Bible history, using the Bible as the text, taught in a controlled curriculum by trained and certified middle and high school teachers employed by the  Hamilton County school system. The group works with other organizations with similar goals and consults with individuals, sponsorship groups and school districts across the nation.

==History==
In 1922, J. P. McCallie, founder of [[The McCallie School]] and chair of the Religious Work Committee of the Chattanooga [[YMCA]],  approached the Chattanooga City Commission to provide Bible courses adapted to the various ages from 4th grade through high school, taught by teachers selected and paid by the Bible Study Committee, and that were subject to the principals and the Board of Education in scholarship and discipline. The program was approved and later expanded into the Hamilton County schools. Today, 4,000-5,000 [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] students elect a Bible history class each year.

==Curriculum==
Five courses are offered by state-certified teachers. Classes are for-credit and considered part of the [[Social Studies]] curriculum in the high schools and the related arts curriculum in the middle schools. Doctrine is not taught. The courses are taught as [[history]] and [[literature]] so that students can have a better understanding of the [[Bible]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">'''Caroline Beaumont Zachry'''  (20 April 1894 &amp;ndash; 22 February 1945) was an [[educational psychologist]] born in New York City to James Greer Zachry and Elise Clarkson Thompson. Her maternal grandfather was [[Hugh Smith Thompson]] the [[Governor of South Carolina]] from 1882 to 1886.

==Early life==
Caroline attended the [[Spence School]] for girls from 1908 to 1914. For the next ten years she attended as well as taught at the [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] where she received a [[B.S.]] in 1924. Under the direction of [[William Heard Kilpatrick]], professor of philosophy of education, her dissertation on the personality adjustment of schoolchildren earned her a [[Ph.D]] in 1929.

== Career ==
Her interest in psychology and its message to teachers prompted her to travel to Vienna in the 1930s where she studied under the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]]. This experience influenced her intellectual development so much that, although not a psychiatrist, she became a Fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association. Her interest shifted from new methods of teaching to examining the psychological forces that determine the psychological development of schoolchildren. She was the director of Mental Hygiene Institute at the New Jersey State Teachers College (Now [[Montclair State College]]) from 1930 to 1934. From 1934 to 1939 she led the study of adolescence for the Commission on Secondary School Curriculum of the [[Progressive Education Association]]. The results of this study she published in 1940 as ''Emotion and Conduct in Adolescence''. She went on to become the director of the Institute for the Study of Personality Development which was renamed after her death to the Caroline B. Zachry Institute of Human Development. In 1942 she was appointed director of the Bureau of Child Guidance of the [[New York City Board of Education]] that lasted until her death three years later in 1945.

== Family ==
Caroline was never married but adopted two children in the 1930s, Stephen Beaumont and Nancy Greer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65898">'''Centron Corporation''' was a leading industrial and [[educational film]] production company, specializing in classroom and corporate [[16mm film]]s and [[VHS]] videocassettes. Although a slightly smaller company than its contemporaries ([[Encyclopædia Britannica Films]], [[Coronet Films]] and Learning Corporation of America), it was nonetheless very successful from the late 1940s through the early 1990s, gaining added fame with the [[Academy Award]] nominated ''[[Leo Beuerman]]'' in 1969.

==Overview==

Founded in 1947 in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] by boyhood friends Arthur H. Wolf (a veteran of another Kansas film company, Calvin Films) and Russell A. Mosser (of Boeing-Witchita), the name was chosen to incorporate the key words "central" (being that the company was located in the center of the United States) and "electronic" in honor of the "electronic age of the future".

Centron successfully competed with large companies on both coasts and was widely known for its high quality films, coming in on time and under budget. Although the company kept afloat for decades making many technical instructions, cooking and sewing demonstrations, teacher aides and safety prevention reels, it also added some [[social guidance film]]s in the 1950s to compete with Coronet Films, along with zoological and geographic topics that held stronger interest among school students.

[[Herk Harvey|Harold "Herk" Harvey]] was a principal director at Centron. His 1962 feature ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' was produced with several people associated with Centron. John Clifford, a Centron screenwriter wrote the script for ''Carnival of Souls''.

One of his most popular educational series covered the land and people "south of the border" (as the ''Middle America Regional Geography'' and ''La América del Sur'' series). Scripted by Peter Schnitzler and shot in many locations by cameraman Bob Rose, these were made under some (for that time) political difficulties. At one point, the series almost had to exclude [[Chile]] when government officials initially prevented film stock from leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Alexander, ''Academic Films for the Classroom: A History'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Centron won many awards for its films, it is most famous for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominated ''[[Leo Beuerman]]''. This simple profile of a short handicapped man with his tractor in downtown Lawrence was produced on a budget of $12,000 and eventually became one of the most popular classroom films of all time, selling an impressive 2300 prints.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Alexander, ''Academic Films...'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also during this period that the company expanded its distribution of outside productions, including a number of [[National Film Board of Canada]] titles. The 1970s was a particularly golden age for nature documentaries, especially the ''Elementary Natural Science'' series of the team of Karl and Stephen Maslowski.

In 1981, Wolf and Mosser sold Centron to the [[Coronet Films|Coronet]] division of Esquire, Inc. Production carried on, mostly in Illinois, under the Coronet banner for a few years with Bob Kohl as primary head. (The Phoenix Learning Group currently has distribution rights to the Coronet library, including many of Centron.) In 1984, the [[Gulf and Western Industries]] conglomerate took over the mother company and, in a swift move, Kohl successfully purchased Centron from Gulf and moved production back to Lawrence, Kansas. After continuing through the end of the decade (including a series of instructional films for Encyclopædia Britannica), Kohl then sold the company facilities to the [[University of Kansas]] in 1991, with the library of films added to their archive by the time the company officially folded in 1994.

The '''College of Science''' is one of the Colleges of the [[University of Baghdad]] in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].  It was the first [[scientific]] college established in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uobaghdad.edu.iq&lt;/ref&gt; The main academic activities held in this college vary between pure and applied [[science]]. Beside its eight departments, the college also holds two research units.
Being one of the earliest academic institutes formed in the [[Republic of Iraq]], the College of Science establishment marked the (Day of Science).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scbaghdad.edu.iq&lt;/ref&gt;
This [[college]] was established on March 27, 1949, with the name of (The College of Arts and Science). 
The college was established with five scientific departments, namely:  (Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Pathology and Anatomy). The Pathology and Anatomy departments were later joined together to form the (Department of Biology). Beside these, another four departments were added during the next fifty years, these are: Department of Geology (1953), Department of Computer Science (1983),  Department of Astronomy (1998) and Department of Biotechnology (1999). The eight departments cover a wide range of branches of pure and applied sciences, which attracts many students as well as scientific researchers each year. Therefore, this college is considered as the largest scientific academic institute in the Republic of Iraq.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">The '''Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking''', or CMIS, is a theoretical construct designed to predict how people will seek information.  It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including [[Library and Information Science]] and [[Health Communication]].

The CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D., &amp; Meischke, H. (1993). Cancer-related channel selection:  An extensionfor a sample of women who have had a mammogram. Women &amp; Health, 20, 31-44.; Johnson, J. D., Donohue, W. A., Atkin, C. K., &amp; Johnson, S. H. (1995). A comprehensive model of information seeking: Tests focusing on a technical organization. 
Science Communication, 16, 274-303.&lt;/ref&gt; It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, J. D., Andrews, J. E. &amp; Allard, S. (2001). A Model for Understanding and Affecting Genetics Information Seeking. Library and Information Science Research 23(4): 335-349.&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies "antecedents" that explain why people become information seekers, "information carrier characteristic" that shape how they go about looking for information, and "information seeking actions" that reflect the nature of the search itself.

==Design==

[[File:Diagram of the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking.jpg|thumb|right|The Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking]]
The CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are:  Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions.  The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information.  Those factors are:  Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs.  These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process.  The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities.  This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information.  A person’s understanding is developed through the information field.  The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field.  The final schema involves information seeking actions.  This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking.  There are three major dimensions:  the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Antecedents==
The CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D. (1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D.(1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Carrier Characteristics==

The information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Information Seeking Actions==

There are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search.  For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Stages in the CMIS==

A key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”.  According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors.

The first stage, ''Casual'', is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic.
 
The second stage is ''Purposive-Placid''. This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned.

The third stage is ''Purposive-Clustered''. Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first-degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or [[BRCA mutation|BRCA]] 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes.

The fourth stage, ''Directed'', includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4304">'''Dictogloss''' is a [[language teaching technique]] that is used to teach [[grammatical structure]]s, in which students form small groups and summarize a [[second language|target-language]] text.{{sfn|Richards|Schmidt|2009}} First, the teacher prepares a text that contains examples of the grammatical form to be studied.{{sfn|Ellis|2003|pp=156–157}} The teacher reads the text to the students at normal speed while they take notes.{{sfn|Ellis|2003|pp=156–157}} Students then work in small groups to prepare a summary of their work using the correct grammatical structures,{{sfn|Richards|Schmidt|2009}} and finally each group presents their work to the rest of the class. Dictogloss activities encourage learners to [[focus on form|focus on the form]] of their language while also being based in communication, and are used in [[task-based language teaching]].{{sfn|Ellis|2003|pp=156–157}}

Dictogloss activities have several advantages. They integrate the four language skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing.{{sfn|Wajnryb|1990}} They also give students opportunities to talk about both content and the language itself. Furthermore, dictogloss activities are a useful way of presenting new factual information to students and encourage them to listen for key points. Finally, they give support to less confident students, as they are encouraged to participate in their groups as part of the structure of the activity.{{sfn|Gibbons|2002|p=110}}

== Method ==

An example of a dictogloss is the following: learners discuss the sea; the teacher then explains the task, and reads a short text on the sea to the class, who just listen; the teacher reads the text again and the learners take notes; in groups, the learners then reconstruct the text. In this activity, learners are required to reconstruct a short text by listening and noting down key words, which are then used as a base for reconstruction.{{https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/dictogloss}}

An alternative way of conducting a dictogloss activity is to have the teacher read a short, relevant text three times. The first time, the students listen only, and do not take notes. The second time, they are allowed to note down several key words. The third time, the learners are allowed to write as much as they desire. Following this, the students are instructed to create a summary of what they have heard on their own. When this task has been completed, they take their own summaries and work with a partner to co-construct a summary based on their individual work. Following this, they join with another pair to create a group of four to collaboratively reconstruct the text.  Then, students compare their reconstruction of the work with the original to discuss similarities and differences from the source text. This activity can be used, for example, to draw attention to a particular language feature or to help develop students' abilities to synthesize information.{{sfn|Gibbons|2009|p=66}}

'''''Dinosaurs! – A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time!''''' is a short film released by [[Golden Book Video]] in 1987 under their "GoldenVision" series. It stars [[Fred Savage]] playing a grade school student named Philip who gives a class report on [[dinosaur]]s, with the help of an animated chalkboard and [[Will Vinton]]'s [[claymation]] dinosaurs. &lt;ref&gt;[http://oddballfilms.blogspot.com/2014/06/will-vintons-claymation-marvels-thur.html Oddball Films: Will Vinton's Claymation Marvels - Thur. June 12 - 8PM]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally created in 1980, when it was known more simply as '''''Dinosaur''''', the 17-minute claymation short by Vinton Studios &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/cartoons-considered-for-an-academy-award-1980/|title=Cartoons Considered For An Academy Award – 1980 -|website=cartoonresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
would later be used for this 1987 video. The popular short is also played at the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian Museum]] and has won numerous awards. This film is also played BOB's request in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut|Rocky Hill]], [[Connecticut]] at the museum in [[Dinosaur State Park]].

''Dinosaurs!'' was designed as an [[educational film]] for young children new to the world of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] life; the video slipcase describes the film with "Discover the ''real'' monsters who dominated the earth for millions of years!" The [[cartoon animation]] of the chalkboard is used to elaborate on attributes such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs]] as well as their brain capacity, while the Vinton claymation illustrates, in a colorful and simplistic manner, the brutal lives of the many dinosaurs. The movie also introduces a [[music video]] for the song "[[Mesozoic]] Mind" by Charmer, featuring cartoon dinosaurs performing it.

==Plot==
The video&amp;mdash;with beginning scenes filmed in 1987&amp;mdash;begins with a young boy named Phillip (played by Fred Savage) sitting in his bedroom, listening to [[loud music]], and struggling to find an idea for a class report on a science topic. While struggling to find some ideas, and irking his mother (who threatens to get his father if he does not turn off the music and go to bed) with his loud music, he plays a song on his [[boom box]] (titled Mesozoic Mind). And the song provides him with an inspiration for his report: DINOSAURS!

Philip then goes to sleep and has a dream where he discovers that the search for the truth about these magnificent animals and their astonishing 160-million-year success on earth is probably the most fascinating speculation there is. Phillip then finishes his report and presents it to the class. The class report is then covered through the 1980 claymation short '''''Dinosaur''''' by Will Vinton Productions. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dinosaur_20170530 ''Dinosaur'' on Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''edcamp''' is a participant-driven conference - commonly referred to as an "[[unconference]]". Edcamps are designed to provide participant-driven professional development for K-12 educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edcampfoundation.org/|title=Vision and mission|date=The edcamp foundation|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edcamps are modeled after [[BarCamp]]s, free participant-driven conferences with a primary focus on technology and computers.  Educational technology is a common topic area for edcamps, as are pedagogy, practical examples in instructional use of modern tools, and solving the problems technology can introduce into the classroom environment.  

Edcamps are generally free or very low-cost, built around ''[[ad hoc]]'' community participation. Sessions are not planned until the day of the event, when participants can volunteer to facilitate a conversation on a topic of their choice or simply choose an idea they are interested in learning more about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/about-edcamp-unconference-history|title=Introduction to Edcamp: A New Conference Model Built on Collaboration|date=September 29, 2010|publisher=Edutopia|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edcamps operate "without keynote speakers or vendor booths, encourage participants to find or lead a conversation that meet their needs and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-08-07/community/hc-simsbury-ed-camp-20120806_1_educators-ethel-walker-participants|title=Ethel Walker To Host 'EdCamp' Conference Friday|date=August 7, 2012|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edcamp was held in May 2010 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcampphilly.org|title=Edcamp Philly Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, there have been over [http://edcamp.wikispaces.com/complete+edcamp+calendar 1,000 edcamp events] held throughout the world. The [http://www.edcamp.org Edcamp Foundation] was formed in December 2011 to help teachers and other stakeholders who organize edcamps. The vision of the Edcamp Foundation is to "promote organic, participant-driven professional development for K-12 educators worldwide." The Edcamp Foundation is still located in Conshohocken, PA. The Foundation has implemented a variety of programs to help participants and organizers get the most out of edcamps like Impact Grants, Edcamp-In-A-Box, and the Urban Initiative. 

The first edcamps that were held in languages other than English were '''edcamp Stockholm''' on October 31, 2011 (in Swedish) and [http://edcamp.wikispaces.com/edcamp+Montréal edcamp Montreal] on November 1, 2011 (in French). There has also been International edcamps in Spain, China, Indonesia, Canada, and more.

The '''education in the Flemish Community''' covers the Dutch-speaking part of [[Belgium]] and consists of three networks (''netten''): government-provided education (''gemeenschapsonderwijs''), subsidized public schools (by provinces and municipalities) and subsidized free schools (mainly affiliated to the Catholic church).

== Generally ==
{{main|Education in Belgium}}
In the past there were conflicts between state schools and Catholic schools (''de [[School struggle (disambiguation)|schoolstrijd]]''), and disputes regarding whether the Catholic schools' should be funded by the government. The 1958 School Pact was an agreement by the three large political parties (the [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Democratic]], [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialist]] and [[Party for Freedom and Progress|Liberal]] parties) to end these conflicts.

Due to the [[State reform in Belgium|federalization of Belgium]], education is organised by the three communities since 1989. Since then, the [[Flemish Government]] organises education in the [[Flemish Region]] as well as in the bilingual [[Brussels-Capital Region]] where the [[Government of the French Community]] is also responsible. The Flemish Community organises the Dutch-language education but has to provide French-language schools in the 12 [[municipalities with language facilities]] within the Flemish Region.

The federal level only regulates a few general matters: the start and end of [[compulsory education]] (which is between the ages of 6 and 18), the minimal conditions for issuing diplomas, and the pension scheme. Article 24 of the [[Belgian Constitution]] furthermore guarantees free education, the right of parents to choose their school and the (philosophical, ideological and religious) neutrality of government-provided schools. These state schools have to provide the choice between the teaching of one of the recognized [[Religion in Belgium|religions]] and non-[[Religious denomination|denominational]] moral teaching.

Education is organised through three networks.

First, there are [[state school]]s directly provided by the [[Flemish government]], which is called ''Gemeenschapsonderwijs'' (literally "community education"), stylised as "GO!", education of the [[Flemish Community]]. They are both primary and secondary schools as well as adult education centres. Most secondary schools are commonly named ''(Koninklijk) Atheneum'' ("(Royal) Atheneum"), most of which were built in the 1960s during the ''[[Second School War|schoolstrijd]]'' ("school struggle") in Belgium. One of the oldest athenea is the Royal Atheneum of [[Antwerp]], which exists since 1808.

Secondly, there are subsidized public schools (''officieel gesubsidieerd onderwijs''), which are public schools organized by [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] and [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]]. Those provided by the municipalities are coordinated through the Education Secretariat of the Cities and Municipalities of the Flemish Community (''Onderwijssecretariaat van de Steden en Gemeenten van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap''; OVSG). This network also includes a few schools organised by the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (VGC) in Brussels.

Lastly, there are subsidized free schools (''vrij gesubsidieerd onderwijs''), which is with about 70% of the pupils by far the largest group. They are mainly organized by an organization affiliated to the [[Catholic Church]], organised by Catholic Education Flanders (''Katholiek Onderwijs Vlaanderen''), formerly known as the Flemish Secretariat of the Catholic Education (''Vlaams Secretariaat van het Katholiek Onderwijs''; VSKO). Only eight schools are affiliated to the [[Protestant Church]], so-called "Schools with the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipco.be/ IPCO, Onderwijskoepel van de Scholen met de Bijbel in Vlaanderen en Brussel]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-denominational free schools, "method schools" using e.g. the [[Waldorf education|Steiner]], [[Freinet education|Freinet]] or [[Montessori education]] method.

[[Homeschooling]] is also legal since "learning" is mandatory in Belgium as opposed to attending school. Homeschooling is very rare, but the numbers are rising slowly. For the year 2007—2008 the number of home-schooled children in Flanders rose to 279 in basic education and 504 in secondary education, out of a total of 1.3 million.

==Levels==
[[File:Flemish Education System-en.svg|thumb|300px|The different levels of education in Flanders]]

===Basic education===
Basic education (''basisonderwijs'') consists of optional [[Preschool education|pre-school]] (''kleuteronderwijs'') and six years of mandatory [[primary education]] (''lager onderwijs''). The mandatory education starts on 1 September of the year in which the child has its sixth birthday.

===Secondary education===
Secondary education (''secundair onderwijs'') also consists of six years starting from the age of 12.
Secondary school is divided into four general types. Each type consists of a set of different directions that may vary from school to school. The general types are as follows:
* General Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Algemeen Secundair Onderwijs}}; ASO. About 40% of all pupils&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Education in Flanders - A broad view of the Flemish educational landscape |url = http://ebl.vlaanderen.be/publications/documents/24173 |publisher = Ministry of the Flemish community |year = 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;): A very broad, general education, preparing for higher education.
* Technical Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Technisch Secundair Onderwijs}}; TSO. About 30% of all pupils): The TSO is divided into two groups of education again: TTK and STK. The TTK courses focus more on technical aspects, the STK courses focus more on practical matters.
* Vocational Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Beroepssecundair Onderwijs}}; BSO. About 30% of all pupils): Very practical and very job-specific education. Afterwards, several directions offer seventh, sometimes eighth, specialisation years.
* Art Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Kunstsecundair onderwijs}}; KSO. About 2% of all pupils): These schools link general and broad secondary education development with active art practice, ranging from performance arts to display arts.
Students with disabilities can follow Special Secondary Education ({{lang-nl|Buitengewoon Secundair Onderwijs}}; BuSO), of different types.

===Higher education===
{{See also|List of universities in Belgium}}
There are five universities in the Flemish Community, each forming an "association" with one or more [[university college]]s (''hogescholen'').
* The [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] (KU Leuven) is the largest university and the oldest in the [[Low Countries]]. As of 2014, it had 46,385 enrolled students, or 20% of all students in Flemish higher education.&lt;ref name="edustats2014"&gt;[http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/werken/studentadmin/studentengegevens/HOIC_2014.pdf Hoger onderwijs in cijfers, 2014-2015], Flemish Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the [[KU Leuven Association]] together with various university colleges located throughout Flanders.
* [[Ghent University]] (UGent) is a public university which was known as ''Rijksuniversiteit Gent'' (State University of Ghent) until being granted autonomy in 1991. The Ghent University Association further includes [[Hogeschool Gent]], which is the largest university college of Flanders, Arteveldehogeschool and [[Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen]].
* The [[University of Antwerp]] forms the [[Antwerp University Association]] together with Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen, Karel de Grote-Hogeschool and the [[Antwerp Maritime Academy]].
* The [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel|Free University of Brussels]] (VUB) forms the Brussels University Association with the [[Erasmushogeschool Brussel]].
* The [[University of Hasselt]] forms the Limburg University Association together with the larger Hogeschool PXL.

The former [[Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel|Catholic University of Brussels]] (K.U. Brussel) merged into the Catholic University of Leuven.

Many universities and university colleges are historically tied to their respective "[[Pillarisation|pillars]]" in society, KU Leuven being the prominent Catholic university, Ghent University being tied to the socialist pillar and the Free University of Brussels representing the liberal pillar.

Certain universities have agreements which give students the option of following certain courses in the French-speaking counterpart:
* [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] - [[Université catholique de Louvain]]
&lt;!--* [[Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel]] - [[Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis]]--&gt;
* [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] - [[Université libre de Bruxelles]]

As part of the [[Bologna Process]], the Flemish government set up in cooperation with the Dutch government an [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders]] (NVAO).

As of 2014, 227,943 students were enrolled in Flemish higher education.&lt;ref name="edustats2014" /&gt;

==Quality==
Education in Belgium, particularly in Flanders, is often considered to be of high quality.

In the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS), Flanders is among the top countries. In mathematics for example, Flemish eighth-grade students were the 5th–6th best performing in 1995–2003 (Flanders is not included in the study for 2007).

===Foreign students===
Relatively many students of neighbouring countries, especially from the [[Netherlands]], attend Flemish schools.

In primary and secondary education, this is some 5,950 students as of 2011 (25,200 if families from neighbouring countries but actually living in Flanders are included too), a rising number. On the other hand, a decreasing 1,422 Flemish students attend schools in neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-va.be/nieuws/persberichten/meer-leerlingen-uit-onze-buurlanden-kiezen-voor-vlaams-onderwijs Meer leerlingen uit onze buurlanden kiezen voor Vlaams onderwijs], 7 June 2012, N-VA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
===Medium of instruction===
[[File:Huldenberg_taal.jpg|thumb|A poster at a school in [[Huldenberg]] saying: "In the interest of your child, we speak Dutch here! You do too?"]]
The language used as [[medium of instruction]] in schools subsidized by the Flemish government is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Flemish schools in Brussels provide Dutch-medium education, whereas French-medium education there is provided by or recognised by the [[Government of the French Community]]. The Flemish Government is however required to provide French-medium schools in the twelve [[municipalities with language facilities]] if there is demand for it.

Contrary to French-speaking Belgium and other European countries, [[bilingual education]] is still rare in Flanders.

In higher education, the use of English is allowed but restricted.

===Foreign languages===
All Dutch-speaking schools teach French as first foreign language, English being the second foreign language. German and Spanish are often also available depending on the school direction.

Compared to other European countries, Flemish pupils aged 13–15 score remarkably well for their knowledge of English, which is taught as a second foreign language, although less so for French, which is the first foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20120621_00194223 Vlaamse tieners sterk in Engels, niet in Frans], 22 June 2012, De Standaard&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olyfran]] is a popular contest organised to test students' knowledge of the French language.

==Brussels==
In Brussels, the Dutch-speaking school system functions separately from the French-language education system. For the Flemish schools in Brussels, The "Scholengroep Brussels" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholengroepbrussel.be/en-us/home.aspx Scholengroep Brussel]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as the organising body for most of the "state schools" ("GO!" education), while the [[Flemish Community Commission]] is the organising body for the Dutch-speaking Brussels schools that until 1995 belonged to the [[province of Brabant]].

In February 2012, the Dutch-speaking schools in the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]] counted 11,776 in pre-school education, 14,850 pupils in primary education and 12,535 in secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vgc.be/Onderwijs/Onderwijsbeleid+van+de+VGC/Over+het+Brussels+Nederlandstalig+onderwijs/feb12.htm Over het Brussels Nederlandstalig onderwijs: Leerlingentelling op 1 februari 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers have been growing considerably since several decades.

Some of the students speak Dutch at home, others French, but about half of those attending Dutch-speaking schools in Brussels use another language at home.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in [[Nigeria]]''' have had various challenges in order to obtain equal [[education]] in all forms of formal [[education in Nigeria]]. Education is a basic [[human right]] and has been recognized as such since the 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]. A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and the [[gross national product]] and increase of life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,contentMDK:23004468~pagePK:64167689~piPK:64167673~theSitePK:7778063,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this correlation, enrollment in schools represents the largest component of the investment in human capital in any society.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, T.P. (2002). "Why Governments should Invest More to Educate Girls" World Development, Vol. 30 No.2 Pp 207 - 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid socio-economic development of a nation has been observed to depend on the calibre of [[Women's education and development|women and their education]] in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha (2003) "Women's Education: A Global Challenge" Sign:: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 2003, vol. 29, no. 2 Pp 325 - 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Education bestows on women a disposition for a lifelong acquisition of knowledge, values, attitudes, competence and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Aliu, S, (2001). "The Competitive Drive, New Technologies and Employment: The Human Capital Link". A Paper presented at the Second Tripartite Conference of Manpower Planners. Chelsea Hotel, Abuja.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure equal access to education, the National Policy on Education states that access to education is a right for all Nigerian children regardless of gender, religion and disability.&lt;ref name="akinp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Funmilola |first=Akinpelu |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |title='Dr' Girl-Child Education: A Reality or a Mirage among Females with Hearing Impairment in Nigeria |url=http://bbi.syr.edu/_assets/staff_bio_publications/Akinpelu_Dr_Girl_Child_Education_2007.pdf |journal=The International Journal of the Humanities |publisher= |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages= |doi= |access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1920, primary and secondary education in Nigeria was within the scope of voluntary Christian organizations. Out of a total of 25 secondary schools established by 1920, three were girls only and the remainder were exclusively for boys.&lt;ref name="oguns"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogunyemi |first=Adetunji |last2= |first2= |date=2015|title=A Historical Reconstruction of the Colonial Government’s Education Expenditure in Nigeria and the Place of the Girl-Child, 1940-1957|url= http://www.iiste.org/Journals/index.php/HRL/article/view/27550|journal=Historical Research Letter |publisher= |volume=27 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the colonial government started giving out subvention to voluntary associations involved in education, the grant giving lasted till the early 1950s and at that point, education was placed under the control of regions. In 1949, only eight out of a total of 57 [[secondary schools]] were exclusively for girls. These schools are [[Methodist Girls' High School]], Lagos (1879), St Anne’s School, Molete, Ibadan (1896), St. Theresa’s College, Ibadan (1932), [[Queen's College, Lagos|Queens College]], Lagos, (1927) Holy Rosary College, Enugu (1935), Anglican Girls Grammar School, Lagos, (1945), Queen Amina College and Alhuda College, Kano. From 1950 up till 1960, six more notable schools were established and by 1960, there were fourteen notable girl's schools, ten mixed and sixty one boys only.&lt;ref name="oguns"/&gt;

; 1960s : In the 1960s, when most African states began to gain their political independence, there was considerable gender disparity in education.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, J. and Graddol, D. (1988) 'Gender equalities in the classroom talk'. English Education 22/1:48-65&lt;/ref&gt; Girls' enrollment figures were very low throughout the continent. In May 1961, the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UNESCO’s educational plans for Nigeria were announced in a conference held in [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]]. A target was set: to achieve 100% universal primary education in Nigeria by the year 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Conference of African States on the Development of Education in Africa Addis Ababa, 15–25 May 1961 unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000774/077416e.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1970s : The implementation in the 1970s of the free and compulsory [[Universal Primary Education]] (UPE) was in line with this UN Plan.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. Gender and education for all: the leap for equality. Global monitoring report 2003/2004. http:// WWW.UNESCO/oc.UNESCO.org/education/eta-report/2003- PDF/chapter3.PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, UNICEF and UNESCO and many other organizations have sponsored, research and conferences within Nigeria regarding the education of girls. Up until the 1970s, considerably more boys than girls participated in education in Nigeria. According to one Nigerian Historian Kitetu, the native traditions' philosophy was that a woman’s place is at home and this kept many girls away from education. However, with the government’s intervention and public awakening, parents began to send and keep their girl children in school.&lt;ref name="Kitetu"/&gt; Consequently, women’s involvement became more visible.
; 1990s : It can be noted that purposeful plans of action led to an increase in females in schools after 1990. While more boys than girls were enrolled in 1991, a difference of 138,000, by 1998 the difference was only 69,400.&lt;ref name="Kitetu"/&gt; At the pan-African Conference held at [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso, in March and April 1993 (three decades after the UN Declaration of the 1960s) it was observed that Nigeria was still lagging behind other regions of the world in female access to education.&lt;ref name="Kitetu"&gt;Kitetu, C (2001). ‘Gender in education: an overview of developing trends in Africa’. CRILE Working paper, Egerton University, Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. "The Education of Girls: The Ouagadougou Declaration and Framework for Action" Pan Africa Conference on the Education for Girls. http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/pdf/OUAGAD_E.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted that [[gender disparity]] existed in education and that there was need to identify and eliminate all policies that hindered girls’ full participation in education.&lt;ref name="Obasi, E. 1997"&gt;Obasi, E. (1997) 'Structural adjustment and gender access to education in Nigeria'. Gender and Education, 19 161-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender disparity in schools==
[[File:Pupils at a public elementary school in Kwara State.jpg|thumb|left|Nigerian classroom]]
[[File:Female literacy rate in Nigeria by state in 2013.svg|thumb|description=Female literacy rate in Nigeria by state in 2013&lt;br&gt;{{legend|#0e1f85|&gt; 90%}} {{legend|#5ba6f3|80-90%}} {{legend|#115a24|70-80%}} {{legend|#1e983e|60-70%}} {{legend|#24e556|50-60%}} {{legend|#e3e524|35-50%}} {{legend|#e02222|&lt; 35%}}]]

From 1970 to 1994, the enrollment of girls in primary education steadily increased from 30% to as high as 80%.&lt;ref&gt;Aromolaran, Adebayo B., Female Schooling, Non-Market Productivity, and Labor Market Participation in Nigeria (January 2004). Yale University Economic Growth Center Discussion Paper No. 879. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=493763&lt;/ref&gt; However, differences exist between enrollment of males and females in all levels of education. In addition, the drop out rate of girls is higher than boys and participation in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] classes are lower for girls than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Ogunjuyigbe, P.O., Ojofeitimi, E.O. &amp; Akinlo, A. J Sci Educ Technol (2006) 15: 277. Science Education in Nigeria: An Examination of People’s Perceptions about Female Participation in Science, Mathematics and Technology. doi:10.1007/s10956-006-9014-6&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the combined gross enrollment for primary, secondary and tertiary schools for female was 57% compared to 71% for males.&lt;ref name="ojo"&gt;Ojo, A. (2002). "Socio-Economic Situation", in Africa Atlases (Nigeria), Paris-France, Les Editions J.A., Pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; This translates into fewer women in certain economic fields as well. The percentages of female workers in some selected professions were as follow: architects, 2.4%, quantity surveyors, 3.5%, lawyers/jurists, 25.4%, lecturers, 11.8%, obstetricians and gynecologists, 8.4%, pediatricians, 33.3%, media practitioners{{clarify|date=May 2012}}, 18.3%.&lt;ref name="ojo"/&gt;

Issues of gender equality in education have been the subject of much debate during the past decades and have become a prominent topic of debate in all countries. In Nigeria, there are large disparities between the education that boys and girls receive. Many girls do not have access to adequate education past a certain age. Currently, the female adult [[literacy]] rate (ages 15 and above) for the country was 59.4% in comparison to the male adult literacy rate of 74.4%. It is differences in education that have led to this gap in literacy.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank report. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Central Bank of Nigeria the gender gap in literacy rates at the rural level between boys and girls was 18.3 percent in favour of the boys overall. However, in the age group 6–9 years (primary school ages) it was only 3.9 percent in favour of boys.&lt;ref&gt;CBN (2000). Annual Report and Statement of Accounts 31 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that there is a gender dimension to educational attainment and development in Nigeria. According to the Examination Council of Nigeria (1994) there are still other problems, such as high drop-out rates of females students, poor performance, reluctance on the part of females students to enroll in science-based courses and poor classroom participation&lt;ref&gt;Examination Council of Kenya. (1994) Government printers.&lt;/ref&gt; Across various geo-political delineations in Nigeria, a greater percentage of school-age girls are needlessly out-of-school, compared with the ratio applicable to boys of same age grouping.&lt;ref name="Isaac"&gt;Adeniran, Adebusuyi Isaac.(2007) "Educational Inequalities and Women's Disempowerment in Nigeria" Department of Sociology, University of Lagos, Nigeria&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender disparity is also visible in the education of children with disabilities, a study in the 1990s revealed that only 37% of disabled females are literate compared to 57% for males. A reason for this situation is the cultural notion that the male will carry the family name while the female will marry. Also the option of street begging by young disabled girls in order to earn income can inhibit their attendance of classes.&lt;ref name="akinp"/&gt;

The completion of the second [[Millennium Development Goal]]’s (MDG) target i.e. ‘education for all’ by 2015 is at risk after having missed the initial deadline of 2005. In Nigeria, educational facilities are generally believed to be inadequate and access is limited for many, especially girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;Uku, P. (1992). "Women and Political Parties" in Chizea and Njoku (eds.) Nigerian Women and the Challenges of Our Time, Lagos, Malthouse Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the United Nations Human Development Report (2005), Nigeria was classified as a low development country in respect of equality in educational accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP (2005). Human Development Report, New York, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons behind the disparity==
There are various cultural and socioeconomic issues that prevent women from having adequate access to education.

===Culture, values and tradition===
Various cultural and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view is that it is better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school.&lt;ref&gt;Denga, D.I. (1993). Education at a glance: From cradle to tomb. Calabar: Rapid Educational Publishers Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list.&lt;ref name="Obasi, E. 1997"/&gt; The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place is believed to be the kitchen. A study by the [[University of Ibadan]] linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in [[patriarchy|male superiority]] and [[submission|female subordination]].&lt;ref&gt;Uwakwe Charles, Ajibola Falaye, Benedict Emunemu and Omobola Adelore (2008). "Impact of decentralization and Privatization on the Quality of Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Nigerian Experience." European Journal of Social Sciences, Volume 7, Number 1. University of Ibadan, Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation was further aggravated by [[patriarchal]] practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.

The Nigerian society (both historical and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural practices that are potently hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices.&lt;ref&gt;Nmadu, T. (2000). "On Our Feet: Women in Grassroot Development", in Journal of Women in Academics, Vol. 1 No 1, Sept. 2000, JOWACS Pp. 165-171.&lt;/ref&gt; As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, D. (1991). Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, New York,Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.

===Cost of education===
The decline in economic activities since the early 1980s has made education a luxury to many Nigerians, especially those in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt; Because Nigerian parents are known to invest in children according to sex, birth order or natural endowments, girls and boys are not exact substitutes.&lt;ref name= "Isaac"/&gt; Often the family can only afford to send one child to school. Because daughters have assumed responsibilities in the home, she is less likely to be the one to attend school.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt;

===Colonial policies===
At the beginning of [[colonialism]] and Christianity, rigid ideals about gender perceptions were imposed on the African mind.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;Hammond, D. and Jablow, A. (1992). The Africa that Never was, Prospect Heights. Woveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the woman’s role has come to be limited to sexual and commercial labour; satisfying the sexual needs of men, working in the fields, carrying loads, tending babies and preparing food.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt; The disempowering colonial ‘ideology of domesticity’ as espoused by the practice of ‘housewification’ provided the springboard for women’s educational imbalance in parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Gaidzwanwa, R. (1992). "Bourgeois Theories of Gender and Feminism and their Shortcomings with Reference to Southern African Countries", in Meena, R. (ed.) Gender in Southern Africa: Conceptual and Theoretical Issues, Harare, Sape Books.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the overall human development in Nigeria is being hindered by this unevenness in educational accessibility across gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullahi, G.L. (2000). "The Crisis of Democratization: Women’s Vision of the Way Forward", in Journal of Women in Academics, Vol. 1 No. 1, Sept 2000, Pp. 183-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
While most of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] face a deadline of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals.&lt;ref name="Goal"&gt;"UNICEF - Goal: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women." UNICEF - UNICEF Home. Web. http://www.unicef.org/mdg/gender.html&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, it will be impossible to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name="Goal"/&gt; Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths.&lt;ref name="ungei.org"&gt;UNESCO. (2008) “Education for All by 2015: Will we make it?” Global Monitoring Report. New York,NY UNESCO/SS/1. UNESDOC database: http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/154743e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, Saranga and Kathleen Kurz (2006). ICRW research on prevalence and predictors of child marriage in developing countries.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths.&lt;ref name="children"&gt;UNICEF - State of the Worlds Children (2004) www.unicef.org/sowc04/files/Chapter2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.&lt;ref name="children"/&gt;

Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made on the grounds that literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kutner, Elizabeth Greenberg, Ying Jin, Bridget Boyle, Yung-chen Hsu, Eric Dunleavy. (2003) "Literacy in Everyday Life: Results from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy" National Center for Education Statistics. http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2007480&lt;/ref&gt; If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2004) "the Plurality of Literacy and its Implications for Policies and Programs" UNESCO Education Sector Position Paper. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, it puts a strain on the whole community as education is one of the keys to success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination.&lt;ref name="ojo"/&gt; The most important ingredient of employment opportunity is education, especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. "For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition," says Dr. Robert Limlim, UNICEF’s Deputy Representative. "Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner."&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Press Release 2008. www.ungei.org/news/files/Press_release_-_NGEI_Launch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current policies of progression==
Currently Nigerian women are making many advancements within their society. In recent years, three male dominated professions, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Nigerian Bar Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, have been led by female presidents.&lt;ref name="WED"&gt;Anugwom, Edlyne E. (2009) "Women, education and work in Nigeria" Department of Sociology/Anthropology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent creation of the National Commission for Women and a ministerial portfolio for Women Affairs provide additional avenues for the promotion of women's educational issues and the enhancement of the role of women in national development by way of a statutory body and a Ministry.&lt;ref name="WED"/&gt; Today, more children go to school and learn to read and write than in previous decades. As a result, younger persons are much more likely to be literate than older persons. In a survey done by the International Education Statistics measured Nigerian literacy across different 5-year age groups. Among persons aged 15 to 19 years - those who were of primary school age in the 1990s - the literacy rate is 70%. Among persons 80 years or older, only 13% are literate. Additionally, the gap between boys and girls aged 15 to 19 is only 11%.&lt;ref&gt;Huebler, Friedrich (2008) "Adult Literacy in Nigeria" International Education Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerian women’s access to formal education is still being constrained due to their unfair workload within the household division of labour. Consequently, the realization of the MDG3’s ‘gender equality and women empowerment’ targets is being impeded harshly.&lt;ref&gt;Opaluwah, A.B. (2007). "Nigerian Women and Challenge of MDGs", Daily Independent,
Monday, March 12, 2007, Pp. B5.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Bhavani, such unequal social and gender relations needs to be transformed in order to take women out of want and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Bhavani, K.K., Foran J., and Kurian, P. (2003). Feminist Futures – Re-Imaging Women, Culture and Development, London, Zed Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2007 UNESCO and UNICEF report addressed the issue of education from a rights-based approach. Three interrelated rights were specified and must be addressed in concert in order to provide education for all:&lt;ref name="education"&gt;UNESCO (2007) "A Human Rights-Based Approach to Education for All" United Nations Children’s Fund; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization www.unicef.org/publications/files/A_Human_Rights_Based_Approach_to_Education_for_All.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right of access to education - Education must be available for, accessible to and inclusive of all children weather male or female gender.
* The right to quality education - Education needs to be child-centered, relevant and embrace a broad curriculum, and be appropriately resourced and monitored.
* The right to respect within the learning environment - Education must be provided in a way that is consistent with human rights, equal respect for culture, religion and language and free from all forms of violence.

UNESCO estimates that an estimated $11 billion per year is necessary to reach the 2015 EFA goals.&lt;ref name="education"/&gt; The disparity between need and aid is apparent: aid sent to low-income countries to provide basic education in 2004 and 2005 was at an average of $3.1 billion per year. The Fast Track Initiative (FTI) provides one of the most promising paths to universal primary education by 2015.&lt;ref name="ungei.org"/&gt; Set up as a partnership between donors and developing countries and non-governmental organizations, the FTI endorses developing countries that put primary education at the forefront of their domestic efforts and develop sound national education plans. Nigeria is already maximizing these resources for the advancement of the younger generation.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from discrimination and equality under the law.&lt;ref name="Goal"/&gt; CEDAW has realized the rights and equality of woman is also the key to the survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training.&lt;ref&gt;"CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. Web. &lt;http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning.

'''Framhaldsskólinn í Vestmannaeyjum''', the comprehensive secondary school of [[Vestmannaeyjar]], [[Iceland]], was founded 1979 when the mechanical engineering, common trades (is. ''iðnskóli'') and the higher education department of the secondary school merged into one.

Then in 1997, it also took over the school of maritime navigation. 

Currently there are seven departments in the school: [[Natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], [[linguistics]], job training (for the disabled), medical aide training, [[electrical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

The school is also currently used as the teaching facility for the Vestmannaeyjar department of the [[University of Iceland]] and has hosted many remote lectures, to [[Ísafjörður]] and [[Bíldudalur]] as well as a few other countries.

==Plot==
The first film in this award-winning trilogy ventures into the rural heart of Rwanda. Follow the first steps in one of the world’s boldest experiments in reconciliation: the Gacaca (Ga-CHA-cha) Tribunals. These are a new form of citizen-based justice aimed at unifying this country of 8 million people after the 1994 genocide which claimed over 800,000 lives in 100 days. While world attention is focused on the unfolding procedures, award-winning documentarian Anne Aghion bypasses the usual interviews with politicians and international aid workers, skips the statistics, and goes directly to the emotional core of the story, talking one-on-one with survivors and accused killers alike. In this powerful, compassionate and insightful film, with almost no narration, and using only original footage, she captures first-hand how ordinary people struggle to find a future after cataclysm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26795">The '''Harkness Fellowships''' (previously known as the '''Commonwealth Fund Fellowships''') are a programme run by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] of New York City.  They were established to reciprocate the [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"/&gt; and enable Fellows from several countries to spend time studying in the United States. The many notable alumni listed below include the president of the [[International Court of Justice]]; former Chairman and CEO of [[Salomon Brothers]]; a former Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Cambridge]]; the controller of [[BBC Radio 4]]; the editor of the ''[[Sunday Times]]''; former directors of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[General Medical Council]]; and, a vice-president of [[Microsoft]].

== History ==
The [[Commonwealth Fund]] is a [[Philanthropy|philanthropic foundation]] established in the [[United States]] by [[Anna Harkness]] in 1918. Her son, [[Edward Stephen Harkness]], initiated the '''Commonwealth Fund Fellowships''' in 1925.  These were intended to reciprocate the [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s by enabling British graduates to study in the United States. In 1927 the scheme was widened by the creation of '''Dominion Fellowships''' available to graduates from universities in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. In 1929 a further category of '''Dominion Civil Service Fellowships''' was established. The awards were tenable from nine to fifteen months and candidates were to be under the age of 40.

In 1961 the Fellowships were renamed the '''Harkness Fellowships'''. In addition to the Civil Service Fellowships, a new category of General Fellowships was set up, open to people in the fields of business, banking, politics, creative arts and journalism. The maximum tenure period was extended to 21 months.

Since June 1997, the activities of the Harkness Fellowships have been limited to the field of health care. The Fellowships are now considered one of the most prestigious award programs in health policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/stis1995/nsf93147/ns93147a.txt |format=TXT |publisher=Nsf.gov |accessdate=2015-08-15 |title=A Selected List of Fellowship and Other support Opportunities for Advanced Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accept Fellows from [[Australia]], [[Canada]] (known as '''Harkness Associates'''), [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] (as of 2009), [[Switzerland]] (as of 2009) and the [[United Kingdom]]. They are tenable for twelve months.

==Current Fellowship programme ==
Harkness Fellows in Health Care Policy &amp; Practice spend a year conducting research at American institutions such as [[Harvard University]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Columbia University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Kaiser Permanente]], or the [[Veterans Health Administration]].  They gain an in-depth understanding of the U.S. health care system and policy challenges, enhance their research skills, and develop contacts and opportunities for ongoing international collaboration.

In addition, Fellows attend a programme of seminars during the year:
*September: Orientation and [[Qualitative Research]] Methodology Workshop
*November: International Symposium on [[Healthcare]] Policy, bringing together Health Ministers from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States
*February: Washington Policy Briefing held on [[Capitol Hill]] with members of the [[United States Congress]] and senior government officials
*May: Canadian Policy Briefing on Federal and provincial health
*June: Final Reporting Seminar and the AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting

== Administration and funding ==
The programme is funded and administered by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] of [[New York City]], with additional support for some Fellows coming from external bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/fellowships/fellowships_show.htm?doc_id=479887|title=Page Not Found|work=commonwealthfund.org|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely:

The '''Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences''' ('''IPM'''; {{lang-fa|پژوهشگاه دانشهای بنیادی}}), previously '''Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics''', is an advanced public research institute in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. IPM is directed by [[Mohammad Javad Larijani]], its original founder. The institute was the first Iranian organization to connect to the [[Internet]]. It is the [[domain name registry]] of [[.ir]] domain names.

The Institute’s activities are directed along several routes:
* The Institute conducts research along the lines that led to its inception, both independently and in cooperation with other research institutes inside the country and abroad.
* The Institute carries out conferences as well as joint research projects, and exchanges researchers to establish links with other research institutes and scientific communities within and outside Iran.
* The Institute provides facilities as well as financial support and opportunity for sabbaticals for researchers belonging to other institutes and universities.
* The Institute tries to provide the atmosphere necessary for attracting Iranian researchers and scientists from around the world.
* The Institute conducts graduate study programs to train researchers in areas where the Institute is interested to increase the number of manpower.
* The Institute publicizes its scientific findings of IPM through books, journals, and scientific gatherings.
* The Institute provides scientific and cultural services that fit within the framework of its activities.
* The Institute seeks to recognize the basic needs of the country in fundamental sciences.
* The Institute has established an electronic network in order to connect all scientific and research centers and to develop the corresponding technologies in Iran.

The pillars of the Institute are its Board of Governors, the Director of the Institute, and the Institute’s Scientific Council. The institute has four main campuses, all north of Tehran in the [[Farmanieh]] district, immediately south of [[Niavaran]]. It offers advanced PhD degrees in areas such as [[Mathematical Logic]] and [[Plasma Physics]] among others. At present the Institute comprises nine schools:

* School of Astronomy
* School of Biological Sciences
* School of Cognitive Sciences
* School of Computer Science
* School of Mathematics
* School of Nano Science
* School of Particles and Accelerators
* School of Philosophy
* School of Physics

'''Interns Anonymous''' was a British based [[advocacy group|campaign]] and internet forum.

== History ==
Interns Anonymous was set up in March 2009 by two [[graduation|graduates]] who were both working as unpaid [[internship|interns]]. Their initial aim was to create an [[internet forum]] where interns could share their experience anonymously. The organisation evolved to campaign against unpaid internships. It has represented the interests of interns before the [[Low Pay Commission]], the [[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]], the [[European Youth Parliament]] and the [[Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internsanonymous.co.uk/about-us/|title=internsanonymous.co.uk|website=internsanonymous.co.uk|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8518617.stm|title=Interns angry at being 'exploited'|date=16 February 2010|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=13 October 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 a farewell post by founders Alex Try and Rosy Rickett formally closed the Interns Anonymous blog. It commended others who have taken up the baton such as [[Intern Aware]], Graduate Fog and individuals such as Mark Watson and Joe Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internsanonymous.co.uk/ | title=It’s been fun | publisher=[[WordPress.com]] | work=Interns Anonymous | date=September 28, 2013 | accessdate=| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230131123/http://internsanonymous.co.uk/ | archivedate= December 30, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guardian Article and British Library Web Archiving Programme ==
In November 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper reported that Interns Anonymous uncovered internal guidance that revealed that the [[Department of Business, Innovation and Skills]] had been warned by their own lawyers that the majority of unpaid interns were 'workers' according to the [[National Minimum Wage Act]] and therefore due the National Minimum Wage. As a consequence of their increased profile, the [[British Library]] added Interns Anonymous's website to the [[British Library]] Web Archiving programme as part of their project to ‘represent aspects of UK documentary heritage’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/04/interns-work-paid-lawyers|title=Interns work – and should be paid, lawyers warn ministers|first1=James|last1=Ball | author1link =James Ball (journalist)|first2=Shiv|last2=Malik | author2link = Shiv Malik|date=4 November 2011|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internsanonymous.co.uk/2011/11/08/archiving-interns-anonymous/|title=internsanonymous.co.uk|website=internsanonymous.co.uk|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2424">'''Keldur – Institute for Experimental Pathology, University of Iceland''' is a [[university]] institution that is connected to [[the Faculty of Medicine]] but has its own board and independent finances. The operations at Keldur are very diverse.  Many scientific methods are used in basic research and services, for example [[pathology]], [[microbiology]], [[immunology]], [[parasitology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

== History and function ==
The Institute at Keldur was established in the autumn of 1948. It is under the supervision of the  [http://eng.menntamalaraduneyti.is/ Ministry of Education and Culture]. The first director of Keldur was [[Björn Sigurðsson]],&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Pétursson. „Hver var Björn Sigurðsson og hvert var hans framlag til vísinda?“. [http://visindavefur.is/?id=58128 Vísindavefurinn 14.1.2011.] (Skoðað 19.1.2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[physician]].

[[The Rockefeller Foundation]] provided financial support to build and equip the Institute at Keldur but its original role was to respond to an epidemic in sheep,   [[Visna virus|the Maedi Visna Virus]], that resulted from contact with [[Karakul (sheep)]] that had been imported into the country in 1933.  The official date for the opening of The Institute at Keldur is November 15, 1948.  The primary function of the institute is first and foremost to research [[veterinary diseases]].

On the Board of Directors at Keldur are representatives from the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Ministry of Agriculture and Keldur staff members.  Keldur has a workforce of 60 employees, on average.  Keldur collaborates with many research teams both domestically and internationally.  The research projects are funded with [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] and [[international]] [[grants]].

The director of Keldur is Sigurður Ingvarsson (born 1956). Previous directors of Keldur are Björn Sigurðsson (born 1913, died 1959), Páll Agnar Pálsson (born 1919, died 2003), Guðmundur Georgsson, (born 1932, died 2010), Guðmundur Pétursson (born 1933).

==Biography==

What makes Kesz Valdez so extraordinary is that if you were to look for him at the age of two, you would have found him picking garbage in Manila’s infamous Captive dumpsite. Beaten by his father and neglected by his mother up till the age of four years old (after they failed to sell him), Kesz was labeled bad luck. Forced to beg, scavenge, eat garbage for food and bring back money to support his father’s drug and alcohol addictions, Kesz escaped from his family at four years old and spent his days begging on the streets in Manila's poorest slum area. At night he could be found sleeping on top of open graves or in shop doorways, surviving as a Filipino slum street kid for over 1 ½ years. He studied on an outreach group called Club 8586.

{{History of Cambodia}}
The '''Khmer Rouge period''' (1975–1979) refers to the rule of [[Pol Pot]], [[Nuon Chea]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Son Sen]], [[Khieu Samphan]] and the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] over [[Cambodia]], which the [[Khmer Rouge]] renamed [[Democratic Kampuchea]].

A four-year period cost 1.671 and 1.871 million people from 1975 to 1979, or 21 to 24 percent of Cambodia's 1975 population.&lt;ref name="kiernanD"&gt;Ben Kiernan. "The Demography of Genocide in Southeast Asia. The Death Tolls in Cambodia, 1975–79,and East Timor, 1975–80". ''Critical Asian Studies'', 35:4 (2003), 585-597&lt;/ref&gt; through the combined result of political [[execution]]s, [[disease]], [[starvation]], and [[unfree labour|forced labor]].  Due to the large numbers, the deaths during the rule of the Khmer Rouge are commonly known as the [[Cambodian genocide]].
The Khmer Rouge took power at the end of the [[Cambodian Civil War]] and were only toppled after the invasion of Cambodia by the neighbouring [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] in the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]]. Most of Cambodia remained under Vietnamese occupation for over a decade.

== Politics ==

By the 17 April 1975 Khmer Rouge victory, [[Pol Pot]] and his associates occupied the most important positions in the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] (CPK) and in the state hierarchies. Pol Pot had been CPK general secretary since February 1963. His associates functioned as the party's Political Bureau, and they held a majority of the seats on the Central Committee.

Through the 1970s, and especially after mid-1975, the party was shaken by factional struggles, including armed attempts to topple Pol Pot. Punitive measures resulted in 1977 and 1978 when hundreds of thousands of people, including some of the most important CPK leaders, were executed.

== Establishing the Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea ==
The Khmer Rouge abolished the [[Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea]] (established in 1970). Cambodia did not have any  sort of government until the proclamation of the Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea on January 5, 1976.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The Khmer Rouge continued to use King [[Norodom Sihanouk]] as a figurehead for the government until April 2, 1976, when Sihanouk resigned as head of state. Sihanouk remained under insecure house arrest in Phnom Penh, until late in the war with Vietnam when he departed for the United States where he made Democratic Kampuchea's case before the Security Council. He eventually relocated to China.

The "rights and duties of the individual" were briefly defined in Article 12. They included none of what are commonly regarded as guarantees of political human rights{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} except the statement that "men and women are equal in every respect." The document declared, however, that "all workers" and "all peasants" were "masters" of their factories and fields. An assertion that "there is absolutely no unemployment in Democratic Kampuchea" rings true in light of the regime's massive use of force.

The Constitution defined Democratic Kampuchea's [[foreign policy]] principles in Article 21, the document's longest, in terms of "independence, peace, neutrality, and [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]]." It pledged the country's support to anti-[[imperialist]] struggles in the [[Third World]]. In light of the regime's aggressive attacks against [[Vietnam]]ese, [[Thailand|Thai]], and [[Laos|Lao]] territory during 1977 and 1978, the promise to "maintain close and friendly relations with all countries sharing a common border" bore little resemblance to reality.

Governmental institutions were outlined very briefly in the Constitution. The legislature, the [[Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly]] (KPRA), contained 250 members "representing workers, peasants, and other working people and the Kampuchean Revolutionary army." One hundred and fifty KPRA seats were allocated for peasant representatives; fifty, for the armed forces; and fifty, for worker and other representatives. The legislature was to be popularly elected for a five-year term. Its [[Cambodian parliamentary election, 1976|first and only election]] was held on March 20, 1976. "[[New people]]" apparently were not allowed to participate.

The executive branch of government also was chosen by the KPRA.[Citation Needed] It consisted of a state presidium "responsible for representing the state of Democratic Kampuchea inside and outside the country." It served for a five-year term, and its president was head of state. Khieu Samphan was the only person to serve in this office, which he assumed after Sihanouk's resignation. The judicial system was composed of "people's courts", the judges for which were appointed by the KPRA, as was the executive branch.

The Constitution did not mention regional or local government institutions. After assuming power, the Khmer Rouge abolished the old provinces (''khet'') and replaced them with seven zones; the Northern Zone, Northeastern Zone, Northwestern Zone, Central Zone, Eastern Zone, Western Zone, and Southwestern Zone. There were also two other regional-level units: the Kracheh Special Region Number 505 and, until 1977, the Siemreab Special Region Number 106.

The zones were divided into ''damban'' (regions) that were given numbers. Number One, appropriately, encompassed the Samlot region of the Northwestern Zone (including Battambang Province), where the insurrection against Sihanouk had erupted in early 1967. With this exception, the damban appear to have been numbered arbitrarily.

The damban were divided into ''srok'' (districts), ''khum'' (subdistricts), and ''phum'' (villages), the latter usually containing several hundred people. This pattern was roughly similar to that which existed under Sihanouk and the Khmer Republic, but inhabitants of the villages were organized into ''krom'' (groups) composed of ten to fifteen families. On each level, administration was directed by a three-person committee (''kanak'', or ''kena'').

CPK members occupied committee posts at the higher levels. Subdistrict and village committees were often staffed by local poor peasants, and, very rarely, by "new people." Cooperatives (''sahakor''), similar in jurisdictional area to the khum, assumed local government responsibilities in some areas.

==Societal transformation==
According to Pol Pot, Cambodia was made up of four [[Social class|classes]]: [[peasants]] and workers, [[bourgeoisie]], [[capitalists]], and [[feudalists]]. Post-revolutionary society, as defined by the 1976 Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea, consisted of workers, peasants, and "all other Kampuchean working people." No allowance was made for a transitional stage such as China's "New Democracy" in which "patriotic" landlord or bourgeois elements were permitted to play a role in socialist construction.

Sihanouk writes that in 1975 he, [[Khieu Samphan]], and [[Khieu Thirith]] went to visit [[Zhou Enlai]], who was gravely ill. Zhou warned them not to attempt to achieve [[communism]] in a single step, as China had attempted in the late 1950s with the [[Great Leap Forward]]. Khieu Samphan and Khieu Thirith "just smiled an incredulous and superior smile."&lt;ref name= Jackson&gt;Jackson, Karl D. ''Cambodia, 1975–1978: Rendezvous with Death''.Princeton U. Press, 1992, Page 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Khieu Samphan and [[Son Sen]] later boasted to Sihanouk that "we will be the first nation to create a completely communist society without wasting time on intermediate steps."&lt;ref name= Jackson/&gt;

Although conditions varied from region to region, a situation that was, in part, a reflection of factional divisions that still existed within the CPK during the 1970s, the testimony of refugees reveals that the most salient social division was between the politically suspect "[[New People|new people]]", those driven out of the towns after the communist victory, and the more reliable "old people", the poor and lower middle-class peasants who had remained in the countryside. Despite the ideological commitment to radical equality, CPK members and the armed forces constituted a clearly recognizable elite. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The working class was a negligible factor because of the evacuation of the urban areas and the idling of most of the country's few factories. The one important working class group in pre-revolutionary Cambodia—labourers on large rubber plantations—traditionally had consisted mostly of Vietnamese emigrants and thus was politically suspect.

The number of people, including refugees, living in the urban areas on the eve of the communist victory probably was somewhat more than 3 million,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} out of the total population of roughly 8 million. As mentioned, despite their rural origins, the refugees were considered "new people"—that is, people unsympathetic to Democratic Kampuchea. Some doubtless passed as "old people" after returning to their native villages, but the Khmer Rouge seem to have been extremely vigilant in recording and keeping track of the movements of families and of individuals.

The lowest unit of social control, the ''krom'' (group), consisted of ten to fifteen nuclear families whose activities were closely supervised by a three-person committee. The committee chairman was selected by the CPK. This grass roots leadership was required to note the social origin of each family under its jurisdiction and to report it to persons higher up in the [[Angkar]] hierarchy. The number of "new people" may initially have been as high as 2.5&amp;nbsp;million.

The "new people" were treated as forced labourers. They were constantly moved, were forced to do the hardest physical labour, and worked in the most inhospitable, fever-ridden parts of the country, such as forests, upland areas, and swamps. "New people" were segregated from "old people", enjoyed little or no privacy, and received the smallest rice rations. When the country experienced [[Famine|food shortages]] in 1977, the "new people" suffered the most.

The medical care available to them was primitive or nonexistent. Families often were separated because people were divided into work brigades according to age and sex and sent to different parts of the country. "New people" were subjected to unending political indoctrination and could be executed without trial.

The situation of the "old people" under Khmer Rouge rule was more ambiguous. Refugee interviews reveal cases in which villagers were treated as harshly as the "new people", enduring forced labour, indoctrination, the separation of children from parents, and executions; however, they were generally allowed to remain in their native villages.

Because of their age-old resentment of the urban and rural elites, many of the poorest peasants probably were sympathetic to Khmer Rouge goals. In the early 1980s, visiting Western journalists found that the issue of peasant support for the Khmer Rouge was an extremely sensitive subject that officials of the People's Republic of Kampuchea were not inclined to discuss.

Although the Southwestern Zone was one original centre of power of the Khmer Rouge, and cadres administered it with strict discipline, random executions were relatively rare, and "new people" were not persecuted if they had a cooperative attitude.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  In the Western Zone and in the Northwestern Zone, conditions were harsh. Starvation was general in the latter zone because cadres sent rice to [[Phnom Penh]] rather than distributing it to the local population.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  In the Northern Zone and in the Central Zone, there seem to have been more executions than there were victims of starvation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  Little reliable information emerged on conditions in the Northeastern Zone, one of the most isolated parts of Cambodia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

On the surface, society in Democratic Kampuchea was strictly [[egalitarian]]. The [[Khmer language]], like many in Southeast Asia, has a complex system of usages to define speakers' rank and social status. These usages were abandoned. People were encouraged to call each other "friend", or "comrade" (in Khmer, មិត្ដ mitt), and to avoid traditional signs of deference such as bowing or folding the hands in salutation.

Language was transformed in other ways. The Khmer Rouge invented new terms. People were told they must "forge" (''lot dam'') a new revolutionary character, that they were the "instruments" (''opokar'') of the Angkar, and that nostalgia for pre-revolutionary times (''chheu satek arom'', or "memory sickness") could result in their receiving Angkar's "invitation" to be deindustrialised and to live in a concentration camp.

Members and candidate members of the CPK, local-level leaders of poor peasant background who collaborated with the Angkar, and members of the armed forces had a higher standard of living than the rest of the population. Refugees agree that, even during times of severe food shortage, members of the grass-roots elite had adequate, if not luxurious, supplies of food. One refugee wrote that "pretty new bamboo houses" were built for Khmer Rouge cadres along the river in Phnom Penh.

According to [[Craig Etcheson]], an authority on Democratic Kampuchea, members of the revolutionary army lived in self-contained colonies, and they had a "distinctive warrior-caste ethos." Armed forces units personally loyal to Pol Pot, known as the "[[Unconditional Divisions]]", were a privileged group within the military.

Although their revolutionary ideology was extreme, the highest ranks of the Khmer Rouge leadership had a tendency to [[nepotism]] similar of the Sihanouk-era elite. Pol Pot's wife, [[Khieu Ponnary]], was head of the [[Association of Democratic Khmer Women]] and her younger sister, [[Khieu Thirith]], served as minister of social action. These two women were considered among the half-dozen most powerful personalities in Democratic Kampuchea. Son Sen's wife, [[Yun Yat]], served as minister for culture, education and learning.

Several of Pol Pot's nephews and nieces were given jobs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of [[Ieng Sary]]'s daughters was appointed head of the [[Calmette Hospital]] although she had not graduated from secondary school. A niece of [[Ieng Sary]] was given a job as English translator for [[Radio Phnom Penh]] although her fluency in the language was relative.

Family ties were important, both because of the culture and because of the leadership's intense secretiveness and distrust of outsiders, especially of pro-Vietnamese communists. Different ministries, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, were controlled and exploited by powerful Khmer Rouge families. Administering the diplomatic corps was regarded as an especially profitable fiefdom.

== Economy ==
Democratic Kampuchea's economic policy was similar to, and possibly inspired by, China's radical [[Great Leap Forward]] that carried out immediate collectivisation of the Chinese countryside in 1958. During the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge established "mutual assistance groups" in the areas they occupied.

After 1973, these were organised into "low-level cooperatives" in which land and agricultural implements were lent by peasants to the community but remained their private property. "High-level cooperatives", in which private property was abolished and the harvest became the collective property of the peasants, appeared in 1974. "Communities", introduced in early 1976, were a more advanced form of high-level cooperative in which communal dining was instituted. State-owned farms also were established.

Far more than the Chinese communists, the Khmer Rouge pursued the ideal of economic self-sufficiency, specifically the version that [[Khieu Samphan]] had outlined in his 1959 doctoral dissertation. Currency was abolished, and domestic trade or commerce could be conducted only through barter. Rice, measured in tins, became the most important medium of exchange, although people also bartered gold, jewelry, and other personal possessions.

Foreign trade was almost completely halted, though there was a limited revival in late 1976 and early 1977. China was the most important trading partner, but commerce amounting to a few million dollars was also conducted with France, the United Kingdom, and with the United States through a Hong Kong intermediary.

From the Khmer Rouge perspective, the country was free of foreign economic domination for the first time in its 2,000-year history. By mobilising the people into work brigades organised in a military fashion, the Khmer Rouge hoped to unleash the masses' productive forces.

There was an "[[Angkor]]ian" component to economic policy. That ancient kingdom had grown rich and powerful because it controlled extensive irrigation systems that produced surpluses of rice. Agriculture in modern Cambodia depended, for the most part, on seasonal rains.

By building a nationwide system of irrigation canals, dams, and reservoirs, the leadership believed it would be possible to produce rice on a year-round basis. It was the "new people" who suffered and sacrificed the most to complete these ambitious projects.

Although the Khmer Rouge implemented an "agriculture first" policy in order to achieve self-sufficiency, they were not, as some observers have argued, "back-to-nature" primitivists. Although the 1970–75 war and the evacuation of the cities had destroyed or idled most industry, small contingents of workers were allowed to return to the urban areas to reopen some plants.

Like their Chinese counterparts, the Cambodian communists had great faith in the inventive power and the technical aptitude of the masses, and they constantly published reports of peasants' adapting old mechanical parts to new uses. Similarly to Mao's regime, which had attempted unsuccessfully to build a new steel industry based on backyard furnaces during the Great Leap Forward, the Khmer Rouge sought to move industry to the countryside. Significantly, the seal of Democratic Kampuchea displayed not only sheaves of rice and irrigation sluices, but also a factory with smokestacks.

== Education and health ==
The Khmer Rouge regarded traditional education with undiluted hostility. After the fall of Phnom Penh, they executed thousands of teachers. Those who had been educators prior to 1975 survived by hiding their identities.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Aside from teaching basic mathematical skills and literacy, the major goal of the new educational system was to instill revolutionary values in the young. For a regime at war with most of Cambodia's traditional values, this meant that it was necessary to create a gap between the values of the young and the values of the nonrevolutionary old.

The regime recruited children to spy on adults. The pliancy of the younger generation made them, in the Angkar's words, the "dictatorial instrument of the party."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 1962 the communists had created a special secret organisation, the Democratic Youth League, that, in the early 1970s, changed its name to the [[Communist Youth League of Kampuchea]]. Pol Pot considered Youth League alumni as his most loyal and reliable supporters, and used them to gain control of the central and of the regional CPK apparatus. The powerful Khieu Thirith, minister of social action, was responsible for directing the youth movement.

Hardened young cadres, many little more than twelve years of age, were enthusiastic accomplices in some of the regime's worst atrocities. Sihanouk, who was kept under virtual house arrest in Phnom Penh between 1976 and 1978, wrote in ''War and Hope'' that his youthful guards, having been separated from their families and given a thorough indoctrination, were encouraged to play cruel games involving the torture of animals. Having lost parents, siblings, and friends in the war and lacking the [[Buddhist values]] of their elders, the Khmer Rouge youth also lacked the inhibitions that would have dampened their zeal for [[revolutionary terror]].

Health facilities in the years 1975 to 1978 were abysmally poor. Many physicians either were executed or were prohibited from practicing. It appears that the party and the armed forces elite had access to Western medicine and to a system of hospitals that offered reasonable treatment, but ordinary people, especially "new people", were expected to use traditional plant and herbal remedies that were of debatable usefulness. Some bartered their rice rations and personal possessions to obtain aspirin and other simple drugs.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Evacuation of the cities ==
The deportations were one of the markers of the beginning of the Khmer Rouge rule. They demanded and then forced the people to leave the cities and live in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambodia.org/khmer_rouge/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phnom Penh]]—populated by 2.5&amp;nbsp;million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1879785,00.html | work=Time | title=The Khmer Rouge | date=February 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010 | first=Dan | last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; —was soon nearly empty. The roads out of the city were clogged with evacuees. Similar evacuations occurred throughout the nation.

The conditions of the evacuation and the treatment of the people involved depended often on which military units and commanders were conducting the specific operations. Pol Pot's brother – Chhay, who worked as a Republican journalist in the capital – was reported to have died during the evacuation of [[Phnom Penh]].

Even Phnom Penh's hospitals were emptied of their patients. The Khmer Rouge provided transportation for some of the aged and the disabled, and they set up stockpiles of food outside the city for the refugees; however, the supplies were inadequate to sustain the hundreds of thousands of people on the road. Even seriously injured hospital patients, many without any means of conveyance, were summarily forced to leave regardless of their condition.

The foreign community, about 800 people, was quarantined in the French embassy compound, and by the end of the month the foreigners were taken by truck to the Thai border. [[Khmer people|Khmer]] women who were married to foreigners were allowed to accompany their husbands, but Khmer men were not permitted to leave with their foreign wives.

Western historians claim that the motives were political, based on deep-rooted resentment of the cities. The Khmer Rouge was determined to turn the country into a nation of peasants in which the corruption and "parasitism" of city life would be completely uprooted. In addition, Pol Pot wanted to break up the "enemy spy organisations" that allegedly were based in the urban areas. Finally, it seems that Pol Pot and his hard-line associates on the [[CPK Political Bureau]] used the forced evacuations to gain control of the city's population and to weaken the position of their factional rivals within the communist party.

==Terror==
[[File:Khmer Rouge Victims.JPG|thumb|180px|Remains of victims of the Khmer Rouge in the Kampong Trach Cave, Kiry Seila Hills, Rung Tik (Water Cave) or Rung Khmao (Dead Cave).]]
A security apparatus called [[Santebal]] was part of the Khmer Rouge organizational structure well before April 17, 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took control over Cambodia. [[Son Sen]], later the Deputy Prime Minister for Defense of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], was in charge of the Santebal, and in that capacity he appointed [[Comrade Duch]] to run its security apparatus. When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, Duch moved his headquarters to Phnom Penh and reported directly to Son Sen. At that time, a small chapel in the capital was used to incarcerate the regime's prisoners, who totaled fewer than two hundred. In May 1976, Duch moved his headquarters to its final location, a former high school known as [[Tuol Sleng]], which could hold up to 1,500 prisoners.
[[Image:Choeungek2.JPG|thumb|Skulls of Khmer Rouge victims]]
The Khmer Rouge government arrested, [[torture]]d and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed "enemies":
* Anyone with connections to the former government or with foreign governments.
* Professionals and intellectuals—in practice this included almost everyone with an education, people who understood a foreign language and even people who required glasses.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime]". BBC News. September 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pol Pot himself was a university-educated man (albeit a drop-out) with a taste for [[French literature]] and was also a fluent French speaker. Many artists, including musicians, writers and film makers were executed. Some like [[Ros Serey Sothea]], [[Pen Ran]] and [[Sinn Sisamouth]] gained posthumous fame for their talents and are still popular with Khmers today.
* Ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], ethnic [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], ethnic [[Thai people|Thai]] and other minorities in Eastern Highland, Cambodian Christians (most of whom were Catholic, and the Catholic Church in general), [[Cham people|Muslims]] and the [[Buddhist monk]]s.
* "Economic saboteurs:" many of the former urban dwellers (who had not starved to death in the first place) were deemed to be guilty by virtue of their lack of agricultural ability.

Through the 1970s, and especially after mid-1975, the party was also shaken by factional struggles. There were even armed attempts to topple Pol Pot. The resultant purges reached a crest in 1977 and 1978 when thousands, including some important KCP leaders, were executed.

Today, examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned [[internment|prison camp]] that was operated by [[Khang Khek Ieu]], more commonly known as "Comrade Duch".

The torture system at Tuol Sleng was designed to make prisoners confess to whatever crimes they were charged with by their captors. In their confessions, the prisoners were asked to describe their personal background. If they were party members, they had to say when they joined the revolution and describe their work assignments in DK. Then the prisoners would relate their supposed treasonous activities in chronological order. The third section of the confession text described prisoners' thwarted conspiracies and supposed treasonous conversations. At the end, the confessions would list a string of traitors who were the prisoners' friends, colleagues, or acquaintances. Some lists contained over a hundred names. People whose names were in the confession list were often called in for interrogation.
Typical confessions ran into thousands of words in which the prisoner would interweave true events in their lives with imaginary accounts of their espionage activities for the [[CIA]], the [[KGB]], or [[Vietnam]].

Some 17,000 people passed through [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng Centre]] (also known as S-21) before they were taken to sites (also known as [[The Killing Fields]]), outside Phnom Penh such as [[Choeung Ek]] where most were executed (mainly by [[pickaxe]]s to save bullets) and buried in [[mass grave]]s. Of the thousands who entered Tuol Sleng only twelve are known to have survived.

==Number of deaths==

Modern research has located 20,000 mass graves from the Khmer Rouge era throughout Cambodia. The analysis of mass graves revealed the remains of 1,386,734 victims of execution.&lt;ref name="Mekong.net_deaths"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Bruce|title=Counting Hell: The Death Toll of the Khmer Rouge Regime in Cambodia|date = April 1, 2005|url = http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/deaths.htm|accessdate =January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed demographic study demonstrates that the total population loss in Cambodia was 1.671 and 1.871 million people from 1975 to 1979, or 21 to 24 percent of Cambodia's 1975 population.&lt;ref name="kiernanD"/&gt; An additional 300,000 Cambodians starved to death between 1979 and 1980, largely as a result of the after-effects of Khmer Rouge policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heuveline|first=Patrick|title=Forced Migration and Mortality|chapter=The Demographic Analysis of Mortality Crises: The Case of Cambodia 1970–1979|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-309-07334-9|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious communities ==
Article 20 of the 1976 Constitution of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] guaranteed religious freedom, but it also declared that "all reactionary religions that are detrimental to Democratic Kampuchea and the Kampuchean People are strictly forbidden." About 85 percent of the population follows the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]]. The country's 40,000 to 60,000 Buddhist monks, regarded by the regime as social parasites, were defrocked and forced into labour brigades.

Many monks were executed; temples and pagodas were destroyed&lt;ref name="Genocide Watch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prosecuting the Crime of Destruction of Cultural Property|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Cambodia_Prosecuting_the_Crime_of_Destruction_of_Cultural_Property.pdf|date=|accessdate=December 28, 2012|first=Sarah J.|last=Thomas|work=GenocideWatch.org|publisher=Genocide Watch|quote=Following its seizure of power in April 1975, the Khmer Rouge regime proclaimed a return to "Year Zero" and set about demolishing links to the past, to the outside world and to religion.  As part of their systematic attack upon Buddhism, the Khmer Rouge desecrated or destroyed most of Cambodia's 3,369 temples, inflicting irreparable damage on statues, sacred literature, and other religious items.  Similar damage was inflicted on the mosques of the Cham, some 130 of which were destroyed.  The Khmer Rouge regime attacked Christian places of worship, even disassembling the Catholic cathedral of Phnom Penh stone by stone until only a vacant lot remained.  The Khmer Rouge destroyed all 73 Catholic churches in existence in 1975.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or turned into storehouses or gaols. Images of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] were defaced and dumped into rivers and lakes. People who were discovered praying or expressing religious sentiments were often killed. The Christian and Muslim communities also were even more persecuted, as they were labelled as part of a pro-Western cosmopolitan sphere, hindering Cambodian culture and society.

The Roman Catholic cathedral of Phnom Penh was completely razed.&lt;ref name="Genocide Watch"/&gt; The Khmer Rouge forced Muslims to eat pork, which they regard as forbidden ''([[ḥarām]]).'' Many of those who refused were killed. Christian clergy and Muslim [[imam]]s were executed. One hundred and thirty [[Cham people|Cham]] mosques were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Genocide Watch"/&gt;

== Ethnic minorities ==
The Khmer Rouge banned by decree the existence of [[Chinese Cambodian|ethnic Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], Muslim [[Cham people|Cham]], and 20 other minorities, which altogether constituted 15% of the population at the beginning of the Khmer Rouge's rule.&lt;ref name="specter"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gellately|first2=Ben|last2=Kiernan|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003|pages=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of Vietnamese were raped, mutilated, and murdered in regime-organised massacres. Most of the survivors fled to Vietnam.

The [[Cham people|Cham]], a Muslim minority who are the descendants of migrants from the old state of [[Champa]], were forced to adopt the [[Khmer language]] and customs. Their communities, which traditionally had existed apart from Khmer villages, were broken up. Forty thousand Cham were killed in two districts of Kampong Cham Province alone. Thai minorities living near the Thai border also were persecuted.

The state of the Chinese Cambodians was described as "the worst disaster ever to befall any ethnic Chinese community in Southeast Asia".&lt;ref name="specter"/&gt; [[Chinese Cambodian|Cambodians of Chinese descent]] were massacred by the Khmer Rouge under the justification that they "used to exploit the Cambodian people".&lt;ref name="rpg"/&gt; The Chinese were stereotyped as traders and moneylenders, and therefore were associated with capitalism. Among the Khmer, the Chinese were also resented for their lighter [[skin color]] and cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Did They Kill? Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide|author=Hinton, Alexander Laban|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2005|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of Chinese families were rounded up in 1978 and told that they were to be resettled, but were actually executed.&lt;ref name="rpg"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pol Pot regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge|first=Ben|last=Kiernan|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2008|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the Khmer Rouge's rule in 1975, there were 425,000 ethnic Chinese in Cambodia; by the end in 1979, there were 200,000. In addition to being a proscribed ethnic group by the government, the Chinese were predominantly city-dwellers, making them vulnerable to the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary ruralism.&lt;ref name="specter"/&gt; The government of the People's Republic of China did not protest the killings of ethnic Chinese in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Remapping Asian American History|first=Sucheng|last=Chan|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2003|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The policies of the Khmer Rouge towards Sino-Cambodians seems puzzling in light of the fact that the two most powerful people in the regime and presumably the originators of the racist doctrine, Pol Pot and Nuon Chea, both had mixed Chinese-Cambodian ancestry. Other senior figures in the Khmer Rouge state apparatus such as Son Sen and Ta Mok also had Chinese ethnic heritage.

In the late 1980s, little was known of Khmer Rouge policies toward the tribal peoples of the northeast, the [[Khmer Loeu]]. Pol Pot established an insurgent base in the tribal areas of [[Ratanakiri]] Province in the early 1960s, and he may have had a substantial Khmer Loeu following. Predominantly animist peoples, with few ties to the Buddhist culture of the lowland Khmers, the Khmer Loeu had resented Sihanouk's attempts to "civilise" them.

== International relations ==

The 'Democratic Kampuchea' regime had closer ties with China (its main backer) and to a lesser extent with [[North Korea]]. In 1977, in a message congratulating the Cambodian comrades on the 17th anniversary of the CKP, [[Kim Jong-Il]] congratulated the Cambodian people for having "wiped out [...] counterrevolutionary group of spies who had committed subversive activities and sabotage"&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Karl D. Cambodia 1977: gone to Pot – ''Asian Survey'', 1978. p 81&lt;/ref&gt; Only China, North Korea, Egypt, Albania, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam (until December 1977), Romania and Yugoslavia had diplomatic missions in Phnom Penh.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Karl D. Cambodia 1977: gone to Pot – ''Asian Survey'', 1978. p 82&lt;/ref&gt;

== The fall of Democratic Kampuchea ==
{{main|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}
Not content with ruling Cambodia, the KR leaders also dreamed of reviving the Angkorian empire of a thousand years earlier, which ruled over large parts of what today are Thailand and Vietnam. This involved launching military attacks into southern Vietnam in which thousands of unarmed villagers were massacred.

Immediately following the Khmer Rouge victory in 1975, there were skirmishes between their troops and Vietnamese forces. A number of incidents occurred in May 1975. The Cambodians launched attacks on the Vietnamese islands of [[Phú Quốc]] and [[Thổ Chu]] causing the death of over 500 civilians&lt;ref&gt;http://suckhoedoisong.vn/quoc-te/neu-khong-co-bo-doi-tinh-nguyen-viet-nam-se-khong-co-dieu-ky-dieu-ay-200919161820891.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and intruded into Vietnamese border provinces. In late May, at about the same time that the United States launched an air strike against the oil refinery at [[Kompong-Som|Kompong Som]], following the [[Mayagüez incident|''Mayagüez'' incident]], Vietnamese forces seized the Cambodian island of [[Poulo Wai]]. According to [[Republic of Vietnam]], the island of [[Poulo Wai]] was a part of Vietnam since the 18th century and the island was under Cambodian administrative management in 1939 in accordance with decisions of French conlonists. The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] has recognized the island of [[Poulo Wai]] as part of Cambodia since 1976, and the recognition is seen as a sign of goodwill by Vietnam to preserve its relationship with Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/modules/news/newsdetail.aspx?co_id=30220&amp;cn_id=109109&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Pol Pot and [[Ieng Sary]] visited [[Hanoi]]. They proposed a friendship treaty between the two countries, an idea that met with a cool reception from Vietnam's leaders. Although the Vietnamese evacuated Poulo Wai in August, incidents continued along Cambodia's northeastern border. At the instigation of the Phnom Penh regime, thousands of Vietnamese also were driven out of Cambodia.
[[Image:MayagüezIncident1.jpg|thumb|The ''Mayagüez'']]
Relations between Cambodia and Vietnam improved in 1976, in part because of Pol Pot's preoccupation with intraparty challenges. In May Cambodian and Vietnamese representatives met in Phnom Penh in order to establish a commission to resolve border disagreements.

The Vietnamese, however, refused to recognize the ''[[Brévié Line]]''—the colonial-era demarcation of maritime borders between the two countries—and the negotiations broke down. In late September, however, a few days before Pol Pot was forced to resign as prime minister, air links were established between Phnom Penh and Hanoi.

With Pol Pot back in the forefront of the regime in 1977, the situation rapidly deteriorated. Incidents escalated along all of Cambodia's borders. Khmer Rouge forces attacked villages in the border areas of [[Thailand]] near [[Aranyaprathet]]. Brutal murders of Thai villagers, including women and children, were the first widely reported concrete evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities. There were also incidents along the [[Laos]] border.

At approximately the same time, villages in Vietnam's border areas underwent renewed attacks. In turn, Vietnam launched air strikes against Cambodia. From April 18 to 30, 1975, Cambodian troops, after invading Vietnamese province of [[An Giang]], carried out the [[Ba Chúc massacre]] causing 3,157 civilian death in province of [[Tây Ninh]], Vietnam. In September, border fighting resulted in as many as 1,000 Vietnamese civilian casualties. The following month, the Vietnamese counter-attacked in a campaign involving a force of 20,000 personnel.

Vietnamese defense minister General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] underestimated the tenacity of the Khmer Rouge, however, and was obliged to commit an additional 58,000 reinforcements in December. On January 6, 1978, Giap's forces began an orderly withdrawal from Cambodian territory. The Vietnamese apparently believed they had "taught a lesson" to the Cambodians, but Pol Pot proclaimed this a "victory" even greater than that of April 17, 1975. For several years, the Vietnamese government sought in vain to establish peaceful relations with the KR regime. But the KR leaders were intent on war. Behind this seeming insanity clearly lay the assumption that China would support the KR militarily in such a conflict.

Faced with growing Khmer Rouge belligerence, the Vietnamese leadership decided in early 1978 to support internal resistance to the Pol Pot regime, with the result that the Eastern Zone became a focus of insurrection. War hysteria reached bizarre levels within Democratic Kampuchea. In May 1978, on the eve of [[So Phim]]'s Eastern Zone uprising, Radio Phnom Penh declared that if each Cambodian soldier killed thirty Vietnamese, only 2 million troops would be needed to eliminate the entire Vietnamese population of 50&amp;nbsp;million. It appears that the leadership in Phnom Penh was seized with immense territorial ambitions, i.e., to recover [[Kampuchea Krom]], the [[Mekong|Mekong Delta]] region, which they regarded as Khmer territory.

Massacres of ethnic Vietnamese and of their sympathizers by the Khmer Rouge intensified in the Eastern Zone after the May revolt. In November, [[Vorn Vet]] led an unsuccessful coup d'état. There were now tens of thousands of Cambodian and Vietnamese exiles on Vietnamese territory.

On December 3, 1978, [[Radio Hanoi]] announced the formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KNUFNS). This was a heterogeneous group of communist and noncommunist exiles who shared an antipathy to the Pol Pot regime and a virtually total dependence on Vietnamese backing and protection. The KNUFNS provided the semblance, if not the reality, of legitimacy for Vietnam's invasion of Democratic Kampuchea and for its subsequent establishment of a satellite regime in Phnom Penh.

In the meantime, as 1978 wore on, Cambodian bellicosity in the border areas surpassed Hanoi's threshold of tolerance. Vietnamese policy makers opted for a military solution and, on December 22, Vietnam launched its offensive with the intent of overthrowing Democratic Kampuchea. A force of 120,000, consisting of combined armor and infantry units with strong artillery support, drove west into the level countryside of Cambodia's southeastern provinces. Together, the Vietnamese army and the National Salvation Front struck at the KR on December 25.

After a seventeen-day campaign, Phnom Penh fell to the advancing Vietnamese on January 7, 1979. Pol Pot and the main leaders initially took refuge near the border with Thailand. After making deals with several governments, they were able to use Thailand as a safe staging area for the construction and operation of new redoubts in the mountain and jungle fastness of Cambodia's periphery, Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders regrouped their units, issued a new call to arms, and reignited a stubborn insurgency against the regime in power as they had done in the late 1960s.

For the moment, however, the Vietnamese invasion had accomplished its purpose of deposing an unlamented and particularly violent dictatorship. A new administration of ex-Khmer Rouge fighters under the control of Hanoi was quickly established (who are ruling till present), and it set about competing, both domestically and internationally, with the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate government of Cambodia.

Peace still eluded the war-ravaged nation, however, and although the insurgency set in motion by the Khmer Rouge proved unable to topple the new Vietnamese-controlled regime in Phnom Penh, it did nonetheless keep the country in a permanent state of insecurity. The new administration was propped up by a substantial Vietnamese military force and civilian advisory effort.

As events in the 1980s progressed, the main preoccupations of the new regime were survival, restoring the economy, and combating the Khmer Rouge insurgency by military and by political means. The fostering of activity to meet these imperatives and the building of institutions are described in subsequent articles in the [[History of Cambodia]] series.

== Aftermath ==

=== The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea ===
The UN General Assembly voted by a margin of 71 to 35 for the KR to retain their seat at the UN, with 34 abstentions and 12 absentees.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce E. Larson, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=wJl2iEkjYOAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=un+general+assembly+vote+on+khmer+rouge+1979&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4wwHvqVqzE&amp;sig=7TD7djbEJddSpmCrVusTYr4WMRY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6jfySi-vJAhXJNT4KHZW-DNEQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=un%20general%20assembly%20vote%20on%20khmer%20rouge%201979&amp;f=false], 'New Foundations for Asian and Pacific Security', 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The seat was occupied by [[Thiounn Prasith]], an old cadre of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary from their student days in Paris and one of the 21 attendees at the 1960 KPRP Second Congress. The seat was retained under the name 'Democratic Kampuchea' until 1982 and then '[[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]]' until 1993.

According to journalist [[Elizabeth Becker]], former U.S. National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] said that in 1979, "I encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot. Pol Pot was an abomination. We could never support him, but China could."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Becker, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3D9153CF934A25757C0A96E958260 Pol Pot's End Won't Stop U.S. Pursuit of His Circle], ''New York Times'', April 17, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Brzezinski has denied this, writing that the Chinese were aiding Pol Pot "without any help or encouragement from the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Brzezinski, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DA163FF931A15757C0A96E958260 China Acted Alone], Letters, ''New York Times'', April 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

China, the U.S., and other Western countries opposed an expansion of Vietnamese and Soviet influence in Indochina, and refused to recognize the [[Cambodia under Vietnamese occupation (1979–1989)|People's Republic of Kampuchea]] as the legitimate government of Cambodia, claiming that it was a puppet state propped up by Vietnamese forces. China funneled military aid to the Khmer Rouge, which in the 1980s proved to be the most capable insurgent force, while the U.S. publicly supported a non-Communist alternative to the PRK; in 1985, the [[Reagan administration]] approved $5&amp;nbsp;million in aid to the republican [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front|KPNLF]], led by former prime minister [[Son Sann]], and the [[Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste|ANS]], the armed wing of the pro-Sihanouk [[FUNCINPEC]] party.

The KPNLF, while lacking in military strength compared to the Khmer Rouge, commanded a sizable civilian following (up to 250,000) amongst refugees near the Thai-Cambodian border that had fled the KR regime. Funcinpec had the benefit of traditional peasant Khmer loyalty to the crown and Sihanouk's widespread popularity in the countryside.

In practice, the military strength of the non-KR groups within Cambodia was minimal, though their funding and civilian support was often greater than the KR. The [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] and [[Reagan administration]]s both supported the non-KR insurgents covertly, with weapons, and military advisors in the form of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] and [[Special Air Service]] units, who taught sabotage techniques in camps just inside Thailand.

=== The end of the CGDK and Khmer Rouge ===
A UN-led [[peacekeeping]] mission that took place from 1991–95 sought to end violence in the country and establish a democratic system of government through new elections. The 1990s saw a marked decline in insurgent activity, though the Khmer Rouge later renewed their attacks against the government. As [[Vietnam]] disengaged from direct involvement in [[Cambodia]], the government was able to begin to split the KR movement by making peace offers to lower level officials. The Khmer Rouge was the only member of the CGDK to continue fighting following the reconciliation process. The other two political organizations that made up the CGDK alliance ended armed resistance and became a part of the political process that began with elections in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/co_mission/unamicbackgr.html |title=United Nations Advance Mission In Cambodia (Unamic) – Background |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=February 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211174055/http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/co_mission/unamicbackgr.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Pol Pot ordered the execution of his right-hand man Son Sen for attempting peace negotiations with the Cambodian government. In 1998, Pol Pot himself died, and other key KR leaders [[Khieu Samphan]] and [[Ieng Sary]] surrendered to the government of [[Hun Sen]] in exchange for immunity from prosecution, leaving [[Ta Mok]] as the sole commander of the Khmer Rouge forces; he was detained in 1999 for "[[crimes against humanity]]." The organization essentially ceased to exist.

=== Recovery and trials ===
Since 1990 Cambodia has gradually recovered, demographically and economically, from the Khmer Rouge regime, although the psychological scars affect many Cambodian families and émigré communities. The current government teaches little about Khmer Rouge atrocities in schools. Cambodia has a very young population and by 2005 three-quarters of Cambodians were too young to remember the Khmer Rouge years. The younger generations would only know the Khmer Rouge through word-of-mouth from parents and elders.
[[Image:Tuolsleng1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]], [[Phnom Penh]]]]
In 1997, Cambodia established a Khmer Rouge Trial Task Force to create a legal and judicial structure to try the remaining leaders for war crimes and other crimes against humanity, but progress was slow, mainly because the Cambodian government of ex-Khmer Rouge Cadre [[Hun Sen]], despite its origins in the Vietnamese-backed regime of the 1980s, was reluctant to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to trial.

Funding shortfalls plagued the operation, and the government said that due to the poor economy and other financial commitments, it could only afford limited funding for the tribunal. Several countries, including India and Japan, came forward with extra funds, but by January 2006, the full balance of funding was not yet in place.

Nonetheless, the task force began its work and took possession of two buildings on the grounds of the [[Royal Cambodian Armed Forces]] (RCAF) High Command headquarters in [[Kandal Province|Kandal]] province just on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The tribunal task force expects to spend the rest of 2006 training the judges and other tribunal members before the actual trial is to take place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In March 2006 the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]], [[Kofi Annan]], nominated seven judges for a trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders.

In May 2006, Justice Minister Ang Vong Vathana announced that Cambodia's highest judicial body approved 30 Cambodian and U.N. judges to preside over the genocide tribunal for some surviving Khmer Rouge leaders. The chief Khmer Rouge torturer [[Kang Kek Iew]] – known as Duch and ex-commandant of the notorious S-21 prison – went on trial for crimes against humanity on February 17, 2009. It is the first case involving a senior Pol Pot cadre three decades after the end of a regime blamed for 1.7&amp;nbsp;million deaths in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuettler |first=Darren |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2009-02-17-killing-fields-torturer-on-trial-in-cambodia |title=Killing Fields torturer on trial in Cambodia |newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian |agency=Reuters |date=February 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute of "genocide" label ===
While the events in Cambodia are widely considered to be a genocide or democide and referred to as such, [[Steven Rosefielde]] argues that the deaths in Cambodia fail to meet the definition of genocide in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations' [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|General Assembly Resolution 260]] (Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide) requires that a "national, ethnical, racial or religious group" be specifically targeted to be considered Genocide. The Khmer Rouge did not meet this legal definition since all people, including the Khmer Rouge themselves, were equally targeted. Therefore the United Nations and the  [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia|Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC)]] has, as of December 2009, only charged two individuals with "Genocide", for the targeting of the [[Vietnam]]ese and ethnic [[Cham people|Cham]] muslims.([https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gXssZ7V8pKg42hqegCKtdB4TPyZgD9CKDBH80 See AP])   Instead, most have been charged with [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[Geneva Conventions#Grave breaches|grave breaches of the Geneva Convention]], [[homicide]], [[torture]] and [[religious persecution]].([http://www.yale.edu/cgp/ see])([http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/tribunal-background/charged-persons--persons-of-interest.html see also] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219033351/http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/tribunal-background/charged-persons--persons-of-interest.html |date=February 19, 2010 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Rosefielde states that there is "no evidence Pol Pot sought to exterminate the Khmer people, or even the Cham and religious minorities."  Instead, he defines Khmer Rouge killings as "''dystopicide''":  "The no-prisoners-taken pursuit of badly implemented, poorly conceived communist utopia-building."&lt;ref name="Rosefielde120121"&gt;[[#Rosefielde2009RedHolocaust|Rosefielde (2009) ''Red Holocaust'']] pp. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, TM is simply – as they state – a technique. Although it enables one to cope with life, it offers no goal beyond human existence (such as moksha), nor does it offer rites or passage or an ethic. Unlike certain other Hindu-derived movements, TM does not prescribe a dharma to its followers – that is to say a set of spiritual obligations deriving from one's essential nature."&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as ''[[Maharishi]]'' (meaning "great seer")&lt;ref name="Koppel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dehsen"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Weidmann|first= K.T.|year=1999|chapter=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|title= Philosophers and Religious Leaders: An Encyclopedia of People Who Changed the World|editor1-first=Christian |editor1-last= von Dehsen |publisher= Greenwood|page=120|isbn= 978-1573561525}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Yogi]]'' as an adult.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mason|first=Paul|year=1994|title=The Maharishi – The Biography of the Man Who Gave Transcendental Meditation to the World|page=28|publisher=Element Books Ltd.|location= Shaftsbury, Dorset|isbn=1-85230-571-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3Mdr3IMgW0C&amp;pg=PA362&amp;dq=the+honorific+maharishi+was++given+to+mahesh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YnKXT8CeF5Tk6QGxw9nPBg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last= Goldberg|first=Philip|title=''American Veda: from Emerson and the Beatles to yoga and meditation|publisher= Harmony Books, Crown Publishing/Random House|year=2010|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi became a disciple and assistant of [[Swami]] [[Brahmananda Saraswati]],  the [[Shankaracharya]] (spiritual leader) of [[Jyotirmath]] in the Indian [[Himalayas]]. The Maharishi credits Brahmananda Saraswati with inspiring his teachings. In 1955, the Maharishi began to introduce his Transcendental Deep Meditation (later renamed Transcendental Meditation) to India and the world. His first global tour began in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oates|first=Robert M.|title=Celebrating the dawn: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the TM technique|page=40|location=New York|publisher=G.P.

==Life==

===Birth===
The birth name, birth date, and caste of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi are not known with certainty, in part because of the tradition of ascetics and monks to relinquish family connections.&lt;ref name=Coplin2n&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree= PhD|chapter=Chapter Two: Socio-Historical Context for SRM's Emergence |title=Text and Context in the Communication of a Social Movement's Charisma, Ideology, and Consciousness: TM for India and the West |url= |author= |last=Coplin |first=J.R. |year=1993|publisher=University of California, San Diego|page=Footnote #73|quote=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's caste background is a matter of some uncertainty because it is the tradition of yogis, ascetics, and renunciants to relinquish their family ties.

===Early life===

Brahmachari Mahesh remained with Swami Brahmananda Saraswati until the latter died in 1953, when he moved to [[Uttarkashi]] in Uttarakhand in the [[Himalayas]].  Although Brahmachari Mahesh was a close disciple, he could not be the Shankaracharya's spiritual successor because he was not of the [[Brahmin]] [[caste]].&lt;ref name=Williamson84&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transcendent in America|first=Lola |last=Williamson|page=84|publisher=New York University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8147-9449-4|quote=Guru Dev represented the tradition well, for he did not allow anyone who was not of the Brahmin varna, the caste of the priesthood, to teach. Since Mahesh was born into a scribe caste (kayastha), he was not allowed to join the order of monks. Thus when Saraswati died in Calcutta in 1953, Mahesh would not have been considered a candidate to replace him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coplin, J.R. (1990) p. 49 Note: "Because he was not a brahmin, Mahesh could not become a member of the ''dandi sannyasi'' order and succeed  his master as Shankaracharya; the honor passed to Swami Shantanand Saraswati in June, 1953." (This from an interview by the author with the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Vishnudevananda Saraswati on 12 June 1983.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shankaracharya, at the end of his life, charged him with the responsibility of travelling and teaching meditation to the masses, while he named [[Shantananda Saraswati|Swami Shantananda Saraswati]] as his successor.&lt;ref name="BBC Obit"&gt;{{cite news|work= BBC News|title=Obituary: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3747053.stm|date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1994) pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

===World tours (1958–1968)===

According to author William Jefferson, in 1958, the Maharishi went to Madras to address a large crowd of people who had gathered to celebrate the memory of Guru Dev. It was there that he spontaneously announced that he planned to spread the teaching of TM throughout the world. Hundreds of people immediately asked to learn TM.&lt;ref name="Jefferson" /&gt; In 1959, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began his first world tour,&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hudson/&gt; writing: "I had one thing in mind, that I know something which is useful to every man".&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

Harrison commented years later, "Now, historically, there's the story that something went on that shouldn't have done – but nothing did." In 1992, Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party, and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying, "We were very young" and "It's probably in the history books that Maharishi 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' – but it's bullshit, total bullshit." Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she "hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, when we had enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi".

===Further growth of the TM movement (1968–1990)===
[[File:Picswiss UR-28-18.jpg|thumb|left|The Maharishi's headquarters in [[Seelisberg]], Switzerland]]
In 1968, the Maharishi announced that he would stop his public activities and instead begin the training of TM teachers at his new global headquarters in [[Seelisberg]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Times0882/&gt; In 1969, he inaugurated a course in his Science of Creative Intelligence at [[Stanford University]], which was then offered at 25 other American universities.&lt;ref name="Una Kroll"/&gt;

In 1970, the Maharishi held a TM teacher training course at a Victorian hotel in [[Poland, Maine|Poland Springs, Maine]], with 1,200 participants. Later that year, he held a similar four-week course with 1500 participants at [[Humboldt State College]] in [[Arcata, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rqIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fGgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3160,277023&amp;dq=maharishi&amp;hl=en|work=Lewiston Evening Journal|agency=Associated Press |first=Pat |last=Sherlock|date=3 July 1970|title=The Transcendental Gospel Solution to Life's Problems Says Guru at Poland Springs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, after having trouble with Indian tax authorities, he moved his headquarters to Italy, returning to India in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Constance |last1=Jones |first2=James |last2=Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |year=2007 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |page=273 |quote=The Maharishi returned to India in the late 1970s and moved to the Netherlands in 1990.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=encyclopedia+of+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dmk7UanpDvSO2QX-1oCYDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mahesh%20yogi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph7870&gt;{{cite news|work=The Telegraph|date=7 February 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1577870/Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi.html | location=London | title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[City of Hope National Medical Center|City of Hope Foundation]] in Los Angeles gave the Maharishi their "Man of Hope" award.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Nat, Denniston, Denise, McWilliams, Peter, (1976).

By 1971, the Maharishi had completed 13 world tours, visited 50 countries, and held a press conference with American inventor [[Buckminster Fuller]] at his first International Symposium on SCI at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Una Kroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williamson92&gt;Williamson, Lola (2012) New York University Press, Transcendent in America, pp 80–105 (page 92)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2010/09/how-pleasing-and-inspiring-it.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529201445/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2010/09/how-pleasing-and-inspiring-it.html |archivedate=29 May 2011 |df=dmy }} Vanity Fair, Beam Me Up, Bucky, James Walcott, 15 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|6z8u313eY_c|Maharishi Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 to 1973, about 10,000 people attended the Maharishi sponsored symposia on his modern interpretation of Vedanta philosophy called Science of Creative Intelligence. During these conferences, held at universities, the Maharishi spoke with "leading thinkers" of the day such as [[Hans Selye]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], and [[Jonas Salk]].&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;

The Maharishi announced his World Plan in 1972, the goal of which was to establish 3,600 TM centres around the world.&lt;ref name="Una Kroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odd Gods"/&gt; That year, a TM training course was given by the Maharishi at [[Queen's University]] and was attended by 1,000 young people from the USA and Canada.

In March 1973, the Maharishi addressed the legislature of the state of Illinois.

In 1974, the [[Maharishi International University]] was founded. In October 1975, the Maharishi was pictured on the front cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. He made his last visit to the [[Spiritual Regeneration Movement]] centre in Los Angeles in 1975, according to film director [[David Lynch]], who met him for the first time there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Lynch's Guru and His Art| date=7 February 2008|first=Claire|last=Hoffman|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=1 May 2010|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/undergod/2008/02/david_lynch_talks_about_the_de.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the Maharishi embarked on a five-continent trip to inaugurate what he called "the Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment".

In the mid 1970s, the Maharishi's U.S. movement was operating 370 TM centres manned by 6,000 TM teachers.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt; At that time, the Maharishi also began approaching the business community via an organisation called the American Foundation for SCI (AFSCI), whose objective was to eliminate stress for business professionals. His TM movement came to be increasingly structured along the lines of a [[multinational corporation]].&lt;ref name=Times0882/&gt;

The teaching of TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence in a New Jersey public school was stopped when a US court, in 1977, declared the movement to be religious, and ruled adoption of TM by public organisations in breach of the separation of church and state ([[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trance 101|first=Mel |last=Bezalel|work=Jerusalem Post|date=1 May 2009|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doug Henning]] and the Maharishi planned a magical Vedic amusement park, Vedaland, and bought large tracts of land near [[Orlando, Florida]], and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], to host the park. The theme park was supposed to be a gateway into understanding the mysteries of the universe. According to the Maharishi's official Vedic city website, "Entering Veda Land through a secret cave on a windswept plateau high in the Himalayas the adventure starts as one travels through a waterfall that leads to a forest where an ancient Vedic civilization awaits to reveal the deepest secrets of the universe (sic)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharishivediccity-iowa.gov/amenities/vedaland.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424114004/http://www.maharishivediccity-iowa.gov/amenities/vedaland.html |archivedate=24 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were never executed and, for Niagara Falls, Veda Land turned out to be just another theme park proposal that never materialized, joining an eclectic list that includes the Worlds of Jules Verne, the Ancient Chinese City and even Canada's Wonderland when it was first being planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2008/02/08/a-dreamland-by-the-qew{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maharishi commissioned plans from a prominent architect for the [[Maharishi Sthapatya Veda#Peace Tower project|world's tallest building]], a Vedic-style pyramid to be built in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, and to be filled with Yogic Flyers and other TM endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Jolla resident involved with maharishi in plans for world's tallest high-rise, Brazil project expected to cost $1.6 billion|first=Frank Dirceu|last=Braun|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=7 August 1999|page=A.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maharishi founded Maharishi Ved Vigyan Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a self-described educational institution located in  [[Uttar Pradesh]], India, in 1982.

In a 2002 appearance on the CNN show, ''[[Larry King Live]]'', the first time in twenty-five years that the Maharishi had appeared in the mainstream media, he said "Transcendental Meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results".&lt;ref name="van den Berg"/&gt; It was occasioned by the reissue of the Maharishi's book ''The Science of Being and Art of Living''.&lt;ref name=Easterling&gt;{{Cite book| publisher=The MIT Press| isbn=0-262-55065-2| last=Easterling| first=Keller| title=Enduring Innocence: Global Architecture and Its Political Masquerades| date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Maharishi Global Financing Research Foundation]] issued the "[[Global Country of World Peace#Currency|Raam]]" as a currency "dedicated to financing peace promoting projects".&lt;ref name=Times0882/&gt;

==Philosophy and teaching==
{{Hindu philosophy}} 
The Maharishi had come out to teach with the "avowed intention" to change "the course of human history".&lt;ref name=Needleman1/&gt; When he first began teaching he had three main aims: to revive the spiritual tradition in India, to show that meditation was for everyone and not just for recluses, and to show that Vedanta is compatible with science.&lt;ref name=Goldberg154-5&gt;Goldberg, (2010) ''American Veda'',  New York, Harmony Books pp154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maharishi had a message of happiness, writing in 1967 that "being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness. Under all circumstances be happy. Just think of any negativity that comes at you as a raindrop falling into the ocean of your bliss".&lt;ref name="van den Berg"/&gt; His philosophy featured the concept that "within everyone is an unlimited reservoir of energy, intelligence, and happiness".&lt;ref name=Hudson/&gt; He emphasised the naturalness of his meditation technique as a simple way of developing this potential.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book|title=The many colors of Hinduism|first=Carl |last=Olsen|pages=338–341|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVWKClYq4TUC|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1962, the Maharishi began to recommend the daily practice of yoga exercises or [[asanas]] to further accelerate growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 59 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also taught that practising Transcendental Meditation twice a day would create inner peace and that "mass meditation sessions" could create outer peace by reducing violence and war.&lt;ref name="van den Berg"/&gt; According to a TM website, the performance of [[yajna|yagya]]s by 7,000 [[pandit]]s in India, plus hundreds of Yogic Flyers in Germany, brought "coherence and unity in the collective consciousness of Germany" and caused the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Maharishi's Programme to Create World Peace led to fall of Berlin Wall: Rising coherence in national and world consciousness|publisher=Global Good News|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=29 August 2010|url=http://www.globalgoodnews.com/world-peace-a.html?art=12578119332103873|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724122036/http://www.globalgoodnews.com/world-peace-a.html?art=12578119332103873|dead-url=no|archivedate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin |title=Weird water &amp; fuzzy logic: more notes of a fringe watcher|year=1996|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=1573920967|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-11-03/news/9002230201_1_transcendental-meditation-mass-meditation-maharishi-mahesh-yogi|title=U.s. Meditation Believers Seek To Give Peace A Chant|last=Cummins|first=Ken|date=November 3, 1990|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One religion scholar, Michael York, considers the Maharishi to have been the most articulate spokesman for the spiritual argument that a critical mass of people becoming enlightened through the practice of "meditation and yogic discipline" will trigger the New Age movement's hoped-for period of [[postmillennial]] "peace, harmony, and collective consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nng-dAooleAC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Maharishi+millennialism&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | editor-last = Barger | editor-first = Helen A. | last=York|first=Michael|chapter=New Age and Magic|page=16|title = Witchcraft and Magic: Contemporary North America | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8122-1971-5 | work = books.google.com | accessdate = 2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious studies scholar Carl Olson writes that the TM technique was based on "a neo-Vedanta metaphysical philosophy in which an unchanging reality is opposed to an ever-changing phenomenal world" and that the Maharishi says it is not necessary to renounce worldly activities to gain enlightenment, unlike other ascetic traditions.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

According to author Jack Forem, the Maharishi stated that the experience of transcendence, which resulted in a naturally increasing refinement of mind and body, enabled people to naturally behave in more correct ways. Thus, behavioral guidelines did not need to be issued, and were best left to the teachings of various religions: "It is much easier to raise a man's consciousness than to get him to act righteously" the Maharishi said.&lt;ref name="Forem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forem|first=Jack|title=Transcendental Meditation-The classic text revised and updated|edition=2nd|year=2012|publisher=Hay House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4019-3156-8|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some religious studies scholars have further said that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is one of a number of Indian [[guru]]s who brought [[Hinduism in the West|neo-Hindu]] adaptations of [[Vedantic Hinduism]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-first=Jacob |editor-last=Neusner|first=Gerald James|last=Larson|chapter=Hinduism in India and in America|title=World Religions in America: An Introduction|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-664-23320-4|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alper|first=Harvey P.|title=Understanding mantras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8Upy4ApG_oC&amp;pg=PA442|date=December 1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0746-4|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raj|first1=Selva J.|author2=William P.

R. Coplin, a sociologist and MIU graduate, says that the Maharishi saw his own purpose as "the 'revival' of the knowledge of an integrated life based upon Vedic principles and Vedantist reality".&lt;ref name=Coplin3/&gt;

Author Barry Miles writes that, in spite of the media's scepticism for the Maharishi's spiritual message, they seized upon him because young people seemed to listen to his pro-establishment, anti-drug message with one TM participant saying the Maharishi "signaled the beginning of the post-acid generation".&lt;ref name=Needleman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barry/&gt;

===Transcendental Meditation===
{{Main|Transcendental Meditation}}
During a CNN interview in 2002, the Maharishi said "Transcendental meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results".&lt;ref name="van den Berg"/&gt; His movement offered in-residence style TM advanced courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.invincibleamerica.org/press/2006_07_25.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sPYDqhks?url=http://invincibleamerica.org/press/2006_07_25.html|archivedate=1 September 2010|title=More than 1200 Yogic Flyers Assemble in Washington, D.C., and Iowa to Promote Invincibility in America and Permanent World Peace|publisher=Invincible America|date=25 July 2006|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, there were nearly 1,000 TM training centres around the world.&lt;ref name=Times0882/&gt;

The Maharishi is credited as having contributed to the western world a meditation technique that is both simple and systematic as well as introducing the scientific study of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Phiilip|title=American Veda|year=2010|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-52134-5|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1970s, the Maharishi began the [[TM-Sidhi program]]me, which included Yogic Flying, as an additional option for those who had been practising the Transcendental Meditation technique for some time. According to Coplin, this new aspect of knowledge emphasised not only the individual, but also the collective benefits created by group practice of this advanced programme.&lt;ref&gt;Coplin, J. R. (1990) p. 71 {{Request quotation|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new programme gave rise to a new principle called the ''[[Transcendental Meditation#Maharishi Effect|Maharishi Effect]]'', which is said to "create coherence in the collective consciousness" and to suppress crime, violence, and accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Musicians Spread the Maharishi's Message of Peace|first=GREGG |last=WAGER|work=Los Angeles Times |date=11 December 1987|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Beacon Light of the Himalayas''====
In 1955, the organisers of the Great Spiritual Development Conference of Kerala published ''The Beacon Light of the Himalayas'', a transcribed 170-page "souvenir" of the conference. Authors Chryssides, Humes and Forsthoefel, Miller, and Russel cite this as the Maharishi's first published book on Transcendental Meditation, although Transcendental Meditation is not mentioned in the text of the book.&lt;ref name="paulmason.info"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.paulmason.info/gurudev/sources/pdf/Beacon%20Light%20of%20the%20HImalayas.pdf |author=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|title=Beacon Light of the Himalayas|year=1955|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxIxPBpGMwgC|last= Chryssides|first=George D.|title=Exploring New Religions|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8264-5959-6 |page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humes 2005 77"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugSb7mArJlYC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=beacon+light+of+the+himalayas#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |last1=Forsthoefel|first1=Thomas A. |last2=Humes|first2=Cynthia Ann|title=Gurus in America|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7914-6573-8|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=og_u0Re1uwUC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=beacon+light+of+the+himalayas#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |last=Miller|first=Timothy|title=America's Alternative Religions|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7914-2397-4|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ89AAAAIAAJ|last=Russell|first=Peter|title=The T.M.

====''Science of Being and Art of Living''====
In 1963, the Maharishi audiotaped the text of the book ''Science of Being and Art of Living'', which was later transcribed and published in fifteen languages.&lt;ref name="van den Berg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1986) p. 459, "There was not much time for writing a book, so Maharishi said, 'I'll speak it out on tape, and then you'll get it printed'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|editor1-first= Lindsay |editor1-last=Jones|location=Detroit|publisher=Macmillan Reference |page=3|isbn=0-02-865981-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
K.T. Weidmann describes the book as the  Maharishi's fundamental philosophical treatise, one in which its author provides an illustration of the ancient Vedic traditions of India in terms that can be easily interpreted and understood by the scientific thinking of the western world.&lt;ref name=" Dehsen"/&gt; In the ''Science of Being'', the Maharishi illustrates the concepts of relative existence as the experience of everyday reality through one's senses, and absolute reality as the origin of being, and the source of all creative intelligence.&lt;ref name="Caveat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bono|first=Joseph|title=Caveat Emptor, Let the Buyer Beware: A Consumers Guide To Mental Health Services [Paperback]|date=September 11, 2006|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1425945633|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maharishi describes this absolute reality, or Being, as unchanging, omnipresent, and eternal. He also identifies it with bliss consciousness. The two aspects of reality, the relative and the absolute, are like an ocean with many waves.&lt;ref name="OlsonC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-Historical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&amp;dq=the+science+of+being+and+the+art+of+living&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813540689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waves represent the relative, and the ocean beneath is the foundation of everything, or Being. Establishing oneself in the field of Being, or unchanging reality, ensures stability.&lt;ref name="OlsonC"/&gt;

In his ''Science of Being'' the Maharishi introduced an additional concept: that of fulfillment viewed as something to be obtained not through exertion or self effort, but through the progressive settling of the mind during the practice of TM.&lt;ref name="Caveat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Peter|title=From Science to God: A Physicist's Journey Into the Mystery of Consciousness|year=2011|publisher=New World Library|isbn= 9781577319917|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first full systematic description of the principles underlying the Maharishi's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wujastyk|first1=Dagmar|last2=Smith|first2=Frederick M.|title=Modern and Global Ayurveda: Pluralism and Paradigms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3XBu-vpXgoC&amp;dq=The+science+of+Being+and+art+of+living&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|date=July 10, 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn= 9780791478165|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary'': 1967====
In his 1967 publication, ''Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary'', the Maharishi describes the Bhagavad Gita as "the Scripture of Yoga". He says that "its purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level."&lt;ref name=gita20-21&gt;{{Cite book|author=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|year=1969|title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita : A New Translation and Commentary, Chapters 1–6|location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=20–21|isbn=978-0-14-019247-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Russell, the Bhagavad-Gita deals with the concept of loss of knowledge and subsequent revival, and this is brought out by the Maharishi himself in the introduction.&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russel|first=Peter|title=The TM Technique|edition=4th|year=2002|publisher=Elf Rock Productions|isbn=1-928586-07-4|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Preface, the Maharishi writes: "The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching.  If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also."&lt;ref name=gita17&gt;Yogi, Maharishi Mahesh (1969) page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A second concept, that of freedom, presented as the antithesis of fear, is also prevalent in the book, according to Jack Forem.&lt;ref&gt;Forem, p. 274 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Forem states that in his interpretation of the Gita, the Maharishi expressed several times that as man gains greater awareness through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, he gradually establishes a level of contentment which remain increasingly grounded within him and in which the mind does not waver and is not affected by either attachment or fear.&lt;ref&gt;Forem, p. 275 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Paul Mason's web site says that Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of [[Jyotir Math]],  is "an outspoken critic" of the Maharishi.  According to Swaroopananda, the Maharishi "was responsible for the [[Jyotir Math#1954 to present|controversy over Shankaracharyas]]"  because he gave Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand encouragement and assistance in fighting the court case which challenged Shantanand's inheritance of the title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120905202522/http://www.paulmason.info/gurudev/TheLastInstruction.html] Paul Mason, The Last Instruction, Retrieved 24 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In a review of the documentary film ''[[David Wants to Fly]]'',  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine reported Swaroopananda's assertion that "as a member of the trader class" the Maharishi "has no right to give mantras or teach meditation".&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942181.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |last=Simon|first=Alyssa|title=David Wants to Fly|work=Variety|date=14 February 2010}} [Swami Swaroopanand, successor to Guru Dev, in a village near Tibet.

Nonetheless, he shares with the last two Shankaracharyas of Jyotir Math (who succeeded Brahmanand Saraswati) a brotherly relationship, known as "guru-bhais". Even today, Swami Vishnudevanand (the current Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math) speaks very highly of Maharishi and sees his teaching as a reflection of their master's. Both he and Swami Shantanand (his immediate predecessor) are frequent guests of Maharishi's both in India and abroad, personally endorsing his mission.".... "When Maharishi began teaching during his South Indian tour in the mid-1950s, he arrived as an informal representative of the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, being a 'great disciple of Shri Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (former Shankaracharya)'".&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biography of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, The Story of the Maharishi (published 1976), William Jefferson suggests that the financial aspect of the TM organisation was one of the greatest controversies it faced. Questions were raised about the Maharishi's mission, comments from leaders of the movement at that time, and fees and charges the TM organisation levied on followers. Jefferson says that the concerns with money came from journalists more than those who have learned to meditate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jefferson|first= William|title=The Story of the Maharishi|publisher=Pocket Books (Simon and Schuster)|location=New York|year=1976|oclc=2737863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milena Rudnytska''' ({{lang-uk|Мілена Рудницька}}: 15 July 1892 – 29 March 1976) was a Ukrainian educator, women's activist, politician and writer. One of the most influential voices in the interwar period of the Galician women's movement leadership, she published articles in various periodicals. As a member of the [[Polish Sejm]] between 1928 and 1935, she brought issues of suppression by government authorities to the world stage, including the Polish regime's efforts to repress the culture of minority Ukrainians and the Soviet regime's denial of starvation in Ukraine during the [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine of 1932-1933]]. With the Soviet and Nazi occupations of Ukraine, Rudnytska fled the country and remained an exile for the remainder of her days, publishing books and articles as she moved throughout Europe and the United States.

==Early life==
Milena Rudnytska was born on 15 July 1892 in [[Zboriv]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to Olga (née Ida Spiegel) and Ivan Rudnytsky.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=470}}{{sfn|Rudnytsky|1987|p=xvi}} The third child and only daughter in the family of intellectuals. Rudnytska's father descended from the Ukrainian gentry{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=470}} and after finishing a law degree at [[Lviv University]], worked as a notary in western Ukraine.{{sfn|Онишко|2012}} Her mother, was from a [[Galician Jews|Galician Jewish]] family of merchants. Their union had been opposed by both of their families and the couple delayed marrying for almost a decade, because one could not marry before age twenty-four without parental consent. When Ida left home, converted to Christianity and changed her name to Olga,{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=470}}{{sfn|Чорновол|2007}} the two finally married and subsequently had five children: {{ill|Myhailo Rudnytsky|lt=Myhailo|uk|Рудницький Михайло Іванович}} (1889–1975), a  [[philologist]]; Volodymyr  (1891–1975), a  lawyer; Milena; {{ill|Ivan Kedrin-Rudnitsky|lt=Ivan|uk|Кедрин Іван}} (1896–1995) a [[publicist]] and [[essayist]]; and Antin (1902–1975) composer and conductor of the Kiev opera.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=470}}{{sfn|Rudnytsky|1987|p=xvi}}

Rudnytska's family spoke [[Polish language|Polish]]{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=470}} at home and her mother never gained a proficiency with [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], though she raised her children as Ukraininan nationals.{{sfn|Rudnytsky|1987|p=xvi}} Close to her father, Rudnytska was profoundly affected by his death in 1906,{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=471}} which precipitated the family move to [[Lviv]]. She undertook her primary lessons at home, but then attended the Classical Gymnasium of Lviv and then in 1910 entered Lviv University to study philosophy, later graduating with a teaching degree in philosophy and mathematics.{{sfn|Онишко|2012}} During [[World War I]] the family lived in [[Vienna]],{{sfn|Онишко|2012}} where Rudnytska studied at the [[University of Vienna]] until 1917 receiving a degree in [[pedagogy]] and though she began work on a doctoral program, she did not complete it.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=471}}

==Career==
Rudnytska began working as a journalist on the biweekly editorial ''Наша Мета'' (Our goal) in 1918.{{sfn|Чорновол|2007}} The following year, she married {{ill|Pavlo Lysiak|uk|Лисяк Павло}} a lawyer politician who had also studied at Lviv and was living in Austria.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=471}}{{sfn|Сніцаpчук|2016}} By the end of the year, the couple had their only child, {{ill|Ivan Lysiak Rudnytsky|lt=Ivan|uk|Лисяк-Рудницький Іван Павлович}} and their home quickly became a gathering place for leaders of the Ukrainian intellectual community living in Vienna.{{sfn|Rudnytsky|1987|p=xvi}} Back home in Galicia the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] had resulted in a territorial transfer to the Polish state and adoption of policies to suppress minority populations. Though Rudnytska supported the Ukrainian national movement, she felt that women had been assigned inferior roles. She began to focus her attention on organizing women and involving them in raising the civic consciousness of a Ukrainian Nation. Returning to Lviv in 1920,{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=471}} Rudnytska and her husband soon separated. Her son, raised among her family, subsequently adopted her surname as his own.{{sfn|Rudnytsky|1987|p=xvi}}

Rudnytska became one of the leading activists of the [[Ukrainian Women's Union]] ({{lang-uk|Союз українок}}), which she helped found in 1920 and along with other members of the leadership, including {{ill|Olena Fedak Sheparovych|uk|Федак-Шепарович Олена}}, Iryna Sichynska, {{ill|Olga Tsipanovska|uk|Ціпановська Ольга}} and others, organized women's journals, conferences, and cooperatives.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=472}} Around the same time, in 1921 she began working in the [[Normal School|Teacher's Seminary]] and later worked at the Higher Pedagogical Institute, both in Lviv, but in 1928, she stopped teaching and turned her focus entirely to social and political issues.{{sfn|Онишко|2012}}{{sfn|Чорновол|2007}}{{sfn|Гавришко|2010}} Having joined the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]], Rudnytska was elected to serve in the [[Polish Sejm]] in 1928 as a party representative, serving through 1935.{{sfn|Гавришко|2010}} That same year, she was elected as president of the Woman's Union and served in that capacity until 1939.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=472}} Until 1939, she continued her journalistic endeavors as well publishing with several feminist journals like, ''Woman'' ({{lang-uk|жінка}}), ''Woman-citizen'' ({{lang-uk|Громадянина}}), ''Ukrainian Woman'' ({{lang-uk|Українка}}) and edited the woman's page of the Ukrainian daily newspaper ''Action'' ({{lang-uk|газета дію}}).{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=472}}{{sfn|Чорновол|2007}}

In Parliament, Rudnytska was a staunch advocate for Ukraine and criticized the Polish authorities for suppressing Ukrainian culture including their schools and religious institutions. Serving on committees for education and foreign affairs, she gave many speeches and was known as a charismatic orator. In 1931, she was one of three delegates from Ukraine to present the case against the Polish officials to the [[League of Nations]], calling the suppression a "pacification campaign" to silence the Ukrainian minority population. She was also invited to speak on the issue at the [[British House Of Commons]].{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=473}} During the [[Holodomor|1932-1933 famine]] she was elected vice chair of the Public Rescue Committee, and organized meetings including politicians, scientists, and educators to address the issue and provide famine relief. Through her international ties with women's organizations, Rudnytska was selected to seek international aid support and bring the situation to the attention of the League of Nations.{{sfn|Онишко|2012}}

[[File:Milena-rudnytska-es.jpg|thumb|People of truth. There were those who spoke the truth about Holodomor. For the world to know. "The Great Hambruns (Holodomor) was the biggest catastrophe in Ukraine—both in terms of number of victims and human suffering" ~ Milena Rudnytska, 2015 remembrance of the Holodomor]]
On 29 September 1933, in [[Geneva]] 14 countries met and Rudnytska along with the other members of the Ukrainian delegation presented their findings about the famine and the need for international assistance. After several hours, the League decision was that the famine was an internal problem of the [[USSR]], which was not a member of the League and therefore no help would be forthcoming. The delegation then turned toward the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) with a plea for help. ICRC officials contacted Soviet officials to gain approval for the Red Cross to organize international aid for Ukraine, but the head of the Soviet [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent Society]], [[Avel Yenukidze]] denied that there was any famine in Ukraine. Rudnytska spoke at another international conference held in [[Vienna]] in December 1933 urging that the international community pressure the [[Stalinist regime]] to admit there was a crisis and allow aid. Denial continued and information about the nature and scope of the famine was suppressed. In 1958, Rudnytska's book, ''Боротьба за правду про Великий Голод'' (Fighting for the truth about the Great Famine) took the stance that the famine was a result of organized pressure by the Kremlin to "fracture Ukrainian peasants using collectivization to curb the rebellious Ukrainian people".{{sfn|Онишко|2012}}

In the [[interwar period]], Rudnytska was one of the strongest voices in the Ukrainian women's movement. When [[Hitler]] came to power in 1933, she evaluated the changes which almost immediately were made restricting women's lives. Laws passed by the [[Third Reich]] barred women from employment in the civil service, enacted quotas for the number of women who had access to higher education, refused women admittance to the legal profession, among other changes. In response to these actions, Rudnytska wrote a satirical article which appeared in the magazine ''Women's Voice'' characterizing the regime's view of women as monsters, who had no purpose other than to cook, clean and bear children. At a time when Ukrainian women had developed a premise that the ideal woman was one committed to political awareness and social enterprise, who made a conscious choice when or if motherhood should occur, the German view caused serious reservations and attempts to organize motherhood schools in German-occupied territories were resisted.{{sfn|Гавришко|2010}} Rudnytska helped organize the First Ukrainian Women's Congress in 1934 which was held in [[Stanyslaviv]] and then in 1937 was elected as president of the World Union of Ukrainian Women.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''|1993}} During the late 1930s, the Polish government closely watched members of the Women's Union, arresting some of the leadership and trying to ban the organization entirely.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=473}}

In 1939, during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the [[Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, Volhynia and Northern Bukovina|regime annexed Galicia]] forcing national-oriented activists to flee.{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=474}} Fearful of repressions by the Soviet regime Rudnytska moved to [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi-occupied]] [[Kraków]]. Later, in 1940, she moved on to [[Berlin]], where her son was finishing his studied, begun already in Lviv{{sfn|Himka|2014}}. In 1943, she arrived in [[Prague]], where she published her book, ''Zakhidna Ukraina pid bolshevykamy'' (Western Ukraine under the Bolsheviks) in 1944. Continuing to write in exile, she moved to [[Berlin]]{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=474}} and then directed the Ukrainian Relief Committee in Geneva between 1945 and 1950.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''|1993}} In 1950 moved to [[New York City]], where she remained for eight years, before returning to Europe,{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=474}} first moving to [[Rome]] and finally settling in Munich. Some of her most known publications include: "''Ukraïns’ka diisnist’ i zavdannia zhinochoho rukhu'' (The Ukrainian Reality and the Tasks of the Women's Movement, 1934), ''Don Bosko: Liudyna, pedahoh, sviatyi'' (Don Bosco: Man, Pedagogue, and Saint, 1963), and ''Nevydymi styhmaty'' (The Invisible Stigmata, 1971)".{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''|1993}}

==Death and legacy==
Rudnytska died on 29 March 1979 in [[Munich]]. Her remains were reburied in Lviv in 1993{{sfn|Zhurzhenko|2006|p=474}} in the Lychakiv Cemetery, beside other family members.{{sfn|Чорновол|2007}} In 1994, Irene Martyniuk published a book, ''Milena Rudnytska and Ukrainian Feminism: The Art of the Possible'', evaluating Rudnytska's role in the women's movement in Ukraine.{{sfn|Martyniuk|1994}} In 1998, ''Мілена Рудницька. Статті. Листи, документи'' (Milena Rudnytska. Articles. Letters, documents) were edited by Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Miroslava Dyadyuk and Jaroslav Pelensky and published with the support of the Union of Ukrainian Americans.{{sfn|Гудзик|2001}}

The '''nature study''' movement (alternatively, '''Nature Study''' or '''nature-study''') was a popular education movement in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Nature study attempted to reconcile scientific investigation with spiritual, personal experiences gained from interaction with the natural world.  Led by [[progressive education|progressive]] educators and naturalists such as [[Anna Botsford Comstock]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Wilbur S. Jackman]], nature study changed the way science was taught in schools by emphasizing learning from tangible objects, something that was embodied by the movement's mantra "study nature, not books".

The movement popularized scientific study outside of the classroom as well, and has proven highly influential for figures involved in the modern environmental movement, such as [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Rachel Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the mid-19th century, a growing concern for the state of the environment began to take shape.  In 1864, American diplomat [[George Perkins Marsh]] published the groundbreaking book ''[[Man and Nature]]''.  Highlighting people's responsibility to the natural world, the work marked the beginning of the conservation movement.&lt;ref&gt;Krech, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1890s, the idea of nature study existed, but the "efforts had been sporadic and piecemeal".&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 327"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturalist Louis Agassiz wanted to capture "learners in studying the natural world".  His students, who were influenced by this philosophy, went on to provide the nature study knowledge in public schools.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 325"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;   It was Agassiz who coined the phrase, "Study nature, not books."&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 325"/&gt;

==Definitions==
Nature study can be described as "conceiving of the movement as a loose coalition of communities composed of individuals, societies, and institutions able to find some common ground in the study and appreciation of the natural world".&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 128"&gt;Tolley, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  In "Leaflet I: What Is Nature-Study?" from a 1904 collection nature study lessons, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] presented the following description of nature study:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NATURE-STUDY, as a process, is seeing the things that one looks at, and the drawing of proper conclusions from what one sees.  Its purpose is to educate the child in terms of his environment, to the end that his life may be fuller and richer.  Nature-study is not the study of a science, as of botany, entomology, geology, and the like.  That is, it takes the things at hand and endeavors to understand them, without reference primarily to the systematic order or relationships of objects.  It is informal, as are the objects which one sees.  It is entirely divorced from mere definitions, or from formal explanations in books.  It is therefore supremely natural.  It trains the eye and the mind to see and to comprehend the common things of life; and the result is not directly the acquiring of science but the establishing of a living sympathy with everything that is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anna Comstock defined the idea extensively in her book, ''Handbook of Nature Study'':  "Nature Study is for the comprehension of the Individual life of the bird, insect or plant that is nearest at hand."&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 5"&gt;Comstock, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Comstock continued that nature study aided "both discernment and in expression of things as they are".&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 1"&gt;Comstock, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement came at a time when society was concerned with the future of the next generation&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", pp. ?-?&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[conservation movement|nature conservation]] itself,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Tolley, pp. ?-?&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this was met with high regard and high expectations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Though many efforts had come before 1890 by some naturalist and scientists to teach and expand the movement, the nature-study movement really did not gain momentum with the public until the late 19th century, early 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Nature Study changed the curriculum for children in many of areas of the country,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and it also affected the way young and teenage girls were able to learn and find job placement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The movement was often related to creating a less extensive or formal science training for females. {{citation needed|reason=claim not substantiated by previous text|date=July 2015}}

=="Study nature, not books"==
Many scientists, teachers, and leaders throughout the United States agreed on the value of nature study, and the subject became an important part of how the natural world was examined in many areas of the country by the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists gave public support to the philosophy and added to the creation of a curriculum and courses.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 327"/&gt;  The movement was particularly popular in the Northeast, the West, and the Midwest.  The South also found some use for the idea of natural science in their agriculture schools, as well as at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama (now [[Tuskegee University]]) and Hampton Institute in Virginia (now [[Hampton University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature Study could be found in both urbanized, highly populated cities and in rural school systems because of the involvement of scientists in designing and implementing curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Wilbur Jackman created an outline of nature study with "life and its phenomena" which examined how the study of plants and animals would consist of zoology and botany (under biology), physics, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, geography, geology, and mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucretia Crocker]] along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.   Along with a [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.   Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Nature Study Society was founded in 1908, and still exists today.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"&gt;Tolley, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  The society was an important aspect as well in helping to bring about the Nature-Study movement. [[Anna Botsford Comstock]] is one of the society' past presidents.  It is considered to be America's oldest organization for environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirolink.org/resource.html?catid=5&amp;itemid=84 The American Nature Study Society]. EnviroLink Network. Retrieved on June 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Botsford Comstock]] studied and worked as the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University with her husband, [[John Henry Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrick and Smith, caption of p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Cornell University was considered to be a major hub for the Nature Study movement.   She wrote the ''Handbook of Nature Study'', which includes sections on how to teach the subject and how to teach the courses to children, and also includes sections from different species of animals and plants to even the skies.

==Education for children==
Sciences were expanding in colleges and universities, and scientists felt "that students needed more and better preparation in secondary and primary schools".&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 329"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only was the curriculum of schools evolving, but also was the system of education itself.  Populations were rising in big urban areas like New York and Chicago, and there was legislation to require students to spend required numbers of hours and days per year in the school system.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 329"/&gt;  With a growing population due to immigration and other reasons, young people could be taught useful skills for life and academia in order to "share fundamental civic values and enlarged view of their world".&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature study became the way younger students learned of their natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  This also came at a time when legislation was being passed for conservation in the country, which helped gather support from parents and educators in the country.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"/&gt;

Anna Botsford Comstock, stated in her book ''Handbook of Nature Study'', "nature-study cultivates the child's imagination, since there are so many wonderful and true stories that he may read with his own eyes, which affect his imagination as much as does fairy lore, at the same time nature study cultivates in him a perception and a regard for what is true, and the power to express it...Nature study gives the child practical and helpful knowledge.  It makes him familiar with nature's ways and forces, so that he is not so helpless in the presence of natural misfortune and disasters."&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 1"/&gt;  Comstock also felt that the nature study did not begin with books, but through the observations of life and form from the first naturalists.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, p. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of the system being to "give pupils an outlook over all the forms of life and their relation one to another".&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 5"/&gt;

Because of the importance placed on the new generation, the surrounding public watched the schools carefully with high expectations of the students in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in Kim Tolley's the ''Science Education of American Girls'' showed that of 127 public school systems, 49% offered Nature-study in all grades, 25% offered in at least six grades, 11% in at least four grades, 5% in three grades or lower, and 10% did not offer it at all in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in the movement==
Women played many roles in this movement within American society.  Some were able to find supervisory jobs, or jobs as professor in natural history at school districts, or institutions of higher learning.  Some women helped to create the movement itself, like Anna Botsford Comstock, and also teachers were able to "[implement] nature study to varying degrees in their classrooms and occasionally modified the curriculum created by male professionals so that it favored the life sciences".&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"/&gt;

Over the four years from 1915–16 to 1919–20 in the state of  [[Wisconsin]], the percentage of women high school biology teachers increased from 50% to 67%.  The number of women physics teachers increased from 3% in 1915–16 to 7% in 1919–20.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature study movement gave a new outlook to the [[education of young women]] in the United States. In the later 20th century, opinions started to change about the movement, and it declined.  Some male critics saw it as "romantic" or "sentimental".  This created a gender issue that was forcibly imposed on the nature-study movement.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 128"/&gt;  By the beginning of the 20th century, many young women were attracted to the natural history movement.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The Science Education of American Girls by Kim Tolley gives an explanation of high schools in America for females.  "Higher schools for females served as important centers for the dissemination of the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, institutions commonly located in small towns and in rural, rather than urban, areas.  The ideology prevailed in antebellum southern institutions serving elite girls who never expected to work for wages outside the home, in northern schools that explicitly south to prepare teachers for the nation's growing common schools, and in Catholic academies on the western front."&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Susanna Moodie]], and her daughter [[Agnes_Dunbar_Moodie_Fitzgibbon|Agnes Chamberlin]] who made nature studies to support her family, and Catharine Parr Traill investigated nature to describe the new territories where they found themselves in nineteenth century Canada.&lt;ref&gt;https://fishercollections.library.utoronto.ca/chamberlin_chrono&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2243">'''Ninel Alexandrovna Kurgapkina''' ({{lang-ru|Нинель Александровна Кургапкина}}; 13 February 1929 in [[Leningrad]] &amp;ndash; 8 May 2009, near [[St. Petersburg]]) was a [[Russia]]n dance teacher and former [[prima ballerina]] for the [[Kirov Ballet]] with over 50 years stage experience. She was named a [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1974.

Ninel Kurgapkina was one of the last pupils of [[Agrippina Vaganova]]. She graduated her ballet school and joined the [[Kirov Ballet]] in 1947, where she danced such roles as Aurora (''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]''), Myrtha (''[[Giselle]]''), Odette-Odile (''[[Swan Lake]]''), Kitri (''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'') and Parasha (''[[Reinhold Glière|The Bronze Horseman]]''). 

Despite their age difference, Ninel Kurgapkina was the first female ballet partner to [[Rudolf Nureyev]], and later also to [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], both of whom were trained at the Kirov.

From 1969 she was a primary coach at the Kirov and also taught master classes at institutions including the [[New York City Ballet]], the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], and the [[La Scala|La Scala Opera Ballet]]. She was appointed a director of the [[Vaganova Academy]] in 1972. She was an
Associate Ballet Mistress at the Masterpiece Dance Theatre since 1994.

==Death==
She died, aged 80, in a road accident near [[St. Petersburg]], on 8 May 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''P-20 longitudinal data systems''' are state-level educational databases in the United States designed "to capture, analyze, and use student data from preschool to high school, college, and the workforce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| date = July 2009

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
These databases are developed on different models in different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve elements are required in these systems:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* A unique identifier for every student that does not permit a student to be individually identified (except as permitted by federal and state law);
* The school enrollment history, demographic characteristics, and program participation record of every student;
* Information on when a student enrolls, transfers, drops out, or graduates from a school;
* Students' scores on tests required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act;
* Information on students who are not tested, by grade and subject;
* Students' scores on tests measuring whether they're ready for college;
* A way to identify teachers and to match teachers to their students;
* Information from students' transcripts, specifically courses taken and grades earned;
* Data on students' success in college, including whether they enrolled in remedial courses;
* Data on whether K-12 students are prepared to succeed in college;
* A system of auditing data for quality, validity, and reliability; and
* The ability to share data from preschool through postsecondary education data systems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Privacy and data mining concerns ==
Under the Obama Administration, over 1 billion dollars has been spent in developing databases designed for improving the educational system, including P-20 [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal data]] systems. Although these databases contain extensive [[personally identifiable information]], much of this information is "not kept in a format that allows officials to easily extract the complete file on any one child."&lt;ref name="politico2014"&gt;

{{As of|2014|June}}, parents concerned about student privacy and [[data mining]] of student information have begun to organize opposition at the state level:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We don’t know what they’re tracking and we don’t know what the implications are going to be for these children in the future ... Going for jobs in the future, trying to get into college — we’re in uncharted territory and we just don’t know the implication it’s going to have for the children. We need to slow down.”&lt;ref name = "politico2014" /&gt;

The Danish College of Pharmacy Practice is a tertiary [[education]]al institution of [[pharmaceutical sciences]] that offers the [[higher education]] programme of [[pharmaconomy]].

Each year, approximately 220 [[high school graduate]]s with special [[skill]]s are allowed to begin the [[Research|studies]] of pharmaconomy as [[pharmaconomist]] [[student]]s at The Danish College of Pharmacy Practice.

With about 602 pharmaconomy students, Pharmakon—Danish College of Pharmacy Practice is the only college in Denmark (including [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands]]) to offer the pharmaconomist education programme.

==International affairs==
Pharmakon—Danish College of Pharmacy Practice plays an active role in the international arena. In 1996, it was designated as a [[WHO]] Collaborating Centre for Drug Policy and Pharmacy Practice.

Furthermore, the College hosted the secretariats of the Community Pharmacy Section of the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] and the [[EuroPharm Forum]].

'''PrepMe''' is a for-profit [[United States|American]] company that offers online courses and tutoring for standardized achievement tests, in particular those offered by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS), such as the [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] and [[SAT]]; and the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] offered by ACT, Inc. PrepMe also developed its Coursification platform to open its adaptive online learning platform to publishers.Over 100,000 students have used the company's programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zak |last=Strambor |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Venture Prone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/18/blackboard-buyer-providence-equity-acquires-personalized-online-learning-platform-from-prepme/|work= |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2011-07-18 |quote=More than  Over 100,000 students have used courses built on PrepMe’s platform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in 2001 by [[Avichal Garg]], Karan Goel, and Joe Jewell, [[Stanford]], [[University of Chicago]], and [[Caltech]] students respectively. It is based in [[Chicago]] with a software engineering team in [[Palo Alto, California]].  One of the company's co-founders, [[Avichal Garg]], a former Google product manager, raised investment capital from other former Google employees to fund PrepMe. The company was incubated at the University of Chicago [[Booth School of Business]]' Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship after it won the university's 2005 New Venture Challenge.

On February 1, 2007, Maine governor [[John Baldacci]] announced that for three years PrepMe planned to let every junior in Maine use its online SAT preparation program without cost to themselves, their school, or the state.  [http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Portal+News&amp;id=29425&amp;v=article-2006 Office of the Governor Release].

In 2008, PrepMe was recognized at the [[Chicago Innovation Awards]] and was featured on the front cover of [[Fortune Small Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Schonwald |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=College alumnus becomes first-place entrepreneur |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/051103/entrepreneur.shtml |work= |publisher=University of Chicago Chronicle |date=2005-11-23 |accessdate=2009-03-17 |quote=The prize, which the magazine announced this month as its cover story, will give Goel’s new company PrepMe.com $35,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[education]], '''realia''' (/riˈeɪˌliˌə/ pron. ree-ay-lee-ah) are objects from real life used in [[Classroom_management|classroom instruction]] by educators to improve students' understanding of other cultures and real life situations. A teacher of a [[language acquisition|foreign language]] often employs realia to strengthen students' associations between words for common objects and the objects themselves. In many cases, these objects are part of an instructional kit which includes a manual and is thus considered as being part of a documentary whole by librarians.

Realia are also used to connect learners with the key focal point of a lesson by allowing tactile and multidimensional connection between learned material and the object of the lesson. They are best represented by simple objects lending themselves to classroom settings and ease of control with minimum risk of accident throughout the student-object interaction.

Technology has begun to impact the use of realia by adding the [[Virtual_reality|virtual realia option]], whereby three-dimensional models can be displayed through projection or on computer screens, allowing the learner to see detail otherwise difficult to acquire and to manipulate the object within the medium on which it is displayed. The option of zooming and looking within objects makes virtual realia an important learning tool in technical environments where it may be difficult or impractical to examine an object in as much detail manually, such as the workings of living organs or machinery containing hazardous parts, such as combustion engines.

Abramson has been a columnist for ''[[Indiewire]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and ''[[Poets &amp; Writers]]'' on subjects ranging from politics to higher education and [[metamodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;"On American Metamodernism," ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' (February 7, 2014).

[http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/a-new-press-play-column-seth-abramsons-metamericana-is-martin-scorseses-latest-offering-unbelievable-on-purpose]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' notes that Abramson has "picked up a very large following as a blogger and commentator, covering poetry, politics, and higher education, and generating a controversial, ''U.S. News''-style ranking of graduate programs in writing."&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Northerners,'' ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' (May 2011). [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-930974-96-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative writing===
Abramson has published a number of poetry books and anthologies. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' describes Abramson as "serious and ambitious...uncommonly interested in general statements, in hard questions, and harder answers, about how to live."&lt;ref&gt;''Northerners'', [[Publishers Weekly]] (Review). [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-930974-96-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Colorado Review]]'' called ''Northerners'', Abramson's second collection of poetry, "alternately expansive and deeply personal...of crystalline beauty and complexity," terming Abramson "a major American voice."&lt;ref&gt;''Northerners'' (review), ''[[Colorado Review]]''. [http://coloradoreview.colostate.edu/reviews/northerners/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Notre Dame Review]]'' echoed the sentiment, calling Abramson "a powerful voice."&lt;ref&gt;"From Ruin to Rebirth," ''[[Notre Dame Review]]''. [http://ndreview.nd.edu/assets/60036/ripatrazone_review.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abramson won the 2008 J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize from ''[[Poetry magazine|Poetry]]''. Editor [[Don Share]] said of Abramson's "What I Have," "The poem absorbs certain details but doesn't fasten upon them the way poets are tempted to do; it's not adjectival, it's not descriptive, it's not painting a kind of canvas with scenery on it, and yet those details are really fascinating."&lt;ref&gt;"You're Always Moving Toward Silence," ''[[Poetry magazine|Poetry]]'' (March 2009 Poetry Foundation Podcast). [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/audioitem.html?id=727]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Best American Experimental Writing''===
Abramson, with the poet [[Jesse Damiani]], has been series co-editor of the annual anthology of innovative verse, ''Best American Experimental Writing'', since its inception with Omnidawn in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"Best American Experimental Writing Anthology Announced," [[The Poetry Foundation]] (November 12, 2012).

=== Trump-Russia investigation ===
After the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Abramson received widespread attention for his tweets alleging collusion between the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] and the Russian government. By synthesizing reporting from major news outlets, Abramson has documented repeated contacts between multiple members of the Trump campaign and the political network surrounding Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=941120497823215616|user=SethAbramson|title=From Russian payments to Trump advisors to failing to register as foreign agents working for Putin allies—from perjury to illegal solicitation of campaign donations from the Kremlin—here's a non-exhaustive summary of known Trump-Russia ties.|date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the timing, publicly known content, and personnel involved in those meetings, Abramson suggests that, through intermediaries, Trump and Putin came to an understanding in 2013 that Trump would run for president and push for an end to U.S. sanctions against Russia, and that Putin would in return greenlight a multibillion dollar Trump Tower Moscow deal and other potential Trump ventures in Russia while using Russian capabilities to aid the Trump campaign.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/12/06/people-cant-stop-reading-a-professors-theory-of-a-trump-russia-conspiracy-true-or-not/|title=People can't stop reading a professor's theory of a Trump-Russia conspiracy — true or not|last=Selk|first=Avi|date=December 6, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers at several media publications – including ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/142977/new-paranoia-trump-election-turns-democrats-conspiracy-theorists|title=The New Paranoia|last=Dickey|first=Colin|date=8 June 2017|work=[[The New Republic]]|access-date=2017-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/liberal-fever-swamps/530736/|title=How the Left Lost Its Mind|last=[[McKay Coppins]]|first=|date=2017-07-02|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Deadspin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/trump-conspiracy-tweetstorms-are-the-infowars-of-the-le-1793957969|title=Trump Conspiracy Tweetstorms Are The Infowars Of The Left|last=Blest|first=Paul|date=2017-04-04|work=[[Deadspin]]|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; – have described Abramson as a conspiracy theorist. While [[Ben Mathis-Lilley]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argues that Abramson is "not making things up, per se; he's just recycling information you could find on any news site and adding sinister what-if hypotheticals to create conclusions that he refers to, quite seriously, as 'investigatory analyses.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/12/sharing-seth-abramson-not-once-not-ever.html|title=Democrats: Please, Please Stop Sharing Seth Abramson's Very Bad Tweets|last=[[Ben Mathis-Lilley]]|first=|date=2017-12-05|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525010716/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/12/sharing-seth-abramson-not-once-not-ever.html|archive-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' also contests the moniker, noting that Abramson "feuds with anti-Trump conspiracy theorists whom he sees linking to dubious sources and making claims without evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-Is-Seth-Abramson-Trying/240071|title=What Is Seth Abramson Trying to Tell Us?|last=Kolowich|first=Steve|date=2017-05-15|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=2017-07-03|language=en-US|issn=0009-5982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Virginia Heffernan]] writes in ''[[Politico]]'' that Abramson's "theory-testing" is "urgently important."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/twitter-thread-social-media-trend-215539|title=The Rise of the Twitter Thread|last=[[Virginia Heffernan]]|first=|date=September–October 2017|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' calls Abramson "a quintessential American figure: an underdog who became an involuntary hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/hobby-detectives-join-mueller-in-investigating-trump-a-1210567.html
|title=Army of Investigators Has Trump in Its Sights|last=Christoph Scheuermann|first=|date=June 4, 2018|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Observer]]'' writes that "events like Trump's 2013 trip to Russia for Miss Universe were covered extensively on Abramson's feed prior to the mainstream media catching on, a fact that has given him a reputation for being early to connect events within the broader Russia story."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2018/06/seth-abramson-is-combating-trump-and-the-media-on-twitter/|title=Seth Abramson Is Combating Trump and the Media on Twitter|last=Mike Albanese|first=|date=June 21, 2018|work=[[New York Observer]]|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Avi Selk of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Abramson "has become virally popular by reframing a complex tangle of public reporting on the Russia scandal into a story so simple it can be laid out in daily tweets."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But Selk notes that facts tend to be "sprinkled into [Abramson's] threads with more fantastic sounding claims," and "Abramson's tweets link copiously to sources, but they range in quality from investigative news articles to off-the-wall Facebook posts and tweets from Tom Arnold."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===The MFA Research Project===
Abramson authors ''The MFA Research Project'' (MRP), a website that publishes indexes of creative writing Master of Fine Arts (MFA) programs based on surveys and hard-data research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfaresearchproject.wordpress.com/|title=Protected Blog ' Log in|website=mfaresearchproject.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indexes appearing on the MRP include ordered listings of program popularity, funding, selectivity, fellowship placement, job placement, student-faculty ratio, application cost, application response times, application and curriculum requirements, and foundation dates. The MRP also publishes surveys of current MFA applicants, and of various creative writing programs. Writing for ''The Cambridge Companion to American Poetry Since 1945'', [[Hank Lazer]] described Abramson's project as "a daring and data-rich endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;"American Poetry and Its Institutions," ''The Cambridge Companion to American Poetry Since 1945'' (February 8, 2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nKMQ5b0VKz0C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=cambridge+companion+lazer+%22daring+and+data-rich%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tilQU4W3DIaKyASZhYLQBQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cambridge%20companion%20lazer%20%22daring%20and%20data-rich%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Missouri Review]]'' observed that Abramson, along with novelist [[Tom Kealey]], "had done a tremendous amount of work to peel back the layers of MFA programs and get applicants to make informed decisions."&lt;ref&gt;"The MFA Degree: A Bad Decision?", ''[[The Missouri Review]]'' (August 29, 2011). [http://www.missourireview.com/tmr-blog/2011/08/the-mfa-degree-a-bad-decision/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012323/http://www.missourireview.com/tmr-blog/2011/08/the-mfa-degree-a-bad-decision/ |date=2014-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the MRP has been regularly published by ''[[Poets &amp; Writers]]'' since 2009. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' has termed the ''Poets &amp; Writers'' national assessment methodology "comprehensive" and "the only MFA ranking regime."&lt;ref&gt;"What Defines a Successful Post-M.F.A. Career?", ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (November 3, 2011). [http://chronicle.com/article/What-Defines-a-Successful/129638/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;"M.F.A. Application-Season Etiquette," ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. [http://chronicle.com/blogs/arts/m-f-a-application-season-etiquette/29172]&lt;/ref&gt; The data is not without its critics. In September 2011, a critical open letter signed by professors from undergraduate and graduate creative writing programs was published.&lt;ref&gt;"Creative Writing Profs Dispute Their Ranking. No, the Entire Notion of Ranking!", ''[[The New York Observer]]'', Kat Stoeffel (September 8, 2011). [http://www.observer.com/2011/09/creative-writing-profs-dispute-their-ranking-no-the-entire-notion-of-ranking/]&lt;/ref&gt; In their response, ''Poets &amp; Writers'' asserted that it adhered to the highest journalistic standards.&lt;ref name="pw.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pw.org/content/poets_and_writers_responds_to_open_letter|title=Poets &amp; Writers Responds to Open Letter|date=13 September 2011|work=[[Poets &amp; Writers]]|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's Editorial Director Mary Gannon said of Abramson, the rankings' primary researcher, that he "has been collecting data about applicants' preferences and about MFA programs for five years, and we stand behind his integrity."&lt;ref name="pw.org"/&gt;

===Controversy===
In May 2014, Abramson was criticised for his ''Huffington Post'' piece "Last Words for Elliot Rodger", a "remix" of words taken from the final [[YouTube]] video of the perpetrator of the [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]], which Abramson published less than two days after they took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://coldfrontmag.com/abramson-publisher-distressed-by-his-elliot-rodger-remix/|title=Abramson Publisher "Distressed" by His Elliot Rodger "Remix"|publisher=Coldfront|date=29 May 2014 | accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the reuse of Rodger's words and the timing of the poem caused offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/poetics-tragedy/
|first=Christopher|last=Kempf|title=The Poetics of Tragedy|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]''|date=10 June 2014 | accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Abramson called the work "a vehicle for amity and compassion", Omnidawn, Abramson's publisher at the time, issued a statement saying that it was "dismayed, disheartened, distressed", adding that "his actions in this matter are not in alignment with our principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/459354/rap-genius-and-bad-poetry-its-always-too-soon-to-grab-personal-attention-after-a-tragedy/|title=Rap Genius and Bad Poetry: It's Always Too Soon to Grab Personal Attention After a Tragedy|publisher=''Flavorwire''|date=27 May 2014 | accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/05/omnidawn-breaks-the-sound-barrier-for-bax/|title=Omnidawn Breaks the Sound Barrier for BAX|publisher=[[Poetry Foundation]]|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016101100/http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/05/omnidawn-breaks-the-sound-barrier-for-bax/|archive-date=2014-10-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9325">'''Strategic enrollment management''' ['''SEM'''] is a crucial element of planning for new growth at a [[university]] or [[college]] as it concerns both academic program growth and facilities needs. {{ref|western}} SEM focuses on what is best for students' success while increasing enrollment numbers and stabilizing institutional revenues. A [[Student|student's]] success, according to an enrollment manager, is often based on the institution's graduation and retention rates. This means that students are often recruited based on the likelihood of them graduating. While this practice is acceptable for many privately run selective institutions, it is not a common practice of most public institutions such as community colleges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationalpolicy.org/pdf/SEM%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A real strategic enrollment management approach looks at the entire student cycle, from entry through graduation. {{ref|inside}}

According to Thomas Williams {{ref|williams}} [[enrollment management]] refers to the traditional task of “setting and meeting the goal of assembling a student body that comprises a predetermined and advantageous mix of students in terms of quality, number, and diversity in all its forms.”  strategic enrollment management is a broader, more dynamic task that begins with an understanding of the world around us, anticipates changes, probes institutional mission and goals, modifying them if necessary, and coordinates “campus-wide efforts in such areas as marketing, student recruitment and retention, tuition pricing, financial aid, academic and career counseling, and curriculum reform.”

Often, SEM is understood to be focused on a college or university's traditional undergraduate students, and mobilized to meet the needs of the traditional college student. An additional area of SEM has been developed to apply these principles to the graduate student lifecycle: [[Graduate enrollment management|Graduate Enrollment Management (GEM)]]. SEM focuses on the unique services and facilities needs specific to the adult graduate student.

Some of the components of strategic enrollment management include: {{ref|southeast}}
* Characteristics of the institution and the world around it
* Institutional mission and priorities
* Optimal enrollments (number, quality, diversity)
* Student recruitment
* Student fees and [[Student financial aid (United States)|Financial aid]]
* Retention
* Institutional marketing
* [[Career counseling]] and development
* Academic advising
* Curricular and program development
* Methods of program delivery
* Quality of campus life and facilities

==History==

The Evolution of Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) resulted from the work of a number of people and organizations since schools started being concerned with this area in the early 1970s. Boston College (through the work of Jack Maguire in 1976)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maguireassoc.com/about/our-staff/&lt;/ref&gt; and Northwestern University (through the work of William Ihlanfeldt)[2] began to use research and specific communication strategies to increase enrollment at their schools. The idea of research and using the data to target communication and marketing efforts resulted in positive enrollment numbers and drew several entrepreneurs into the field of managing enrollments. Jack Maguire subsequently created and named the first enrollment management model for recruitment and retention of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/pub/emr/EMR-spring-2007.pdf/|title=Recruitment &amp; Admissions – Higher Ed Services - Education Professionals – The College Board|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Stuart Weiner and Drs. Ron and Dori Ingersoll formed one of the earliest teams that addressed enrollment issues from the point of view of the total enrollment effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enrollment-management.com/page13.php&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, the Ingersolls and others made enrollment efforts more effective by strategically addressing schools, data, academic offerings, and student services—and included retention in the overall effort.

In the late 1970s, the practice of Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) was born. Since that time, organizations such as Noel-Levitz, Williams and Associates, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) have continued to refine the concept.

But it wasn’t until 1990 that AACRAO established the term, “Strategic Enrollment Management”, and started the first annual SEM conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacrao.org/Professional-Development/meetings/2013SEM/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; specifically focused on pressing issues and effective practices in Strategic Enrollment Management.  Beginning in 2009, AACRAO developed the first SEM Award of Excellence to recognize outstanding achievement and visionary leadership in Strategic Enrollment Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacrao.org/About-AACRAO/governance-and-leadership/leadership/awards/semaward.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bob Bontrager, Sr. Director of AACRAO Consulting and SEM Initiatives edited some of the first books on SEM:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacrao.org/professional-development/meetings/past-meetings/2012ExecSymposium/KeynoteSpeakers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''SEM and Institutional Success: Integrating Enrollment, Finance and Student Access'' (2008)
* ''Applying SEM at the Community College'' (2009)

In 2012, Dr. Ron Ingersoll and Dr. Dori Ingersoll, with Dr. Bob Bontrager, co-edited the book ''Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Education''.  This SEM compendium was published for the higher education profession by AACRAO. EMAS Pro then initiated the industry’s first monthly Strategic Enrollment Management webinar series, as a companion to the ''Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Education'' book.&lt;ref&gt;http://emaspro.com/news-events/seminar-series/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ingersolls serve as primary SEMinar session co-presenters.

In recent years, AACRAO has published additional books on SEM that include:
* ''SEM in Canada: Promoting Student and Institutional Success in Canadian Colleges and Universities'' (2011)
* ''Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Educations'' (2012)
* ''Handbook of Strategic Enrollment Management'' (2014)
* ''SEM Core Concepts: Building Blocks for Institutional and Student Success'' (2017)

==Software==

As enrollment moved from a focus on marketing to including the whole institution, the need grew for software that offered better ways to communicate and work with students and parents.  In the mid-1980s, the Ingersoll Group and Tom Williams developed the first software to effectively manage the process for students from inquiry to enrollment. This was The Enrollment Management Action System (EMAS™).

Noel-Levitz had developed Dialogue, a Telecounseling software designed for higher education.  When Noel-Levitz merged with Williams Crockett, the telecounseling package was merged into EMAS to create EMAS''Plus''—a software system that addressed recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noellevitz.com/about-noel-levitz/the-history-of-noel-levitz|title=The History of Ruffalo Noel Levitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Education Systems Inc. purchased EMAS products to add to software they developed for work with financial aid. At this point, the emphasis was still primarily on marketing and communication efforts. Education Systems, Inc. (doing business as EMAS™ Pro) expanded the original higher-education CRM software into a resource to address the total commitment of schools to manage their enrollment from a strategic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emaspro.com/about-us/history&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, a number of vendors serving Higher Education have emerged with CRM systems such as Hobsons, [[Jenzabar]], Talisma and Target X.

Student CRM by Data Harvesting is also a growing popular choice for a student recruitment solution for universities and colleges.

==Common misconceptions==
According to Bontrager and Kerlin {{ref|bontrager}}, common misconceptions and sometimes barriers to implementing or moving strategic enrollment management forward within an institution are that strategic enrollment management is:
* a quick fix
* solely an organizational structure
* an enhanced admissions and marketing operation
* a financial drain on the institution
* an administrative function separate from the academic plan and mission of the institution

The school is home to one of the longest-established [[Gamelan|Javanese gamelan]] ensembles in the United States. This group of instruments, known formally as ''Kyai Telaga Madu'' (Venerable Lake of Honey), has been at the university since 1966, when its purchase was negotiated and organized by [[William P. Malm|Bill Malm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/gamelan.education/um_gamelan_history | title=Javanese Gamelan at the University of Michigan, University of Michigan Gamelan Education Project | publisher=Center for Southeast Asian Studies, University of Michigan | date=2012 | accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 until 2002, the ensemble was under the direction of faculty ethnomusicologist [[Judith Becker]]. The ensemble is currently directed by Susan Walton.

====Bands====
Wind ensembles, under the University Bands, provide a central performance and training opportunity for students at the school.&lt;ref name="bands"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://smtd.umich.edu/current_students/perf_opps/bands.htm |title=UMich Band Performance Opportunities |website=University of Michigan School of Music, Theater, and Dance |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind ensembles provide a primary training opportunity for most instrumentalists at the school, who may audition to perform in one of the two top ensembles, the Symphony Band and Concert Band. The [[Michigan Marching Band]] is also a component of the University Bands and provides music and entertainment at university athletic events.

====Orchestras====
Students also receive training in large orchestral ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.music.umich.edu/current_students/perf_opps/orchestras.htm |title=UMich Orchestra Performance Opportunities |website=University of Michigan School of Music, Theater, and Dance |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Organizations===
Student organizations through the university include:
* '''Arts Enterprise''' which invites students to create projects and make connections to the local, national, and international cultural spheres.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ArtsEnterpriseUMich&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Basement Arts''' which allows students the opportunity to direct, produce and star in studio productions. This student group is well known for performing student written works such as [[A Very Potter Musical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arts.umich.edu/resources/studentorgs/profiles/index.php?id=13 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409130147/http://arts.umich.edu/resources/studentorgs/profiles/index.php?id=13 |archive-date=2015-04-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''MUSKET''', founded in 1908, puts on two large scale productions of musicals every year run entirely by students. Recent Productions have included: [[Rent (musical)|Rent]], [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]] and [[Into the Woods]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ummusket.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The University of Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan Society''', which produces main stage productions of operettas every year. Most of these are works by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], however they have also ventured into other works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umgass.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Walgreen-Drama.jpeg|thumbnail|The Walgreen Drama Center]] --&gt;

The school's facilities are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On the [[University of Michigan]] north campus, these include the Earl V. Moore Building, the Stearns Building, the Walgreen Drama Center, and the [[Lurie Tower|Lurie Carillon]]. Specific north campus facilities include studios in the James and Anne Duderstadt Center, as well as the Arthur Miller Theater and the Stamps Auditorium (both in the Walgreen Drama Center). The Miller Theater is the only theater given permission by the estate of Arthur Miller to bear the playwright's name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.music.umich.edu/about/facilities/north_campus/walgreen/arthurmiller/&lt;/ref&gt; On central campus, the school's facilities include [[Hill Auditorium]], the Power Center, the Dance Building, and [[Burton Memorial Tower]], which houses the Charles Baird Carillon. The university's south campus is home to [[William D. Revelli]] Hall, which houses offices and rehearsal space for the University of Michigan Marching Band.

===History of the Moore Building===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments]]--&gt;
The majority of the school's teaching spaces, faculty offices, and music library, are located in the Earl V. Moore Building. This building is named after a previous dean of the school, and was designed in a mid-century modern style by architect [[Eero Saarinen]].&lt;ref name="Moore-Power"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.music.umich.edu/muse/2013/spring/Moore-Power.html | title=Moore Power | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre, &amp; Dance | date=2013 | accessdate=22 March 2014 | author=Carlin, Marilou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saarinen was commissioned to design the master plan for the University of Michigan’s North Campus, he requested to design the music school building (now the Earl V. Moore Building).&lt;ref&gt;https://michiganmodern.wordpress.com/buildings/washtenaw-county/university-of-michigan-earl-v-moore-school-of-music-building/&lt;/ref&gt;

The original scheme called for an L-shaped building and a circular concert hall. Completed in 1964, the result was a five-level pavilion with flanking wings. Saarinen envisioned a building in harmony with nature, and so designed the building to be built into a hill overlooking a pond. The brick-clad concrete structure has narrow vertical windows that contrast with the horizontal brick patterns, thought to represent the alternating colors of piano keys. The brick color is known as “Cranbrook Buff” for its reference to the color of the buildings on the campus of the Cranbrook Education Community. The style of this building has influenced almost all of the later construction on North Campus.

The building contains 2 rehearsal/concert halls, 45 performance teaching studios, 18 classrooms, 40 offices, a large library, 120 practice rooms, including 12 organ practice rooms, and other special facilities for piano, harp, harpsichord and percussion practice. The construction of this building allowed for the first increase in enrollment since 1946.

During construction of the building, Saarinen was diagnosed with a brain tumor, but he was able to watch the progress of the building from his room at University Hospital.

===Renovation===
On October 30, 2012, University of Michigan President [[Mary Sue Coleman]] announced an $8-million gift from [[William K. Brehm]] and Delores S. Brehm, a major contribution toward the cost of renovating and expanding the Moore Building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/university-of-michigans-132-million-kellogg-eye-center-expansion-to-welcome-patients-monday/&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total cost, another $14 million is allocated from the university, with the remaining balance to come from additional fundraising, including a gift from Glenn E. Watkins, emeritus professor of musicology. Construction for the project commenced in early 2014 and was finished in the fall of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/20937 | title=Brehm gift launches building expansion at U-M School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance | accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation, which cost 29.5 million and added 34,000 square feet,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.music.umich.edu/about/news.php?id=433&lt;/ref&gt; includes a rehearsal with the footprint of [[Hill Auditorium]], revamping of the McIntosh Theater, a lecture hall, an entrance and lobby, and new practice and teaching rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.music.umich.edu/muse/2013/spring/Moore-Power.html | title=Moore Power: SMTD Announces a Major Renovation and Expansion of the Earl V.

'''University rankings in China''' include rankings of universities ordered by different standards and made by various organizations in [[China]].

There are several comprehensive rankings of universities in China, including [[Chinese university ranking (Wu Shulian)|Wu Shulian Ranking]], made by a team led by Wu Shulian and published in the name of Chinese Academy of Management, [[Chinese university ranking (Netbig)|Netbig Ranking]], made by the higher education internet information company Netbig, and [[Chinese university ranking (CUAA)|CUAA Ranking]], by Airuishen (a company) in the name of Chinese Universities Alumni Association, etc.. Shanghai Ruanke compiles both the [[Best Chinese Universities Ranking (BCUR)]] and the world university ranking, [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]].

==History==

In 1987, a ranking of 86 key universities according to Science Citation Index was compiled by Zhao Hongzhou, [[Chinese Academy of Management Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.sohu.com/20050221/n224361530.shtml 盘点1987-2005中国大学排行榜 (Summarily Counting 1987-2005 Chinese university rankings)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It's said that the first comprehensive (exactly, synthetic) ranking of Chinese universities was made by Cai Yanhou, Higher Education Research Institute, [[Central South University of Technology]], in 1989. Colleges and universities were ranked in four categories, science (generally comprehensive universities), engineering, agricultural and medical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.sohu.com/20160602/n452443195.shtml 中国第一个综合的大学排行榜，南京大学和清华大学分列榜首 (The first comprehensive ranking of Chinese universities, Nanjing University and Tsinghua University rank first in respective lists)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese university ranking on research and development in 1991 was published in 1993 by Wu Shulian, Guangdong Academy of Management Science, which was registered in the year 1993 as a private institute and later ceased and was claimed to be the Guangdong branch of Chinese Academy of Management Science. The 1996 ranking was released in 1997, and since then the annual ranking has been released continuously. It's a single list ranking except 1998 ranking, which consists of comprehensive university ranking and technological university ranking, with [[Nanjing University]] and [[Tsinghua University]] ranking 1st respectively. In 2000, the comprehensive ranking was released under the name ''Chinese University Assessment''. [[Chinese university ranking (Wu Shulian)|The ranking]] was later published in the name of Chinese Academy of Management Science.

In 1999, Netbig, or literally Net Universities in abbreviation, a higher education internet information company, released [[Chinese university ranking (Netbig)|Chinese university ranking]].

In 2002, Chinese university ranking by Airuishen (a company) was released. The [[Chinese university ranking (CUAA)|CUAA Ranking]], released in the name of Chinese Universities Alumni Association, is said made by Cai Yanhou team.

In 2003, a team in [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]], later named Shanghai Ranking (Shanghai Ruanke, literally Shanghai Soft Science in abbreviation), released [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. Shanghai Ranking also compiles the [[Best Chinese Universities Ranking (BCUR)]].

A '''virtual campus''' or '''e campus''', refers to the [[online]] offerings of a [[college]] or [[university]] where college work is completed either partially or wholly online, often with the assistance of the [[teacher]], [[professor]], or [[teaching assistant]]. Many colleges and universities now offer such courses (or entire degree programs) either partially or wholly online. There are an estimated 4,500 such institutions with total enrollments approaching perhaps 2,000,000.

The majority of students using virtual campuses to obtain online degrees are adults students for three main reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jhosta, Harris|work=Streetdirectory.com|title=Why Are More Adults Turning Towards Online Education?|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/14588/education/why_are_more_adults_turning_towards_online_education.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility – Adults with full-time jobs and families would find it impossible to attend daily at a traditional school setting.  Online classes allow students to work at their own pace and work around their busy lives.
* Cost – The cost of an online degree is relatively cheaper than at a traditional college setting.  Obtaining your degree online eliminates costs such as classroom costs and facility upkeep costs that traditional students are required to pay because they are using the campus. However, the cheaper cost of an online degree does not diminish the value of the degree.
* Broad Choices – Students can remain at home and have availability to degrees that may not be offered by universities or colleges nearby.

Schools use a variety of tools for conducting classes – typically called [[learning management system]]s (LMS) or [[course management system]]s (CMS). CMS may also refer to CONTENT Management Systems.

Some of the aspects that go under virtual campus includes various types of learning activities such as lectures, homework, discussions, readings, assignments. Classes are usually self paced using online documents and databases that might be available to them. Tests and other assignments are available online in specific programs used for online classes. Other methods used in virtual campus are live sessions, videoconferencing, discussing and sharing various applications. Individuals are able to access the materials any time they want under the teacher's control and are able to access anywhere online where they're able to access internet usage. Email is a big part of the virtual campuses and is often used before, during and after sessions. This aids individuals in exchanging information and or point them to the right direction that would be useful in increasing and understanding various methods available to them via documents and online sources.

== Virtual campus experience ==

Alexander et al. conducted a study and found that the use of technology did not in itself result in improvements in the quality of learning but that success depended on the design of the whole learning experience.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1513&amp;context=iatul|title=The Virtual Campus: the impact on teaching and learning|author=Rickards, J.|work= Proceedings of the IATUL Conferences|publisher=Paper 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main models for the virtual campus emerging. The first of these is one in which an educational institution uses communication and information technologies (CITs) to provide all conventional services. In the second model, services are unbundled, with some being sub-contracted to other organizations.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; Virtual campuses are learner centered, and students can customize their virtual campus to fit their learning styles and preferences thanks to the Internet and telecommunication technologies. Teleconferencing, videoconferencing, computer-based interactive multimedia packages, and various forms of computer mediated communication are technologies that facilitate synchronous delivery of content and real-time interaction between teacher and students as well as opportunities for problem-solving either individually or as a team.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt;
