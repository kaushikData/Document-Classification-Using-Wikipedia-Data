Seventy people were killed during the campaign, including six on election day itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=392758 ''no title'']; The Economist online; accessed September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrea Cambini''' or '''Andreas Cambinus''' (1445/1460—1527) was an Italian historian, humanist and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisaha|first=Nancy|title=Creating East and West: Renaissance humanists and the Ottoman Turks|year=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-3806-8|url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=QNQoCqPmZkIC&amp;pg=PA178|page=178|quote=Sixteenth-century Italian historians and treatise writers such as... Andrea Cambini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works on Ottomans ==

Cambini was the author of an early history of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the ''Commentario de Andrea Cambini fiorentino della origine de turchi, et imperio della casa Ottomanna'', which was published in 1529,&lt;ref name="Cambini1529"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea Cambini|authorlink=Andrea Cambini|title=Commentario de Andrea Cambini, fiorentino, della Origine de'Turchi, et imperio della casa Ottomanna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Is87AAAAcAAJ|year=1529}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after his death in Florence in 1527.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philippides|first=Marios|title=The Siege and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate, cop|isbn=978-1-4094-1064-5|url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=qvvdVXckfqQC&amp;pg=PA101|author2=Walter K. Hanak|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1541, Cambini's book had been reissued several times.&lt;ref name="TolanLaurens2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Tolan|authorlink1=John V. Tolan|author2=Henry Laurens|authorlink2=Henry Laurens|author3=Gilles Veinstein|title=Europe and the Islamic World: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnyKKD1Qu2IC&amp;pg=PA236|date=25 November 2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-4475-4|page=236|quote=Andrea Cambini's Origin of the Turks and of the Ottoman Empire was reissued several times between 1528 and 1541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambini was a pupil of fellow humanist [[Cristoforo Landino]].&lt;ref name="Cambini1538"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea Cambini|title=Della origine de turchi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDxJYAAACAAJ|year=1538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Cambini had never traveled outside Italy, he wrote his work on the Ottomans by relying on older sources from around Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David B. Ruderman|authorlink1=David B. Ruderman|author2=Giuseppe Veltri|authorlink2=Giuseppe Veltri|title=Cultural Intermediaries: Jewish Intellectuals in Early Modern Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSZ8z5N6X0UC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3779-X|pages=70, 71|quote=...the works of two well-known contemporary Italian historians, Andrea Cambini and Paolo Giovio.28 Without having ever left Italy...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambini belonged to a group of sixteenth-century Italian historians which included [[Paolo Giovio]] and Giovanni Menavino. They openly praised the Ottoman's organization and behavior.&lt;ref name="Bisaha2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Bisaha|title=Creating East and West: Renaissance Humanists and the Ottoman Turks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t4kL9o3rSwUC&amp;pg=PA178|date=1 January 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0129-9|page=178|quote=Sixteenth-century Italian historians and treatise writers such as Giovanni Menavino, Andrea Cambini, and Paolo Giovio spoke highly of the Turks' organization and honorable behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work sparked interest in the origin of the Ottoman dynasty.&lt;ref name="Murphey2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhoads Murphey|title=Ottoman Warfare, 1500–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_RCuaPRzX4C&amp;pg=PA6|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-01597-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, he rejected a theory that the Ottomans were descendants of the [[Troy|Trojans]].&lt;ref name="ClassenMargolis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albrecht Classen|author2=Nadia Margolis|title=War and Peace: Critical Issues in European Societies and Literature 800–1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEOVaglZx74C&amp;pg=PA482|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-026822-5|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambini followed the fashion of other contemporary historical works and wrote a history of the Ottomans focused on the personality of the [[Ottoman sultans]] and on the military events of their reigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David B. Ruderman|authorlink1=David B. Ruderman|author2=Giuseppe Veltri|authorlink2=Giuseppe Veltri|title=Cultural Intermediaries: Jewish Intellectuals in Early Modern Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSZ8z5N6X0UC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3779-X|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of his works by other contemporary authors ==

Some authors had considered the work of [[Christophe Richer]] on the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to be the account of an eyewitness (an otherwise unknown Riccherio), but it was later discovered that it was actually the work of Richer himself, who based his narration of the event on the work of several previous historians, including Cambini.&lt;ref name="PhilippidesHanak2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marios Philippides|author2=Walter K. Hanak|title=The Siege and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453: Historiography, Topography, and Military Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvvdVXckfqQC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1064-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambini's work remains a valuable source of information on the siege because his sources included the testimonies of survivors.&lt;ref name="Runciman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Runciman|authorlink=Steven Runciman|title=The Fall of Constantinople 1453|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJz8BCdxlfEC&amp;pg=PA197|date=26 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-60469-8|page=197|quote=Useful information can be obtained from the Florentine Andrea CAMBINI. For his work on Ottoman history, written towards the end of the fifteenth century, he seems to have consulted survivors from the siege.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1562, [[John Shute (architect)|John Shute]] translated the works of Cambini and [[Paolo Giovio]] into English and composed a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] on them (''Two very notable commentaries: The one of the original of the Turcks and the empire of the house of Ottomanno, and the other of the warre of the Turcke against [[Skanderbeg|George Scanderbeg]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healey|first=Robin|title=Italian Literature Before 1900|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-4426-4269-0|url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=38gBss-QJ9wC&amp;pg=PA368|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">The '''Argippaeans''' or '''Argippaei''' are a people mentioned by [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]].'' He mentions them as north of the Scythians and much of the scholarship points to them being a tribe near the [[Ural Mountains]].

==In Herodotus==

{{quotation|
As far as their country, the tract of land whereof I have been speaking is all a smooth plain, and the soil deep; beyond you enter on a region which is rugged and stony. Passing over a great extent of this rough country, you come to a people dwelling at the foot of lofty mountains, who are said to be all—both men and women—bald from their birth, to have flat noses, and very long chins. These people speak a language of their own,. the dress which they wear is the same as the Scythian. They live on the fruit of a certain tree, the name of which is Ponticum; in size it is about equal to our fig-tree, and it bears a fruit like a bean, with a stone inside. When the fruit is ripe, they strain it through cloths; the juice which runs off is black and thick, and is called by the natives “aschy.” They lap this up with their tongues, and also mix it with milk for a drink; while they make the lees, which are solid, into cakes, and eat them instead of meat; for they have but few sheep in their country, in which there is no good pasturage. Each of them dwells under a tree, and they cover the tree in winter with a cloth of thick white felt, but take off the covering in the summer-time. No one harms these people, for they are looked upon as sacred—they do not even possess any warlike weapons. When their neighbours fall out, they make up the quarrel; and when one flies to them for refuge, he is safe from all hurt. They are called the Argippaeans.” |Herodotus | The Histories | Translated by George Rawlinson &lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/herodotus/h4/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{nihongo|'''Asahi Shell Midden'''|朝日貝塚|Asahi kaizuka}} is an [[archaeological site]] consisting of a [[Midden#Shell middens|shell midden]] and the remains of an adjacent  [[Jōmon period]] settlement located in what is now the city of [[Himi, Toyama|Himi]], [[Toyama Prefecture]] in the [[Hokuriku region]] of [[Japan]].  The site was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site of Japan]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/190592 |title= 朝日貝塚|trans-title= Asahi Shell Midden|language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Asahi shell midden is located in the southwestern part of Himi, on the Asahiyama hill which extends from the west to the east through the center of the city area. An excavation survey was conducted by [[Tokyo Imperial University]] several times since the discovery of the midden in July 1918 during the construction of a Buddhist temple. The midden dates from the early Jōmon period through the [[Heian period]]. During a second survey in 1924, traces of at least two residences with hearths were discovered, overlapping earlier Jōmon period remains.

'''Brooksville''' is a town in [[Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma|Pottawatomie County]], [[Oklahoma]], United States. It is one of the thirteen existing all-black towns in Oklahoma.The population was 63 at the 2010 census, a 30 percent decline from 90 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/Brooksville CensusViewer: Population of the City of Brooksville, Oklahoma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of more than fifty All-Black towns of Oklahoma, Brooksville is one of only thirteen still existing at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Located in Pottawatomie County four miles southwest of Tecumseh, Brooksville was established in 1903. Originally the town was named Sewell, after a white doctor who owned much of the surrounding land and attended the residents. In 1912 the name changed to Brooksville in honor of the first African American in the area, A. R. Brooks, a cotton buyer and farmer. His son, W. M. Brooks, became the first postmaster. In 1906 Rev. Jedson White organized St. John's Baptist Church. Soon afterward, the congregation built a church that still exists. White also promoted the town throughout the South, urging African Americans to settle in Brooksville. Brooksville had a Santa Fe Railroad station, three hotels, two doctors, and two mills.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Brooksville"&gt;[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BR023 Larry O'Dell. "Brooksville," ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.] Accessed August 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, with the aid of the Rosenwald Fund, a new school was built. Banneker School, under management of W. T. McKenzie, was a rock building of four large rooms, a three-hundred-seat auditorium, a small library, and a well-equipped domestic science room. [[George W. McLaurin]], the first African American graduate student at the University of Oklahoma, taught at the school. After a fire, the original building was replaced by a wooden one that served students until the school closed in 1968. The building then became a community center for the town and stands next to the new city hall. A declining cotton market and the Great Depression made life difficult in Brooksville, as in many Oklahoma communities. Most of the residents departed, but the town survived. At the beginning of the twenty-first century Brooksville was steadily increasing in population.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Brooksville"/&gt;

The current mayor, Keith Davenport, is also the Presiding Bishop of A Miracle of Love Ministries and was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 2012 and 2014; as well as the Republican nominee for Oklahoma State Senate District 48 in 2005.

Mayor Davenport, succeeded long-time Lee Oliver who died on September 20, 2015.

'''Cao Xuân Dục''' ({{lang-vi-hantu|高春育}}; 1843–1923) was a scholar, [[historian]]-[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]], and court adviser in the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Camp Davis, ''States of banditry: The Nguyen government, bandit rule, and the culture of power in the post-Taiping China-Vietnam borderlands''  University of Washington 2008 - Page 104 "Cao Xuân Dục"&lt;/ref&gt;

Cao Xuân Dục was born in Thịnh Mỹ, Diễn Châu, [[Nghệ An]]. In 1876, he entered Vietnamese [[Imperial examination]] and was awarded the degree of [[Confucian court examination system in Vietnam|provincial graduate (舉人 - cử nhân)]], in same class with the famous anti-French patriot [[Phan Đình Phùng]] from [[Hà Tĩnh]].

He served under Nguyễn Emperors [[Đồng Khánh]] and [[Thành Thái]] and held several important government posts including [[Governor-General]] of [[Hưng Yên]] (1889) and [[minister of education]] (1907). He was one of the four top advisers to the Emperor during the [[Wars_of_French_colonization_in_Indochina#French_invasion|Vietnam-France conflict in early 20th century]].

When [[Trương Như Cương]], a pro-French collaborator, coerced his colleagues to sign a petition to Thành Thái to promote him to [[viceroy]], Dục refused to sign - instead he wrote a quick poem on the petition.

||''the sky cannot have two suns&lt;br&gt;a nation cannot have two kings&lt;br&gt;your servant Cao Xuân Dục&lt;br&gt;cannot sign''
|}
He was later vilified by Cương's group and demoted to a lowly local post in Hoàng Xá outside of [[Hanoi]]. A [[relief]] of Cao Xuân Dục was sculptured on a wall in a cave in this local region to commemorate his righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caoxuan.com/article.php?Fl=docs/20100326002454 Relief of Cao Xuân Dục in a cave in Hoàng Xá]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cao Xuân Dục retired in 1913 to concentrate on building his library, ''Long Cương Bảo Tàng Thư Viện'' (named after his pseudonym), collecting and maintaining Vietnamese literature.

A street in [[Ho Chi Minh city]] was named after Cao Xuân Dục&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Cao+Xu%C3%A2n+D%E1%BB%A5c,+Ho+Chi+Minh+City,+District+8,+Vietnam&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=FQj0owAduXlbBg&amp;split=0&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=38.161973,47.373047&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Cao+Xu%C3%A2n+D%E1%BB%A5c,+District+8,+Vietnam&amp;z=17 map of Cao Xuan Duc street Ho Chi Minh city]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Pedagogic activity===

His writing has appeared in ''[[Effects : Magazine for New Art Theory]],'' ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]],'' ''[[Art in America]],'' ''[[Art News]],'' ''[[Artforum]],''&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlene Spretnak]], ''The Spiritual Dynamic in Modern Art : Art History Reconsidered, 1800 to the Present'', Palgrave Macmillan, (2014) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; ''Camera Austria,'' ''[[High Times]],'' ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]],'' ''[[Tokion]],'' ''Vice'' and other magazines.

===''The Downtown Show: the New York Art Scene from 1974 to 1984''===
McCormick was guest curator of the exhibition ''The Downtown Show: the New York Art Scene from 1974 to 1984'' (in consultation with Lynn Gumpert, and Marvin J. Taylor) that was held at [[New York University]]’s Grey Art Gallery and Fales Library. The exhibition examined the rich cross-section of artists and activities that coexisted and often overlapped in Lower Manhattan between 1974 and 1984. Emerging out of the deflated optimism of the [[Summer of Love]] (and energized by the enactment of the [[1982 Loft Law|loft laws]] that made it legal for artists to live in [[downtown]] New York's industrial spaces) the Downtown [[no wave]] scene attracted painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, [[performance art]], filmmakers, and writers who could afford the then-low rent lofts and [[Lower East Side]] tenement apartments.

The ''Downtown Show: the New York Art Scene from 1974 to 1984'' show traveled to the [[Andy Warhol]] Museum in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] (May 20 to September 3, 2006) and the [[Austin Museum of Art]], in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] (November 18, 2006, to January 28, 2007). It was chosen as first place winner by the [[International Association of Art Critics]]/USA (AICA USA) for best thematic show in [[New York City]] in 2005-2006.

He has also curated shows for the [[Bronx Museum of Art]], the [[Queens Museum of Art]] and the Woodstock Center for Photography.

Some authors known by their crônicas are [[Machado de Assis]], [[Rubem Braga]], [[Fernando Sabino]], [[Paulo Mendes Campos]], [[Rachel de Queiroz]] and [[Luís Fernando Veríssimo]].

[[File:Portrait of a 31-year old woman dressed in a cyberpunk industrial outfit, photographed in 2013.jpg|thumb|A woman dressed in a cyber outfit]]

'''Cybergoth''' is a [[subculture]] that derives from elements of [[goth subculture#Fashion|goth]], [[rave]]r, and [[rivethead]] fashion. Unlike traditional [[Goth subculture|goths]], Cybergoths primarily listen to [[electronic music]] more often than [[rock music]].

==History==
The term 'Cybergoth' was coined in 1988 in Berlin, Germany by [[Games Workshop]], for their roleplaying game ''[[Dark Future]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/Manifestos/cybergoth.htm "What the Hell is Cybergoth? A Look at Cyberpunk's Bastard Children"] Andrew Mayer&lt;/ref&gt; the fashion style did not emerge until a decade later. [[Valerie Steele]] quotes Julia Borden, who defines cybergoth as combining elements of [[rivethead|industrial aesthetics]] with a style associated with "Gravers" (Gothic ravers).&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Gravers hybridized "the British Raver look and the German ClubKid look with a 'freak show' spin."&lt;ref name=steele&gt;Valerie Steele, ''Gothic: Dark Glamour'', [[Yale University Press]], 2008, p. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; This fusion between German and Austrian styles began in 1999.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Borden indicates that initially the hair extensions and bright fishnets did not mesh well with goth fashion, but that by 2002 "the rave elements of dress were replaced by Industrial-influenced accessories, such as goggles, reflective clothing, and mostly black clothing."&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Steele summarizes:
{{cquote|Today cyber goths tend to wear primarily black clothing with hints of neon colors, as well as clothing made of reflective materials and PVC, and huge platform boots. Their hair extensions or falls often incorporate a bright color and multiple piercings are typical. Goggles are often worn. Some cyber goths also wear gas masks or (in what appears to be a kind of medical fetish) shiny PVC doctors' masks.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;}}

[[Nancy Kilpatrick]] indicates that [[David Bowie]]'s look in the 1970s is the initial inspiration for the style, and that [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' provided the prototype for cyber aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Kilpatrick-US-2004"&gt;[[Nancy Kilpatrick]]. ''The Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined''. New York: [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Griffin]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-312-30696-2}}, p. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
[[Image:Atomik Reaktion.jpg|thumb|200px|Cybergoth neon fashion under a [[nightclub]] [[black light]].]]

Cybergoth [[fashion]] combines rave, [[rivethead]], and [[Gothic fashion|goth]] fashion, as well as drawing inspiration from other forms of [[science fiction]]. [[Androgyny]] is common.&lt;ref name="gothbible"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilpatrick |first=Nancy | authorlink = Nancy Kilpatrick | title=The Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined |year=2005 |publisher=Plexus |location=UK |page=55 |isbn=0-85965-365-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style sometimes features one starkly contrasting bright or neon-reactive theme color, such as red, blue, neon green, chrome, or pink,&lt;ref&gt;2002-09-13 [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/13/1031608320631.html "Dead fashionable"] [[The Age]]. Accessed 6 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; set against a basic, black gothic outfit. Matte or glossy black materials such as rubber and shiny black [[PVC]] can be mixed and matched in an effort to create a more artificial look.

The black-and-monochromatic juxtaposition can take a variety of forms, including brightly colored hair and make-up, [[cybernetic]] patterns such as live LED [[circuit boards]], [[body modification]], [[gas masks]] and [[goggles]] (especially [[aviator|aviator-style]]), typically worn on the forehead or around the neck rather than on the eyes.&lt;ref name="Kilpatrick-US-2004" /&gt; The most common use of a theme color is in the hair or eye make-up. Artificial, extended hair or "falls" are sometimes used to create this added effect. Falls can be made of various materials, ranging from yarn to fluorescent tubing to electrical wiring. Popular club gear for cybergoths includes tight black pants, tight black vests or shirts cut from ripped, solid or fishnet fabrics, [[Fluffy (footwear)|fluffies]], resembling costumes from 19th Century [[gothic fiction|Gothic novels]] or early black and white [[horror films]] from the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="gothbible" /&gt; Companies that specialize in the style include Cyberdog (UK), DANE (UK), Pen &amp; Lolly Clubwear (UK), Lip Service (US), and Diabolik (CA).&lt;ref name="Kilpatrick-US-2004" /&gt;

==Hair==

Cybergoth style incorporates extravagant hair pieces and styles, including [[Synthetic dreads|synthetic dreadlocks]] (known as cyberlox), hair extensions and so on. These hair pieces can be made of a variety of materials, from real hair to synthetic kanekelon hair, plastic tubing, tubular crin, rubber and foam strips, belts, and are often accented with goggles.

==Music==
In the first decade of the 21st century, the instrumental, computer driven, synthesized hypnotic tempos and textures of the [[trance music]] of the late 1990s were transformed into futurepop, a term coined by Ronan Harris of the UK band [[VNV Nation]] and Stephan Groth, vocalist of [[Apoptygma Berzerk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sortedmagazine.com/Sordid.php3?nID=261 |publisher=[[Sorted magazine]] |title= Being a little bit productive |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other associated music includes [[aggrotech]], [[power noise]] and club-oriented dance music styles such as [[acid house]], [[acid trance]], [[neurofunk]], [[synthpop]], [[digital hardcore]], [[gabber]], [[hard house]], [[hard trance]], [[hardstyle]], [[dark psytrance]], [[noise music]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[industrial dance music]], and [[post-industrial]].

'''Dragan Markovina''' (born 6 February 1981) is a Croatian historian, author and president of the [[New Left Croatia]] party.

==Early years and education==
Markovina was born in [[Mostar]] and there he attended the first 5 grades of primary school. In 1992, due to the [[Bosnian War]], he moved to the island of [[Korčula]] in [[Croatia]] where he continued primary school. He continued to live there after the war. In 1999, Markovina graduated from the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Korčula. After that he went to study history at the University Centre for Croatian Studies in [[Zagreb]]. He graduated from the faculty in 2004. His graduation thesis was: ''[[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia|ZAVNOH]]- Foundations and political activity''.

In December 2004, he started working at the [[University of Split]] and later he enrolled in the postgraduate studies of Croatian history at the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] in Zagreb. He defended his master's thesis in 2009 on the subject: ''The [[Šibenik]] port in the commercial-cultural exchanges between the two [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coasts]] in the 18th and 19th century''.
In 2011, Markovina defended his doctor's thesis on the subject: ''[[Dalmatia]] in the [[Republic of Venice]] reform projects during the 18th century''.&lt;ref name="'marul.ffst.hr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marul.ffst.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=481:dragan-markovina-prof-znanstveni-novak-asistent&amp;catid=131:katedra-za-novovjekovnu-i-suvremenu-povijest&amp;Itemid=311&amp;lang=en/|title=dr.sc. Dragan Markovina, znanstveni novak – viši asistent|website=marul.ffst.hr|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
When it comes to politics, he is regarded as a left-wing intellectual. He gained public attention in April 2013 when he started a petition for the removal of [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s statue in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. He later announced his candidacy for the council assembly at the [[Split local elections, 2013]]. He received 1.97% of the popular vote.&lt;ref name="'tportal.hr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/256482/Ovaj-znanstvenik-vraca-ljevicu-u-Split.html|title=Ovaj znanstvenik vraća ljevicu u Split!|last=Nikolić|first=Leo|date=|work=|newspaper=www.tportal.hr|access-date=2018-09-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, he was a guest on the national TV talk show, ''[[Nedjeljom u 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|7o1vDujyipU|2014 TV Interview with Dragan Markovina by Aleksandar Stanković}} (60 minutes) {{hbs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the most popular TV talk show in Croatia and it pushed Markovina into mainstream media. About the same time, he was informed that his contract with the University of Split was not going to be renewed so he lost his job as a university professor.&lt;ref name="'index.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/markovina-u-tudjmanovom-naslijedju-nema-niceg-pozitivnog/789872.aspx/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221092925/http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/markovina-u-tudjmanovom-naslijedju-nema-niceg-pozitivnog/789872.aspx |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was later offered a job by [[Milorad Pupovac]] to work with the archives at the [[Serb National Council]] which he accepted and then left after a few months.&lt;ref name="LeftWingParty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/445713/Markovina-osniva-lijevu-stranku-a-opleo-je-i-po-Plenkovicu.html|title=Markovina osniva lijevu stranku, a opleo je i po Plenkoviću|last=Srdoč|first=S.|date=27 September 2016|website=|publisher=''T-portal''|location=Zagreb|language=Serbo-Croatian|issn=1334-3130|trans-title=Markovina is setting up a left-wing party|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markovina is known for his opposition to the modern Croatian politics which to him originates from the 1990s. He is a fierce critic of the Franjo Tuđman regime and his modern legacy. He calls for a public recognition of the Croatian war crimes against [[Serbs]] in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] and possibly his most devoted field of engagement is the defense of the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav]] [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] movement in [[World War II]] which is marginalised and ignored by the modern Croatia government.
He also supports the [[separation of church and state]] in Croatia.

He is politically engaged in his hometown of Mostar in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He criticizes the Croatian administration in Mostar for dividing the city into 2 parts and for creating a nationalistic rhetoric which promotes hate between [[Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]]. He also supports the idea that the football club [[FK Velež Mostar]] should return to their original [[Stadion pod Bijelim Brijegom|stadium]]. Their original stadium was stolen by the Croatian administration in 1992 and given to the football club [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar]].&lt;ref name="'tacno.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tacno.net/nogomet/dragan-markovina-o-mitskom-klubu-velez-je-klub-raje-ljubavi-ponosa-i-prkosa-2//|title=Dragan Markovina o mitskom klubu: Velež je klub raje, ljubavi, ponosa i prkosa |publisher=''Tačno.net''|last=Markovina|first=Dragan|date=2016-02-11|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markovina is a very active writer. His first book from 2014, ''Between red and black'', is one of the first historical books in Croatia which focuses on the effects and disasters of the Croatian right wing government in Split and Mostar during the 1990s.
His third book, ''History of the defeated,'' is focused on the devastation of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] legacy in Croatia.

When it comes to his opinion on political party's in Croatia, he is a strong critic of both [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]. For Markovina, HDZ is a right wing nationalist party which promotes hate and SDP is a party that betrayed [[social democracy]].

As a teenager, Markovina was a sympathizer and friend of [[Stipe Šuvar]] and his [[Socialist Labour Party of Croatia]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2014, he said on a TV talk show that he is not a member of any party but he believes that the far-left [[Workers' Front (Croatia)|Workers' Front]] has a perspective and that he wishes them all the best. In 2016, he began setting up his own left-wing party.&lt;ref name="LeftWingParty"/&gt;

Markovina is a columnist for the national weekly newspaper ''Telegram''.

==New Croatia Left==
On 18 December 2016, Markovina alongside other well known intellectuals and civil activists founded the [[New Left Croatia]], a left wing political party mostly oriented towards social democracy and anti-fascism.&lt;ref name="'http://www.portalnovosti.com/"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/dvjesto-ljudi-na-osnivanju-nove-ljevice//|title=Dvjesto ljudi na osnivanju Nove ljevice|trans-title=Two hundred people on the founding of the New Left|last=|first=|date=2016-12-18|work=|newspaper=[[Novosti (Croatia)|Novosti]]|location=Zagreb|issn=1845-8955|access-date=2017-11-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his candidacy for Mayor of Split in the [[Split local elections, 2017|2017 local elections]]. He received 3.47% of the popular vote in the Mayor elections while the New Left received 4,36% of the popular vote in the City council elections.[http://www.izbori.hr/231lok/rezult/1/nrezultati.html#close]

'''Enos''' or '''Enosh''' ({{lang-he-n|אֱנוֹשׁ}} ''ʼEnōš''; "mortal man"; {{lang-ar|أَنُوش/يَانِش|Yāniš/’Anūš}}; [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]: ሄኖስ ''Henos''), in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], is the first son of [[Seth]] who figures in the [[Generations of Adam]], and consequently referred to within the genealogies of [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]].

According to Christianity, he is part of the [[Genealogy of Jesus]] as mentioned in {{bibleverse||Luke|3:38|NIV}}. Additionally, Enos is also mentioned in [[Islam]] in the various collections of [[qisas al-anbiya|tales of the pre-Islamic prophets]], which honor him in an identical manner. Furthermore, early Islamic historians like [[Ibn Ishaq]] and [[Ibn Hisham]] always included his name in the genealogy of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], ([[Arabic]]: ''’Anūsh'' أَنُوش  or [commonly]: ''Yānish'' يَانِش).&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishāq, ''Sīrat Rasūl Allāh'', tr. A. Guillaume (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Hebrew Bible==
According to Genesis, Seth was 105 years old when Enos was born&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|5:6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but the [[Septuagint]] version gives 205 years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Genesis/index.htm Septuagint, Genesis]&lt;/ref&gt;), and Seth had further sons and daughters. He was the grandson of [[Adam and Eve]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|5:6-11|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:38|NIV}}). According to [[Seder Olam Rabbah]], based on Jewish reckoning, he was born in [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 235. According to the Septuagint, it was in AM 435.

Enos was the father of [[Kenan]], who was born when Enos was 90 years old&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|5:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 190 years, according to the Septuagint). According to the Bible he died at the age of 905.

==In Judaism==
{{bibleverse||Genesis|4:26|HE}} says: "And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the Lord". The traditional Jewish interpretation of this verse, though, implies that it marked the beginning of idolatry, i.e. that men start dubbing "Lord" things that were mere creatures. This is because the previous generations, notably Adam, had already "begun calling upon the name of the Lord", which forces us to interpret הוחל huchal not as "began" but as the homonym "profanated". In this light, Enosh suggests the notion of a humanity (Enoshut) thinking of itself as an absolute rather than in relation to God (Enosh vs. Adam).

[[Maimonides]] in [[Mishneh Torah]] Avodat Kochavim chapter 1:1-2 writes:
During the times of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one of those who erred.
Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.
Most of the commentators agree with this view.

==In Christianity==
Enos is included in the [[Genealogy of Jesus]], according to Luke 3:23–28.&lt;ref name="Luke"&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|3:23–38|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopian Orthodox Bible===
According to the [[Book of Jubilees]] (4:11-13) in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] Bible, Enos was born in [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 235, and "began to call on the name of the Lord on the earth." He married his sister, No'am, and she bore him [[Kenan]] in the year 325 AM. Ethiopian Orthodox tradition considers him a "faithful and righteous servant of God", and further credits him with the introduction, following a divine revelation, of the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] in its original, consonant-only form, "as an instrument for codifying the laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eotc-patriarch.org/teachings.htm#alpha Official Website of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625174828/http://www.eotc-patriarch.org/teachings.htm |date=2010-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-day Saint Scripture===
[[The Doctrine and Covenants]] teaches that Enos was ordained to the [[Priesthood]] at age 134.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.44?lang=eng#43 Doctrine &amp; Covenants 107:44]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Adam]] called his posterity into the land of [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]] to give them a final blessing, Enos was one of the righteous high priests in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53?lang=eng#52 Doctrine &amp; Covenants 107:53]&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century Protestantism===
According to [[Matthew George Easton]], 19th century Scottish Presbyerian Preacher and author of [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], "In his time 'men began to call upon the name of the Lord' (Gen. 4:26), meaning either (1) then began men to call themselves by the name of the Lord (marg.) i.e., to distinguish themselves thereby from idolaters; or (2) then men in some public and earnest way began to call upon the Lord, indicating a time of spiritual revival"&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastonsbibledictionary.org/1213-Enos.php “Enos” entry in [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family tree==
according to the [[Book of Jubilees]]
{{Antediluvian patriarchs genealogy}}

==In Mandaeanism==
According to the [[Mandaean]] scriptures including the [[Qolusta|Qolastā]], the [[Draša D-Iahia|Book of John]] and [[Ginza Rba|Genzā Rabbā]], Enosh is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure [[Anush Uthra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-1931956499|title=The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran|date=1932 |author=Drower, E.S. |publisher=Gorgias Press.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who taught John the Baptist and performed many of the same miracles within Jerusalem typically ascribed to Jesus by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogueleaf.com/book-of-john/2012/07/09/76-anush-uthra-and-christ/# The Mandaic Book of John]&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''This page is about the World War II organization. Not to be confused with the Japanese revisionist group [[Global Alliance for Historical Truth]]&lt;!--http://gaht.jp/--&gt;. For the modern United Nations organization, see [[Global Alliance for ICT and Development]].''
'''Global Alliance For Preserving the History of WWII in Asia''' is a non-profit, non-partisan federation of over 40 grassroots organizations dedicated to the remembrance, redress and reconciliation concerning [[World War II]] in [[Asia]], also known as the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Global Alliance For Preserving the History of WWII in Asia|title = For Justice and Peace | year = 2008 | url = http://www.global-alliance.net/index.html|accessdate = 2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned about crimes committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and issues related to them such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]], [[Unit 731]], [[Comfort women]], [[Prisoners of War]] and [[Forced Labor]]. It aims to bring together such groups electronically, organizationally, and personally. This federation has become increasingly recognized{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} as the leading organization safeguarding humanity and international justice with relation to [[World War II]] in Asia and the Pacific and its aftermath. It is also the first organization of its kind since previous similar groups were only focused on one or some aspects of the war.

==History==

{{Empty section|date=November 2016}}

==Mission and goals==
Global Alliance's mission focuses on bringing about the proper closure of unresolved issues arising from Japan’s aggression that led to World War II in Asia and the Pacific. It seeks justice for victims through punishment of those criminals that were either never put on trial or set free without fulfilling their sentence. Furthermore, it asks war reparations to be given to such victims that have been neglected for over five decades.

Besides reparation and redress, members of Global Alliance seek to preserve and disseminate the true story of the war. [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] theories have focused on the denial of such massacres as the [[Nanking Massacre|Rape of Nanjing]], and the actual events that took place during the war are largely unknown in [[Japan]] and the West. To address this issue, the organization has worked towards building a memorial museum in the U.S. similar to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] to preserve the truth of atrocities during World War II. Finally, Global Alliance advocates expanded coverage of World War II history in the public school textbooks, and has promoted the inclusion of material on the Asian experience of the war. Prevalent focus has been given to the European experience, which was not the only region suffering large losses during the war.

==Beliefs==
The federation believes that historical truth will bring about justice for victims and safeguard humanity from repeating the mistakes of the past. The following beliefs summarize Global Alliance's ideology: 
*A full accounting of the [[Asia-Pacific War]] is imperative with relation to the [[Japanese Government]]’s factions that foster [[collective amnesia]] and [[ultra-nationalism]], justifying and whitewashing [[Japanese war crimes]]
*[[Crimes against humanity]] were committed on a grand scale during this time period
*Victims are still seeking justice after nearly 60 years of the war’s end
*A nation who forgets the past is condemned to repeat its mistakes
*Embrace a feeling of sympathy and friendship with the people of Japan, for they too have been victims of [[Japanese militarism]]
*Transfer [[Confucius]]’ [[Golden Rule]] to an international scale: Nations shall not do unto other countries what they would not want others do unto themselves

==Demands==
Based on the premise that the Government of Japan has to honor its post-war responsibilities, Global Alliance demands that through legislation enacted by the [[Diet of Japan]], the Government of Japan must:
*Offer an official and unequivocal apology acknowledging the commission of atrocities in [[China]], [[Korea]], and other Asian states during the [[Asia-Pacific War]]
*Authorize full disclosure and preservation of documents relating to the mentioned events
*Mandate inclusion and teaching at all levels of schooling lessons of humanity learned from Japan’s wars of aggression and its related [[war crime]] issues in the first half of the 20th century
*Provide just and due compensation to all identified surviving victims and surviving family members of the deceased victims, and victims whose properties were looted and/or destroyed
*Amend all statutory limitations under Japanese laws to make them non-applicable to [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Imperial Forces]] during the [[Asia-Pacific War]] such that victims could seek due redress in the courts of Japan
*Provide funding for the creation of a memorial museum in [[Tokyo]] dedicated to: the commemoration and remembrance of [[war victims]] of the Asia-Pacific War, the preservation of documents declassified, research and publication of information pertaining to all facets of the war, educational outreach focusing on lessons learned through war crimes and related issues of this period, and to the efforts to bring closure to this war and to prevent future wars of aggression
*Outlaw public denial of war crimes committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]
*Prosecute the living Japanese war criminals that have escaped [[Japanese war crimes|international war crime trials]] after the end of the war, such as the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]
*Remove relics of all war criminals now enshrined in the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] and prohibit honoring and worshiping of war criminals in that Shrine or any other religious establishments of national significance
*Establish a national day of remembrance for victims of the Asia-Pacific War
*Return all looted national treasures, including cultural and historical relics
*Honor the "[[Japanese military yen|military monetary certificates]]" issued by the Japanese occupational authorities for which people of victimized countries were forced to exchange their national currencies with due interest payment and adjustment for inflation

==Activities==
*Link to affiliate websites in order to enhance communication and public education
*Espouse the study, research, and dissemination of historical truths regarding World War II
*Support exhibits on World War II and exhibits on war crimes committed by the Japanese army
*Lobby to promote legislation in the U.S. and elsewhere that will facilitate sue for redress for victims
*Organize conferences to call the world’s attention to Japan’s unresolved wartime issues
*Support efforts related to the redress movement of the survivors and victims of Japanese Asia-Pacific War atrocities
*Coordinate joint projects and activities related to Global Alliance's mission among member organizations
*Convene conferences on goal-related and mission-relevant subjects of importance

==Related events==
*In 2000, a resolution ordering{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Japan to apologize and compensate victims of war crimes committed during World War II was proposed to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. The resolution included measures for comfort women, Korean women forced into providing sex to the Japanese Army. Congressman [[Lane Evans]] - [[Illinois' 13th congressional district]] - submitted the resolution to the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], formerly known as the International Relations Committee, on June 19 for consideration during the [[106th Congress]] in September. This resolution is the second of its kind, following one submitted by Congressman [[William Lipinski]]- [[Illinois' 3rd congressional district]] - in July 1997. The resolution was passed on to the International Relations Committee’s Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, but it was later scrapped when congressmen delayed passing the resolutions, fearing damage to United States relations with Japan.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
*In 2006, two members of the [[United States Congress]], Representative [[Lane Evans]] (D-Illinois) and Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (R-New Jersey), have introduced a non-binding resolution (H.Res. 759) in the current congressional session which calls on the government of Japan to "formally acknowledge and accept responsibility for its [[Comfort women|sexual enslavement]] of young women" during the 1930s and 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = [[History News Network]] |title = US Congressional Resolution Calls on Japan to Accept Responsibility for Wartime Comfort women | year = 2006 | url = http://hnn.us/articles/24291.html|accessdate = April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yeshayahu Shachar''' (born '''Isaiah Stengel''')  (August 6, 1935 in [[Haifa]] – September 19, 1977) was an [[Israel]]i historian.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OfwjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gH4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5570,1370556&amp;dq=isaiah-shachar&amp;hl=en|title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search|publisher=news.google.com|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dr. Isaiah Shachar. (1935-1977).|author=Cohen, R.I.|date=1978|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dNuQwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] he studied European history and [[Jewish history]] in eastern Europe. His master thesis in 1963 was entitled ''Criticism of the Jewish community and Its Leadership in the [[Hasidic]] and Non-Hasidic Literature of Eighteenth century [[Poland]]—A Comparative Study'' (in [[Hebrew]]). 1964-66 Shachar was [[junior research fellow]] at the [[Warburg Institute]] ([[University of London]]) where he worked on a [[doctoral dissertation]] under the supervision of professor [[E. H. Gombrich]] (finished 1967). It was published in his main work: ''The [[Judensau]]: A Medieval Anti-Jewish Motif and Its History'', Warburg Institute Surveys, 5 (London, 1974). He also edited the catalogue of the Feuchtwanger Collection of Judaica at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem (Jerusalem, 1981), and published miscellaneous monographs, including one establishing the authenticity of the personal seal of [[Nachmanides]] (found in a field in Israel). His varied interests included the early history of [[Hasidism]]; Jewish iconography and portraiture, and Jewish/Hebrew bibliography. His important personal library was auctioned at Sotheby's (1980). He held teaching posts at Hebrew University and University College, London, and at the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies.

Shachar wrote some articles on [[Jewish art]]. A memorial volume commemorating the life and works of Shachar was edited by Clare Moore in 1993: ''The Visual Dimension: Aspects of Jewish Art'' (Westview Press, 1993).

'''Karl''' August '''Bomansson''' (5 April 1827 in [[Saltvik]] – 7 February 1906 in [[Helsinki]]), was a Finnish historian and archivist. Between 1870 and 1883 he was chief archivist at the [[National Archives of Finland]]. From 1862 he was associate professor in history at [[Helsinki University]].

In 1853 he was organizing the Finnish senates archives, and modernizing it into better standards. As a man of science he was foremost interested in the history of [[Åland]]. He wrote ''Kastelholm'' (1956), and ''Om Ålands folkminnen'' (1859), which was the first work on the archaeological subject in Finland. Bomansson took part in the excavations in [[Kökar]] in 1867. His assistant was then Johan Reinhold Aspelin.

==History==

===Pre-Islamic===
Indigenous Arabs, as well as Jews, once made up the population of Khaybar, although when Jewish settlement in northern Arabia began is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;In a research conducted by [[David Samuel Margoliouth]] and published in the [[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]] in the last century, he points out the fact that the Jews of Khaybar and Yathrib (in Saudi-Arabia), as early as the 6th century CE when Jews still lived there - before being evicted to places in Syria and to the city of [[al-Kufah]] in Iraq, did not differentiate between the non-accentuated "thau" ('''ת''') and the accentuated "tau" ('''תּ''')  – although these letters have distinct phonetic sounds by those scrupulous in the use of proper Hebrew grammar (See: Margoliouth, D.S.: "A poem attributed to Al-Samau’al." Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. Published by the Society, 22, Albemarle St. London W. London, 1906. p. 364).&lt;/ref&gt; In 567, Khaybar was invaded and vacated of its Jewish inhabitants by the [[Ghassanid]] Arab Christian king [[Al-Harith ibn Jabalah]]. He later freed the captives upon his return to the [[Levant]]. A brief account of the campaign is given by [[Ibn Qutaybah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamport.com/b/5/adab/%df%ca%c8%20%c7%e1%c3%cf%c8/%c7%e1%e3%da%c7%d1%dd/%c7%e1%e3%da%c7%d1%dd%20005.html Ibn Qutaybah: al-Ma'arif]&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed by the [[Harran, as-Suwayda|Harran Inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/harran.html Harran Inscription]&lt;/ref&gt; See Irfan Shahid's ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century'' for full details.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Shahid]]: ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the sixth century'', p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===7th century===
{{Main|Jewish community of Khaybar}}

As late as the 7th century, Khaybar was still inhabited by Jews, who pioneered the cultivation of the oasis&lt;ref&gt;Yāqut, ''Šihāb al-Dīn ibn ‘Abd Allah al-Ḥamawī al-Rūmī al-Baġdādī'' (ed. Ferdinand Wüstenfeld), Mu’jam al-Buldān, vol. IV, Leipzig 1866, p. 542 (reprint: Ṭaharān 1965, ''Maktabat al-Asadi''); Hayyim Zeev Hirschberg, ''Israel Ba-‘Arav'', Tel Aviv 1946, p. 343 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; and made their living growing date palm trees, as well as through commerce and craftsmanship, accumulating considerable wealth. Some objects found by the Muslims when they entered Khaybar &amp;mdash; a [[siege engine|siege-engine]], 20 [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]s of [[Yemen]]ite cloth, and 500 cloaks &amp;mdash; point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews.  In the past some scholars attempted to explain the siege-engine by suggesting that it was used for settling quarrels among the families of the community.  Today most academics believe it was stored in a depôt for future sale, in the same way that swords, lances, shields, and other weaponry had been sold by the Jews to Arabs. Equally, the cloth and the cloaks may have been intended for sale, as it was unlikely that such a quantity of luxury goods were kept for the exclusive use of the Jews.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shikk, and al-Katiba, probably separated by natural divisions, such as the desert, [[Harrat Khaybar]] [[lava]] drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a separate family and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the settlers raised the fortresses up on hills or [[basalt]] rocks.

===Aftermath===
Jews continued to live in the oasis for several more years afterwards until they were finally expelled by caliph [[Umar]]. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews of the Khaybar Fortress served as a precedent.  Islamic law came to require exaction of tribute known as ''[[jizya]]'' from ''[[dhimmi]]s'', i.e. non-Muslims under Muslim rule.

For many centuries, the [[oasis]] at Khaybar was an important [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] stopping place.  The center developed around a series of ancient dams built to hold run-off water from the rain. Around the water catchments, [[date palm]]s grew.  Khaybar became an important date-producing center.

===Battle of Khaybar===
The [[Battle of Khaybar]] took place in May/June 628.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|author=Watt, W. Montgomery|author-link=Montgomery Watt|title=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GfAGAQAAIAAJ Muhammad at Medina]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0195773071|page=2|quote=Muhammad had thus a straightforward reason for attacking Khaybar. The moment he chose for the attack May /June 628 (i/y) shortly after his return from the expedition of al-Hudaybiyah was one when it was also convenient for him to have booty to distribute to his followers whose expectations had recently been disappointed.}} ([https://archive.org/details/muhammadatmedina029655mbp free online])&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jewish Banū *Naḍīr of *Medina, who claimed to be descendants of Aaron the priest, owned lands in Khaybar and had castles, fortresses, and their own weapons there. After Muhammad expelled them from Medina in 625, their leaders moved to their estates in Khaybar in order to prepare for war against Muhammad and to recruit the aid of Arab tribes. Muhammad first sent disguised guests to the homes of the leaders of Banū Naḍīr who then killed their hosts. Muhammad's victory over the Jews of Khaybar in the subsequent battle was also aided by the distance of the settlements and their castles from one another, the absence of coordination between the fighting forces, the death of the leader Sallām ibn Mishkam, and a Jew who showed the Muslims the secret entrances to one of the fortresses. The castles of Khaybar had tunnels and passages which in wartime enabled the besieged to reach water sources outside the castles.&lt;ref name="I. Ben-Ze'ev, 1946"&gt;I. Ben-Ze'ev, ''Ha-Yehudim ba-Arav'' (19572), index; H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrael ba-Arav'' (1946), index; I. Ben Zvi, in: ''Keneset'', 5 (1940), 281–302; J. Braslavsky, ''Le-Ḥeker Arẓenu'' (1954), 3–52 (English summaries: 3–4, English section); S.D. Goitein, in: KS, 9 (1932/33), 507–21; Caetani, in: ''Annali dell' Islam'', 2 (1905), 8–41; R. Leszynsky, ''Juden in Arabien zur Zeit Mohammeds'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 16-18 Muslims were killed
and 93 Jews.&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 238"&gt;Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 238. ([https://www.webcitation.org/60y569zNt?url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch6s2.html online])&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Muslim victory, Muhammad, concerned that Khaybar would remain desolate and would not continue supplying its agricultural produce to the Hejaz, signed an agreement with the Jews which allowed many of its inhabitants to remain on their lands, while requiring payment of half their crops to the conquerors. From a legal point of view the pact was defective, since it did not define the situation of the Jews and did not say whether they were to remain the owners of the soil which they were to cultivate. In later years Muslim jurists defined this settlement as land tenure with rent paid in produce. One version of this agreement was copied by Joseph *Sambari in the 17th century. According to Muslim sources, Muhammad returned to the Jews copies of the Torah seized during the siege, since he opposed desecrating them. After captives of war and slaves from other countries were brought to Khaybar and the people of Hejaz became more accustomed to agriculture, the caliph Omar decided to expel the Jews of Khaybar in 642 under the pretense that before his death Muhammad had commanded that two religions could not exist simultaneously in the Hejaz.&lt;ref name="I. Ben-Ze'ev, 1946"/&gt;

===Expedition of Fadak===
In 627 Muhammad also ordered the [[Expedition of Fadak]] to attack the Bani Sa‘d bin Bakr tribe, because Muhammad received intelligence they were planning to help the Jews of Khaybar.&lt;ref&gt;Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 211. ([https://www.webcitation.org/60wanT9G2?url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s13.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; In this expedition 1 person was captured by Muslims, the rest of the tribe fled.&lt;ref name="Sa'd 1967 110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sa'd|first=Ibn|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=AUL5Tf7sN8jIsgaVreXVDw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=_vnXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq|title=Kitab al-tabaqat al-kabir, By Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2|year=1967|publisher=Pakistan Historical Society|asin=B0007JAWMK|page=110|quote=SARIYYAH OF 'ALI IBN ABl TALIB AGAINST BANU SA'D IBN BAKR AT FADAK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion of the Jews==
During the reign of Caliph [[Umar]] (634-644), the Jewish community of Khaybar were transported alongside the Christian community of [[Najran]] to the newly conquered regions of [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]]; Umar also forbade [[Kafir|non-Muslim]]s to reside in the [[Hejaz]] for longer than three days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Levi Della Vida]] and [[Michael Bonner]], ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', and Madelung, ''The Succession to Prophet Muhammad'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Jews of Khaybar traveled around many areas throughout the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic Empire]] as artisans and merchants and maintained a distinctive identity until the 12th century.

==The Journey of Benjamin of Tudela==
{{main|Benjamin of Tudela}}
Benjamin was a Jew from [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. He travelled to Persia and Arabia in the 12th century. He visited and described Khaybar and neighboring [[Tayma]] some time around 1170, mentioning these places as Jewish habitations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela'' (ed. Marcus Nathan Adler), Oxford University Press, London 1907, pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

Historically, Khaybar is known for growing [[dates (fruit)|dates]]. The dates raised in the region were generally exported to [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Prothero83&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9321">'''Louis Hartz''' (April 8, 1919 – January 20, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] political scientist and influential liberal proponent of the idea of [[American exceptionalism]].

Hartz was born in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], the son of [[Russians|Russian]] Jewish immigrants, but grew up in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. After graduating from [[Technical High School (Omaha, Nebraska)|Technical High School]] in Omaha, he attended [[Harvard University]], financed partly by a scholarship from the ''[[Omaha World Herald]]''.

==Career==
Hartz graduated in 1940, spent a year traveling abroad on a fellowship, and returned to Harvard as a teaching fellow in 1942. He earned his doctorate in 1946 and became a full professor of government in 1956. Hartz was known at Harvard for his talented and charismatic teaching. He retired in 1974 for ill health and spent his last years living in [[London]], [[New Delhi]], [[New York City]], then [[Istanbul]], where he died of an  epileptic seizure.

Hartz is best known for his classic book ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955), which presented a view of America's past that sought to explain its conspicuous absence of ideologies. Hartz argued that American political development occurs within the context of an enduring, underlying [[Lockean]] liberal consensus, which has shaped and narrowed the landscape of possibilities for U.S. political thought and behavior. He attributed the triumph of the liberal worldview in America to its lack of a [[feudal]] past and thus the absence of a struggle to overcome a conservative internal order, to its vast resources and open space, and to the liberal values of the original settlers, who represented only a narrow middle-class slice of European society. Hartz was chiefly concerned with explaining the failure of [[socialism]] to become established in America, and he believed that Americans' pervasive, unthinking consensual acceptance of [[classic liberalism]] was the major barrier.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel H. Beer "Hartz, Louis", ''The "American National Biography'' (2003)  https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1401127&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Founding of New Societies'' (1964), Hartz developed the idea that the nations that developed from settler colonies were European "[[fragment theory|fragments]]" that in a sense froze the class structure and underlying ideology prevalent in the mother country at the time of their foundation and did not experience the further evolution experienced in Europe. He considered Latin America and French Canada to be fragments of feudal Europe, the United States, English Canada, and Dutch South Africa to be liberal fragments, and Australia and English South Africa to be "radical" fragments (incorporating the nonsocialist working class radicalism of Britain in the early 19th century).

Hartz led a normal life until a sudden unexplained emotional disturbance changed his entire personality in 1971. He refused all medical help. He divorced in 1972, rejected all his friends, and feuded intensely with students, faculty and administrators. In 1974 he resigned from Harvard, but his scholarly skills and interests remained strong.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, ''American National Biography'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1956, the [[American Political Science Association]] awarded Hartz its [[Woodrow Wilson]] Prize for ''The Liberal Tradition in America'', and in 1977 gave him its Lippincott Prize, designed to honor scholarly works of enduring importance. The book remains a key text in the [[political science]] graduate [[curriculum]] in American politics in [[universities]] today, in part because of the extensive, longrunning criticism and commentary that Hartz's ideas have generated. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Hartz's fragment thesis was disseminated and elaborated upon for the Canadian context by [[Gad Horowitz]], in his essay "Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in Canada: An Interpretation" (1966). Horowitz's influential interpretation was still actively debated into the 21st century in Canadian political theory.

In Australia, Hartz's fragment thesis "received respectful attention, but ... did not win assent or committed followers", according to historian [[John Hirst (historian)|John Hirst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48958283|title=The Oxford companion to Australian history|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Davison, Graeme, 1940-, Hirst, J. B. (John Bradley), Macintyre, Stuart, 1947-|isbn=019551503X|edition=Rev.|location=South Melbourne|oclc=48958283}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was applied to early colonial history by feminist historian [[Miriam Dixson]] in ''The Real Matilda'' (1976), in which she traced gender relations in colonial [[New South Wales]] to the culture of the proletarian fragment identified by Hartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2524187|title=The real Matilda : woman and identity in Australia, 1788-1975|last=Miriam.|first=Dixson,|date=1976|publisher=Penguin Books Australia|isbn=0140219382|location=Ringwood, Australia|oclc=2524187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the ''[[Australian Economic History Review]]'' dedicated an issue to analysis of Hartz's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 1973|title=Australia and the Hartz 'fragment' thesis|url=|journal=Australian Economic History Review|volume= XIII| issue =  2|pages=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie-Claire Daveluy''' (August 15, 1880 &amp;ndash; January 21, 1968) was a Canadian librarian, historian and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=FeflDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1847 |title=Creative Canada: A Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-century Creative and Performing Artists |pages=1847–49 |volume=Volume 1 |year=1971 |ISBN=1442637838}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered a pioneer in [[library science]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academiedeslettresduquebec.ca/membres/marie-claire-daveluy-74 |title=Marie-Claire Daveluy |publisher=Académie des lettres du Québec |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughter of Georges Daveluy and Marie Lesieur Desaulniers, she was born in [[Montreal]] and was educated at the Hochelaga Convent. She earned a degree in library science at [[McGill University]] in 1920. At the [[Montreal Public Libraries Network|Bibliothèque municipale de Montréal]], she was assistant librarian from 1920 to 1943 and head of cataloguing from 1930 to 1941. In 1937, with [[Aegidius Fauteux]], she founded the École de bibliothécaires at the [[Université de Montréal]] and served as its chair for several years. She also helped found the Association canadienne des bibliothécaires de langue française in 1943. She hosted a weekly program of historical sketches on [[Ici Radio-Canada Première|Radio-Canada]] from 1943 to 1948. Daveluy contributed articles to various periodicals including the ''{{ill|Revue d'histoire de l'Amérique française|fr}}'', ''La Bonne Parole'', ''L'Oiseau bleu'' and ''[[L'Action nationale|L'action française]]''. Her novels for youth combined Canadian history with romantic fiction. She also published a number of fairy tales including ''Le Filleul du roi Grolo'', ''Sur les ailes de l'oiseau bleu'' and ''Une Révolte au pays des fées''.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;&lt;ref name=montreal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archivesdemontreal.ica-atom.org/daveluy-marie-claire-1880-1968 |title=Daveluy, Marie-Claire |work=Catalogue des archives de la Ville de Montréal |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first woman to become a member of the Montreal Historical Society. In 1924, she received the {{ill|Prix David|fr}} for her historical novel ''Aventures de Perrine et Charlot''. In 1934, she received the Prix de l'[[Académie Française]] and a second Prix David for ''Jeanne-Mance, 1606-1673''.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/literaryarchives/027011-200.034-e.html |title=Marie-Claire Daveluy fonds |publisher=Library and Archives Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/030001-1352-e.html |title=Marie-Claire Daveluy |work=Celebrating Women's Achievements |publisher=Library and Archives Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montreal/&gt;

[[File:Uhle max.jpg|thumb|upright|Max Uhle.]]
'''Friedrich Max Uhle''' (25 March 1856 – 11 May 1944) was a German [[archaeologist]], whose work in [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Bolivia]] at the turn of the Twentieth Century had a significant impact on the practice of archaeology of South America.

==Biography==
Uhle was born in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] on 25 March 1856 and received his Ph.D. in 1880 from the University of Leipzig. He married Charlotte Grosse from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], where he worked at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] for several years.

Trained as a [[philologist]], Uhle became interested in Peru while a curator at Dresden Museum.  In 1888, a close friend, [[Alphons Stübel]], who had recently published an article on the history of Peruvian archaeology, suggested Uhle concentrate his studies on that region.  He first traveled to South America in 1892 to initiate research in Argentina and Bolivia for the Konigliches Museum fur Völkerkunde in [[Berlin, Germany]].  In that same year he published ''"The Ruins of Tiahuanaco in the Highlands of Ancient Peru,"'' with photographer and engineer [[B. von Grumbkow]].  This extensive work is considered the first in depth scientific account of the ancient site of [[Tiwanaku]], Bolivia.

Uhle returned to South America in 1896, now sponsored by the American Exploration Society in Philadelphia. He also enjoyed the patronage of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the mother of [[William Randolph Hearst]].  He undertook excavations at [[Pachacamac]], near the coast of Peru, and on [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]] and [[Chimu]] sites. His site report of work at Pachacamac was highly praised and is still used as a basic text for studying South American archaeology.  He recognized versions of Tiwanaku stone sculpture imagery on ceramics, textiles, and other artifacts in these coastal sites.  On this trip, he recovered approximately 9,000 artifacts spanning over 3,000 years of Andean pre-history.  These included [[Nazca]] pottery, shells, textiles, metals, objects made of wood and other plant material, and objects constructed of animal materials such as feathers, bone, and leather.  He concentrated on the dating of these artifacts, and established a system primarily based on textile design. Artifacts found in the Mocha Valley were dated based on the  sequential position of Inca ceramic styles. This early dating was later advanced by American archaeologist [[Alfred Kroeber]] and is one of the key points in understanding the chronology of pre-Inca Peru. Uhle later worked in the highlands of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chile. In 1917 he was the first to scientifically describe the [[Chinchorro mummies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artslivres.com/ShowArticle.php?Id=211 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185544/http://artslivres.com/ShowArticle.php?Id=211 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Max Ulhe also participated in numerous paleontological excavations. In 1926, Max Uhle and paleontologist, Franz Spillmann, excavated, about 12 km. east of Quito, Ecuador, an almost complete mastodon skeleton, together with associated obsidian and bone tools and about 150 potsherds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equinox-project.com/esop81.htm|title=The Equinox Project|website=Equinox-project.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uhle also made a notable contribution to North American archaeology in excavations of the Emeryville shell-mound in San Francisco Bay, [[California]]. The German-Peruvian Max Uhle School in [[Arequipa, Peru]] was named after him.

[[File:Galileo-1638-173.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]]'s demonstration of the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion. It is the same demonstration that [[Oresme]] had made centuries earlier.]]

In the 14th-century, the [[Oxford Calculators]] of [[Merton College]] and French collaborators such as [[Nicole Oresme]] proved the '''mean speed theorem''', also known as the '''Merton rule''' of [[uniform acceleration]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Grant]], ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'' (1974) Vol. 1, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Merton mean speed theorem'''. It essentially says that: a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e., zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with [[speed|uniform speed]] whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |publisher=Dover |year=1959 |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |chapter=III. Medieval Contributions |pages=79–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Details==
Oresme essentially provided a geometrical verification for the generalized Merton Rule, which we would express today as &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_f)t&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., distance traveled is equal to one half of the sum of the initial and final velocities, multiplied by the elapsed time), by finding the area of a [[trapezoid]].&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Edwards, Jr., ''The Historical Development of the Calculus'' (1979) pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay tablets used in [[Babylonian astronomy]] (350–50 BC) present trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and [[Displacement (vector)|motion]] and anticipate the theorem by 14 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ossendrijver |first=Mathieu |date=29 Jan 2016 |title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter’s position from the area under a time-velocity graph |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full |journal=Science |publisher= |volume=351 |issue=6272 |pages=482–484 |doi=10.1126/science.aad8085 |access-date=29 January 2016|bibcode = 2016Sci...351..482O |pmid=26823423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval scientists demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of "[[Law of falling bodies|the law of falling bodies]]" — long before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is generally credited with it. The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main [[kinematical]] properties of [[uniformly accelerated motion]]s, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

The theorem is a special case of the more general kinematics equations for uniform acceleration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4208">The '''Michael Shaara Award for Excellence in Civil War Fiction''' is an annual literary award awarded to the writer of a work of fiction related to the [[American Civil War]]. The award was started by [[Jeffrey Shaara|Jeffrey ("Jeff") Shaara]], (b. 1952),  and named for his father, the writer of historical fiction [[Michael Shaara]], (1928–1988), who won the 1975 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the 1974 novel of the [[American Civil War]], ''[[Killer Angels]]'', about the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], and later made into the [[Ted Turner]]-produced movie in 1993, ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', by director  [[Robert Maxwell]]. The original novel and movie later became the inspiration for son Jeff's prequel ''[[Gods and Generals (novel)|Gods and Generals]]'', (1996), and sequel ''[[The Last Full Measure (novel)|The Last Full Measure]]'', (1998),  set of novels of which ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' was also made into a film in 2003 by Turner and Maxwell focusing on the earlier part of the war with  Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. ("Stonewall") Jackson]]. The younger Shaara has also since written several other novels and series of [[historical fiction]] about the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Mexican–American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. He later returned to the theme of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with a set of works focusing on the western theatre of the war, ([[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theatre]]).&lt;ref name=lsu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/shaara.html|title=The Michael Shaara Award for Excellence in Civil War Fiction|publisher=[[Louisiana State University]]|accessdate=9 August 2011|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235350/http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/shaara.html|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $5,000 was first awarded in 1997, at the United States Civil War Center at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. In 2004, it was moved to the [[Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/civilwar/prizes_andscholarships/michael_shaaraprize/about_themichaelshaaraprize.dot|title=About the Michael Shaara Prize|publisher=[[Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College]]|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is Professor of Christian History and Theology at the [[University of Exeter]] and Head of the Theology and Religion Department. She is known in particular for her work on [[Gregory of Nyssa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/theology/staff/ludlow/|title=Professor Morwenna Ludlow {{!}} Theology and Religion {{!}} University of Exeter|website=humanities.exeter.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ludlow studied [[Literae humaniores|Literae Humaniores]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and remained there to study for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] in [[Theology]] with a dissertation about universal salvation in [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and [[Karl Rahner]]. Ludlow began work on her D.Phil. at [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] but moved to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]] on receipt of a Holwell Studentship, and moved again to [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] to take up a Junior Research Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5yYTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=%22Morwenna+Ludlow%22+st+john's+college+oxford&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dit3KmISw_&amp;sig=dqcuZIjDaHBVW7FKAW0CgPnE2pQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCrvahw_HcAhXqDMAKHbIABrcQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Morwenna%20Ludlow%22%20st%20john's%20college%20oxford&amp;f=false|title=Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory of Nyssa and Karl Rahner|last=Ludlow|first=Morwenna|date=2000-12-07|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198270225|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Ludlow worked at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] before moving to the [[University of Exeter]]. In 2006 Ludlow was appointed as lecturer in [[Patristics]] in the Department of Theology and Religion, [[University of Exeter]]. She was appointed [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Christian History and Theology in 2016. She delivered her inaugural lecture on the 3 November 2016 on ''The Workshop: Experiments in History and Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/ehsoc/about/morwenna-ludlow-0|title=Professor Morwenna Ludlow {{!}} Ecclesiastical History Society|website=www.history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/theology/news/title_550481_en.html|title=University of Exeter|last=Robinson|first=Debbie|website=humanities.exeter.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludlow works primarily on [[patristics]], in particular the work of the fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers|Cappadocian]] theologian, [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. Ludlow uses her research into early Christian thought to examine modern theology by analysing the reception of patristic theology by modern writers. She also works on the history of [[eschatology]] in Christianity, with a focus on the idea of universal salvation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordpatristics.com/directors|title=patristics {{!}} directors|website=patristics|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludlow is currently working on the aesthetic qualities and doctrinal content of 4th century Greek Christian texts through a project, ''Art, Craft and Rhetoric.'' In this work, Ludlow uses [[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]] theorists from [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] and [[William Morris|Morris]] up to the present-day in order to re-examine early Christian texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ludlow appeared on BBC Radio 4's ''[[In Our Time (radio series)|In Our Time]]'' on 4 March 2018) to discuss the conversion of Augustine of Hippo to Christianity in a programme with Kate Cooper and Martin Palmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09tyzvz|title=Augustine's Confessions, In Our Time - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordained ministry==
Ludlow was [[ordained]] in the [[Church of England]] as a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] in 2015 and as a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Ludlow | forenames = Morwenna Ann | id = 47299 | accessed = 11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Curate]] at [[Exeter Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exeter-cathedral.org.uk/about-us/our-people/cathedral-clergy/|title=Cathedral Clergy - Exeter Cathedral|work=Exeter Cathedral|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2018, she has also served as [[canon theologian]] of the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Appointments |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/26-october/gazette/appointments/appointments |accessdate=11 November 2018 |work=Church Times |date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The immediate cause of the riot was a [[hit-and-run]] accident just before midnight on 23 June 1991 on the pedestrian crossing at Piłsudskiego and Zuzanny Morawskiej streets.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; A speeding luxury car driven by seventeen-year-old Roman Packowski of [[Romani people|Romani ethnicity]] hit and seriously injured two young pedestrians, killing one of them.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; The driver fled the scene and hid from the police.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; He was later convinced by the Roma elders to turn himself in.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; Soon after the accident the local radio station informed that the driver had fled the scene. This claim was in fact true;&lt;ref name="cbos"&gt;Anna Giza-Poleszczuk i Jan Poleszczuk, "Cyganie i Polacy w Mławie konflikt etniczny czy społeczny?" prepared for [[CBOS]], Warszawa, December 1992, pages 24 to 29&lt;/ref&gt; however, the driver fled after people who witnessed the accident already identified his vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Beata Klimkiewicz (7 December 1999), [http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=1127  The pogrom in Mława, Poland: no media influence on justice.] ERRC.org&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two days the driver and his car were hidden among the local [[Romani people|Roma community]].&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbos"/&gt;

The accident victim who died from his injuries was the 21-year-old Jaroslaw Pinczewski. The mayor of Mława, Adam Chmielinski informed that he died at the scene.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; Other victim, seventeen-year old Katarzyna Zakrzewska, suffered permanent physical incapacitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cahn |first=Claude |editor=Claude Cahn |title=Roma rights: race, justice, and strategies for equality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8E9u2aD4fYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22in+the+Polish+town+of+Mlawa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nZVATeGCHImChQeCo9DzCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20the%20Polish%20town%20of%20Mlawa%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-01-26 |series=Sourcebook on contemporary controversies |year=2002 |publisher=IDEA |isbn=978-0-9702130-6-8 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Two days later some sixty Mława youths targeted and destroyed the house of a local Roma leader. The assailants quickly grew in number and began burning other Roma homes. Estimates put the number of participants in the violence from one hundred to two hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=EU Accession Monitoring Program|first=|title=Monitoring the EU accession process: minority protection : country reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=LVZATdD3JqSShAfnvpCSCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=8-IVAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=MLAWA+poland+romanies&amp;q=MLAWA+#search_anchor|accessdate=2011-01-27|series=Monitoring the EU accession process |volume=1|year=2001|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|isbn= 978-1-891385-19-3|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Roma found protection at the local police station. Others hid at the homes of their Polish friends.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; A total of 17 Roma houses were seriously damaged and further 4 houses and 9 apartments were vandalized, but no members of the Roma community were hurt. The crowd apparently targeted wealthier Roma and their estates. The police brought in additional forces and imposed a [[curfew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=1127|title=When the media make a difference: Comparing two European race crimes|last=Klimkiewicz|first=Beata|date=7 July 2004|publisher=[[European Roma Rights Centre]]|pages=''The pogrom in Mlawa, Poland: no media influence on justice''|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former political dissident [[Adam Michnik]] writing in ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' castigated the police and political authorities for their alleged inaction. The paper also demanded 'official action against ethnic hatred'. As a result, a number of political parties and academic institutions belatedly condemned the pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8E9u2aD4fYC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22was+the+only+paper+to+advocate+official+action+against+ethnic+hatred%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C-JATYW9MpK5hAfewfmZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22was%20the%20only%20paper%20to%20advocate%20official%20action%20against%20ethnic%20hatred%22&amp;f=false Cahn (2002) p.120]&lt;/ref&gt;

The eruption of ethnic violence at Mława in 1991 has been described as 'the renewal of anti-Gypsy racism in Poland' by hostile foreign critics; presumably linked to a significant rise in Polish Roma [[Asylum seeker|asylum applications]] in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Acton|first=Thomas Alan|title=Gypsy politics and Traveller identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr3pF8qyS_AC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22In+1991+a+pogrom+at+Mlawa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CqFATeP6IIKyhAfk19ynBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%201991%20a%20pogrom%20at%20Mlawa%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-01-27|year=1997|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|isbn=978-0-900458-75-0|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drobizheva |first=L.

Afterwards, 21 persons were brought to court, and 17 were sentenced for up to 30 months in prison. The President of the Roma Society of Poland, Roman Kwiatkowski informed that the relations between the local Roma and their Polish neighbours twenty years after the fact are good.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11929">The '''New Cross house fire''' was a [[conflagration|fire]] that occurred during a party at a house in [[New Cross]], south-east [[London]], in the early hours of Sunday, 18 January 1981. The blaze killed thirteen young people aged between 14 and 22, and one survivor committed suicide two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/03/ukcrime.owenbowcott |title=Inquest begins into 14 victims of 1981 fire  |last1=Bowcott |first1=Owen |date=3 February 2004 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one has ever been charged in connection to the fire, which forensic science subsequently established was started from inside the house, either by accident or deliberately.

==Circumstances==
The party was a joint birthday celebration for Yvonne Ruddock (one of the victims of the fire) and Angela Jackson (who survived) and was held at No. 439, New Cross Road. It began on the evening of Saturday, 17 January 1981 and continued throughout the night and into the early hours of Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Akwagyiram, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2011/01/110118_birth_black_britain.shtml "Did the New Cross fire create a black British identity?"], BBC News, 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, there was a fairly high degree of racial tension in the area and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] groups including the [[British National Front|National Front]] were active locally. 

There had also been some early complaints from neighbours about excessive noise from the party.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/18/newsid_2530000/2530333.stm|title=1981: Nine die in New Cross house fire|date=1981|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A white [[Austin Princess]] was seen driving away from the fire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The initial police suspicion was that the party had been fire-bombed, either as a revenge attack or in an attempt to stop the noise; there was also an alternative theory that a fight had broken out, from which the blaze emanated. 

Subsequent forensic investigation found that the fire had started in an armchair inside the front-room of the property at 5:40am on Sunday morning and police ruled out the theory that a fight had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Dee Lahiri, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/15/race.london "'I don't think I can die before I find out what happened to my son'"], ''The Guardian'', 15 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and the Black People's Day of Action==
One week after the fire, on 25 January, a meeting was held at the Moonshot Club in New Cross, attended by over one thousand people. The meeting concluded with a march to the scene of the fire and a [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] there, which blocked New Cross Road for several hours. The New Cross Massacre Action Committee was set up and organised weekly meetings in New Cross, which saw increasing participation as the police investigation announced that there was no evidence of arson and that the fire was believed to be accidental.

The Action Committee organised a "Black People's Day of Action" on 2 March, when 20,000 people marched over a period of eight hours from [[Fordham Park]] to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] carrying placards including: "Thirteen Dead and Nothing Said", "No Police Cover-Up" and "Blood Ah Go Run If Justice No Come". One slogan read: "Dame Jill Knight Set The Fire Alight!" — an apparent reference to a controversial speech by [[Jill Knight, Baroness Knight of Collingtree|Dame Jill Knight]], a right-wing member of the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]], which was widely interpreted as condoning or even encouraging "direct action" against noisy parties.&lt;ref&gt;Darcus Howe, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/17/new-cross-fire-we-cant-forget "New Cross: the blaze we cannot forget"], ''The Guardian'', 17 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/kurtbarling/2011/01/ "New Cross fire - a turning point?"], Barling's London, BBC, 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The march was overwhelmingly peaceful but ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper reported it with the headline: "Day the blacks ran riot in London". References in other newspapers were typically cursory mentions. None of the reports mentioned the fact that the march was cut in two at [[Blackfriars Bridge]] by police. This unexplained action created delay, confusion and frustration, and was seen as an attempt to stop the march. It also isolated the stewards and march leaders from the general public who had joined the march at the rear. Press indifference or outright hostility led to an increasing division between some elements of the black and white communities.

A survivor of the fire, Anthony Berbeck, apparently committed suicide on 9 July 1983 by jumping from the balcony of a block of council flats in south London. He had been traumatised by the death of his friends in the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3479827.stm "Eyewitnesses describe killer fire"], BBC News, 11 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquests==
The [[inquest]] into the deaths of the 13 teenagers saw criticism of the police. The [[coroner]]'s summary for the jury was heavily directed towards suggesting the fire was accidental, and the jury returned an [[open verdict]] which implied agreement. The victims' families challenged the procedure and while the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] agreed that the summing-up was inaccurate, it did not overturn the verdict.

In 2002 a new action in the High Court led to an order for a second inquest, which was held in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Terri Judd, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/23-years-on-new-inquest-opens-into-black-youths-killed-in-fire-5354285.html "23 years on, new inquest opens into black youths killed in fire"], ''The Independent'', 3 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This second inquest also resulted in an open verdict.

==Commemoration==
The deaths in the fire were commemorated in a number of reggae songs and poems at the time, including [[Johnny Osbourne]]'s "13 Dead and Nothing Said", [[Benjamin Zephaniah]]'s "13 Dead" and [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]]'s "New Crass Massakah".

On 14 January 2011 an event called "Remembering the New Cross Fire 30 Years On" was held at the [[Albany Theatre]] in [[Deptford]]. The event was hosted by [[Kwame Kwei-Armah]] and was an evening of spoken word, film, discussion and [[Lovers rock]] music. It featured contributions from [[Alex Pascall]], Professor [[Gus John]], filmmaker [[Menelik Shabazz]], spoken-word artists El Crisis and Zena Edwards, novelist [[Courttia Newland]] and musicians [[Janet Kay]] and [[Carroll Thompson]]. Many of the victims' families and the survivors attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Muir, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/11/hideously-diverse-britain-new-cross-tragedy "Hideously diverse Britain: Memories of the New Cross tragedy never fade"], ''The Guardian'', 11 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thealbany.org.uk/event_detail/602/Events/Remembering-the-New-Cross-Fire "Remembering the New Cross Fire"], The Albany, January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Andrew's church in [[Brockley]] has a strong connection with the victims as many of them attended the youth club there. In October 2002, Lewisham council installed a special stained-glass window at the church in their memory. On 16 January 2011 a memorial service was held there, with speakers including George Francis, chair of the New Cross Fire Parents' Committee; Lewisham council leader [[Steve Bullock (British politician)|Steve Bullock]]; and [[Joan Ruddock]], MP for Lewisham Deptford.

The victims were also commemorated in January 2011 with a blue plaque from Nubian Jak Community Trust. There is a stone memorial in [[Fordham Park]], Deptford, listing those who died; facing the stone memorial is a bench with a memorial inscription. Both were installed in 2012.

There is also a memorial to the victims consisting of a park bench plus 13 trees with a plaque at either end on [[Hackney Downs]] in east London and a memorial plaque on the wall of Catford Civic Hall listing the names of the "fourteen young people who died in the New Cross Fire of 18th January 1981".

In 2017, the '13 Dead, Nothing Said'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypfcqyj-FiM&amp;feature=youtu.be] '13 Dead, Nothing Said' exhibition at Goldsmiths - Exhibition video&lt;/ref&gt; exhibition was hosted at Goldsmiths College, University of London. The exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gold.ac.uk/calendar/?id=10585] Exhibition notes by Professor  Les Back &lt;/ref&gt; presents a body of photographs taken by Vron Ware documenting the Black People’s Day of Action on 2 March 1981. The images bear witness to an historic moment of community organising and resistance in post-war Britain.

The '''New York Competition of Dramatic Arts''' (NYCODA) is an Annual Performance Festival and Competition for actors, located in [[New York City]].

NYCODA, established in the spring of 2008, is becoming known for its appeal to both amateur and professional actors, but with a wider appeal to other areas of the performing arts.  The company flew below the radar for a while, but is fast becoming known on the New York Performance Arts scene, and being identified as uniquely Brooklyn.  In fact, many are calling it a Brooklyn movement of performance artists and a haven for the aspiring actor.

NYCODA was established as an annual performance festival and competition, where actors can compete in different genres, such as Shakespearean Drama, Dramatic Duologue, Humorous Verse and Open Reading.  Actors compete in these categories, with the Open Reading category a favorite, because the actor has freedom to choose what to perform.  In fact, many actors write and perform their own work in this category.

The NYCODA competition is typically held in the Fall of each year in the [[New York City]] borough of Brooklyn.  Contestants submit samples of their performances, typically monologues, via the company's website.  The contestants are chosen months in advance, and are notified by the Summer preceding the Fall event.  The festival is a one-day event and category winners are chosen at the end of the night and presented with some of the most sought after awards in the industry, with the biggest award, The NYCODA Actor Award going to the overall winner of the festival.  The event is recorded for television purposes.

While the NYCODA festival primarily features competing actors, many other performance artists are included.  Dancers, singers and other performers help add to the rich and complex texture of the event, and now the festival is being called the [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Festival]] of Brooklyn and the buzz is already alive in the community of aspiring actors, who see the festival and competition as another outlet to have their skills recognized and an opportunity to perform live on stage in front of a large audience.

Many noteworthy organizations are already in line to endorse the NYCODA movement, and to applaud it as the festival for which New York has long waited.  The company has begun to develop an international outlook and has begun partnering with international agencies, in Africa and Europe.  Through their international program, NYCODA welcomes actors and performance artists from all over the country and all over the world, and some NYCODA contestants have the opportunity to perform internationally as well.

[[Image:Palaisdesrois.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Palace of the Kings of Majorca]]
The '''Palace of the Kings of Majorca''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Palais des Rois de Majorque'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Palau dels Reis de Mallorca''), is a palace and a fortress with gardens overlooking the city of [[Perpignan]] in [[Pyrenees-Orientales]], [[Occitanie]], [[France]].

== History ==
=== The Kingdom of Majorca (1276-1349)===
In 1276, [[List of monarchs of Majorca|King]] [[James II of Majorca]] made [[Perpignan]] the capital of the [[Kingdom of Majorca]].  He started to build a palace with gardens on the hill of Puig del rey on the south of the town, the architects were Ramon Pau, Pons Descoll, and Bernat Quer with completion in 1309.

=== Ending the Western Schism ===
In 1415, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]], organised a European summit in Perpignan, to convince the [[Avignon]] [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] to resign his office and take to an end the [[Western Schism]] through the [[Council of Constance]]. On 20 September 1415, the Emperor met with Pope Benedict XIII at the palace with the King [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]] and the delegations of the Counts of Foix, Provence, Savoy, Lorraine, the embassy of the Roman church for the [[Council of Constance]], and embassies from the Kings of France, England, Hungary, Castille and Navarre. The pope refused to resign and to recognise the Pope that the Council had chosen, clashing with the emperor who left Perpignan on 5 November.

=== The Franco-Spanish wars ===
Part of the northern wing of the palace was destroyed in a siege in 1502.
Following the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, France gained [[Roussillon]], and proceed to develop the defensive features of the palace.

The [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]] bought the Palace and the gardens in 1958, to the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]] who keeps the [[Vauban]] bastions and 19th century buildings and courts as a garrison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/monuments/palais_majorque/index.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414081238/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/monuments/palais_majorque/index.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
The Palace of the Kings of Majorca is a fortified Palace in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. It is organised around three courtyards 60 m square. The first foremen on the site were Ramon Pau and especially Pons Descoyl, very active in [[Perpignan]] and the [[Balearic Islands|Baleares]].

It has two chapels, one above the other: the lower is the ''Queen's Chapel'', while the upper is ''Holy Cross'' with a pink marble door.

Here we have together in the “Great Hall“, the seat of political power, the chapel and the royal residence. The position of the chapel in the heart the royal apartments, opposite the throne room, indicates the importance of the spiritual over the temporal. The plan of the palace was inspired by those of [[Majorca]], and the chapel is like that of the earlier [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]].

The walls, built with uncut stones and bricks bound with mortar, were coated with lime and painted.

Doors, corridors, stairs, armatures and the main towers are all made of cut stone: [[ochre]] stone from Les Fonts, Baixas Blue, Sandstone, Red Marble from [[Villefranche-de-Conflent]], White and Blue Marble from [[Ceret]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/monuments/palais_majorque/traduc_anglais.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127050315/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/monuments/palais_majorque/traduc_anglais.html |date=November 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
=== Guitares au Palais ===
The [[Guitares au Palais]], a free three-day guitar [[music festival]], is held in the last weekend of August in the Palace and the gardens.

The festival's art director is Pedro Soler and opens the stage to an eclectic stream of guitar enthusiasts with performances in traditional [[acoustic guitar]], [[flamenco]], [[classical music]], [[gypsy style|gypsy music]], [[pop music]] and [[jazz]].

International guests includes the [[Rosenberg Trio]], Tekamali and [[Paco Ibáñez]] in 2004, [[Montserrat Figueras]], Rolf Lislevand and [[Manolo Sanlucar]] in 2005, [[The National (band)|The National]] and Sergio Lopez in 2006, [[Caetano Veloso]] in 2007, and the Rumberos Catalans, Bernardo Sandoval, [[Peter Finger]] and [[Aaron and Bryce Dessner]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg66.fr/bienvenue/ete66/guitares_palais.html]   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707030214/http://www.cg66.fr/bienvenue/ete66/guitares_palais.html |date=July 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schweizer Chronik Etterlin.jpg|thumb|Chronicle's title page]]
'''Petermann Etterlin''' was born in [[Lucerne]] as the son of [[Egloff Etterlin]], who served as chronicler of the city of Lucerne from 1427 to 1453.&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his parents had destined him for an ecclesiastical career, Etterlin never became a [[clergyman]].&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1464, Etterlin was appointed copyist of the city of Lucerne.&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Etterlin’s military career began in 1468 when he joined the army of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] at the siege of [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]].&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt; During a temporary exile from the city of Lucerne, Etterlin furthermore participated in the battles of [[Battle of Grandson|Grandson]], [[Murten]] as well as [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] during the [[Burgundian Wars]] (Müller 397). In 1477, he was moreover involved in a campaign against [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]].&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to his hometown in 1477, Etterlin was appointed the post of chancellor of the city of Lucerne.&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1495, after his promotion to the position of chronicler of the city of Lucerne, Etterlin joined the leading French-minded party.&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1493 to 1501, Etterlin is reported to have made several journeys to [[France]].&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his life, Etterlin embarked upon writing his ''[[Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation]]'' (German: ''Kronika von der loblichen Eydtgenossenschaft'').&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Müller, Petermann Etterlin died in Lucerne in 1509, only two years after the completion of his monumental work.&lt;ref name="müller_397"&gt;Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;397.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Falle''' (1656–1742) was a clergyman and historian of [[Jersey]].

==Life==
Falle was born in the parish of [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|St. Saviour]] in Jersey. He was the eldest of four brothers, two of whom were killed in battle, and one, as a reward for service in the navy, was appointed first lieutenant of [[Hampton Court]]. Sent to England at a very early age, he was educated, first at a school kept by a [[People of Transylvania|Transylvanian]] in [[Great Queen Street, London]], and afterwards by one Mr. Dalgarno at Oxford. In the winter of 1669 he was entered at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where his tutor was [[Narcissus Marsh]]; and on Marsh becoming principal of [[Alban Hall]], Falle migrated, and graduated there M.A. in 1676.

He was ordained [[deacon]] by [[Ralph Brideoake]], bishop of Chichester, in the following year, and priest in 1679 by [[Guy Carleton (bishop)|Guy Carleton]], who had succeeded to the see. In 1681 he was presented by [[Sir John Lanier]], then [[governor of Jersey]], to the living of [[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]] parish in that island. The stipend was £40 per annum; but Falle had inherited a small estate by the death of his father. He also undertook the care of the garrison, which was then without a chaplain.

In 1687 [[Thomas Jermyn, 2nd Baron Jermyn]], who had succeeded Lanier as governor, took Falle back to England as tutor to his only son; and in that occupation he remained through the [[Glorious Revolution]], living for the most part at [[Rushbrooke, Suffolk|Rushbrooke]], Lord Jermyn's country seat, near [[Bury St. Edmunds]]. In 1689 he returned to Jersey, and was translated to the charge of his native parish of St. Saviour. Meantime the [[battle of La Hogue]] had been fought, and the French navy became dispersed, but formidable in maritime depredations. The [[States of Jersey]], of which Falle, as Rector of Saint Saviour, was a member, made an appeal to [[William III of England|William III]] for protection. Taking with him Mr. Durell, the advocate-general of the island, Falle went (6 February 1693) to wait upon his majesty at [[Kensington]]. Aided by Jermyn, and favourably received by [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]], the delegates pointed out the French danger.

In January 1700 Falle became a prebendary of [[Durham Cathedral]]. In 1709 he resigned his Jersey rectorship, having been collated to the benefice of [[Shenley]], near [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]]. Falle died at Shenley, 7 May 1742, having never married.

==Legacy==
In 1736 he presented to his fellow-islanders his collection of books. With another donation by Canon Dumaresq (died 1805), this benefaction developed into a large library, for which the States provided a building in [[Saint Helier]].

==Works==
Falle, as part of his advocacy for the defence of Jersey, wrote the first ''Account of Jersey'' (1694);&lt;ref&gt;''Account of the Isle of Jersey, the greatest of those Islands that are now the only remainder of the English Dominions in France, with a new and accurate map of that Island'', 1694.&lt;/ref&gt; in that year he was appointed royal chaplain, and preached a sermon on [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]]'s death (20 December 1694). Around the same time Falle edited a history of the campaign of the [[battle of Landen]] in the [[Nine Years' War]], by his friend and colleague the [[Edward D'Auvergne]], rector of [[Saint Brélade|St. Brelade]]. His main work is based on materials  from his friend [[Jean Poingdestre]]; but Falle was a poor historian.

In 1722 he contributed an account of the [[Channel Islands]] to [[Edmund Gibson]]'s translation of [[William Camden|Camden]]'s ‘''Britannia'',’ and in 1734 brought out an expanded edition of his ''History of Jersey''. Falle also published a few sermons.

'''Philippe de Commines''' (or '''de Commynes''' or "Philippe de Comines"; [[Latin]]: ''Philippus Cominaeus''; 1447 &amp;ndash; 18 October 1511) was a writer and diplomat in the courts of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Commines, Philippe de|volume=6|page=774}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called "the first truly modern writer" ([[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]]) and "the first critical and philosophical historian since classical times" (''[[Oxford Companion to English Literature]]''). Neither a [[chronicle]]r nor a historian in the usual sense of the word, his analyses of the contemporary political scene are what made him virtually unique in his own time.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Coat of arms of Philippe de Commines.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of Philippe de Commines.]]
'''Commines''' was born at [[Renescure]] (in what was then the [[county of Flanders]]), to an outwardly wealthy family. His parents were Colard van den Clyte (or ''de La Clyte'') and Marguerite d'Armuyden.&lt;ref name = advent&gt;Bréhier, Louis. "Philippe de Commines." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 July 2008 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04163a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being ''[[lord of the manor|seigneur]]'' of Renescure, Watten and Saint-Venant, Clyte became [[bailiff]] of Flanders for the Duke of Burgundy in 1436, and had been taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Philippe took his surname from a ''seigneurie'' on the [[Lys River|Lys]] which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother, Jeanne de Waziers.&lt;ref name = advent/&gt; His paternal grandfather, also named Colard van den Clyte (d. 1404), had been governor first of [[Cassel, France|Cassel]] and then of [[Lille]]. However, the death of Commines' father in 1453 left him the orphaned owner of an estate saddled with enormous debts. In his teens he was taken into the care of [[Philip the Good of Burgundy|Philip the Good]] (1419–1467), Duke of Burgundy, who was his godfather. He fought at the [[Battle of Montlhéry]] in 1465 and the [[Battle of Brusthem]] in 1467 but in general seems to have kept a low profile.

===Burgundy===
In 1468, he became a knight in the household of [[Charles the Bold of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]], Philip's son who succeeded to the dukedom in 1467, and thereafter he moved in the most exalted circles, being party to many important decisions and present at history-making events. A key event in Commines's life seems to have been the meeting between Charles and [[Louis XI of France]] at [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]] in October 1468. Although Commines's own account skates over the details, it is apparent from other contemporary sources that Louis believed Commines had saved his life. This may explain Louis's later enthusiasm in wooing him away from the Burgundians.

In 1470 Commines was sent on an embassy to [[Calais]], then an English possession. It is unlikely that he ever visited England itself, what he knew of its politics and personalities coming mostly from meetings with exiles, both Yorkist and Lancastrian; these included [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] and [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick|Warwick the Kingmaker]]. He also met King [[Edward IV of England]] during the latter's continental exile and later wrote a description of his appearance and character.

Commines was a great favorite with Duke Charles for seven years (going back to when he had still been Count of [[Charolais (county)|Charolais]]). The 19th-century scholar [[Isaac D'Israeli]], recounts that one day, when they came home from hunting and were joking around as was their wont within the "family", Commines "ordered" the prince to remove Commines's boots as if he were a servant; laughing, the prince did so but then tossed the boot at Commines, and it bloodied his nose. Everyone in the Burgundian court started calling Commines "booted head". D'Israeli, in his 1824 ''Curiosities of Literature'', suggests that Commines's hatred for the duke of Burgundy poisoned everything he wrote about him, but comments:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When we are versed in the history of the times, we often discover that memoir-writers have some secret poison in their hearts. Many, like Comines, have had the boot dashed on their nose. Personal rancour wonderfully enlivens the style... Memoirs are often dictated by its fiercest spirit; and then histories are composed from memoirs. Where is TRUTH? Not always in histories and memoirs!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Service of Louis XI===
[[File:Philippe de Commynes Louvre LP 47.jpg|thumb|Commines at prayer]]
D'Israeli says Commines so resented his nickname that it was the reason he suddenly left Burgundy and went into the service of the French king, but the financial incentives offered by Louis provide a more than adequate explanation: Commines was still heavily burdened with his father's debts. He fled by night from [[Normandy]] on 7 August 1472, and joined Louis near [[Angers]]. On the following morning, when Duke Charles discovered his servant and god-brother missing, he confiscated all of Commines' property. These were later given to [[Philip I of Croÿ-Chimay]].

[[File:Philippe-de-Commynes-sieur-d'Argenton-et-al-Mémoires-de-messire-Philippe-de-Comines MG 1110.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philippe de Commines]]Louis was generous in making up for those losses. On 27 January 1473 the king wed him to a [[Poitou|Poitevin]] heiress, Hélène de Chambes (d.1532), ''[[lord of the manor|dame]]'' of the ''seigneuries'' of Argenton, Varennes, and Maison-Rouge.&lt;ref name = advent/&gt; When Hélène's sister, Colette de Chambes, was believed to have been poisoned by her aged husband [[Louis d'Amboise]], [[Viscount of Thouars]], in a fit of jealousy over her affair with [[Charles de Valois, Duke of Berry|Charles de Valois]], Louis XI's brother, the king had [[confiscation|confiscated]] most of his properties. Some of these he later gave to Commines for life, including the Princedom of Talmond in [[Poitou]], and the ''seigneuries'' of Berrie, Sables, and Olonne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Seigneurs d’Amboise| work = Racines et histoire| publisher = Etienne Pattou| date = 26 February 2008| url = http://racineshistoire.free.fr/LGN/PDF/Amboise.pdf| accessdate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite later reverses in the family's fortunes, on 13 August 1504 their only child, Jeanne de Commines (d.1513), made a splendid marriage to the heir of [[Brittany]]'s most powerful family, [[René de Brosse]] [[Count of Penthièvre|comte de Penthièvre]] (d.1524). Through her descendants, Commines would become the ancestor of [[Jean IV de Brosse|Jean, duc de Chevreuse]], of the [[Gouffier]] ''[[List of French peerages|ducs de Roannais]]'', and of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]],&lt;ref name="Jeanne de Commines"&gt;{{cite web| title = Jeanne de Commines| work = Genealogical database| publisher = Gene Web| url = http://geneweb.inria.fr/roglo?lang=en;i=263041| accessdate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jeanne herself became the mother-in-law of [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|Anne, duchesse d'Étampes]], ''[[maîtresse-en-titre]]'' to King [[Francis I of France]].

As a long-time enemy of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], Louis no doubt valued the inside information Commines was able to provide, and Commines quickly became one of the king's most trusted advisers. [[Jean Dufournet]]'s 1966 study of Commines has shown that the next five years, up to 1477, were the most prosperous from Commines's point of view, and the only ones when he truly had Louis's confidence. After Charles the Bold's death in 1477, the two men openly disagreed about how best to take political advantage of the situation. Commines himself admitted associating with some of the king's most prominent opponents and referred to another incident, in May 1478, when Louis reprimanded him for allegedly being open to bribery. Thereafter, much of his diplomatic work was done in the Italian arena, and he came into contact with [[Lorenzo de Medici]] on several occasions.

When Louis began to suffer ill-health, Commines was apparently welcomed back into the fold and performed personal services for the king. Many of his activities during the period seem to have involved a degree of secrecy; he was effectively acting as a kind of undercover agent. However, he never regained the level of intimacy with the king that he had previously enjoyed, and Louis's death in 1483, when Commines was still only in his thirties, left him without many friends at court. Nevertheless, he retained a place on the royal council until 1485. Then, having been implicated in the [[mad War|Orleanist rebellion]], he was taken prisoner and kept in confinement for over two years, from January 1487 until March 1489. For some of that period, he was kept in an iron cage.

===Mémoires===
After his release, Commines was exiled to his estate at [[Dreux]], where he began to write his ''Mémoires''. (This title was not used until an edition of 1552.) By 1490, however, he was recovering his position at court and was in the service of King [[Charles VIII of France]]. Charles never allowed him the privileged position he had held under Louis, and he was once again used as an envoy to the Italian states. However, his personal affairs were still problematic, and his right to some of the possessions given him by Louis was subject to legal challenges.

In 1498 (fifteen years after the death of [[Louis XI of France]]), Commines's work was completed (first published in [[1524 in literature|1524]] in Paris), and is considered a historical record of immense importance, largely because of its author's cynical and forthright attitude to the events and machinations he had witnessed. His writings reveal many of the less savory aspects of the reign of Louis XI, and Commines related them without apology, insisting that the late king's virtues outweighed his vices. He is regarded as a major primary source for 15th century European history.

The ''Mémoires'' are divided into "books", the first six of which were written between 1488 and 1494, and relate the course of events from the beginning of Commines' career (1464) up to the death of King Louis. The remaining two books were written between 1497 and 1501 (printed in [[1528 in literature|1528]]), and deal with the Italian wars, ending in the death of King [[Charles VIII of France]].

[[File:The deathbed of Philippes de Commines.jpg|thumb|The deathbed of Philippe de Commines.]]
Commines' scepticism is summed up in his own words: ''Car ceux qui gagnent en ont toujours l'honneur'' ("For the honours always go to the winners"). Some have disputed whether his candid phrases disguise a deeper dishonesty. Yet at no time does he attempt to present himself as a hero, even when recounting his military career. His attitude to politics is one of pragmatism, and his ideas are practical and progressive. His reflections on the events he has witnessed are profound by comparison with those of [[Jean Froissart|Froissart]], who lived a century earlier. His psychological insights into the behaviour of kings are ahead of their time, reminiscent in some ways of his contemporary, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. Like Machiavelli, Commines aims to instruct the reader in statecraft, though from a slightly different viewpoint. In particular, he notes how Louis repeatedly got the better of the English, not by military might, but by political machination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2517">'''Richard of Hexham''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1141) was an [[England|English]] [[chronicler]]. He became prior of [[Hexham]] about 1141, and died between 1155 and 1167.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Strickland, ‘Hexham, Richard of (d. 1155x67)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote ''Brevis Annotatio'', a short history of the church of Hexham from 674 to 1138, for which he borrowed from [[Bede]], [[Eddius]] and [[Symeon of Durham]]. This is published by [[James Raine]] in ''The Priory of Hexham, its Chroniclers, Endowments and Annals'' (Durham, 1864 to 1865). More important is his ''Historia de gestis regis Stephani ci de bello Standardii'', very valuable for the history of the north of [[England]] during the earlier part of the reign of [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], and especially for the [[Battle of the Standard]].

This history, which is a contemporary one, covers the period from the death of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in 1135 to early in 1139. It has been edited for the [[Rolls Series]] by [[Richard Howlett]] in the ''Chroniclers of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'', vol. iii. (1886); and has been translated by [[Joseph Stevenson]] in the ''Church Historians of England'', vol. iv. (1856).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5994">'''Rolf Hachmann''' (19 June 1917 – 5 June 2014) was a German [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] who specialized in [[prehistory|pre-]] and [[protohistory]]. 
== Life ==

Hachmann was born in [[Blankenese]], now part of [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. He attended school at the ''Reformrealgymnasium'' in [[Blankenese]], where he was instructed by Peter Zylmann, a Frisian prehistorian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewetel.net/~norbert.fiks/ostfriesland/seiten/plyt2.html |title=The Plytenberg at Leer |publisher=Ewetel.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030615125222/http://www.ewetel.net/~norbert.fiks/ostfriesland/seiten/plyt2.html |archivedate=2003-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated there in 1937, receiving his ''[[Abitur]]''. After work and military service and escape from imprisonment by English forces, in 1945 he began studies at the [[University of Hamburg]], majoring in [[prehistory|pre-]] and [[protohistory]] under [[Hans Jürgen Eggers]] with minor studies in [[classical antiquity]], German medieval studies, [[folkloristics]], [[ethnology]] and [[geography]]. After seven semesters in mid-1949 he received his doctoral degree with a thesis titled ''"Untersuchungen zur Eisenzeit in Mitteldeutschland" ("Investigations of the Iron Age in Central Germany")''. From 1952-1953, he received a travel stipend from the [[German Archaeological Institute]].

After [[habilitation]] in 1955, he was a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' for pre- and protohistory at the [[University of Hamburg]]. In 1959 he succeeded [[Vladimir Milojčić]] as professor of pre- and protohistory at [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], where he directed the institute from 1959 until 1985. At his initiative, the institute was renamed the Institute for Pre- and Protohistory and [[Near Eastern Archaeology]]. He became a professor emeritus in 1986 and continued his scholarly work until his death in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saarbruecker-zeitung.trauer.de/Traueranzeige/Rolf-Hachmann |title=Rolf Hachmann |publisher=Saarbruecker-zeitung.trauer.de |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

He took part in various excavations in Turkey ([[Boğazkale]]) and [[Syria]] ([[Tell Chuera]]), and began work on the [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] [[Kamid al lawz]] in [[Lebanon]] in 1963 together with [[Arnulf Kuschke]], professor for [[Old Testament|Old Testament studies]] at the [[University of Mainz]]. He directed this excavation from 1966 until 1981. In 1982, he initiated the excavations near the village of Drama in the [[Yambol Province]] of southeast [[Bulgaria]] together with [[Jan Lichardus]] and [[Alexander Fol]], heading the efforts until his retirement.

His research covers a broad spectrum in both periods and geography. He authored important works on topics which included the [[bronze age]] in central Europe and the archaeology and history of [[Germanic peoples]]. In 1962 together with [[Georg Kossack]] and [[Philology|philologist]] [[Hans Kuhn (philologist)|Hans Kuhn]] he published a study on the ''[[Nordwestblock]]'' ("Völker zwischen Germanen und Kelten") and in 1970 investigated the origins of the [[Goths]] and their presumed original homeland in [[Scandinavia]]. He continued his work after becoming an [[emeritus]] professor at the university. In 1991, he published his studies on the origin and creation of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The excavation results from [[Kamid al lawz]] were published in more than 20 volumes under his direction in the series ''Saarbrücker Beiträge zur Altertumskunde''. Those whose [[doctorate]]s he supervised include the former director of antiquities for the [[Saarland]], [[Alfons Kolling]], the mining archaeologist [[Gerd Weisgerber]] and [[François Bertemes]], professor of prehistoric archaeology at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]].

Hachmann is a regular member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and was also an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]] from 1993. On June 30, 2007, the University of the Saarland held a colloquium on the occasion of his 90th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeologie-online.de/magazin/nachrichten/view/festkolloquium-zum-90-geburtstag-von-professor-dr-rolf-hachmann/ Celebratory colloquium on Prof. Hachmann's 90th birthday]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world, without recourse to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Livingstone |first1=E.A. |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191727214 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198614425.001.0001/acref-9780198614425}}&lt;/ref&gt; In political terms, secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]] and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]] (the attainment of such is termed [[secularity]]). Under a brief definition, Secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion, leaving religious choice to the [[liberty]] of the people.  One manifestation of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;See also [[Separation of church and state]] and ''[[Laïcité]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another manifestation of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions, especially [[Politics|political]] ones, should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;"Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives". Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;See also [[Public reason]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as [[Zeno of Citium]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]; from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[John Locke]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Voltaire]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]]; and from more recent [[Freethought|freethinkers]] and [[Atheism|atheists]] such as [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Christopher Hitchens]]. It shifts the focus from religion to other ‘temporal’ and ‘this-worldly’ things with emphasis on nature, reason, science, and development.&lt;ref&gt;Yaniv Roznai citing Domenic Marbaniang in "Negotiating the Eternal: The Paradox of Entrenching Secularism in Constitutions," ''Michigan State Law Review'' 253, 2017, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Noah |authorlink=Noah Feldman |year=2005 |title=Divided by God |location=New York City |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page=25. |quote="Together, early protosecularists (Jefferson and Madison) and proto-evangelicals (Backus, Leland, and others) made common cause in the fight for nonestablishment [of religion]{{spaced ndash}}but for starkly different reasons."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European [[laicism]], it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward [[modernization]], and away from traditional religious values (also known as [[secularization]]). This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official [[state church]] or other state support of religion. In the [[United States]], some argue that [[#State secularism|state secularism]] has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz, Hakan M. and John L. Esposio (2003) ‘’Turkish Islam and the Secular State: The Gulen Movement’’. Syracuse University, pp. xv–xvii. {{ISBN|0-8156-3040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Noah |authorlink=Noah Feldman |year=2005 |title=Divided by God |location=New York City |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page=147 |quote=But with the Second World War just ahead, secularism of the antireligious type was soon to disappear from mainstream American society, to be replaced by a new complex of ideas that focused on secularizing the state, not on secularizing society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Meiji era]] Japan maintained that it was secular and allowed [[freedom of religion]] despite enforcing [[State Shinto]] and continuing to prohibit certain "superstitions;" scholar of religion Jason Ānanda Josephson has labelled this conception of the secular "the Shinto Secular" and noted that it follows a pattern established in certain European constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jason Ānanda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=132-139, 186-91|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italians|Italian]] law professor [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552–1608) first split secularism from [[canon law]] and [[Roman Catholic theology]].]]
The term "secularism" was first used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[George Jacob Holyoake]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="Holyoake" /&gt; Holyoake invented the term secularism to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing or criticizing religious belief. An [[agnostic]] himself, Holyoake argued that "Secularism is not an argument against Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others. Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Holyoake | first=G.J. | title=The Reasoner | publisher=Holyoake. | issue=v. 30 | year=1872 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cA7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 | access-date=2017-10-04 | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Kosmin]] of the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture]] breaks modern secularism into two types: hard and soft secularism.  According to Kosmin, "the hard secularist considers religious propositions to be [[epistemological]]ly illegitimate, warranted by neither reason nor experience."  However, in the view of soft secularism, "the attainment of absolute truth was impossible and therefore skepticism and tolerance should be the principle and overriding values in the discussion of science and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/9614BC42-9E4C-42BF-A7F4-0B5EE1009462/0/Kosmin_paper.pdf |title=Kosmin, Barry A.

==History==
The departure from reliance on religious faith to reason and science marks the beginning of the secularization of education and society in history. Among the earliest documentations of a secular form of thought is seen in the [[Charvaka]] system of philosophy, which held [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, and sought to reject the prevailing religious practices of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar|date=2018-08-21|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Domenic Marbaniang, Secularism emerged in the West with the establishment of reason over religious faith as human reason was gradually liberated from unquestioned subjection to the dominion of religion and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Budiselić, "Christian Witness for the 21st Century: Contemporary, yet Orthodox and Radical," ''Bogoslovni vestnik,'' 74 University of Ljlubljana, (2014) 3, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Secularism first appeared in the West in the classical philosophy and politics of ancient Greece, disappeared for a time after the fall of Greece, but resurfaced after a millennium and half in the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]]. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An increasing confidence in human capabilities, reason, and progress, that emerged during the Italian Renaissance, together with an increasing distrust in organized and state supported religion during the Reformation, was responsible for the ushering of modernity during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which brought all facets of human life including religion under the purview of reason and thus became responsible for the freeing of education, society, and state from the domination of religion; in other words, the development of modern secularism.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, ''Secularism in India: A Historical Analysis'' SI: Domenic Marbaniang, 2011, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Harvey Cox explains that the Enlightenment hailed Nature as the "deep reality" that transcended the corrupted man-made institutions of men. Consequently, the rights of man were not considered as God-given but as the de facto benefits of Nature as revealed by Reason.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, ''The Secular City: Secularization and Urbanization in Theological Perspective'' (Princeton University Press, 2013), p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government (often termed the [[separation of church and state]]).  This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a [[state religion]], replacing laws based on scripture (such as [[Halakha]], [[Dominionism]], and [[Sharia]] law) with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion.  This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). p. 14. "[Legal secularists] claim that separating religion from the public, governmental sphere is necessary to ensure the full inclusion of all citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''On Temporal Authority (1523),'' [[Martin Luther]] argued for the division of the church and the state. He specified two distinct powers: ''weltliches Regiment'' (German word for ‘the kingdom of the world,’ ‘the State’) and ''geistliches Regiment'' (German word for ‘the kingdom of God,’ ‘the Church’) and argued that citizens need only subject to the ruler's edict as long as the edict conformed to God's divine will as revealed in the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Kingdom in Secular Politics" in ''Basileia: A Theological Journal'', Itarsi: Central India Theological Seminary, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars, such as [[Jacques Berlinerblau]] of the Program for Jewish Civilization at the [[School of Foreign Service|Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]], have argued that the separation of church and state is but one possible strategy to be deployed by secular governments. What all secular governments, from the democratic to the authoritarian, share is a concern about the relationship between the church and the state. Each secular government may find its own unique policy prescriptions for dealing with that concern (separation being one of those possible policies; French models, in which the state carefully monitors and regulates the church, being another).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Berlinerblau|Berlinerblau, Jacques]], "How to be Secular," Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major impact on the idea of state religious liberty came from the writings of [[John Locke]] who, in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]] argued in favor of religious toleration. He argued that government must treat all citizens and all religions equally and that it can restrict actions but not the religious intent behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Elissa B. Alzate, ''Religious Liberty in a Lockean Society'', Palgrave Studies in Religion, Politics, and Policy, 2017, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] of the [[Sikh empire]] of the first half of the 19th century successfully established a [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. This secular rule respected members of all races and religions and it allowed them to participate without discrimination in Ranjeet Singh's [[Durbar (court)|darbar]] and he had Sikh, Muslim and Hindu representatives heading the darbar.&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Duggal, ''Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign'', Abhinav Publications (1989) {{ISBN|81-7017-244-6}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh also extensively funded education, religion, and arts of various different religions and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheikh|first=Majid|title=Destruction of schools as Leitner saw them|url=http://dawn.com/2010/10/31/destruction-of-schools-as-leitner-saw-them/|work=Dawn|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism is most often associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe and it plays a major role in [[Western culture|Western society]]. The principles, but not necessarily the practices, of [[separation of church and state in the United States]] and ''[[Laïcité]]'' in [[France]] draw heavily on secularism. Secular states also existed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Islam and secularism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). "The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman Noah (2005). pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[embryonic stem cell]] research, [[same-sex marriage]], and [[sex education]] are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the [[Center for Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 15, 2006 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/14/AR2006111401176.html "Think Tank Will Promote Thinking" ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |title=Declaration in Defense of Science and Secularism |publisher=Cfidc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073312/http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |archive-date=2009-01-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] and scholars (notably in the United States) oppose secularism, often claiming that there is a "radical secularist" ideology being adopted in our current day and they see secularism as a threat to "Christian rights"&lt;ref name="christianpost-jerrys-kids"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a sign that ‘hard secularism’ is taking over from ‘soft secularism’ towards becoming the predominant ideological mindset. According to the terminologi of Barry Kosmin, described earlier in this article.

The most significant forces of religious fundamentalism in the contemporary world are [[Christian fundamentalism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]].  At the same time, one significant stream of secularism has come from religious minorities who see governmental and political secularism as integral to the preservation of equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the well known states that are often considered "[[constitution]]ally secular" are the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mount|first=Steve|title="The Constitution of the United States," Amendment 1 - Freedom of Religion, Press|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am1|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/preamble.htm |title=Preamble of the Constitution of India |publisher=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Mexico#Article 3|See article 3 of the 1917 Mexican constitution]], and [[Constitution of Mexico#Article 24|Article 24]]. See also Schmitt (1962) and Blancarte (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]], and [[Turkey]] although none of these nations have identical forms of governance with respect to religion.

Countries with state religion in northern Europe have a high degree of political secularism with systems build upon Protestant and democratic ideology. For example, the monarchy of Denmark have a constitutional right for the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and it is illegal to discriminate individually upon religion, ethnic origins etc.

One of the most wellknown countries with a religious political system is the Islamic republic of Iran.

== Secular society ==
In studies of religion, modern [[democracy|democracies]] are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete [[freedom of religion]] (beliefs on religion generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions.  Nevertheless, it has been claimed that surveys done by [[Pew Research Center]] show Americans as generally being more comfortable with religion playing a major role in public life, while in Europe the impact of the church on public life is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2005/04/21/secular-europe-and-religious-america-implications-for-transatlantic-relations/ |title=Secular Europe and Religious America: Implications for Transatlantic Relations |last= |first= |date= |website= Pew Research Center|publisher= |access-date= 4 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[sociology]] has, since [[Max Weber]], often been preoccupied with the problem of [[authority]] in secularized societies and with [[secularization]] as a sociological or historical process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', Max Weber, London, Routledge Classics, 2001, pp. 123–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth-century scholars, whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters, include [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Hans Blumenberg]], [[Meyer Howard Abrams|M. H. Abrams]], [[Peter L. Berger]], [[Paul Bénichou]] and [[D. L. Munby]], among others.

Some societies become increasingly secular as the result of social processes, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement; this process is known as [[secularization]].

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] maintained that the modern world can no longer be described as being secular or becoming increasingly secular, instead it can best be described as being pluralistic.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger and Ross Douthat, "Why Hasn't Religion Died Out?", 2015. The Veritas Forum, http://www.veritas.org/why-hasnt-religion-died-out/ Accessed on June 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secular ethics ==
{{main|Secular ethics|Secular religion}}

[[George Holyoake]]'s 1896 publication ''English Secularism'' describes secularism as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Secularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good.&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, G.J. (1896). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DCg0dcD2bBAC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=%22Secularism+is+a+code+of+duty+pertaining+to+this+life,+founded+on+considerations+purely+human,+and+intended+mainly+for+those+who+find+theology+indefinite+or+inadequate,+unreliable+or+unbelievable.+Its+essential+principles+are+three:%22 37].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holyoake held that secularism and [[secular ethics]] should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong [[freethought]] and atheism. In this he disagreed with [[Charles Bradlaugh]], and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was.

Contemporary ethical debate in the West is often described as "secular." The work of well known moral philosophers such as [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Peter Singer]], and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, have been described as explicitly secular or non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Clarendon Press |isbn = 0-19-824615-3 |publication-place = Oxford [Oxfordshire] |title = Reasons and persons |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3172889M/Reasons_and_persons |author = Derek Parfit |publication-date = 1984 |id = 0198246153 |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==American interpretation of secularism==
It has been argued that the concept of secularism has frequently been misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=uooavbjacq&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacques-berlinerblau/secularism-is-not-atheism_b_1699588.html|author=Jacques Berlinerblau|title=Secularism Is Not Atheism|journal=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2012-07-28 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2012 ''[[Huffington Post]]'' article titled ''Secularism Is Not Atheism'', Jacques Berlinerblau, Director of the Program for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University, wrote that "Secularism must be the most misunderstood and mangled ism in the American political lexicon. Commentators on the right and the left routinely equate it with Stalinism, Nazism and Socialism, among other dreaded isms. In the United States, of late, another false equation has emerged. That would be the groundless association of secularism with atheism. The religious right has profitably promulgated this misconception at least since the 1970s."&lt;ref name=uooavbjacq /&gt;

== Secularism in late 20th century political philosophy ==
It can be seen by many of the organizations (NGO's) for secularism that they prefer to define ''secularism'' as the common ground for all [[life stance]] groups, religious or atheistic, to thrive in a society that honors freedom of speech and conscience. An example of that is the [[National Secular Society]] in the UK.  This is a common understanding of what secularism stands for among many of its activists throughout the world. However, many scholars of Christianity and conservative politicians seem to interpret secularism more often than not, as an antithesis of religion and an attempt to push religion out of society and replace it with [[atheism]] or a void of values, [[nihilism]]. This dual aspect (as noted above in "Secular ethics") has created difficulties in political discourse on the subject. It seems that most political theorists in philosophy following the landmark work of [[John Rawls|John Rawl]]´s ''Theory of Justice'' in 1971 and its following book, ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948824118|title=Political Liberalism : Expanded Edition|last=Inc.|first=Recorded Books,|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231527538|location=|pages=457|oclc=948824118}}&lt;/ref&gt; would rather use the conjoined concept ''overlapping consensus'' rather than secularism. In the latter Rawls holds the idea of an overlapping consensus as one of three main ideas of [[Classical liberalism|political liberalism]]. He argues that the term ''secularism'' cannot apply; &lt;blockquote&gt;But what is a secular argument? Some think of any argument that is reflective and critical, publicly intelligible and rational, as a secular argument; [...], Nevertheless, a central feature of political liberalism is that it views all such arguments the same way it views religious ones, and therefore these secular philosophical doctrines do not provide public reasons. Secular concepts and reasoning of this kind belong to [[Metaphysics|first philosophy]] and [[Ethics|moral doctrine]], and fall outside the domain of the political.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Still, Rawl´s theory is akin to Holyoake´s vision of a tolerant democracy that treats all [[life stance]] groups alike. Rawl´s idea it that it is in everybody´s own interest to endorse "a reasonable constitutional democracy" with "principles of toleration". His work has been highly influential on scholars in political philosophy and his term, ''overlapping consensus'', seems to have for many parts replaced ''secularism'' among them. In textbooks on modern political philosophy, like Colin Farelly´s, ''An Introduction to Contemporary Political Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/290530058|title=Contemporary political theory : a reader|last=Patrick.|first=Farrelly, Colin|date=2004-01-01|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761949084|oclc=290530058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Will Kymlicka´s, ''Contemporary Political Philosophy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611694157|title=Contemporary political philosophy : an introduction|last=Will.|first=Kymlicka,|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198782742|oclc=611694157}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term secularism is not even indexed and in the former it can be seen only in one footnote. However, there is no shortage of discussion and coverage of the topic it involves. It is just called ''overlapping consensus, [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]'', ''[[multiculturalism]]'' or expressed in some other way. In The ''Oxford Handbook of Political Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/474737332|title=The Oxford handbook of political theory|last=1953-|first=Dryzek, John S.,|last2=Bonnie.|first2=Honig,|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199270033|location=|pages=636|oclc=474737332}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is one chapter called "Political secularism", by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. It covers secularism in a global context and starts with this sentence: "Secularism is a beleaguered doctrine."

== Organizations ==
{{main|List of secularist organizations}}

Groups such as the [[National Secular Society]] (United Kingdom) and [[Americans United]] campaign for secularism are often supported by [[Humanism|Humanists]]. In 2005, the National Secular Society held the inaugural "Secularist of the Year" awards ceremony. The award's first winner was [[Maryam Namazie]], of the [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran]] and the [[Central Council of Ex-Muslims#Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain|Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Secular Society]] is active in Scotland and is currently focused on the role of religion in education. In 2013 it raised a petition at the [[Scottish Parliament]] to have the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1980]]  changed so that parents will have to make a positive choice to opt into [[Religious Observance]].

Another secularist organization is the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. The Secular Coalition for America lobbies and advocates for separation of church and state as well as the acceptance and inclusion of Secular Americans in American life and public policy.  While Secular Coalition for America is linked to many secular humanistic organizations and many [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] support it, as with the Secular Society, some non-humanists support it.

Local organizations work to raise the profile of secularism in their communities and tend to include secularists, freethinkers, atheists, agnostics, and humanists under their organizational umbrella.

Student organizations, such as the [[Toronto Secular Alliance]], try to popularize nontheism and secularism on campus.  The [[Secular Student Alliance]] is an educational nonprofit that organizes and aids such high school and college secular student groups.

In Turkey, the most prominent and active secularist organization is [[Atatürkist Thought Association]] (ADD), which is credited for organizing the [[Republic Protests]] – demonstrations in the four largest cities in Turkey in 2007, where over 2 million people, mostly women, defended their concern in and support of secularist principles introduced by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].

[[Leicester Secular Society]] founded in 1851 is the world's oldest secular society.

'''''The Arms Bazaar: From Lebanon to Lockheed''''' is an investigation and anatomical study of the international [[arms industry|arms trade]] by [[Anthony Sampson]] (1926 – 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Arms-Bazaar-Lebanon-Lockheed/dp/0670132632|title=
The Arms Bazaar: From Lebanon to Lockheed, by Anthony Sampson |publisher=[[amazon.com]]|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book was published in 1977. Sampson describes how the "defence industry" grew uncontrollably.

Sampson explains how the system produces a "growing frenzy to push weapons into the new markets". He mentions the role of governments and the development of the arms salesman. He describes the private manufacture of arms.&lt;ref name="Kaldor"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5goAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 | title=the arms bazaar | author=Kaldor, Mary | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=Apr 1978 | pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins by describing how the arms industry was changed by the industrial revolution and mass production, and the accomplishments of the Swedish born scientist [[Alfred Nobel]] and how he influenced the business through his invention of [[nitroglycerin]] and later on dynamite. While describing Nobel, the author also describes the Swedish defence contractors like [[Bofors]] which was owned by Nobel and [[Saab AB]].

The book largely discusses the beginning of U.S arms export during the [[Cold war]] under the auspices of the then [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] to reverse the deficit in the [[balance of payment]]. It shows how actually [[The Pentagon]] helped the American defense contractors to make weapons sales to the [[Nato]] allies in Europe instead of providing them with direct security.

It examines what went wrong to the sale of [[Lockheed Martin]] [[F-104 Starfighter]] to [[West Germany]] and Netherlands. The [[Luftwaffe]] lost more than 300 Starfighters during training and operation. The sales of [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] [[F-5 Tiger]] is also considered.

The book also explains how American companies used the connections of the [[Saudi]] arms dealer [[Adnan Khashoggi]] and used [[bribery]] to make a lucrative arms sales to the [[oil]] rich [[Saudi Arabia]]. Saudis during the time were booming with the oil money and were eager buyers of American weapons.

The book continues about [[CIA]], [[Kermit Roosevelt]], and arms sales to the [[Mohammad Reza Shah]].

| In response to Canada's passage the previous year of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] the previous year, a Commonwealth conference on nationality and citizenship is convened.

As a result, the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] is passed the next year by the British parliament which creates a distinction in that country between British citizens and British subjects; Australia and New Zealand also pass their own citizenship acts. Eventually, the category of British subject develops into that of a [[Commonwealth citizen]] whose rights are greater than those of a foreign national but often less than one of a full citizen of the country in question. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] had already passed citizenship legislation in 1935 defining its own citizenship laws.

It allows India (and, thenceafter, all other members) to remain in the Commonwealth as a republic, creates the position of [[Head of the Commonwealth]], and changes the name of the organisation to the ''Commonwealth of Nations''. The decisions of the 1947 Commonwealth ministerial conference on nationality and citizenship are affirmed which allow states to create their own citizenship rules. Indians are agreed to be recognised as [[Commonwealth citizen]]s, rather than [[British subject]]s, once that Dominion becomes a republic.

[[File:Alsaceregionsnaturelles.jpg|thumb|right|Topographical map of Alsace]]
This is a list of '''World War 1 Memorials and Cemeteries in Alsace.'''

The [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] ran across the Haute Alsace, across Le Bonhomme, passing Le Ligne, on near Munster, Reichackerkopf and Sondernach. It passed through the Petit Ballon and Grand Ballon before reaching Le Vieil Armand (Hartmannswillerkopf)  and passing a line through Thann and Cernay. It then ran its course to Altkirch and the Sundgau and the Swiss border.

==Background==

While Alsace comprises the "départements" of [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Haut-Rhin]] the front line just ran through the Haut-Rhin.

The fighting in this area in the 1914-1918 war can be divided into

* The Battles of Mulhouse and Dornach in August 1914.
*  Fighting right along the line to partly define and establish that front line and then to defend or attack it. As part of this process great battles were fought at Linge and Hartmannwillerkopf both involving a heavy loss of life.

==The Battles of Mulhouse and Dornach==
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| Description-The Battles of Mulhouse and Dornach
|-
|The Battle of Mulhouse (or Mülhausen) is also known as the Battle of Alsace. It began on 9 August 1914, and was the opening attack of the war. The offensive ended in failure, with a withdrawal on 10 August toward Belfort. The French were led by General Bonneau, whose "Army of Alsace" was made up of several units taken from the French 1st Army, namely the 7th Army Corps (14th and 41st infantry divisions reinforced by one brigade of the 57th reserve division from Belfort) and the 8th Cavalry division. On the German side the forces were part of Generaloberst Josias von Heeringen's 7th Army and comprised the XIVth and the XVth German Army Corps.

Building up to the Mulhouse battle, the French offensive had started on 7 August, with an attack in Haute-Alsace and the seizure of the border town of [[Altkirch]] and very soon Bonneau's troops had taken Mulhouse. The French success was short-lived however and the Germans retook the city on 10 August after reserves had been rushed down from Strasbourg. [[Joseph Joffre]], the French [[Commander-in-Chief]], had also despatched a reserve division to assist Bonneau but they had arrived too late to save Mulhouse from recapture. Bonneau withdrew towards [[Belfort]], the only fort incidentally to have held out during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], on 10 August in order to escape German encirclement.

Bonneau's withdrawal to Belfort angered Joffre and he Immediately relieved him of his command. Joffre added four more divisions to the so-called 'Army of Alsace' and now placed it under the command of General Pau.

All this was humiliating for the French but for a short time they had been euphoric and when they had entered Mulhouse, Joffre was moved to declare {{Quotation|''"CHILDREN of ALSACE!  After forty-four years of sorrowful waiting, French soldiers once more tread the soil of your noble country. They are the pioneers in the great work of revenge. For them what emotions it calls forth, and what pride!   To complete the work they have made the sacrifice of their lives. The French nation unanimously urges them on, and in the folds of their flag are inscribed the magic words, "Right and Liberty.". Long live Alsace. Long live France"''}}

The French were by no means finished with, despite the 10 August failure, and a counter-attack followed on 19 August in the wealthy Mulhouse suburb of Dornach which forced the Germans to retreat to  [[Ensisheim]], 20&amp;nbsp;km to the north. However, on 24 August the French again withdrew from Mulhouse and, in a short time, after an unsuccessful contribution to the fighting at Morhange-Sarrebourg. Pau’s army was dissolved and its troops deployed northwards to participate in the Battle of the Marne. Joffre sent Pau to join Bonneau in "retirement".

When the French finally left Mulhouse, the front line was beginning to take shape and now ran roughly on a line from [[Pfetterhouse]] - [[Altkirch]] - [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann]] - [[Hartmannswillerkopf]] - Munster  - Col du Linge- Col du Bonhomme. Only on 17 November 1918 were the French soldiers to march back into Mulhouse led by General [[Auguste Edouard Hirschauer|Hirschauer]].

==The course of the front line==

We are dealing with a front line that starts to the south of St Die des Vosges and runs right down to the Swiss border. We shall cover the German cemetery south of Saulcy-sur-Meurthe, La Croix aux Mines, the Col du Bonhomme and the town of La Bonhomme as well as the French National cemetery at Duchesne. Next we will identify memorials and cemeteries in the area to the north and south of Orbey and the valley of Orbey. This will cover the Linge area, the memorial of Linge and the battle fought there, as well as covering memorials or cemeteries at Lapoutrie, Labaroche and Hohrod. We shall then deal with Munster and the area south of Munster and then the Hohneck peak and the Petit Hohneck. .

|Although actually in Lorraine, this cemetery is included in this listing as many of the soldiers buried here were killed fighting in nearby Alsace. The cemetery was created in 1921 and brought in bodies originally and provisionally buried in graves in the Col du Bonhomme, the Col de la Schlucht, Gérardmer, Mandray, Le Valtin and la Croix-aux-Mines. The cemetery holds the remains of 2,565 French soldiers of whom 1,174 are buried in two ossuaries. It has been claimed that the body of the soldier buried in Paris in the tomb of the unknown soldier came from grave 1405 in the Saulcy-sur-Meurthe cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aufildesmotsetdelhistoire.unblog.fr/2009/02/03/le-soldat-inconnu-de-saulcy-sur-meurthe/ The French cemetery atSaulcy-sur-Meurthe] Aufildesmotsetdelhistoire.unblog.fr.

|This cemetery is also known as "Tête des Faux". It contains the remains of 292 French soldiers in individual graves and another 116 who rest in an ossuary. The bodies here were brought in from Stosswihr, Orbey, Soultzeren and the Col du Bonhomme.
The slopes of the ridge at Linge, with its passes and peaks such as the Col du Wettstein and the Schratzmännele saw continuous fighting from mid February to mid October 1915 and it would be fair to say that the actual front line was not clearly defined before this period and until it finished.

The memorial was inaugurated on 12 August 1939.

The village of Le Bonhomme itself suffered from artillery bombardments when the Germans were firing at the Tête-des-Faux. This is another area heavily fortified by the Germans and they constructed a tunnel on the Tête des Faux with a length of 1 kilometre, hewn from the rock of the mountain from the Corbeau Rock to the Mont Bonhomme peak. The village was occupied by French forces on 15 August 1914 and was later taken by the Germans.

===La Tête des Faux===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| Description La Tête des Faux
|-
|The Tête des Faux is where the first large battle of the Vosges took place between December 1914 and February 1915. At 1,219 metres in height, the Tête des Faux dominates the villages of Bonhomme, Lapoutroie and Orbey as well as the pass at Bonhomme (Col du Bonhomme). It was considered as strategically important by the French and was the scene of some bloody fighting and is said to be the area where the Chasseur Alpins (Battalion Chasseur a Pied) were given their nickname of the "Diables bleus".

From August 1914, the Germans had installed themselves on the summit of the Tête des Faux from where they were able to use their artillery to fire on the Bonhomme pass. On 2 December 1914, the 28th Chasseurs attacked the Tête des Faux and ousted the soldiers of the Bayerische Landwehr Infanterie Regiment and on 18 December 28 BCA were relieved by the 30th BCA. They were joined by the 229th French Infantry and part of the 51st Territorials. Other men from the 51st took up positions in the pass and two companies of the 30th were kept in reserve. The weather worsened from 21 December 1914 onwards with heavy snow. On 24 December 1914, the French positions came under artillery fire and in the subsequent fighting the Germans, while taking heavy losses, made some progress. The Germans launched a further attack on 21 February 1915. but finally there was stalemate and at the finish the French held the summit and the German dug in on one of the slopes and built formidable fortifications thereafter. The front line was to change little here until the end of the war.

At the top of the Tête des Faux there are the remains of a French look-out post and a small memorial which reads {{Quotation|"Ici sont tombés pour la France le 6 juillet 1916, le capitaine Demmler, le docteur Espagne, Jean-François Bouvier, Jean-Marie Renaud du 62e BCA". Probablement les victimes d'un obus tombé sur un abri situé à cet endroit"}}

In the pass that separates the two peaks of the Têtes des Faux is the cemetery at Duchesne and In this cemetery there is a monument with the inscriptions {{Quotation|"Mes frères d'armes pour la Patrie. Le 14e BCA - juin 1915"}} and {{Quotation|"Au commandant J. Duchesne, chef de bataillon 215e, mort pour la Patrie le 2 XII 14 à l'assaut de Grimaude"}} Duchesne had been killed in the December 1914 assault on the Têtes des Faux at Grimaude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieux-insolites.fr/cicatrice/14-18/tdf/tdf.htm Tête des Faux] www.lieux-insolites.fr.

The district of Orbey occupies the valley of the river Weiss and the area includes both Lake Blanc and Lake Noire. The area is dominated by the peaks of the Linge, the Gazon du Faing and the Tetes des Faux. Lake Blanc is the source of the Weiss river. Orbey is made up of several small villages and farms on the slopes of the mountains. There is a museum in the area, the Musée mémorial du Linge.

===The Battle of Le Linge===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| Description of the Battle of Le Linge
|-
|The Linge ridge is located in the Vosges in Alsace and with a height of 1,000 metres it separates the [[Orbey]] and [[Munster, Haut-Rhin|Munster]] valleys and the Germans had taken up positions along the ridge in 1914 when, being the aggressor, they were able to pick and choose where they wanted to place their guns and men and, as we have seen so often always went for the high ground. One objective here was to cut off French access to [[Colmar]]. From the beginning of 1915 the position of the front line in this whole area was ill-defined and the French, certainly influenced by the need to improve their positions and using their [[Chasseurs Alpins]] launched an attack with the ensuing battle lasting from 20 July to 15 October.&lt;br&gt; 
It was a bloody encounter with gas and flame throwers being used. Approximately 10,000 Frenchmen and 7,000 Germans were to be killed but after the fighting the front line positions were to remain much the same until the end of the war in November 1918. The Germans had made the first moves on 19 February 1915 when they attacked some of the smaller peaks on the Linge ridge including the Kleinkopf, the Barrenkopf, and the Schratzmännele but heavy snow storms meant that they could only reach the Barrenkopf and the Schratzmännele. In March 1915, the French launched their own offensive and fighting continued week by week and in July, after a heavy artillery bombardment the French Chasseurs à Pied, Chasseurs Alpins,and Infantry Regiments attacked the Barrenkopf, the Schratzmännele, and the Collet du Linge but without success.&lt;br&gt; 
Attacks and counterattacks continued and on 29 July the French took the Barrenkopf and the Schratzmännele but by the end of August the Germans retook these peaks but left the lower western slopes to the French. From August until October 1915 the attacks and counterattacks would go on without much gain for both parties.&lt;br&gt; 
Part of the battlefield area has been conserved and one can still see bunkers and fortified trenches. The terrain of the Linge was not ideal for fighting with numerous trees and bushes and rocky escarpments and the Germans had used their time on the ridge from late 1914 to build substantial defences including bunkers, blockhouses for their artillery and machine gun emplacements and to add barbed wire which was often difficult to see amongst the bushes and rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linge1915.com/biblio-an.html Battle of Linge] Official website. 22 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieux-insolites.fr/cicatrice/14-18/alinge/alinge.htm The Battle of Linge] www.lieux-insolites.fr.

|-
|The front line in early 1915 ran north of the Col de Wettstein. This peak has a height of 882 metres and on its lower slopes there is a French War cemetery known either as the "Cimetière des Chasseurs" or the "Cimetière du Col du Wettstein". This cemetery holds 2,201 individual graves with the remains of another 1.334 men lying in two ossuaries. Bodies here were brought in from Lingekopf, Barenkopf, Schratzmännele and the Valley de la Fecht as well as from Stosswihr, Soultzeren, Muhlbach, Hohrod, les Trois-Epis and Orbey. The main Linge Memorial is located in this cemetery and is dedicated to those who fought in the Battle of Linge.

The memorial is dominated by a large cross with the word "PAX" inscribed at the centre, the original wooden cross is set into the cross further down and the body of a chasseur lies at its foot. It also bears the inscription "AUX MORTS DU LINGE". Beneath the sculpture of the soldier is a plaque reading {{Quotation|""Les Diables Rouges du 15-2 aux Diables Bleus tombés en Alsace".}}  This then is a tribute from the "Red Devils" of the 152nd to the "Blue Devils".

[[File:Orbey 035.JPG|thumb|centre|500px|Depiction of a dead soldier at the foot of a giant cross in the French Military Cemetery at the Col de Wettstein.]]

The main memorial dedicated to this battle is to be found in this cemetery. It depicts a dead "Chasseur" who lies prostrate beneath a large cross. It seems that a young officer in the Chasseurs had made a wooden cross from some pine trees damaged by gunfire and this was replaced at a later stage by a cross carved from granite, It was inaugurated by General Gamelin in 1939.

The original wooden cross has been kept and is fixed to the monument with the inscription {{Quotation|"La croix de bois ci-dessus a été confectionnée avec les débris de la croix primitive érigée à cet emplacement par les combattants du Linge en avril 1915"}}

It also has a plaque which lists all the units of Chasseurs who fought at Linge. {{Quotation|"3e B.C.P. 5e B.C.P. 6e B.C.A. 7e B.C.A. 11e B.C.A. 12e B.C.A. 13e B.C.A. 14e B.C.A. 15e B.C.P. 22e B.C.A. 23e B.C.A. 24e B.C.A. 25e B.C.P. 26e B.C.P. 27e B.C.A. 28e B.C.A. 29e B.C.P. 30e B.C.A. 42e B.C.P. 45e B.C.P. 46e B.C.A. 47e B.C.A. 51e B.C.A. 52e B.C.A. 54e B.C.A. 62e B.C.A. 63e B.C.A. 64e B.C.A. 65e B.C.P. 67e B.C.A. 68e B.C.A. 70e B.C.A. 106e B.C.P. 107e B.C.P. 114e B.C.A. 115e B.C.A. 120e B.C.P. 121e B.C.P. 122e B.C.P. 4e B.C.T. 1ere Cie Skieurs du 28e B.C.A."}}

==The area around Munster==

Munster itself and all the villages in the Munster valley were subjected to artillery bombardments. One such was Metzeral and here in 1915 there was some fierce fighting in June 1915. General Pouydraguin of the 47th French Infantry joined with General Serret and his 66th French Infantry in an offensive.
On 9 June the population of Metzeral and Sondernach were evacuated and the French attack started on 15 June and on the 20th and 21st Metzeral was attacked with the fighting taking place in the village itself. Metzeral and the Fecht valley were now in ruins but the French offensive had failed. One month later the fighting would start at Linge.

After the end of 1915 fighting in the Vosges was less intense but the various cemeteries scattered around the area bear witness to the great loss of life. One such cemetery is known as the "Chêne Millet"  and holds the remains of 2,632 Frenchmen. It is located between Metzeral and Mittach..

==Route des Crêtes. Col du Bonhomme to the Hartmannswillerkopf==

[[File:Route des Cretes 1.jpg|thumb|centre|400px|Route des Crêtes]]

The [[Route des Crêtes]] or "Road of the Ridges" was a major construction in the region ordered by Joffre and finished in the summer of 1915. It ran from the Col du Bonhomme in the north to the Hartmannswillerkopf in the south and was built to facilitate the delivery of supplies to the French troops on the passes and mountains they held, as well, of course, as moving the soldiers themselves when it was necessary to bolster forces in any given area.

===The route itself===

From  [[Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines]] the Route des Crêtes runs down to the [[Col du Bonhomme]] on the route connecting [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges]] and [[Colmar]]. The route continues south via the Col de Louchbach to the Col de Calvaire where it enters the department of [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]]. The route then passes the Gazon du Faing from where there is a panoramic view stretching to the [[Black Forest]] across the [[Rhine]] valley in Germany and the [[Hohneck (Vosges)|Hohneck]], Petit Ballon and [[Grand Ballon]] summits in the [[Vosges mountains]]. From here the road then crosses the [[Col de la Schlucht]] a pass which connects [[Gérardmer]]  with Colmar. The road then passes the [[Hohneck (Vosges)|Hohneck]] mountain. After passing the [[Kastelberg]], [[Rainkopf]] and Rotherbachkopf peaks the road returns to the [[Haut-Rhin]] department before it crosses the Cols du Herrenberg and Hahnenbrunnen then reaching [[Le Markstein]]. The road now reaches its highest point at the [[Col du Grand Ballon]] before passing the Col Amic on the descent to [[Cernay, Haut-Rhin|Cernay]] and passing Hartmannswillerkopf.

|-
|At Soultz along the Route des Cretes and on the Grand Ballon are two memorials to the [[Chasseurs Alpins]], or, to be more precise, a monument in two parts. The original single monument was erected in 1927 but was dynamited by the Germans in July 1940 during the occupation of the 1939-1945 war. The first memorial comprises a small pedestal with a bronze depicting the typical oversized beret worn by the Chasseurs perched on the top. This beret was retrieved from the original monument. A plaque fixed to the monument tells us that the land was given to the Club Alpin Francais by the town of Soultz as a thank you to those who helped France secure the return of Alsace and Lorraine and a second plaque tells us that it is dedicated to the {{Quotation|"AUX DIABLES BLEUS"}}which was the nickname of the Chasseurs Alpin. A little further on there is a 1960s reconstruction of the 1927 memorial with a bronze by the sculptor Pierre Bouret. It depicts a Chasseur Alpin in winter outfit including of course the famous beret. A photograph of the 1960s replica is shown below.

While there was always trench to trench fighting in the area the actual battle of Hartmannswillerkopf started on 25 December 1914 when the 28th Battalion Chasseurs a Pied dug in on the summit and this led to German attacks on 4 January 1915. Attacks and counterattacks followed for twelve months until January 1916 and during this time territory changed hands frequently. After January 1916, the front line settled down and there was no major action until the war ended. The death toll from the Hartmannswillerkopf was high and it has been estimated that some thirty thousand Frenchmen were killed and, of course, a huge number of Germans.

In order to supply their troops on the Hartmannswillerkopf, the Germans built several camps on the Alsatian plain with many blockhouses and the area from Mulhouse to Hartmannswillerkopf is littered with the remains of German fortifications.

[[File:Memorial at Hartmannswillerkopf.JPG|thumb|centre|400px|Monument dedicated to the "Diables Rouges" ("Red Devils") as the 152nd Infantry Regiment were known]]

The National Monument of the Hartmannswillerkopf was inaugurated on 9 October 1932. It consists of a crypt carved out of the bedrock. The entrance is approached by a cutting from the road and is flanked by two bronze representations of victory by the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. Inside the crypt and covered by a large bronze shield is an ossuary which contains the remains of 12,000 unidentified soldiers. There are also Protestant and Jewish altars and a Catholic chapel. On the esplanade, which is situated above the crypt, is the Altar de la Patrie. This symbolises the raising of volunteers en masse for the defence of France and the Republic. It bears on its sides the names of the cities which contributed to the building of the memorial.

Behind this crypt is a French Military Cemetery which contains 1,640 soldiers of whom the remains of 384 are in six ossuaries. Near to this cemetery is the monument dedicated to the "Diables Rouges" ("Red Devils") as the 152nd Infantry Regiment were known. This bronze depicts five larger-than-life-size soldiers all in attacking mode. The sculpture is mounted on a sheer rock face so that the figures can appear to be looking out over the Alsace plain.

|Joncherey is where the first casualties of the war on the Western Front occurred in one of the border incidents that preceded the formal declarations of war. At the eastern edge of the village is a monument to Corporal Jules Peugeot who was killed at 10am on 2 August 1914, 30 hours before war was declared between France and Germany. He was the first French casualty of the war and died just in front of the house which stands across the road from the monument. His patrol from the 44th Infantry Regiment was surprised by and fired upon by a patrol of seven German cavalrymen. The first German casualty, a Lieutenant Mayer of Ilfurth, was killed in the same incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joncherey.fr/ Joncherey] Joncherey website. Retrieved 25 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

|Not far from Pfetterhouse on the Franco-Swiss border the Western Front ends and in the surrounding woods there are some vestiges of that Front Line with the odd crumbled pillar box. Below is a photograph of the Monument aux Mort in the village. After the miles of killing fields that had been passed along the line of the Western Front, through the Yser region, through Flanders, through Artois, through the Somme, through the Chemin des Dames, St Mihiel, The Argonne, and Lorraine, the word "PAX" did indeed seem appropriate. It was however sad to recall that the fighting and killing would start all over again in 1939!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfetterhouse.net/ Pfetterhouse] Pfetterhouse website.
