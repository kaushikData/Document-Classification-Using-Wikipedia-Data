In 1981, England suffered serious riots across many major cities. They were perceived as [[race riot]]s between communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/apr/13/fromthearchive|title=How smouldering tension erupted to set Brixton aflame|date=13 April 1981 | location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all cases the main motives for the riots were related to racial tension and [[inner city]] deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;Kettle, Martin &amp; Hodges, Lucy (1982) Uprising!: Police, the People and the Riots in Britain's Cities&lt;/ref&gt; The riots were caused by a distrust of the police and authority.  The four main riots that occurred were  the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riot]] in London, the [[1981 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]] in [[Birmingham]], the [[Chapeltown riots (1981)|Chapeltown]] riot in [[Leeds]] and the [[Toxteth riots]] in [[Liverpool]].

==Context==
=== Racial tensions===
In all four main cases, the areas had large ethnic minority communities, who had largely come from the [[Commonwealth]] in the 1950s and 1960s to do low paid manual jobs. All the areas suffered from poor housing (mostly dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries), high unemployment and particular problems with racial tensions. According to the [[Scarman report]] which was subsequently commissioned by the UK government, the riots were a spontaneous outburst of built-up resentment sparked by particular incidents. Lord Scarman stated that "complex political, social and economic factors" created a "disposition towards violent protest". The Scarman report highlighted problems of racial disadvantage and inner-city decline, warning that "urgent action" was needed to prevent racial disadvantage becoming an "endemic, ineradicable disease threatening the very survival of our society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3631579.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A THe Scarman Report | date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brixton]] ([[London]]), [[Toxteth]] ([[Liverpool]]) and [[Chapeltown, Leeds|Chapeltown]] ([[Leeds]]) were originally built as affluent areas of the city. However the relocation of industry, rising popularity of homes on new private housing estates since the 1930s, poor connections and the influx of migrant workers had led to a downfall in their fortunes and the large Victorian terraces and villas were often divided up into low rent [[bedsit|bed sits]], and many of those still existing as houses had been bought by landlords who let them to tenants.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government elected in 1979 had instituted new powers for the Police under the [[Vagrancy Act 1824|Vagrancy Act of 1824]] to stop and search people based on only a 'reasonable suspicion' that an offence had been committed &amp;mdash; hence their common name of "[[sus law]]s". These were applied disproportionately to the black community, and caused widespread resentment amongst young black men. The majority of these were not immigrants; they were the British-born children of immigrants, mostly born in the late 1950s or the first half of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4854556.stm | work=BBC News | title= The legacy of the Brixton riots | date= 5 April 2006 | accessdate=20 April 2013 | first=Cindi | last=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic circumstances===
The election of the Conservative government in 1979 had also seen the implementation of [[monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies which were designed to tackle inflation, which initially rose to 18% in the first few months of the Thatcher administration and was still above 10% by 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swanlowpark.co.uk/rpi0106.jsp | title=UK Inflation History by month: 1976 - 1995 |publisher=swanlowpark |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which had been at 13% by the end of [[James Callaghan|James Callaghan's]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government in May 1979. 

Although inflation was falling by 1981, unemployment was still rising and the recession was now in its second year, passing the 2.5 million mark in April 1981 having stood at 1.5 million two years earlier. Less than a decade earlier, unemployment had still been in six figures and it had stood at less than 400,000 as recently as the mid 1960s. The inner city areas affected by the 1981 riots were among those hit particularly hard by the recession and the unemployment and other social issues which came with it. 

This level of unemployment, not seen since the 1930s, had led to mass discontent in the working class areas of Britain most affected by the [[Early 1980s recession|recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2007/03/uk-economy-under-mrs-thatcher-1979-1984.html |title=Economics Essays: UK Economy under Mrs Thatcher 1979-1984 |publisher=Econ.economicshelp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Police powers===
The Asian community also felt isolated and vulnerable to racist attack. The Police were given new powers to question people about their immigration status. Resentment arose that these laws were applied, but the police were failing to protect the Asian community from violence. On 11 July 1981, the "Bradford 12" &amp;mdash; a group of Asian youths, members of the "United Black Youth League" &amp;mdash; were arrested for manufacturing [[petrol bombs]], allegedly to protect their community from a threatened attack. At the subsequent trial, they were acquitted by a jury, on the grounds of [[self defence]].

On 18 January 1981, thirteen Black youths died in the [[New Cross Fire]] in London. The police quickly dismissed a racial motive for the apparent arson attack;&lt;ref&gt;In the aftermath, an inquest held soon after the fire recorded an "open verdict"; and a second inquest in 2004 confirmed the conclusion. It was only with advances in forensic science in the intervening 23 years that it was finally determined that the fire was likely to have been an accident.&lt;/ref&gt; and the local Black community were dismayed by the indifference shown in the press towards the deaths. 15,000 people marched demanding action to Central London, in the largest Black issue demonstration seen in the UK.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

Racial tensions continued to rise in the early part of the year. On 28 March 1981, [[Enoch Powell]] &amp;mdash; by then an [[Ulster Unionist]] MP, but still an influence on the Conservative Party &amp;mdash; gave a speech in which he warned of the dangers of a "racial civil war" in Britain. By 6 April, it was announced that overall unemployment had risen from 1.5 million to 2.5 million in 12 months; and that joblessness among ethnic minorities had risen faster, up 82% in the same period.&lt;ref name=untold&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/U/untold/programs/riot/timeline.html "1981 riots timeline"], ''Untold History'' (Channel Four Television), accessed 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During March and April, the Metropolitan Police begin "Operation Swamp 81", a London-wide campaign against burglary and robbery. In Brixton, over only six days, 120 plain-clothes officers stopped 943 people, arresting 118 &amp;mdash; predominantly Black youths. The police justified their heavy-handed policing by statistics showing that while street robberies had increased 38% across London between 1976&amp;ndash;80; in Brixton it had risen 138%.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

The first disturbances began in Brixton over the weekend of 10-12 April 1981, and were followed in July by a series of similar disturbances in more than 35 cities and towns, especially Liverpool. In London, these included [[Dalston]], [[Stoke Newington]], [[Clapham]], [[Hounslow]] and [[Acton, London|Acton]]. Leech{{who|date=June 2018}} notes "Here these were not race riots - riots between races. Rather the conflict was with police as symbols of white authority, with state racism and criminalisation of black communities".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Leech]] ''Struggle in Babylon'' (Sheldon Press 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
These riots by the unemployed called the Government to attention that strategies for helping young people into work were not working. The [[Youth Training Scheme]] and suchlike were brought in.

The [[Association of Chief Police Officers]], who develop police policy in England,  produced their ''Public Order Manual'' in response to the riots.   This was subsequently used in training by police forces throughout Britain.

The UK government commissioned the [[Scarman report]] two days after the Brixton Riots. The terms of reference for the enquiry were "to inquire urgently into the serious disorder in Brixton on 10–12 April 1981 and to report, with the power to make recommendations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3631579.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A THe Scarman Report | date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarman was concerned with the "plight" of the ethnic communities in UK inner cities and their relationship with the rest of the national "community". He concluded that it was essential that "people are encouraged to secure a stake in, feel a pride in, and have a sense of responsibility for their own area". He called for a policy of "direct coordinated attack on racial disadvantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rich| first = Paul B.| title = race and empire in British politics| publisher = CUP Archive| year = 1990| location =| pages =212–213| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G144AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=scarman+report&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-38958-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As a consequence of the Scarman report a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the ''[[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]''; and the act also created an independent [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]], established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010 |url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/cy/index/about_ipcc/came_from.htm |title=IPCC - History |publisher=[[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |last= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609022635/http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/cy/index/about_ipcc/came_from.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sus law]] was repealed on 27 August 1981, when the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]] received Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/47/section/8 section 8], [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]], by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/47/section/11 section 11 (commencement)], one month after [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/47/introduction date of assent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triggers==
While there were common root causes, the triggers of the riots were different.

===Brixton===
{{Main|1981 Brixton riot}}

On the evening of 10 April, at around 17:15, a black youth was stabbed by three other black youths in an attack by a police patrol in Atlantic Road. As he was being helped, a large hostile crowd gathered. As the police tried to take him to a waiting car on [[Railton Road]], the crowd intervened. The police were attacked and the struggle only ended when more police officers arrived; the youth was taken to a hospital. The crowd is reported to have believed that the police stopped and questioned the stabbed youth, rather than help him. Rumours spread that the youth had been left to die by the police or that the police looked on as the stabbed youth was lying on the street. Over 200 youths reportedly turned on the police. In response the police decided to increase the number of police foot patrols in Railton Road, despite the tensions, and continue "Operation Swamp 81" throughout the night of Friday the 10th and into the following day, Saturday the 11th of April. During the disturbances, 299 police were injured, and at least 65 civilians. 61 private vehicles and 56 police vehicles were damaged or destroyed. 28 premises were burned and another 117 damaged and looted. 82 arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.met.police.uk/history/brixton_riots.htm ''Brixton Riots, 1981''] (MPS), accessed 6 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved in the riot.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] — [http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,,108184,00.html How smouldering tension erupted to set Brixton aflame], 13 April 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handsworth===
{{Main|1981 Handsworth riots}}
The first riot in Handsworth took place on 10 July 1981. The second larger riot took place between 9 and 11 September 1985. The riots were reportedly sparked by the arrest of a man near the Acapulco Cafe, Lozells and a police raid on the Villa Cross public house in the same area. Hundreds of people attacked police and property, looting and smashing, even setting off fire bombs.

===Chapeltown===
{{Main|1981 Chapeltown riots}}
The exact trigger for the riots is unclear, although much speculation took place in the local and national press. By 1981, Chapeltown was experiencing a high level of violent crime, tensions were high, particularly amongst the area's Caribbean majority.  The high crime brought about a police purge and the riots took place in July 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict-terrorism/leeds_2696.jsp |title=Leeds footsoldiers and London bombs |publisher=openDemocracy |date=2005-07-21 |accessdate=2010-08-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100824003855/http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict-terrorism/leeds_2696.jsp| archivedate= 24 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxteth===
{{Main|1981 Toxteth riots}}
The Merseyside police force had, at the time, a poor reputation within the black community for stopping and searching young black men in the area, under the "sus" laws, and the perceived heavy-handed arrest of Leroy Alphonse Cooper on Friday 3 July, watched by an angry crowd, led to a disturbance in which three policemen were injured.

===Moss Side===
{{Main|1981 Moss Side riot}}

===Other riots===
There was also rioting during 1981 in a number of other English cities and towns, although most of these riots were less serious and attracted less media attention than the highly publicised rioting in areas like Brixton and Toxteth.

Rioting also occurred in the [[Dingle]] and [[Cantril Farm]] districts of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;[https://liverpoolassignment.wordpress.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brixton was not the only part of London to be affected by rioting. Disturbances in the districts of [[Southall]] and [[Battersea]] resulted in fire stations being targeted by rioters and ultimately evacuated for the safety of staff. There was also rioting in [[Ellesmere Port]], [[Wolverhampton]], [[Sheffield]], [[Nottingham]] and parts of [[Tyneside]] and [[Humberside]]. Several of these areas were already known for racial tension and most of them had high levels of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/11/world/new-riots-sweep-england-s-cities-anarchy-feared.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ana Cofiño was born in a conservative and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] Guatemalan family. She studied at a Catholic school for "well-off" girls, at which time she participated in the movement called CRATER, made up of young people who were involved in social programs as part of the church's renewal movement.&lt;ref name=Albedrío/&gt; Years later, she explained that her break with the Catholic Church was fundamental and a process. According to Cofiño:
{{Quote|If you are educated as a Christian or a Catholic, the first thing you carry, especially women, is guilt. Just getting rid of it is a revolution. When I began to question the existence of God, I was afraid that I would suddenly be struck by lightning. These ruptures are usually painful; they are a tremendous intellectual effort. If you break away you must be very clear about things, or else you are only assuming a pose.&lt;ref name=Albedrío/&gt;}}

She began to study at the [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]], and later moved to [[Mexico]] to study at the [[National School of Anthropology and History]], where she made a critical study of the Guatemalan condition, of its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiLlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13 |title=Transforming Modernity: Popular Culture in Mexico |chapter=Acknowledgments |last=García Canclini |first=Néstor |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |isbn=9780292789074 |date=28 June 2010 |access-date=30 October 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came into contact with Guatemalan exiles, among them writers such as {{ill|Carlos Illescas|es}} and the feminist [[Alaíde Foppa]].&lt;ref name=Albedrío/&gt; When she finished her degree, she moved to [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], Chiapas, to prepare her thesis in the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] area, a trip which changed her life, she explains. She founded the bookstore Soluna there.&lt;ref name=Chirix&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://bibliotecadigital.aecid.es/bibliodig/pub_aecid/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1008234 |title=Emma Chirix conversa con Ana Cofiño |trans-title=Emma Chirix Talks With Ana Cofiño |last=Chirix |first=Emma |publisher=Colección Pensamiento |language=Spanish |date=October 2008 |access-date=30 October 2017 |via=AECID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 she returned to Guatemala with the expectation that the [[Vinicio Cerezo]] government, in which there were many women working, would represent a transformation for the country. She opened the Pensativo Bookstore in [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], where she began to publish works by Guatemalan and Central American authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.prensalibre.com/ciudades/sacatepequez/abren-boquete-para-robar-en-centro-cultural-de-antigua-guatemala |title=Hacen boquete para entrar a robar en centro cultural de Antigua Guatemala |trans-title=They Made a Hole To Enter and Rob the Cultural Center of Antigua Guatemala |last=Sicán |first=Julio |work=[[Prensa Libre]] |language=Spanish |date=14 June 2017 |access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cofiño graduated with an anthropology degree from the Universidad de San Carlos when she concluded research on the feelings of [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] women on the exhumation of [[San Juan Comalapa]].&lt;ref name=Chirix/&gt;

In 1998 she founded the monthly publication ''La Cuerda'', of which she was co-editor, backed by an association that aims to recover the prominence of women.

In 2012 she published, along with 17 other authors from ''La Cuerda'', the book ''Nosotras, las de la Historia. Mujeres en Guatemala (siglos XIX–XXI)'' (We, of History. Women in Guatemala (19th–20th Centuries), recounting the history of Guatemalan women from a women's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wradio.com.mx/radio/2012/03/14/audios/1331742420_654977.html |title=Ana Cofiño y Rosalinda Hernández Alarcón, autoras del libro 'Nosotras, las de la Historia.

'''Asa Briggs, Baron Briggs''' (7 May 1921 – 15 March 2016) was an English historian. He was a leading specialist on the [[Victorian era]], and the foremost historian of broadcasting in Britain. He was made a [[life peer]] in 1976.

==Early life==
Asa Briggs was born in [[Keighley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1921 to William Briggs, an engineer, and his wife Jane.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt; He was educated at [[Oakbank School, Keighley#Grammar school|Keighley Boys' Grammar School]] and [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], graduating with a BA (first class) in 1941, and a BSc in Economics (first class) from the [[University of London External Programme]], also in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bridges| first=Sophie| title=The Papers of Asa Briggs| url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FBRIG| publisher=Janus| accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
From 1942 to 1945 during the [[Second World War]], Briggs served in the Intelligence Corps and worked at the British wartime codebreaking station, [[Bletchley Park]]. He was a member of "the Watch" in [[Hut 6]], the section deciphering [[Enigma machine]] messages from the German Army and Luftwaffe.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, foreword to Gwen Watkins, ''Cracking the Luftwaffe Codes'', 2006, Greenhill Books, p. 12, {{ISBN|978-1-85367-687-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This posting had arisen because at college Briggs had played chess with Cambridge mathematician [[Howard Smith (diplomat)|Howard Smith]] (who was to become the [[Director general of MI5|Director General of MI5]] in 1979) and  Smith had written to the head of Hut 6, [[Gordon Welchman]], who was also a Cambridge mathematician, recommending Briggs to him.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt;

==Academic career==
After the war, he was elected a Fellow of [[Worcester College, Oxford]] (1945–55), and was subsequently appointed [[University of Oxford|University]] [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Recent Social and Economic History (1950–55). Whilst a young Fellow, Briggs proofread [[Winston Churchill]]'s ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]''.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones  |first= Nigel |title= Asa Briggs obituary |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/lord-briggs-of-lewes-asa-briggs-obituary| date= 15 March 2016 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=15 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later Faculty Fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] (1953–55) and a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], United States (1953–54).

From 1955 until 1961 he was Professor of [[Modern History]] at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] and between 1961 and 1976 he was Professor of History at [[University of Sussex|Sussex University]], while also serving as Dean of the School of Social Studies (1961–65), [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor|Pro Vice-Chancellor]] (1961–67) and Vice-Chancellor (1967–76). On 4 June 2008 the University of Sussex Arts A1 and A2 lecture theatres, designed by [[Basil Spence]], were renamed in his honour.

In 1976 he returned to Oxford to become [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]], retiring from the post in 1991.

He was [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[Open University]] (1978–94) and in May 1979 was awarded an honorary degree as Doctor of the University. He had been an Honorary Fellow of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], from 1968, of [[Worcester College, Oxford]], from 1969, and of [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], from 1977. He also held a visiting appointment at the Gannett Center for Media Studies at [[Columbia University]] in the late 1980s and again at the renamed Freedom Forum Media Studies Center at Columbia in 1995–96. Announced in the [[1976 Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=4 June 1976 |supp=y |issue=46919 |page=8015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Briggs''', of [[Lewes]] in the [[East Sussex|County of East Sussex]] on 19 July 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=46970 |date=23 July 1976 |page=10135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Between 1961 and 1995, Briggs wrote a five-volume text on the history of broadcasting in the UK from 1922 to 1974 — essentially, the history of the [[BBC]], who commissioned the work.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt; Briggs' other works ranged from an account of the period that [[Karl Marx]] spent in London to the [[corporate history]] of British retailer [[Marks and Spencer]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 March 2016"/&gt; In 1987, Lord Briggs was invited to be President of the [[Brontë Parsonage Museum#Brontë Society|Brontë Society]], a literary society established in 1893 in Haworth, near Keighley, Yorkshire. He presided over the Society's centenary celebrations in 1993 and continued as President until he retired from the position in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lemon| first=Charles| title=A Centenary History of The Brontë Society, 1893–1993| journal=Brontë Society Transactions| year=1993| volume=Supplement to Volume 20|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also President of the William Morris Society from 1978 to 1991 and President of the Victorian Society (UK) from 1986 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Crick, The History of the William Morris Society 1955–2005 (London, 2011); Paul Thompson, 'Asa Briggs 1921–2016', The Victorian: The Magazine of the Victorian Society, 52 (July, 2016), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at home in Lewes at the age of 94 on 15 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/index?id=34873 |title=Asa Briggs, Lord Briggs of Lewes, passes: 07 May 1921 Б─⌠ 15 March 2016 : News and events : University of Sussex |website=Sussex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European [[architectural sculpture]], an '''atlas''' (also known as an '''atlant''', or '''atlante'''&lt;ref&gt; Hersey, George,  The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture,  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,  1998 p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;  or '''atlantid'''; plural '''atlantes''')&lt;ref name="atlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html ''Aru-Az'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103828/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, Michael Delahunt, [http://www.artlex.com/ ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, 1996–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a [[column]], a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] or a [[pilaster]]. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon (plural '''''telamones''''' or telamons).&lt;ref name="atlex" /&gt;

The term ''atlantes'' is the Greek plural of the name [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]—the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, ''telamones'', also is derived from a later mythological hero, [[Telamon]], one of the [[Argonauts]], who was the father of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]]. 

The [[caryatid]] is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at [[Delphi]] and the [[Erechtheion]] on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an [[Ionic order|Ionic context]] and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed., ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York,  1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atalante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called [[Term (architecture)|terms]].  The body of many Atalantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term.  The pose and expression of Alalantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids.  The [[herma]] or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atalantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif.  Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect [[Vitruvius]], whose description of the structures,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', 6.7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in [[ancient Egypt]] out of [[monolith]]s. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in [[Magna Graecia]], southern Italy. The [[:Image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|earliest surviving atlantes]] are fallen ones from the Early Classical [[Greek temple]] of Zeus, the ''Olympeion'', in [[Agrigento]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdiva.blogspot.com/2008/05/vitruvius-caryatids-and-telamones.html Dorothy King, "Doric Figured Supports: Vitruvius’ Caryatids and Atlantes: 5.2 Atlantes and Telamones"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantes, however, have played a more significant role in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[baroque architecture]]. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many buildings were built with glorious atlantes that look much like the Greek ones. Their selection from the two proposed designs&amp;mdash;the other design using Caryatids&amp;mdash;for the entrance of the [[Hermitage Museum]] that was built for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] made atlantes become even more fashionable. The portico of this building has ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from [[Sortavala|Serdobol granite]], which were designed by [[Johann Halbig]] and executed by the sculptor, [[Alexander Terebenev]].

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] are typically called [[Atlantean figures]].  These figures are considered to be "massive statues of [[Toltec]] warriors".&lt;ref name="Evans-p42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Gustaf Grimberg''' (September 22, 1875 in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] – June 11, 1941 in [[Djursholm]]) was a Swedish historian.

His parents were Joel Grimberg and Charlotta (née Andersson). In 1919 he married Eva Carlsdotter Sparre (1895–1982).

Grimberg's most famous work is his history of Sweden, ''Svenska folkets underbara öden'' (1913-1924). In 1926 Grimberg began to publish his history of the world, ''Världshistoria'', but he did not finish it before his death.

'''Chaophraya Thiphakorawong''' (born '''Kham Bunnag'''; 1 October 1813&amp;ndash;1870) was a Thai aristocrat, government official, and scholar.

== Family ==
Kham Bunnag was born in 1813 into the powerful [[Bunnag family]], a powerful Thai noble family of [[Persian people|Persian]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="Bentiage"&gt;Bentiage, Bjorn, Eggert, Marion, Kramer, Hans-Martin, and Reichmuth, Stefan [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtY6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 "Religious Dynamics Under the Impacts of Imperialism and Colonialism: A Sourcebook"] pp.63-4&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Prayurawongse|Tish Bunnag]], was a kinsman of the royal family who later served as regent for King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV), while his brother [[Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse|Chuang Bunnag]] would go on to serve as regent for King [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V).

== Government service ==
Kham Bunnag entered the service of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III), as an official in the Harbour Department. After the death of Rama III, the Bunnag family played a major role in selecting his successor. Kham's strong support for Mongkut earned him a role as Minister of State in 1853, Minister of the Treasury in 1855, and the title of Thiphakorawong in 1865.&lt;ref name="Bentiage"/&gt;

== Scholarship ==
After ill health led to his retirement from public life in 1867, Thipakorawong spent the remainder of his life writing on history and religion.&lt;ref name="Bentiage"/&gt; In 1867, he wrote his most famous work, ''Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit'' ("A Book on Various Things").&lt;ref name="Nangsue"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtY6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 Bentiage] pp. 67-69&lt;/ref&gt; Thipakorawong was commissioned by Chulalongkorn to write the history of the first four reigns of the [[Chakri dynasty]], which he completed before his death in 1870. Though the history was complete by 1870, the section on the reign of Rama III was not published until 1934, due to a controversial section detailing a powerful prince's homosexual inclinations.&lt;ref name="Reyes"&gt;Reyes, Raquel A. G., Clarence-Smith, William G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uP57zh13BqQC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92 "Sexual Diversity in Asia, c. 600 - 1950"] pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; Thipakorawong's historical works were often edited, particularly by [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Prince Damrong]], to remove items that were considered scandalous or critical of the early monarchs.&lt;ref name="Reyes"/&gt;

== The Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit ==
Thipakorawong's Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit was a groundbreaking work, said to be both the first science textbook in Thai and the first Thai book to be printed without the assistance of Westerners.&lt;ref name="Nangsue"/&gt; In this work, Thipakorawong argued against the literal truth of much traditional [[Buddhist cosmology]] (said to be contaminated by [[Brahmanism]]), while also attesting to the truth of Buddhist spiritual doctrines and the compatibility of modern science with Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Winichakul"&gt;Winichakul, Thongchai [https://books.google.com/books?id=TJEK4sHPlUsC&amp;pg=PA40 "Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of a Nation"] pp. 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of the book detailing how [[karma]], [[reincarnation]], and [[merit (Buddhism)|merit]] account for differences in social orders. While not necessarily derived from Mongkut's reforming views, it was clearly complementary to them.&lt;ref name="Piker"&gt;Piker, Steven [https://books.google.com/books?id=_yAVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 "The Psychological Study of Theravada Societies"] pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit was translated into English by [[Henry Alabaster]], an advisor to Chulalongkorn. Alabaster published his translation as the first part of his "The Wheel of the Law" in 1871. While generally regarded as a faithful translation, Alabaster's version omits many sections of Thipakorawong's work, including a defense of polygamy, and also includes his own commentary.&lt;ref name="Nangsue"/&gt;

'''Christopher Robert Paul Gunness''' (born 1959) is the chief spokesperson for the [[UNRWA|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA).

==Early life==

Gunness was born in 1959 in what was then the [[Crown Colony]] of [[Trinidad]], part of the [[British West Indies]]. He was educated in England, initially at [[Ardingly College]], before gaining a scholarship in 1979, to [[Oxford University]]. He was a contemporary of [[Ian Hislop]] at both institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/london-evening-standard-west-end-final-b/20090127/281861524390249|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BBC==

He joined the [[BBC]] as a graduate trainee in 1982. During his 23-year career in broadcasting, he covered all the following roles: producer, studio manager, reporter, correspondent and anchor.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/2933337.st,&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNSCO==

In 2005, Gunness left the BBC to join the [[United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process]] (UNSCO), which was created following the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]]. He gained public profile as a member of a high level UN mission mandated by the UN to halt the Lebanon war in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2006/060721_Roed-Larsen.doc.htm PRESS CONFERENCE BY MIDDLE EAST MISSION | Meetings Coverage and Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNRWA==

In 2007, he was appointed Spokesman and Director of Strategic Communications at [[UNRWA]], a very high-profile spokesperson position within the [[United Nations]] system.

==2014 Gaza War==

In 2014, during the war between [[Israel]] and [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza Strip]], he was interviewed extensively.

===Meet the Press===

On July 27, 2014, Gunness was interviewed by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] on [[Meet the Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Full Meet the Press interview with UN relief official Chris Gunness|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/meet-the-press/55734533#55734533|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gregory played a video on the screen showing what appeared to be a rocket being fired from a school in Gaza. Only the viewers could see the video and not Gunness, who was appearing via satellite from [[Tel Aviv]]. Gregory asked “the Israeli government has released video tape within the last hour, it was posted on YouTube. NBC News has not independently verified the Israeli’s claim. I realize you cannot see this video, but our audience can. And I'm going to describe it to you, that purports to show rockets being fired from a UN school. Is this accurate?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-july-27-2014-n166016|title=Meet the Press Transcript - July 27, 2014 - NBC News|newspaper=NBC News|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunness, unable to see the video while being accused of complicity in the firing of rockets replied, “Look, to be fair to me, to bring me on a live program and expect me to comment live on air on pictures I haven't actually seen, I think anyone looking at this program would agree that that's really unfair. I mean, if I can see it, I'll happily comment on it. But can I make the point that we have said that all sides have to respect the inviolability of UN compounds. And that's both side. So if it is what you say it is, we would strongly condemn it. And we're a humanitarian organization. We're not an organization with an army. We have moral force. We have the force of international law. And we have the principles of humanitarianism to protect us. But that's it.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-july-27-2014-n166016 Meet the Press Transcript - July 27, 2014 - NBC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory then abruptly ended the interview, but towards the end of the program, he revisited the topic with a new statement in an attempt to reverse the perception of bias during the interview. He issued an “endnote to an earlier conversation about Gaza, we asked as you will recall, a UN spokesman about this video, which Israel claims, Israel claims showed rockets being fired by Hamas from a UN school in Gaza. This is shot by the Israeli government, and that's their claim. The UN has reviewed it, tells us that they have confirmed in their view the video does not show rockets being fired from a UN administrative school in Gaza.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Gregory was widely criticized for his interview tactics during the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2014/08/was-david-gregory-fired-for-being-pro-israel.php|title=Was David Gregory fired for being "pro-Israel"? {{!}} Power Line|website=www.powerlineblog.com|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://egbertowillies.com/2014/07/27/david-gregory-un-bombing-israeli-video/|title=David Gregory called out for journalistic blunder by his guest|date=2014-07-27|website=EgbertoWillies.com|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawstory.com/2014/07/un-official-busts-david-gregory-for-using-israeli-propaganda-video-thats-really-unfair/ UN official busts David Gregory for using Israeli propaganda video: ‘That’s really unfair’&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/nbcs-gregory-issues-correction-for-showing-unverified-israeli-video/ NBC’s Gregory Issues Correction for Showing Unverified Israeli Video | Mediaite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imediaethics.org/nbc-news-airs-unverified-gaza-video-un-spokesperson-hits-back/ NBC News David Gregory airs unverified video, gets called 'unfair'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/david-gregory-issues-end-note-to-clarify-unverified-video-from-gaza/234569 David Gregory Issues ‘End Note’ to Clarify Unverified Video From Gaza | TVNewser&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/28/david-gregory-correction-israel-gaza-un_n_5626405.html David Gregory Backtracks After Being Corrected On Gaza | HuffPost&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/2014/07/29/david_gregory_is_really_bad_at_his_job/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/sunday-morning-freak-show/ Why Firing David Gregory Won’t Change ‘Meet the Press’ | The Nation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Jazeera Interview===

On July 30, 2014, immediately following a live TV interview from his office in [[Jerusalem]] with [[al Jazeera]] discussing the killing of children who died from Israeli shelling while sleeping in the relative safety of a UN school in Gaza, Gunness broke down in tears.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFd8jVrbf0A UNRWA Christopher Gunness breaks down in tears on live TV after attack on UN school in Gaza - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The video of the UN spokesperson in tears immediately went viral and was written about extensively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/30/chris-gunness-breaks-down_n_5634920.html UN Official Chris Gunness Breaks Down On Air After School Bombing | HuffPost&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/gaza/11001631/UN-spokesman-breaks-down-talking-about-Gaza-child-deaths.html Video: UN spokesman breaks down talking about Gaza child deaths - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2711550/UN-official-breaks-air-bloody-horror-Gaza-conflict-obvious-emotional-toll.html UN's Christopher Gunness breaks down over Gaza conflict live on air | Daily Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bustle.com/articles/34078-video-of-un-official-chris-gunness-crying-on-air-discussing-gaza-school-bombing-will-break-your Video Of UN Official Chris Gunness Crying On Air Discussing Gaza School Bombing Will Break Your Heart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/news/daily-news/2014/07/un-spokesman-breaks-down-crying-on-tv-gaza U.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Christian Lupus''' (23 July 1612 – 10 July 1681) was a historian.

Lupus was born at [[Ypres]] ([[Flanders]]).  He joined the [[Augustinian Order]] at the age of fifteen, and on the completion of his studies, was appointed lecturer in theology, to the younger members of the order in [[Cologne]]. While occupying this position he won the confidence of the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne|nuncio at Cologne]], Fabio Chigi (later [[Pope Alexander VII]]). In 1640 Lupus was appointed professor of theology at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] (French: ''Louvain''), but, owing to his zeal for the teaching of [[St. Augustine]], was suspected of [[Jansenism]]. The nuncio at Brussels accused him of it, and would not permit the University of Leuven to confer a doctor's degree upon him; only after the pope's mediation was it given to him. When the accusation was renewed, Alexander VII called him to Rome, where for the next five years he devoted himself under papal protection to the study of ecclesiastical history.

He returned to Leuven in 1660, and was elected provincial of the province; in 1667 he returned to Rome, accompanied by several professors of the theological faculty of Leuven. [[Innocent XI]] condemned sixty-five of the propositions denounced by him. On his return to Leuven he was appointed [[Regius Professor]] of theology, the first time a religious had ever held this office. He remained there until his death.  His writings were published in thirteen parts, the first twelve in [[Venice]], 1724–1729, in six folio volumes, the thirteenth in [[Bologna]], in 1742. The first six under the title ''Synodorum generalium et provincialium statuta et canones cum notis et historicis dissertationibus'' (1665–1673) contain a detailed history of the councils, with many dissertations. The seventh part contains: ''Ad Ephesinum concilium variorum patrum epistolas, item commonitorium Coelestini papae, titulos decretorum Hilarii papae'' (Louvain, 1682). He also wrote critical replies to [[Pasquier Quesnel]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux]], and Gerbais. His writings are mostly collections of historical materials, usually little elaborated by him.

A '''chronology of Jesus''' aims to establish a [[timeline]] for the events of the life of [[Jesus]]. Scholars have correlated [[Jewish]] and [[Greco-Roman]] documents and astronomical calendars with the [[New Testament]] accounts to estimate dates for the major events in Jesus's life. 

Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]]: one based on the accounts in the [[Gospels]] of his birth with reference to [[Herod the Great|King Herod's]] reign, and the other by subtracting his stated age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" when he began preaching. Most scholars, on this basis, assume a date of birth between 6 and 4&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=MJDG324 &gt;[[John P. Meier]] (1991).

Recent astronomical research uses the contrast between the synoptic date of Jesus' last Passover on the one hand with John's date of the subsequent "Jewish Passover" on the other hand, to propose Jesus' Last Supper to have been on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 and the crucifixion on Friday 3 April AD 33.

===Biblical references to King Herod's reign===
The two [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity accounts of Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke]] differ substantially from each other, and are considered to have been written independently. However, some consistent elements are evidently derived from a common early tradition:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Luz]]: ''Die Geburtsgeschichten Jesu und die Geschichte.'' Göttingen 2013, [https://books.google.de/books?id=6ZJbAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 S. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jesus was born under the Judean king [[Herod the Great]] (Matt 2,1f; Luke 1,5 vs Luke 2,1f)
*in [[Bethlehem]] (Matt 2,5f; Luke 2,4.15)
*prior to his parents moving to [[Nazareth]] (Matt 2,22f), or before their return to Nazareth (Luke 2,39).
*Jesus' parents [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] were [[Engagement#Betrothal|betrothed]] (Matt 1,18–20; Luke 1,27; 2,5).
* His birth was a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] conceived by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* [[Angel]]s announced Jesus' birth, his name, his role as the [[Messiah]] (being a descendant of King [[David]] and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|son of God]]), and his mission to save his people from sin (Matt 1,21; Luke 1,77; 2,11,30).

Thus both Luke and Matthew independently associate Jesus' birth with the reign of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew furthermore implies that Jesus was up to two years old when Herod reportedly ordered the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], that is, the murder of all boys in Bethlehem up to the age of two (Matt 2:16).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Edwin D | last = Freed | title = Stories of Jesus' Birth | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2004 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that Herod died in 4 BC, although some have argued for 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The Date of Herod's Death|journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|issue=19|year=1968|pp=204–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernegger|first=P.

===Subtracting Jesus' age of "about 30 years" when preaching===
Another approach to estimating Jesus' year of birth is based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" when starting his ministry.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate to have been in AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtracting 30 years, it appears that Jesus was born in 1-2 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 28–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
The Gospel of John 8:57 mentions in passing an upper limit of 50 for Jesus' age when preaching: ''Then the Jews said to Him: You are not even fifty years old, and you claim to have seen Abraham?'' Fifty years is a round number which emphasises the discrepancy to Jesus's claim he had existed before Abraham, that is, for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name=Humphreys72 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have attempted to establish the date of birth by identifying the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with some known astronomical or astrological phenomenon. For example, astronomer Michael Molnar proposed 17 April 6 BC as the likely date of the Nativity, since that date corresponded to the [[heliacal rising]] and lunar [[occultation]] of [[Jupiter]], while it was [[Apparent retrograde motion#Apparent motion|momentarily stationary]] in the [[Aries (constellation)|constellation of Aries]]. According to Molnar, to knowledgeable astrologers of this time, this highly unusual combination of events would have indicated that a regal personage would be (or had been) born in Judea. &lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Molnar, "The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi," Rutgers University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research points to a 1991 report from the Royal Astronomical Society, which mentions that Chinese astronomers noted a "comet" that lasted 70 days in the Capricorn region of the sky, in March of 5 BC.  Authors Dugard and O'Reilly consider this event as the likely Star of Bethlehem. &lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Bill, and Dugard, Martin, "Killing Jesus: A History," Henry Holt and Company, 2013, {{ISBN|0805098542}}, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many possible phenomena and none seems to match the Gospel account exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''101 Questions and Answers on the Bible'', Paulist Press (2003), page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years of preaching==

===Reign of Tiberius and the Gospel of Luke===
[[File:Sapsaphas Madaba.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Madaba Map]] showing [[Bethabara]] (Βέθαβαρά), calling it the place where John baptised]]
One method for the estimation of the date of the beginning of the [[ministry of Jesus]] is based on the Gospel of Luke's specific statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1-2]] about the ministry of [[John the Baptist]] which preceded that of Jesus:&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans67 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]] began on the death of his predecessor [[Augustus Caesar]] in September AD&amp;nbsp;14, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in late AD&amp;nbsp;28 or early AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Cradle &gt;Andreas J.

If so, the fifteenth year of Tiberius' reign would be counted from AD&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;ref name="Riesner"/&gt; Riesner's suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule - namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio - count from AD&amp;nbsp;14 - the year of Augustus' death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;ref name=Humphreys64 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament presents [[John the Baptist]] as the precursor to Jesus and the [[Baptism of Jesus]] as marking the beginning of Jesus' ministry.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blomberg224 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L.

===The Temple in Jerusalem and the Gospel of John===
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Herod's Temple]], referred to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]], as imagined in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]]. It is currently situated adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]

Another method for estimating the start of the ministry of Jesus without reliance on the [[Synoptic gospels]] is to relate the account in the [[Gospel of John]] about the visit of Jesus to [[Herod's Temple]] in Jerusalem with historical data about the construction of the Temple.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] says that Jesus went to the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] around the start of his ministry and in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] Jesus is told: "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?".&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;

Herod's Temple in Jerusalem was an extensive and long term construction on the [[Temple Mount]], which was never fully completed even by the time it was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.&lt;ref name=Roller67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lundquist /&gt;&lt;ref name= Maxxix &gt;''The biblical engineer: how the temple in Jerusalem was built'' by Max Schwartz 2002 {{ISBN|0-88125-710-9}} pages xixx-xx&lt;/ref&gt; Having built entire cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]], Herod saw the construction of the Temple as a key, colossal monument.&lt;ref name=Lundquist &gt;''The Temple of Jerusalem: past, present, and future'' by John M. Lundquist 2007 {{ISBN|0-275-98339-0}} pages101-103 [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22john+2:20%22+temple&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kpydTvvXB-qK4gSg2NHPCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%202%3A20%22%20temple&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication of the initial temple (sometimes called the inner Temple) followed a 17 or 18 month construction period, just after the visit of [[Augustus]] to Syria.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roller67 &gt;''The building program of Herod the Great'' by Duane W. Roller 1998 University of California Press {{ISBN|0-520-20934-6}} pages 67-71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZsB1yQOmyEC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=herod+temple+construction&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DredTu3cIqT64QSitp2nCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=temple%20construction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josephus]] ([[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV|Ant 15.11.1]]) states that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostenberger140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the historical Jesus'' by Craig A. Evans 2008 {{ISBN|0-415-97569-7}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; But there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, which event marked the start of Herod's reign, and whether the initial date should refer to the inner Temple, or the subsequent construction.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt; Hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit.&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; Given that it took 46 years of construction, the best scholarly estimate for when Jesus preached is around the year AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAnderson200 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

===Josephus' reference to John the Baptist===
Both the gospels and first-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]], in his work [[Antiquities of the Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;''The new complete works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus'', William Whiston, Paul L. Maier {{ISBN|0-8254-2924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Herod Antipas]] killing [[John the Baptist]], and to the marriage of Herod and [[Herodias]], establishing two key connections between Josephus and the biblical episodes.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt; Josephus refers to the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas and that Herodias left her husband to marry Herod Antipas, in defiance of Jewish law.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley694 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus and the gospels differ, however, on the details and motives, e.g. whether the execution was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:18|Mark 6:18]]), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2]].&lt;ref name=Leslie508 &gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-856-6}} pages 508-509 [https://books.google.com/books?id=17kzgBusXZIC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=baptist+josephus+antipas+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5kmbTvPYB9TP4QSuzIDjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=baptist%20herodias%20josephus%20antipas%20jesus&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Women in scripture'' by [[Carol Meyers]], Toni Craven and Ross Shepard Kraemer 2001 {{ISBN|0-8028-4962-8}} pages 92-93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFbHT73BxpAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=herodias+herod&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJmcToy0M4abOtTmzIYJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Herod Antipas in Galilee: The Literary and Archaeological Sources'' by Morten H.

The exact year of the marriage of [[Herod Antipas]] and [[Herodias]] is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt; While some scholars place the year of the marriage in the range AD&amp;nbsp;27-31, others have approximated a date as late as AD&amp;nbsp;35, although such a late date has much less support.&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt; In his analysis of Herod's life, [[Harold Hoehner]] estimates that John the Baptist's imprisonment probably occurred around AD&amp;nbsp;30-31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oO0upEG0g7kC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=herodias+herod+antipas#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod%20antipas&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;Herod Antipas'&amp;#39; by Harold W.

===Reign of Herod Antipas===
{{see also|Jesus at Herod's court}}
In the [[Gospel of Luke]], while Jesus is in [[Pilate's court]], Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean and thus is under the jurisdiction of [[Herod Antipas]].&lt;ref name=Niswonger &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L.

===Conversion of Paul===

Another approach to estimating an [[upper bound]] for the year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of [[conversion of Paul the Apostle]] which the New Testament accounts place some time after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt; Paul's conversion is discussed in both the [[Letters of Paul]] and in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey William (1979). ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A–D'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. pp. 689. {{ISBN|0-8028-3781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|15:3–8]]), Paul refers to his conversion. The [[Acts of the Apostles]] includes three separate references to his conversion experience, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#9|Acts 9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#22|Acts 22]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#26|Acts 26]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and His Letters'' by John B. Polhill 1999 {{ISBN|0-8054-1097-X}} pages 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' by William Lane Craig, James Porter Moreland 2009 {{ISBN|1-4051-7657-1}} page 616&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating the year of Paul's conversion relies on working backwards from his trial before [[Junius Annaeus Gallio|Junius Gallio]] in [[Achaea]] Greece ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:12|Acts 18:12–17]]) around AD&amp;nbsp;51–52, a date derived from the discovery and publication, in 1905, of four stone fragments as part of the [[Delphi Inscription]]s, at [[Delphi]] across the Gulf from [[Corinth]].&lt;ref name=Marrow45 &gt;''Paul: his letters and his theology'' by Stanley B. Marrow 1986 {{ISBN|0-8091-2744-X}} pages 45–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak18 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 18–22&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gallio Inscription|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~horton/r102/gallio.html|accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserves a letter from Claudius concerning Gallio dated during the 26th acclamation of Claudius, sometime between January 51 and August 52.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Polhill, ''Paul and His Letters'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|9780805410976}}, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this basis, most historians estimate that Gallio (brother of [[Seneca the Younger]]) became [[proconsul]] between the spring of AD&amp;nbsp;51 and the summer of AD&amp;nbsp;52, and that his position ended no later than AD&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 &gt;''The Cambridge Companion to St Paul'' by James D.

===Astronomical analysis===

====Newton's method====
[[File:Bolton-newton.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton]]]]
All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (Matt 27:62, 28:1, Mark 15:42, Luke 23:54, John 19:31,42). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April in our calendar). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (Leviticus 23 v. 5; Numbers 28 v. 16). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John's Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus' trial and execution was the day before Passover (John 18 v. 28 and 19 v. 14), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan ("sacrificed as a Passover lamb", 1 Cor 5:7), and was resurrected on the Jewish [[Shavuot|festival of the first fruits]], i.e. on a 16 Nisan (1 Cor 15:20).&lt;ref name=Humphreys68 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all 4 Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26–36) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html "The Date of the Crucifixion"], Colin Humphreys and W. Graeme Waddington, March 1985. American Scientific Affiliation website. Retrieved 17 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733, [[Isaac Newton]] considered only the range AD&amp;nbsp;31–36 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, and 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00205]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton &gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton, Isaac]] (1733).

K. Fotheringham]], who in 1910 suggested 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"&gt;Fotheringham, J.K., 1910.

Schaefer]] and J. P. Pratt, following a similar method, arrived at the same date.&lt;ref name=Pratt1 &gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J.

A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze.&lt;ref&gt;C. Philipp E. Nothaft, ''Dating the Passion: The Life of Jesus and the Emergence of Scientific Chronology'' (200–1600) page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Sanders, ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'' (Penguin, 1993) 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD&amp;nbsp;27.  Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;ref name=Humphreys53 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD&amp;nbsp;27 and AD&amp;nbsp;34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with Luke 3:1–2, and spring AD&amp;nbsp;34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline, confirming Friday 7 April AD&amp;nbsp;30, and Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.&lt;ref name=Humphreys63 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipse method====
[[File:Total_lunar_eclipse_May_4_2004-Jpeter_smith.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Lunar eclipse]], 4 May 2004. Red hue caused by diffraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.]]
A [[lunar eclipse]] is potentially alluded to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]] ("The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come"), as pointed out by physicist [[Colin Humphreys]] and astronomer Graeme Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33,&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"/&gt;[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/0001-0100/LE0033-04-03P.gif] a date which coincides with one of Newton's astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red "bite" missing at the top left of the moon's disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]]).&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Astronomer [[Bradley Schaefer]] agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1990, March). Lunar visibility and the crucifixion. Royal Astronomical Society Quarterly Journal, 31(1), 53–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1991, July). Glare and celestial visibility.

A potentially related issue involves the reference in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] to a three-hour period of darkness over the whole land on the day of the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος – the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event,&lt;ref&gt;David E. Garland, ''Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel'' (Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing,  1999) page 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a [[solar eclipse]], since this could not take place during the crucifixion at Passover,&lt;ref name=Milone &gt;''Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy'' by David H. Kelley, Eugene F. Milone 2011 {{ISBN|1-4419-7623-X}} pages 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond'' by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009 {{ISBN|0-495-56203-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours.&lt;ref&gt;Meeus, J. (2003, December). ''The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse''. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, 113(6), 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, astronomers [[Colin Humphreys|Humphreys]] and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the ''lunar'' eclipse of AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref name="HumWadJASA"/&gt; This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as 'undefended' and 'indefensible'.&lt;ref name="henige"&gt;{{cite book | last=Henige | first=David P. | authorlink=David Henige | title=Historical evidence and argument | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | isbn=978-0-299-21410-4 | page=150| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a ''[[khamsin]]'', i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review&lt;ref name="Telford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Telford|first1=William R.|title=Review of The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=2015|volume=66|issue=1|pages=371–376|doi=10.1093/jts/flv005|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/27/jts.flv005|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his lunar eclipse argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony, accepting uncritically statements such as the "three different Passovers in John" and Matthew's statement that Jesus died at the ninth hour. He also alleges that Humphreys uses two very dubious sources, namely Pilate's alleged letter to Tiberius and the writings of the fifth-century Bishop Cyril of Alexandria, which Humphreys however classifies as forgery or contemporary interpretation indicative of a tradition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys 2011 p85 "Much apocryphal writing consists of highly theatrical literature, which cannot be used as historical evidence ... if [Pilate's report to Tertullian] is a Christian forgery, probably made up on the basis of Acts, as seems likely, then this suggests there was a tradition that at the crucifixion the moon appeared like blood."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double Passover method====
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|The rising full moon at sunset signals the start of the Passover meal. This is two weeks after the new moon has heralded the start of the month of Nisan (March/April).]]
In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) ''before'' his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official "Jewish" Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall ''after'' Jesus' death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus' "synoptic" Passover meal in fact took place two days before John's "Jewish" Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by [[Moses]] in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the [[Samaritans]]). The official "Jewish" Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD&amp;nbsp;30 and AD&amp;nbsp;33 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus' last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD&amp;nbsp;30 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD&amp;nbsp;33 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's narrative that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 192–195&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford counters that the separate day schema of the Gospel's Holy Week "is an artificial as well as an inconsistent construction".  As Telford had pointed out in his own book in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;WR Telford ''The Barren Temple and the Withered Tree: A Redaction-Critical Analysis of the Cursing of the Fig-Tree Pericope in Mark's Gospel and its Relation to the Cleansing of the Temple Tradition'' Bloomsbury, London, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; "the initial three-day structure found in [Mark 11] is occasioned by the purely redactional linkage of the extraneous fig-tree story with the triumphal entry and cleansing of the temple traditions, and is not a chronology upon which one can base any historical reconstructions."

===Scholarly debate on time of death===
[[File:Papyrus 90 (John 19.1-7).jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Papyrus 90]] fragment of [[Gospel of John|John 19]]]]
The estimation of the hour of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries, since there was perceived to be&lt;ref name=RBrown959 /&gt; a clear difference between the accounts in the Synoptic Gospels and that in the Gospel of John. Also, some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), ''Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus – A Critical Study'' [Trans. from German] (pp. 35–71 for ‘The Chronology of “More Than One Day”)&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus of modern scholarship agrees with the four Gospels that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, although a Wednesday crucifixion has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Kellum142 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nis167 &gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Niswonger+%22which+meant+Friday%22&amp;btnG= ''New Testament History''] by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pages 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the [[Last Supper]] takes place on the first night of [[Passover]], defined in the [[Torah]] as occurring after daylight on [[Quartodeciman|14 of Nisan]], and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Lev|23:5–6|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[the Gospel of John]] the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover meal&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barnett, ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'', page 21  (InterVarsity Press, 1999). {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. John's account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm and eaten before midnight on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Philo]] |title=''De Specialibus Legibus'' 2.145 |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book28.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]].

It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:17–19}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:12–16}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts,&lt;ref name= KEasley323 /&gt; although [[Raymond E.

Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 538&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]] has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the [[Lamb of God]].&lt;ref name="Barclay2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Barclay|title=The Gospel of John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTjS1ADrbMkC&amp;pg=PA340|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-1-61164-015-1|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Humphreys' widely publicised "double passover" astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the hour of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the "six days" leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John's gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus' day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey's proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie Jaubert&lt;ref&gt;La date de la cène, Gabalda, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran ''solar'' calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert's conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus' Last Supper ''after'' the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of [[Samaritans]] did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s.

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which "does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise."&lt;ref name="Telford"/&gt;

==Ancient estimates==
Other estimates of the chronology of Jesus have been proposed over the centuries, e.g. [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and [[Cassiodorus]] asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD&amp;nbsp;31.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 3rd/4th century Roman historian [[Lactantius]] states that Jesus was crucified on a particular day in AD&amp;nbsp;29, but that did not correspond to a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Of the Manner In Which the Persecutors Died'' 2: "In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of Ruberius (''sic'') Geminus and Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April, as I find it written".&lt;/ref&gt;

As these societies became more sedentary, they were able to manufacture and use vessels that would have broken during transportation.  Pots allowed for more efficient processing of wild seeds, which created less work for people when the pots were made waterproof. More-efficient seed collection systems and the deliberate manipulation of the native plants, in turn led to the domestication of several plant species.  This is just one of many cultural developments that began during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian M., ''Ancient North America''. London: Thames and Hudson, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyril Edel Leonoff''' (February 22, 1925 – April 7, 2016) was a Canadian [[geotechnical engineer]], historian, and author. He was the founding president of the Jewish Historical Society of British Columbia.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Cyril Leonoff was born to [[Jewish]] parents William Leonoff and Rose Leonoff (née Brotman) in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada.  His grandparents on both sides of his family came to Canada from Eastern Europe, the Leonoffs from Nicolaiov, [[Russia]] and the Brotmans from the [[Poland|Polish]] town Bialykammin in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]].  The Brotmans were among the first [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] families to settle in the farming colony of [[Wapella, Saskatchewan]].

Leonoff attended schools in the North End of Winnipeg, where many of the students were Jewish.  His Jewish education, however, was provided mostly by a private tutor.  During his second year of classes at the [[University of Manitoba]], he joined the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] and was stationed in [[Kingston, Ontario]] in the [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals|Signal Corps]].  Near the end of World War II in Europe, he was posted to the Signals Research establishment in [[Ottawa]].  He then returned to the University of Manitoba where he completed a Bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]]. During his studies, he met his future wife, Faye Matlin (1927-2011). Together they graduated in 1949, married on the eve of their graduation, and traveled to [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]], where Cyril worked for the Rivers &amp; Harbours Branch of the Public Works Department.

=== Engineering career ===

The couple relocated briefly to [[Seattle]] where Leonoff completed his post-graduate education in [[geotechnical engineering]] at the [[University of Washington]]. In 1952, they returned to [[Vancouver]], where Leonoff joined the one-year-old engineering firm of Ripley and Associates. Together with Charles F. Ripley and Earle J. Klohn, Leonoff co-founded Ripley, Klohn &amp; Leonoff, Ltd., which grew nationally in the 1950s and 1960s, and internationally in the 1970s, to become Klohn Leonoff, Ltd. Leonoff was one of the earliest pioneer practitioners in British Columbia of soil mechanics and foundation engineering, a field known today as [[geotechnical engineering]].

Throughout his thirty-six year engineering career, Leonoff made significant contributions to the profession, participated in engineering societies, and authored many technical papers. In 2000, he received the Vancouver Geotechnical Society&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Geotechnical Society - http://v-g-s.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; Award for significant contributions to the local practice of geotechnical engineering and was inducted as a Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Fellows of the Engineering Institute of Canada - http://www.eic-ici.ca/honours_awards/fellows.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewish Historical Society of British Columbia ===

In 1968, Leonoff met Eli Barish, one of three brothers who had grown up on the Wapella Farm Settlement where Leonoff's family had also originated. At a community event, Barish noticed Leonoff's daughter and commented "She looks like my old girlfriend on the farm... she looks like Rose Brotman", Leonoff's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, C.E. (July 21, 2011). Interview by J. Yuhasz. The Jewish Historical Society of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to know more about this history, and realizing that there was no documentation of it, Leonoff began interviewing the Barish brothers and other alumni of the Jewish farm settlements throughout the Canadian prairies. The following summer he joined the Barish brothers on a visit to Wapella, where he took many photos and interviewed more aging farmers. This research resulted in Leonoff's first book, ''Wapella Farm Settlement: The First Successful Jewish Farm Settlement in Canada''.

That same year, Leonoff was approached by Abe Arnold, then Executive Director of the Winnipeg chapter of [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], and former editor of the Vancouver-based community newspaper, ''[http://www.jewishindependent.ca/ The Jewish Western Bulletin]''. A long-time history buff, Arnold was working to establish a Canadian Jewish Historical Society and a network of regional Jewish historical societies. He encouraged Leonoff to lead the BC society. Co-sponsored by CJC and the [[National Council of Jewish Women]], a meeting was held on November 26, 1970 to establish the Jewish Historical Society of British Columbia. Leonoff was elected president of the new society.

The Historical Society's oral history program expanded rapidly with the involvement of new volunteers drawn largely from the ranks of the National Council of Jewish Women. These interviews led to Leonoff's next book, ''Pioneers, Pedlars, and Prayershawls: The Jewish Communities in British Columbia and the Yukon'', published in 1978.

=== Mountain View Cemetery ===

[[File:MVC Notice - Apr 8 1971.jpg|frameless|right|Public Notice announcing proposed renovations in the Jewish section of Mountain View Cemetery, April 8, 1971.]]
In April 1971, a notice appeared in the ''Jewish Western Bulletin'', alerting the community to proposed renovations planned for the Jewish section of [[Mountain View Cemetery (Vancouver)|Mountain View Cemetery]]. Consecrated in 1892, this section of Mountain View Cemetery is the final resting place of many of the early pioneers of the Vancouver Jewish community, including Zebulon Franks, Simon and Samuel Petersky, Solomon Weaver, and Samuel, Rosina, and Maurice Gintzburger. In response to the growing community that now numbered over 600 families, the new Schara Tzedeck Cemetery was consecrated in New Westminster on November 3, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, Cyril E.: "Restoration &amp; Re-Dedication of the Jewish Cemetery at Mountain View, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 1892-2015" in ''Western States Jewish History'', Volume 48, number 2, Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the opening of this new cemetery, the Jewish section of Mountain View fell out of use and by 1971 was largely forgotten by the community.

In an effort to reduce the cost of maintaining the site, the committee responsible proposed laying the gravestones flat to allow a motorized lawnmower to pass through more easily. The Jewish Historical Society, still in its infancy, rallied in opposition to this plan and submitted a letter, penned by Leonoff, expressing these concerns. It was published in the ''Jewish Western Bulletin'' on April 21, 1971. "We are seriously concerned with the proposal to modify the monuments by laying them flush with the ground, as is the present vogue," Leonoff wrote. "We consider that not only will this disfigure the individual monuments but will also destroy the traditional character of the cemetery."&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, Cyril: "Historical Society Opposes Modernizing Old Cemetery," ''The Jewish Independent April 23, 1971: 2 | http://multiculturalcanada.ca/node/360492{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonoff and his colleague Julius Shore were invited to a site visit with the Cemetery Board and Mountain View staff, with the result that the headstones remained untouched. A comprehensive restoration effort was initiated years later, in February 2013, and completed in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Pat: "New Life for Cemetery," ''The Jewish Independent'' May 8, 2016 | http://www.jewishindependent.ca/new-life-for-cemetery/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growing the Collection ===

[[File:LF.02057.jpg|thumb|right|High-steel men working on the Port Mann Bridge above the Fraser River, Coquitlam, BC, February 23, 1962; LF02057, Otto F. Landauer, Photographer]] For the ensuing 45 years, Leonoff remained actively involved in the work of the Jewish Historical Society, writing frequent articles and acquiring new material for the archives. A passionate hobby photographer, Leonoff sought out the collections of three major Jewish BC photographers: Leonard Frank, [[Otto Landauer]], and Fred Schiffer, as well as the vast photographic collection of pioneer dentist Irving Snider. Together, these collections number over 300,000 items documenting vast portions of the history of BC, including the logging trade in the early 20th Century and the post-war construction of Vancouver. They have served as source material for numerous exhibits produced by the Jewish Museum and Archives of BC, the successor organization to the Jewish Historical Society.

Leonoff documented the lives and work of Leonard Frank and Otto Landauer in a pair of books, ''An Enterprising Life: Leonard Frank Photographs, 1895-1944'', and ''Bridges of Light: Otto Landauer of Leonard Frank Photographs, 1945-1980''. The first of this pair was widely acclaimed, was a finalist for the B.C. Book Prize,&lt;ref&gt;Winners and Finalists of the BC Book Prize, 1991 | http://www.bcbookprizes.ca/winners/1991&lt;/ref&gt; and won the City of Vancouver Heritage Award and the Alcuin Society Design Award.

Leonoff won additional accolades for his other writings, notably the Margaret McWilliams Medal&lt;ref&gt;Past Winners of the Margaret McWilliams Medal | http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mcwilliams/index.shtml#1985&lt;/ref&gt; of the Manitoba Historical Society for his 1985 essay, "The Jewish Farmers of Western Canada". Leonoff was also the 2007 recipient of the Louis Rosenberg Distinguished Service Award, awarded by the Association for Canadian Jewish Studies for a lifetime of scholarly achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rosenberg Award Recipients | http://acjs-aejc.ca/awards/about-past-louis-rosenberg-award-recipients/&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued writing on the history of Jews in Western Canada right up until the time of his death. Following his passing, Leonoff's family found on his desk notes for future writings.

The '''Djiboutian Civil War''' (also known as the '''Afar insurgency''') was a conflict in [[Djibouti]], lasting from 1991 to 1994 and resulting in thousands of fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;"Djibouti army reports 100 rebels killed." ''The Associated Press'', January 19, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; This uneven power sharing between the Issas and Afars led to the Civil War that ravaged the country for three long years.

==Background==
On 11 March 1862, the French Government made an agreement with the Afar Sultan [[Raieta Dini Ahmet]]. Ahmet sold his territory of Obock for 10,000 thalaris, around [[French franc|F]]55,000. This was the start of the French colonisation era in the region, the treaty was used by a captain of the Fleuriot de Langle, to colonise the south part of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura|Tadjoura Gulf]].{{sfn|Henri|1968|pp=32–47}}

Since at least French rule, first as [[French Somaliland]] and then as [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]], there have been ethnic tensions in Djibouti between the [[Issa (clan)|Issas]], and the [[Afar people|Afars]]. Following independence in 1977, the Issas-dominated [[People's Rally for Progress]] party had ruled Djibouti, and since 1981, had ruled it as a [[one-party state]] with the People's Rally for Progress the only authorized party.  Many Afar felt marginalized.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

At the same time, in 1991, neighboring countries' [[authoritarian]] governments were overthrown, [[Siad Barre]] in [[Somalia]] and [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in [[Ethiopia]].  [[Eritrea]] also became independent from the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] in 1991.

==Outbreak==
In May 1991, thousands of Ethiopian soldiers routed into Djiboutian territory after the Derg Government (the former Ethiopian Government) was overthrown. Framed by French and Djiboutian troops, they are repatriated back to Ethiopia, but leaving many weapons behind them. At the beginning of October 1991, the rebel organization Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD), calling for greater political participation of Afar, launched a guerrilla struggle against the government.  There were clashes between government forces and FRUD rebels in the Dikhil region of western Djibouti on October, from the first days of the outbreak of hostilities, specifically on the night of 15–16 November 1991, the Djiboutian Army captured some 232 individuals in the [[Obock Region]]. These were mainly the Afars of [[Eritrea]] and the militia of the former [[Derg]] regime. To wash away the affront, the FRUD launches on 21 November 1991 to the assault of the town of [[Obock]] and its garrison, after a long day of fierce fighting, the Djiboutian soldiers crushed them and won the battle. Subsequently, several other battles will confront the national army and the Frud militia, which caused heavy casualties on both sides. The rebel (FRUD) seized all military posts in the north of the country and laid siege to the city of [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]]. The government troops and FRUD rebels clashed near [[Tadjoura]] on January 3–4, 1992, resulting in the deaths of some 150 rebels and three soldiers and government troops and FRUD rebels clashed in the Gagade, Kharab, and Bekaneb districts on 17–18 January 1992, resulting in the deaths of some 150 rebels and 16 soldiers. Throughout the war, the fighting was mainly in the north of the country with the exception of the incident in the capital, when the December 18, 1991 the year the government troops entered the area Arhiba inhabited by the Afar, and opened fire on crowds of people. At the same time killed at least 59 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/20/world/soldiers-fire-into-crowd-in-djibouti-tribal-strife.html |title=Soldiers Fire Into Crowd in Djibouti Tribal Strife |publisher=The New York Times |first=Jane |last=Perlez |date=December 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesnouvelles.org/P10_magazine/12_depeche04/12188_FDParhiba2003.html |title=Pour la 12ème commémoration du massacre d’Arhiba |publisher=Les nouvelles d'Addis |date=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1992, some French troops were deployed in the north to aid the government forces.&lt;ref&gt;"250 French Troops Sent to Djibouti War Zone." ''Associated Press'', February 25, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; With about 3,000 (FRUD) rebel attacked a government institutions in [[Dikhil]] but was repelled back. [[France]] has tried to mediate between the government and the rebels, but all attempts to organize such talks (November 1992, May 1993 the year ) failed.&lt;ref&gt;"Rebels turn down president's terms for negotiations." Agence France Presse, May 10, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded by increasing its armed forces from about 5,000 to 20,000 men and recalled its reserves, they were supported with some military equipment by [[France]]. On the 5 July 1993, government troops went on the offensive, capturing most of the rebel-held areas. Some 10,000 to 18,000 of [[Djiboutian]]s fled the fighting in the neighboring [[Afar Region]] of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Thousands Of Djiboutians Flee to Ethiopia." ''The Associated Press'', July 12, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil War contributed to the reintroduction of a multi-party democracy in 1992 with a new constitution. In 1992 and 1993 parliamentary and presidential elections took place. Subsequently, the FRUD split on the question of how far it was to cooperate with the government. But guerrilla actions continue to unfold, the opposition denounces numerous abuses against civilians.

==Peace agreement==
In December 1994, the Abb'a peace agreement between the government and the moderate majority of FRUDs largely ended the civil war. Two FRUD representatives received ministerial posts, and at the next 1999 elections the FRUD supported the RPP, re-constituted themselves as a political party and some 200 of their adherenets was integrated in the civil service and local administration and almost 700 of fighters joined regular army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5482.htm |title=Djibouti |publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; A faction of the rebels, led by [[Ahmed Dini]] continue low-scale insurgency over the next few years, being especially visible in the 1996. In December 2000 this faction also signed a cease-fire and took five government posts. Accordingly, to the words of agreement, administrative reform were ensued soon after.

'''Elmer Rice''' (born '''Elmer Leopold Reizenstein''', September 28, 1892 – May 8, 1967) was an American [[playwright]]. He is best known for his plays ''[[The Adding Machine]]'' (1923) and his Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of New York tenement life, ''[[Street Scene (play)|Street Scene]]'' (1929).

==Biography==
===Early years===
Rice was born Elmer Leopold Reizenstein at 127 East 90th Street in [[New York City, New York|New York City]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical information for this entry is taken from Durham, Palmieri, and Rice's autobiography.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was a political activist in the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in the German states. After the failure of that political upheaval, he emigrated to the United States where he became a businessman. He spent most of his retirement years living with the Rice family and developed a close relationship with his grandson Elmer, who became a politically motivated writer and shared his grandfather's liberal and pacifist politics. A staunch atheist, his grandfather may also have influenced Elmer in his feelings about religion as he refused to attend Hebrew school or to have a bar mitzvah. In contrast, Rice's relationship with his father was very distant. As he wrote in his autobiography, his grandfather and his Uncle Will, both of whom boarded with the family, made up for the affection and attention his father withheld.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; A child of the tenements, Rice spent much of his youth reading, to his family's consternation, and later observed, "Nothing in my life has been more helpful than the simple act of joining the library."&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 42, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his need to support his family when his father's epilepsy worsened, Rice did not complete high school, and he took a number of menial jobs before earning his diploma by preparing for the state examinations on his own and then applying to law school. Though he disliked legal studies and spent a good deal of class time reading plays in class (because they could be finished within the span of a two-hour lecture, he said), Rice graduated from [[New York Law School]] in 1912 and began a short-lived legal career.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the profession in 1914, he was always to retain a cynical outlook about lawyers, but his two years in a law office provided him with material for several plays, most notably ''Counsellor-at-Law'' (1931).  Courtroom dramas became a Rice specialty.

Needing to make a living, he decided to try writing full-time. It was a wise decision. His first play, ''On Trial'' (1914), a melodramatic murder mystery, was a great success and ran for 365 performances in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Palmieri, pp.&amp;nbsp;34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George M. Cohan]] offered to buy the rights for $30,000, a proposition Rice declined largely because he did not believe Cohan could be serious. Co-authored with a friend, Frank Harris (not the famed [[Oscar Wilde]] biographer and memoirist), the play was purportedly the first American drama to employ the technique of reverse-chronology, telling the story from its conclusion to its starting-point. ''On Trial'' then went on tour throughout the United States with three separate companies and was produced in [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Norway]], [[Scotland]] and [[South Africa]]. The author ultimately earned $100,000 from his first work for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 98-119. Rice aptly entitled this chapter of his memoirs "The Jackpot."&lt;/ref&gt;  None of his later plays earned him as much as ''On Trial.''  The play was adapted for the cinema three times, in 1917, 1928, and 1939.

Political and social issues occupied Rice's attention in this period as well. [[World War I]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s conservatism confirmed him in his criticism of the status quo. (He had been firmly converted to socialism in his teens, he said, by reading [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H.G. Wells]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Frank Norris]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;) He frequented [[Greenwich Village]], then the most bohemian part of New York City, in the late 1910s and became friendly with many socially-conscious writers and activists, including the African-American poet [[James Weldon Johnson]] and the illustrator [[Art Young]].&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 158-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Bickerton-Rice-Laemmle Counsellor at Law.jpg|thumb|left| From left, [[Joseph P. Bickerton, Jr.]] (theatre producer), Elmer Rice (playwright) and [[Carl Laemmle Jr.]] (Universal producer) sign a contract for the film version of Counsellor at Law]]
After writing four more plays of no special distinction, Rice startled audiences in 1923 with his next contribution to the theatre, the boldly [[Expressionism (theatre)|expressionistic]] ''[[The Adding Machine]]'', which he wrote in 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, pp. 32-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[satire]] about the growing regimentation of life in the [[machine age]], the play tells the story the life, death and bizarre [[afterlife]] of a dull [[bookkeeping|bookkeeper]], Mr. Zero. When Mr. Zero, a mere cog in the corporate machine, discovers that he is to be replaced at work by an [[adding machine]], he snaps and murders his boss. After his trial and execution, he enters the next life only to confront some of the same issues and, judged to be of minimal use in heaven, is sent back to Earth for recycling. Theatre critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] called it "the most original and brilliant play any American had written up to that time&amp;nbsp;... the harshest and most illuminating play about modern society [Broadway had ever seen]."&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[Alexander Woollcott]] were enthusiastic. Other reviewers spoke of him, hyperbolically, as a writer who might become America's Ibsen.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Meade, ''Dorothy Parker: A Biography'' (New York: Villard, 1987), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Directed with great ingenuity by [[Philip Moeller]], designed by [[Lee Simonson]], and produced by the [[Theatre Guild]], the play starred [[Dudley Digges]] and [[Edward G. Robinson]], then at the start of his acting career.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it made its author no money at all. (Adapted as an innovatively staged musical in 2007, ''The Adding Machine'' enjoyed a successful Off-Broadway run in 2008.)

When [[Dorothy Parker]] was at work on her own play the following year (loosely based on fellow [[Algonquin Round Table]] member [[Robert Benchley]], his marital problems, and the extra-marital temptations he was grappling with) and needed a co-author, she approached Elmer Rice, now acknowledged as the Broadway "boy wonder" of the moment. It was a smooth collaboration and also resulted in a brief affair between Parker and the already-married Rice, begun at Rice's insistent urging.&lt;ref&gt;Meade, pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; The run of the play did not go smoothly, however; despite good reviews, ''Close Harmony'' (1924) closed quickly and was soon forgotten.

Rice was a prolific, even tireless writer. His plays over the next five years included the unproduced ''The Sidewalks of New York'' (1925), ''Is He Guilty?'' (1927) and ''The Gay White Way'' (1928) and two collaborations, ''Wake Up, Jonathan'' (1928) with Hatcher Hughes, a dramatist unknown today and ''Cock Robin'' (1929) with Philip Barry, a Broadway name equal to Rice's. None of these plays was a success. Rice was a theatre professional by this time: open to collaboration, increasingly interested in producing and directing his own plays. In the 1930s, he even bought a Broadway house, the famed [[Belasco Theatre]].

[[File:Street-Scene-1929.jpg|thumb|left|Original Broadway production of ''[[Street Scene (play)|Street Scene]]'' (1929)]]

Rice's second hit (after ''The Adding Machine'') proved to be his most lasting literary accomplishment. Originally entitled ''Landscape with Figures,'' ''[[Street Scene (play)|Street Scene]]'' (1929), later the subject of an [[opera]] by [[Kurt Weill]], won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for its realistic chronicle of life in the slums. "With fifty characters casually strolling through it," Brooks Atkinson wrote, "it looked like an improvisation.... Based on the facade of a house at 25 West 65th Street, which Rice selected as typical, the tall massive setting caught the tone and humanity of a decaying brownstone."&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The script had been rejected by most producers who read it, and director [[George Cukor]] abandoned it as un-stageable after the second day of rehearsals. Rice took over the direction himself and proved that it was highly stageworthy, if unconventional in its narrative style and disorienting naturalism. Like ''The Adding Machine,'' the play's break with the conventions of stage realism was part of its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, pp. 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice's plays of the 1930s included ''The Left Bank'' (1931), a comedy dramatizing an expatriate's superficial attempt to escape from American materialism in [[Paris]], and ''Counsellor-at-Law'' (1931), a vigorous work that drew a realistic picture of the legal profession for which Rice had been trained. (The latter play is probably more frequently revived in regional theatres than any of Rice's other plays.) In that decade, he also wrote two novels and enjoyed a lucrative period in Hollywood, writing screenplays. His time in Hollywood was not without its friction, though, as he was looked upon by many studio heads as one of "those Eastern Reds."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McBride, ''Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1992), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Depression-inspired, anti-capitalist ''We, the People'' (1933) was a play particularly close to Rice's heart. It dealt with "the misfortunes of a typical skilled workman and his family, helplessly engulfed in the tide of national adversity," as its author described it. Rice engaged an activist-minded cast and noted set designer Aline Bernstein to design the fifteen different sets that the ambitious play called for. ''We, the People'' failed amid what Rice called "agitated" reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 328-329.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1932 trip to the [[Soviet Union]] and to Germany, where he heard [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] speak, provided material for Rice's next plays. The [[Reichstag fire trial]] is an element in ''Judgement Day'' (1934), and conflicting American and Soviet ideologies form the subject of the conversation-piece ''Between Two Worlds'' (1934).

[[File:Playwrights-Company-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Maxwell Anderson]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]] and Elmer Rice, four of the five founders of the [[Playwrights' Company]] (1938)]]
After the failure of these plays, Rice returned to Broadway in 1937 to write and direct for the [[Playwrights'  Company]], which he had helped to establish along with Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, and Robert E, Sherwood. Of his later plays, the most successful was the fantasy ''[[Dream Girl (play)|Dream Girl]]'' (1945) in which an over-imaginative girl encounters unexpected romance in reality. Rice's last play was ''Cue for Passion'' (1958), a modern psycho-analytical variation of the Hamlet theme in which [[Diana Wynyard]] played a Gertrude-like character. In his retirement, Rice was the author of a controversial book on American drama, ''The Living Theatre'' (1960), and of a richly detailed autobiography, ''Minority Report'' (1964).

Rice was one of the more politically outspoken dramatists of his time and took an active part in the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the Authors' League, the [[Dramatists Guild of America]] where he was elected as the eighth president in 1939, and P.E.N. He was the first director of the New York office of the [[Federal Theatre Project]], but resigned in 1936 to protest government censorship of the Project's "[[Living Newspaper]]" dramatization of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] invasion of [[Ethiopia]]. An outspoken defender of free speech, he left that position with a "blast of scorn" at the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration's efforts to control artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1932, Rice had reluctantly supported the [[Communist Party]] candidate in the presidential election because he found [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] and Roosevelt equally displeasing alternatives with an insufficient grasp of the crisis the country faced.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; though in subsequent elections he became an FDR supporter) He also spoke out against McCarthyism in the 1950s.

In the end, Elmer Rice did not believe he had been a success as a writer, not as he wished to define success.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; He needed to make a living and, while deriding the commercialism of the New York stage, he managed to earn a considerable amount of money, but at a cost to his more experimental vision. The realistic drama he could write with ease was at odds with the innovations that most intrigued him. ''The Adding Machine'' and ''Street Scene'' were anomalies and did not make money. An even more radical venture, ''The Sidewalks of New York'' of 1925, was an episodic play without words, "in which speech is indicated by gesture, by a series of situations in which there was no need for speech."&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre Guild turned the script down flat; Broadway would never be ready for the level of experimentation that inspired Rice, a reality that was a source of continuous frustration for him.

===Personal life===
Rice was married in 1915 to Hazel Levy and had two children with her, Margaret and Robert. After his divorce in 1942, he married actress [[Betty Field]] with whom he had three children, John, Judy and Paul, before their divorce in 1956.

Though born into a working-class family with no interest in the arts and known primarily for his attachment to theater and politics, Rice was also passionate about Old Master and modern art. His own art collection, slowly assembled over the years, included works by Picasso, Braque, Rouault, Leger, Derain, Klee, and Modigliani.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 267, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly frequented New York's museums and in his autobiography wrote of his first trip to Spain and the powerful impact Velazquez had on him and, in Mexico, of enjoying the work of Diego Rivera and the Mexican Muralists, artists who shared his political bent.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 331-332.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was close friends with Japanese-American modernist painter [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;Rice, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmer Rice lived for many years on a wooded estate in Stamford, Connecticut, until his death in [[Southampton]], England, in 1967 of pneumonia after suffering a heart attack. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jta.org/1967/05/10/archive/elmer-rice-noted-american-jewish-playwright-dies-in-london-was-74&lt;/ref&gt; Obituaries took note of a long and respected theater career. Brooks Atkinson described Rice in his history of Broadway as "a plain, rather sober man with a reticent, unyielding personality.... But when a social principle was at stake, he was more clear-headed than most people, and he was quietly invincible.... He was one of Broadway's most eminent citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, pp. 274. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archive ==
Elmer Rice's papers were placed at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1968, a year after his death. Additions have been made by family members over the years. The collection spans over 100 boxes and includes contracts, correspondence, manuscript drafts, notebooks, photographs, royalty statements, scripts, theater programs, and over seventy-three scrapbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00656|title=Elmer Rice: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|others=Anderson, Maxwell, 1888-1959., Behrman, S.

'''Hesychius of Miletus''' ({{lang-el|Ήσύχιος ο Μιλήσιος|translit=Hesychios o Milesios}}), [[Greece|Greek]] chronicler and biographer, surnamed '''Illustrius''', son of an advocate, flourished at [[Constantinople]] in the 6th century AD during the reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]].

According to [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (cod. 69) he was the author of three important works:

#A ''Compendium of [[Universal History]]'' in six books, from Belus, the reputed founder of the [[Assyria]]n empire, to [[Roman Emperor Anastasius I|Anastasius I]] (d. 518). A considerable fragment has been preserved from the sixth book, a history of Byzantium from its earliest beginnings till the time of [[Constantine the Great]].
#A ''Biographical Dictionary of Learned Men'', arranged according to classes (poets, philosophers), the chief sources of which were the works of [[Aelius Dionysius]] and of [[Herennius Philo]]. Much of it has been incorporated in the ''[[Suda]]'', as we learn from that book. It is disputed, however, whether the words in the ''Suda'' ("of which this book is an epitome") mean that ''Suda'''s compiler himself epitomized the work of Hesychius, or whether they are part of the title of an already epitomized Hesychius used in the compilation of the ''Suda''. The second view is more generally held. The epitome referred to, in which alphabetical order was substituted for arrangement in classes and some articles on Christian writers added as a concession to the times, is assigned from internal indications to the years 829-837. Both it and the original work are [[Lost works| lost]], with the exception of the excerpts in Photius and the ''Suda''. A smaller compilation, chiefly from [[Diogenes Laertius|Diogenes Laërtius]] and the ''Suda'', with a similar title, is the work of an unknown author of the 11th or 12th century.
#A ''History of the Reign of [[Justin I]]'' (518–527) and the early years of Justinian, completely [[Lost works| lost]].
In 1663 [[Gilles Ménage]] published an anonymous ''Vita Aristotelis'' that is commonly attributed to Hesychius.

Photius praises the style of Hesychius, and credits him with being a veracious historian.

== Velvet Revolution ==
{{main|Velvet Revolution}}

===Background===
[[File:Czechoslovakia.png|thumb|Czechoslovakia in 1969-1990]]
Although in March 1987 [[Gustáv Husák]] nominally committed [[Czechoslovakia]] to follow the program of ''[[perestroika]]'', he nevertheless cautioned the party in October 1987 not to "hasten solutions too quickly" so as to "minimize the risks that could occur." (December 1, 1987)

On December 17, 1987, Husák, who was one month away from his seventieth birthday, had resigned as head of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSC). He retained, however, his post of president of Czechoslovakia and his full membership on the Presidium of the KSC. Husák's resignation was caused by failing health and by increasing ambitions of the party members [[Miloš Jakeš]], [[Ladislav Adamec]] and Vasil Biľak, which became apparent since the spring of 1987.  Miloš Jakeš, who replaced Husák as first secretary of the KSC, was sixty-five years of age at the time of his assumption of the most powerful post in the country. Other than the age difference and the fact that Jakeš is a Czech whereas Husák is a Slovak, there was little to distinguish the new leader from his predecessor. In his first pronouncements as the head of the KSC, Jakes assured the KSC's Central Committee that he would continue the cautious and moderate path of reform set forth by Husák. He called for a large-scale introduction of new technology as the means to "fundamentally increase the efficiency of the Czechoslovak economy." But he also warned that there would be no "retreat from the fundamental principles of socialism," adding that the party had learned well the "lesson from 1968-69 and know[s] where such a retreat leads." At the same time, Jakeš acknowledged Soviet pressure for reform by pledging to pursue economic restructuring, stating that "just as Soviet Communists, we too must observe the principle that more democracy means more socialism." 

The Czechoslovak version of ''perestroika'', which had slowly taken shape during the last months of Husák's rule under the guidance of the reformist and pro-[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] Czechoslovak leader Premier [[Lubomir Strougal]], called for a modest decentralization of state economic administration but postponed any concrete action until the end of the decade. The slow pace of the Czechoslovak reform movement was an irritant to the Soviet leadership. Economically, however, it was surely partly because on the one hand there were no serious economic problems at the standard-of-living level in Czechoslovakia as opposed to e.g. [[Poland]], the Soviet Union and [[Hungary]], and on the other hand the catastrophic initial effects of the reforms in the Soviet Union and Hungary could already be seen in the late 1980s. A corroboration of this might be the fact that Gustáv Husák, before his resignation in 1989 (see [[Velvet Revolution]]), told to the newly appointed anti-Communist government they can expect very difficult years to come. The dissatisfaction of many ordinary Czechs and Slovaks was increasing, due to the rigid political situation, lack of freedom, but mainly because they could see on foreign TV channels in some regions (West German in frontier [[Bohemia]], Austrian in southwestern Slovakia (including the capital [[Bratislava]])), and in the late 1980s in all regions due to a gradual spread of videorecorders, the way of living in Western Europe and in the USA. 

In December 1987, some 500,000 Catholics of Czechoslovakia signed a petition for religious freedom. It was the biggest petition of the opposition forces in central Europe. 

The first anti-Communist demonstration took place on March 25, 1988 &amp;ndash; the [[Candle demonstration in Bratislava|Candle demonstration]]. An unauthorized peaceful gathering of some 2,000 (other sources 10,000) Catholics in the Slovak capital Bratislava, organized by the Slovak Catholic dissent and demanding religious freedom and civic rights, was violently dispersed by the police force. Some 100 participants were arrested. Leading Communist functionaries (e.g., the Slovak prime minister, minister of the interior, minister of culture) were observing the whole operation from the windows of a nearby hotel (Carlton). 

Demonstrations also occurred on October 28, 1988 (the anniversary of the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918) in [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]] and some other towns. The establishment of the "capitalist" Czechoslovakia on October 28 only became a public holiday in September 1988 in the Communist Czechoslovakia. Further demonstrations followed in January 1989 (death of [[Jan Palach]] on January 16, 1969), on August 21, 1989 (Soviet intervention in 1968), and on October 28, 1989 (see above).

===The Revolution===
The anti-Communist revolution started on November 16, 1989, in Bratislava, with a demonstration of Slovak university students for democracy, and continued with the well-known similar demonstration of Czech students in Prague on November 17.

== Following the Velvet Revolution ==
{{see also|History of Czechoslovakia#Democratic Czechoslovakia (1989–1992)}}
A coalition government, in which the Communist Party had a minority of ministerial positions, was formed in December 1989. The first free elections in Czechoslovakia since 1946 took place in June 1990 without incident and with more than 95% of the population voting. As anticipated, Civic Forum and Public Against Violence won landslide victories in their respective republics and gained a comfortable majority in the federal parliament. The parliament undertook substantial steps toward securing the democratic evolution of Czechoslovakia. It successfully moved toward fair local elections in November 1990, ensuring fundamental change at the county and town level.

Civic Forum found, however, that although it had successfully completed its primary objective—the overthrow of the communist regime—it was ineffectual as a governing party. The demise of Civic Forum was viewed by most as necessary and inevitable.

By the end of 1990, unofficial parliamentary "clubs" had evolved with distinct political agendas. Most influential was the Civic Democratic Party, headed by [[Václav Klaus]]. Other notable parties that came into being after the split were the Czech Social Democratic Party, Civic Movement, and Civic Democratic Alliance.

== Dissolution of Czechoslovakia ==
{{main|Dissolution of Czechoslovakia}}
On November 25, 1992, Czechoslovakia's parliament (the [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Federal Assembly]]) voted to split the country into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] starting on January 1, 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22252">[[File:Camera obscura.jpg|thumb|A diagram of the [[camera obscura]] from 1772.  According to the Hockney–Falco thesis, such devices were central to much of the great art from the [[Renaissance]] period to the dawn of [[modern art]].]]

The '''Hockney–Falco thesis''' is a theory of [[art history]], advanced by artist [[David Hockney]] and physicist [[Charles M. Falco]]. Both claimed that advances in [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] and accuracy in the history of Western art since the [[Renaissance]] were primarily the result of [[optical instrument]]s such as the [[camera obscura]], [[camera lucida]], and [[curved mirror]]s, rather than solely due to the development of [[artist]]ic technique and skill. Nineteenth-century artists' use of photography had been well documented.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Aaron Scharf]]'s 1968 book ''Art and Photography'' (Allen Lane, The Penguin Press), referred to by Hockney in his 1977 painting ''My Parents'' (Tate, London) in which his father attentively reads the volume. Scharf notes in his introduction (p.1); 'In 1568 Daniele Barbaro, the Venetian writer on architecture, recommended the camera Obscura as an aid to artists: "By holding the paper steady you can trace the whole perspective outline with a pen, shade it, and delicately colour it from nature."'&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 book, ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', Hockney analyzed the work of the [[Old Masters]] and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by "eyeballing it".  Since then, Hockney and Falco have produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of optical aids, and the historical plausibility of such methods. The hypothesis led to a variety of conferences and heated discussions.

==Setup of the 2001 publication==
Part of Hockney's work involved collaboration with Charles Falco, a [[condensed matter physics|condensed matter physicist]] and an expert in [[optics]].  While the use of optical aids would generally enhance accuracy, Falco calculated the types of [[distortion]] that would result from specific optical devices; Hockney and Falco argued that such errors could in fact be found in the work of some of the Old Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Falco, [http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/FAQ.html FAQ] (accessed March 16, 2007). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220210253/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/FAQ.html |date=February 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

Hockney's book prompted intense and sustained debate among artists, art historians, and a wide variety of other scholars.  In particular, it has spurred increased interest in the actual methods and techniques of artists among scientists and [[history of science|historians of science]], as well as general historians and [[art historian]]s.  The latter have in general reacted unfavorably, interpreting the Hockney–Falco thesis as an accusation that the Old Masters "cheated" and intentionally obscured their methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupré|2005|pp=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicist David G. Stork and several co-authors have argued against the Hockney–Falco thesis from a technical standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Criminisi |first2=David G. |last2=Stork |chapter=Did the great masters use optical projections while painting?

Tyler, "Rosetta Stoned?" [http://www.diatrope.com/hockney.html Diatrope.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hockney and Falco's theory has already inspired an increase in research regarding the use of optics throughout the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punk Playthings: Provocations for 21st Century Game Makers|last=Taylor|first=Sean|last2=Lowthorpe|first2=Chris|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=9781315350035|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there was the case of the decade-long research on [[Rembrandt]]'s works conducted by painter Francis O'Neill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Neill|first=Francis|last2=Palazzo-Corner|first2=Sofia|date=August 2016|title=Rembrandt’s self-portraits|url=|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the published paper he wrote with Sofia Palazzo Corner entitled, ''Rembrandt's Self-portraits'', O'Neill presented recurring themes in the painter's works that serve as evidence in his use of mirrors, particularly, in his self-portraits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/science/rembrandt-old-master-optics-mirrors.html|title=The Mirrors Behind Rembrandt’s Self-Portraits|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=July 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the use of [[chiaroscuro]], which is a signature of the lighting conditions necessary for projections as well as Rembrandt's off-center gaze in his self-portraits, which - according to O'Neill - indicated that the artist might have been looking at a projection surface off to the side rather than straight onto a flat mirror.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origins of the thesis==
As described in ''Secret Knowledge'', in January 1999 during a visit to the [[National Gallery, London]], Hockney conceived of the idea that optical aids were the key factor in the development of artistic realism.  He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and became convinced that Ingres had used a [[camera lucida]] or similar device.  From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of optical aids in earlier paintings, creating what he called the ''Great Wall'' in his studio  by organizing images of great realistic art by time period.  What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney–Falco thesis.&lt;ref name=svensixseven&gt;{{harvnb|Dupré|2005|pp=126–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Falco and Hockney published an analysis ("Optical Insights into Renaissance Art") of the likely use of concave mirrors in Jan van Eyck's work in ''Optics &amp; Photonics News'', vol. 11.  In 2001, Hockney published an extended form of his argument in ''Secret Knowledge''.

The hypothesis that technology was used in the production of Renaissance Art was not much in dispute in early studies and literature.&lt;ref name=id&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Don Ihde |first=Don |last=Ihde |chapter=Art Precedes Science: or Did the Camera Obscura Invent Modern Science? |editor-first=Helmar |editor-last=Schramm |editor2-first=Ludger |editor2-last=Schwarte |editor3-first=Jan |editor3-last=Lazardzig |title=Instruments in Art and Science: On the Architectonics of Cultural Boundaries in the 17th Century |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP-FNOpBCGUC&amp;pg=PA383 |year=2008 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-020240-3 |pages=384–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1929 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] contained an extensive article on the [[camera obscura]] and cited [[Leon Battista Alberti]] as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; The discussion started by the Hockney–Falco thesis ignored the abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices, at least in the Renaissance, and, e.g., [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref name=delft/&gt;

==Hockney's argument==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 008.jpg|thumb|Detail of the chandelier and mirror from Van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', one of Hockney's key examples]]
In ''Secret Knowledge'', Hockney argues that early [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance artists]] such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Lorenzo Lotto]] used concave mirrors; as evidence, he points to the chandelier in Van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', the ear in Van Eyck's [[portrait of Cardinal Albergati]], and the carpet in Lotto's ''Husband and Wife''.  Hockney suggests that later artists, beginning with [[Caravaggio]], used [[convex mirrors]] as well, to achieve a large field of view.

''Secret Knowledge'' recounts Hockney's search for evidence of optical aids in the work of earlier artists, including the assembly of a "Great Wall" of the [[history of Western art]].  The 15th century work of Jan van Eyck seems to be the turning point, he argues, after which elements of realism became increasingly prominent.  He correlates shifts toward increased realism with advances in optical technologies.  The argument of ''Secret Knowledge'' is primarily a visual one, as Hockney was largely unable to determine when and how optical aids were used by textual or direct evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jane |last=Partner |title=Review: David Hockney: Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |journal=Cambridge Quarterly |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=345–9 |year=2002 |doi=10.1093/camqtly/31.4.345 |url=http://camqtly.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/345.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falco and Ibn al-Haytham==
At a scientific conference in February 2007, Falco further argued that the Arabic physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]]'s (965–1040) work on [[optics]], in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', may have influenced the use of optical aids by Renaissance artists. Falco said that his and Hockney's examples of Renaissance art "demonstrate a continuum in the use of optics by artists from c. 1430, arguably initiated as a result of Ibn al-Haytham's influence, until today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles M. Falco |last=Falco |first=Charles M. |chapter=Ibn al-Haytham and the Origins of Modern Image Analysis |chapterurl=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4555635 |title=9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Applications, 2007. ISSPA 2007 |publisher=IEEE |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4244-0778-1 |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1109/ISSPA.2007.4555635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Artist's skill===
Art historians and others have criticized Hockney's argument on the grounds that the use of optical aids, though well-established in individual cases, has little value for explaining the overall development of Western art, and that historical records and paintings and photographs of art studios (sans optical devices), as well as present-day realist artists, demonstrate that high levels of realism are possible without optical aids.&lt;ref name=svensixseven/&gt;

===Optical distortion===
In addition to incredulity on the part of art historians and critics of modern art, some of the harshest criticism of the Hockney–Falco thesis came from another expert in optics, image processing and pattern recognition, David G. Stork.  Stork analyzed the images used by Falco and Hockney, and came to the conclusion that they do not demonstrate the kinds of optical distortion that curved mirrors or converging lenses would cause.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Stork, [http://www.diatrope.com/stork/FAQs.html FAQ] (accessed March 16, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Falco has claimed that Stork's published criticisms have relied on fabricated data and misrepresentations of Hockney and Falco's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rex |last=Dalton |title=Tempers blaze over artistic integrity |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7081 |page=134 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/440134a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7081/full/440134a.html |pmid=16525432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stork has rebutted this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David G. |last=Stork |first2=Marco |last2=Duarte |title=Revisiting computer vision and art |journal=IEEE Multimedia |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=108–9 |year=2007 |doi=10.1109/MMUL.2007.62 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4287425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance optics===
Critics of the Hockney–Falco theory claim that the quality of mirrors and optical glass for the period before 1550 and a lack of textual evidence (excluding paintings themselves as "documentary evidence") of their use for image projection during this period casts doubt on the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics|last=Smith|first=Mark|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=9780226174761|location=Chicago|pages=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are more inclined to agree about the possible relevance of the thesis between 1550 and the invention of the telescope, and cautiously supportive after that period, when there clearly was interest and capacity to project realistic images; 17th century painters such as [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Gaspar van Wittel]] used optical devices in a variety of ways, though not the ways postulated by Hockney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sven |last=Dupré |title=Introduction. The Hockney–Falco Thesis: Constraints and Opportunities |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |year=2005 |doi=10.1163/1573382054088141 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573382054088141 |jstor=4130307 |ref=harv}} pp. 128–135; quotation from p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving the technical optical arguments aside, historians of science investigated several aspects of the historical plausibility of the thesis in a 2005 set of articles in ''Early Science and Medicine''.  In his introduction to the volume, Sven Dupré claimed the Hockney–Falco analysis rests heavily on a small number of examples, "a few dozen square centimeters" of canvas that seem to show signs that optical devices were used.&lt;ref name=svensixseven/&gt;

===Image projection===
&lt;!--One critic{{Who|date=October 2014}} argued that the optical ideas of opticians at the time were somewhat incompatible with image projection, though artists might have been more receptive.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}  Two other scholars{{Who|date=October 2014}} showed that Renaissance painting treatises and Leonardo's manuscripts also lack any reference to image projection.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}} However, his--&gt;Leonardo's notebooks include several designs for creating concave mirrors&lt;!--, even if this alone is not evidence of their use for image projection--&gt;. Leonardo also describes a [[camera obscura]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' of 1478–1519.

The camera obscura was well known for centuries and documented by [[Ibn al-Haitham]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' of 1011–1021. In 13th-century England [[Roger Bacon]] described the use of a camera obscura for the safe observation of [[solar eclipses]], exactly because the viewer looks at the projected image and not the sun itself.

David Lindberg's ''A Catalogue of Medieval and Renaissance Optical Manuscripts'' (Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974) lists 61 manuscripts written in the years 1000–1425. These manuscripts not only describe methods for making mirrors and parabolic mirrors but also discuss their use for image projection.

===Optical glass===
Sara J. Schechner claimed that surviving glassware from the 15th and 16th centuries is far too imperfect to have been used to create realistic images, while "even thinking about projecting images was alien to the contemporary conceptual frame of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sara J. |last=Schechner |title=Between Knowing and Doing: Mirrors and their Imperfections in the Renaissance |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=137–162 |year=2005 |doi=10.1163/1573382054088187 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573382054088187 |jstor=4130308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vincent Ilardi, a historian of Renaissance optical glass, subsequently argued against Schechner's conclusions based on surviving glassware, suggesting that the present condition of Renaissance glassware is not likely to reflect the optical quality of such glassware when it was new.  Ilardi documents [[Lorenzo Lotto]]'s purchase of a high-priced crystal mirror in 1549, bolstering the Hockney–Falco thesis in Lotto's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vincent |last=Ilardi |title=Renaissance Vision, From Spectacles to Telescopes |series=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=2007 |isbn=0-87169-259-7 |pages=197–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, even normal eyeglasses (spectacles) can also project images of sufficient optical quality to support the Hockney–Falco thesis and such eyeglasses, along with magnifying glasses and mirrors, were not only available at the time, but actually pictured in 14th century paintings by artists such as [[Tommaso da Modena]].

Dutch draper and pioneering microbiologist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723), a contemporary of artist Vermeer (and an executor for Vermeer when he died in 1675) in Delft was known to have exceptional lens making skills, having created single small lenses capable of 200x magnification, far exceeding those of more complex compound microscopes of the period. Indeed, his feats of lens making were not matched for a considerable time as he kept aspects of their construction secret; in the 1950s, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing to recreate Leeuwenhoek design microscopes.  It was long believed that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a master lens grinder (a notion repeated in the recent BBC television documentary "Cell"). However, it is now believed{{By whom|date=October 2014}} that he came upon a relatively simple method of making small, high quality glass spheres by heating and manipulating a small rod of soda lime glass.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

===Metal mirrors===
On his website, Falco also claims Schechner overlooked manuscript evidence for the use of mirrors made from steel and other metals, as well as numerous metal artifacts that belie the claim that sufficiently large and reflective metal mirrors were unavailable, and that other contributors to the ''Early Science and Medicine'' volume relied on Schechner's mistaken work in dismissing the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Charles Falco|title=Objections |url=http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/faq.html#Objections |accessdate=April 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625201014/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/faq.html#Objections |archivedate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier evidence of the use of optical tools==
[[File:Annunciation_-_Virgin_and_Angel_-_Jan_van_Eyck_-_1434_-_NG_Wash_DC.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' (van Eyck, Washington)]] with three crown glass windows behind Mary]]
[[File:The_Arnolfini_Portrait,_détail_(2).jpg|thumb|Mirror depicted in the 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'']]
[[Don Ihde]] called the hypothesis being 'hyped' and referred to clear evidence about the use of optical tools by, e.g., [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and others. As well the 1929 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref name=id/&gt; contains an extensive article on the [[camera obscura]] and cites [[Leon Battista Alberti]] as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; Ihde states abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices at least in the Renaissance and e.g. in [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref name=delft/&gt; [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 painting ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' shows a convex mirror in the centre of the painting. Van Eyck also left his signature above this mirror,&lt;ref name=delft&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert D. |last=Huerta |title=Giants of Delft: Johannes Vermeer and the Natural Philosophers : the Parallel Search for Knowledge During the Age of Discovery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIelMWzUR6gC |year=2003 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |isbn=978-0-8387-5538-9}} the book mentions various (previous) studies stating a broad use of technology in the Renaissance and does not refer to the hypothesis and the hype around it at all&lt;/ref&gt; showing the importance of the tool. The painting includes a [[Crown glass (window)|crown glass window]] in the upper left side, a rather expensive luxury at the time.

An '''independent scientist''' (modern gender-neutral term historically also known as '''gentleman scientist''') is a [[private income|financially independent]] [[scientist]] who pursues [[science|scientific study]] without direct affiliation to a public institution such as a university or government-run [[research and development]] body. The expression "gentleman scientist" arose in post-[[Renaissance]] [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Segen (1992). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FbSlyyshjOoC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=dictionary+%22gentleman+scientist%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=juVfcRDdrx&amp;sig=8VsuQLxjLd0kks-vQphH0W5ffOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Dictionary of Modern Medicine]''. p. 246. {{ISBN|1-85070-321-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became less common in the 20th century as government and private funding increased.

Most independent scientists have at some point in their career been affiliated with some academic institution, such as [[Charles Darwin]], who was affiliated with the [[Geological Society of London]].  

==History==
Self-funded scientists practiced more commonly [[History of science policy#Self-funded science|from the Renaissance until the late 19th century]], including the [[Victorian era]], especially in [[England]], before large-scale government and corporate funding was available.  Many early fellows of the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]] were independent scientists.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Self-funding has the disadvantage that funds may be more restricted; however, it has the advantage of eliminating a number of inconveniences such as teaching obligations, administrative duties, and writing [[Grant (money)|grant]] requests to funding bodies. It also permits the scientist to have greater control over research directions, as funding bodies direct grants towards interests that may not coincide with that of the scientist. Furthermore, [[intellectual property]] of the inventions belongs to the inventor and not the employer.

Modern science requires competence and may require access to scientific equipment. However, independent scientists may have past careers as funded scientists, cooperate with funded colleagues, obtain partial equipment-only grants or choose directions where the most expensive resource required is the researcher's time. If the research succeeds, independent scientists may publish results in the same peer-reviewed journals as funded scientists do.

Scientists may choose to work on unusual projects with high risk of failure also when the grant system does not fund them. A scientist could be attributed the status of independent scientist if they work on such projects during a gap between two academic positions, for example.

==Modern-day independent scientists==
Modern-day independent scientists who fund their own research on an independent basis include, for example, [[Stephen Wolfram]] who funds his research through the sale of [[Mathematica]] software, [[Julian Barbour]], [[Aubrey de Grey]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Susan Blackmore]]&lt;ref name="Blackmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Blackmore |authorlink=Susan Blackmore|date=Oct 24, 2008 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science |title=Solo Science: Tinkering Outside The Tower |publisher=More Intelligent Life |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref name="Blackmore"/&gt; and [[John Wilkinson (scientist)|John Wilkinson]] who funds his research on "molecular synergism in nature" by running a regulatory scientific consultancy in natural products.

Peter Rich said of [[Peter D. Mitchell]]: "I think he would have found it difficult to have gotten funding because his ideas were rather radical."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cohen (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell went on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1978. Chemist [[Luis Leloir]] funded the research institute he headed, the [[Leloir Institute|Institute for Biochemical Research]], in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Prizes in Chemistry |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are today several [[wikt:virtual|virtual]] research institutes for independent scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dance|first=Amber|date=2017-03-30|title=Flexible working: Solo scientist|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7647/full/nj7647-747a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7647|pages=747–749|doi=10.1038/nj7647-747a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indigetes''' (Latin: ''indigetes'' or ''indigetae'' or ''Indiketes'') were an ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] (Pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the eastern side of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to have spoken the [[Iberian language]].

They occupied the far north east area of the Iberian Peninsula known as [[Hispania Tarraconensis]],&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O59BAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |editor-first=William |editor-last=Smith |page=52 |publisher=Walton and Maberly |date=1857 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the gulf of [[Empúries]] and Rhoda, stretching up into the [[Pyrenees]] though the regions of [[Empordà]], [[Selva]] and perhaps as far as [[Gironès]], where the [[Ausetani]] could be found who were related ethnically.

They were divided into four tribes,&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; and the main towns they centered on were: ''Indika'' (only mentioned by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], still unidentified, but he was possibly referring to Empúries or [[Ullastret]]),&lt;ref&gt;Sanmartí, J. &amp; Santacana, J.

This district in the Gulf of Empúrias was known as ''Juncaris Campus''.

The Indigetes minted their own coins which bore the inscription ''undikesken'' in [[northeastern Iberian script]] that is interpreted in [[Iberian language]] as a self-reference to the ethnic name of that people: from the Indigetes or from those of ''undika''.

In 218 BC they were conquered by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] during the [[Roman conquest of Hispania]]. In 195 BC they rebelled; the [[consul]] [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]] quashed the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llndCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |title=The Roman Wars in Spain: The Military Confrontation with Guerrilla Warfare |first=Daniel |last=Varga |pages=51–52 |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books|Pen and Sword]] |date=2015 |isbn=9781473860957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main archaeological sites for the Indigetes are in [[Ullastret]] ([[Baix Empordà]]), [[Castell de la Fosca]] ([[Palamós]], Baix Empordà) and [[Puig Castellet]] ([[Lloret de Mar]], Selva).

'''Jean-Louis Flandrin''' (July 4, 1931 – August 8, 2001) was a [[France|French]] [[historian]]. His fields of study were family, sexuality, and, in particular, food.  He introduced new analytical methods and examined a range of sources including church [[penitentials]], cookbooks, and even traditional [[proverbs]] over a wide historical time-frame, from the [[Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]] to the [[20th century]].  At the time of his death, Flandrin was [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[Paris 8 University|University of Paris VIII]] and Head of Research at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des hautes études en sciences sociales]].&lt;ref name="Flandrin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flandrin|first=Jean-Louis|title=Arranging the Meal: A History of Table Service in France (California Studies in Food and Culture)|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=2007|isbn=978-0520238855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the twentieth century, there were three thousand people within the [[Kırklareli]] [[Jewish]] congregation. However during the [[1934 Thrace Pogroms]], most Jews fled the city. The [[synagogue]] of the city is still active and now there are only 5 Jewish residents in the city of [[Thrace]], including a [[rabbi]]. Most of the remaining population of these five Kırklareli are around the age of 80 or over. Rabbi Hayim Abravanel (85), his wife Victoria Abravanel (76) and Yasua Kaneti (80). The youngest members of the community are Penhas (58) and Rozi (50) Haleva. The [[Synagogue]] has been standing for 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowturkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=773371|title=Krklareli Sinagogu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milica Kacin Wohinz''' (née Brezigar, born 12 October 1930) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[historian]], renowned for her seminal study on the history of the [[Italianization|forceful Italianization]] of the [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)]] that took place between 1918 and 1943.&lt;ref name="MilicaKacinWohinz__80th_Anniversary__RTVSLO"&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/zapoved-marksisticnega-zgodovinopisja-a-kaj-to-sploh-je/222996 Commandment of marxist historiography, but what is this anyway?], MMC [[RTV Slovenija]], 7 February 2010, accessed 28 January 2013, archived by [[WebCite]] at [https://www.webcitation.org/6E0L35KDF www.webcitation.org/6E0L35KDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
She was born in the [[Slovene Littoral]] that was after [[World War I]] annexed by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and was at the age of twelve punished by the Italian Fascist regime for her father's resistance to Italianization by being expelled from school.&lt;ref name="MilicaKacinWohinz__80th_Anniversary__RTVSLO"/&gt; During World War II, she joined the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]], helping [[Slovene partisans]]. After [[World War II]] and the annexation of the [[Slovenian Littoral]] to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1947, she attended the Slovene-language high schools in [[Postojna]] and [[Ljubljana]]. 

In 1952, she enrolled to the [[University of Ljubljana]], where she studied history. She obtained her PhD in 1970 under the supervision of [[Vasilij Melik]]. Since 1959, she worked at the [[Institute of Contemporary History, Ljubljana|Institute of Contemporary History]] in Ljubljana. Between 1979 and 1983, she was head of the Institute.&lt;ref name="MilicaKacinWohinz__80th_Anniversary__RTVSLO"/&gt;

;Marxist pressures against her work
Because her research topic was the history of an ethnic minority and not the history of working class, her work was subjected to Marxist criticisms by Dušan Kermavner during Slovenia's socialist period.&lt;ref name="MilicaKacinWohinz__80th_Anniversary__RTVSLO"/&gt;

==Work==
Her works on Slovene and Croat anti-Fascist resistance against Italianization are considered pioneer. She was one of the first historians to engage in thorough research of the militant anti-Fascist organization [[TIGR]].

She was member of the joint [[Slovenian-Italian Cultural-Historical Commission]], established by the governments of the [[Republic of Slovenia]] and [[Republic of Italy]] in order to jointly publish the account of historical relationship between the two peoples from 1880 to 1954 based on historiographic examination of sources.&lt;ref name="MilicaKacinWohinz__80th_Anniversary__RTVSLO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm Report] by [[Slovenian-Italian Cultural-Historical Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muzio Febonio''' (13 July 1597 – 3 January 1663) was an [[Italy|Italian]] priest and historian, best known for his historical and agiographic works about [[Marsica]], the [[Abruzzo]] sub-region where he was born. In his writings he made extensive use of archive documents and historiographic and archaeological sources, showing a deep knowledge of them, although in a somewhat formal and pedantic style. However, his works represent a valuable source of information for later historians, even if their publication occurred with a lot of errors and delays, which partly explains the limited fame this author enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pignatti|1995|loc=vol. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
{{Verse translation|lang=it|Vedere all'intorno gran memorie antiche e vestigi di più lochi|Seeing around great ancient memories and vestiges of several places|attr1=Muzio Febonio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avezzano.terremarsicane.it/index.php?module=CMpro&amp;func=viewpage&amp;pageid=109|title=Muzio Febonio (Scheda biografica)|first=Vittoriano |last=Esposito|publisher=Terre Marsicane|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was born in [[Avezzano]], [[Abruzzo]]. He completed his studies in [[Rome]] where he obtained a PhD in law before taking up theological studies and an ecclesiastical career. Febonio came, in 1626, to obtain the office of apostolic protonotary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morelli|1998|pp=14–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the abbot of Saint Cesidius Church in [[Trasacco]] in 1631 and the property administrator of the [[Colonna family]] in [[Marsica]]. Here he began to devote himself to the historical and geographical studies of his own land since it was lacking in historical summaries and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buonocore|1998|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1648 Febonio settled first in [[Sulmona]], where he obtained the post of general vicar of the cathedral and then, in 1651, in [[L'Aquila]] for the same position. During the troubled stay in L'Aquila he received several accusations, later totally dropped, from the vicar of [[St. Cesidius and Rufinus Basilica|St. Cesidius' Chair]] in [[Trasacco]], including those of [[simony]] and murder. Misunderstandings and contrasts will arise with the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of L'Aquila|Aquilan bishop]], Spanish Francesco Tellio de Leon, elected in 1654, which will prove irremediable.

From 1660, after some years without posts when he devoted himself to scholarly studies with a greater commitment, he was partnered with the vicar of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Frosinone-Veroli-Ferentino#Diocese of Veroli|Diocese of Veroli]]. 

The first draft of the precious ''Historiae marsorum'' ({{lang-la|History of the Marsi}}) would date back just to 1660, however, the work, made of three books, was terminated between 1661 and 1662, and in all likelihood, after some months, the revision with the stylistic corrections suggested by historian [[Ferdinando Ughelli]], also considered by Febonio as a master of erudition. He will spend the last years of his life in his native town as general vicar of [[Diocese of Avezzano|Marsi diocese]], finally partnering with the vicar of [[Pescina]], where he died after a short disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terremarsicane.it/muzio-febonio/|title=Muzio Febonio|publisher=Terre Marsicane|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilcentro.gelocal.it/laquila/cronaca/2013/02/19/news/la-storia-dei-marsi-raccontata-da-febonio-1.6565548|title=La Storia dei Marsi raccontata da Febonio|first=Nino|last=Motta|publisher=Il Centro|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10391">'''Nerses Balients''', also '''Nerses Balienc''' ({{lang-hy|Ներսես Բալիենց}}) or '''Nerses Bagh'on''' ({{lang-hy|Ներսես Բաղոն}}), was a [[Christian]] [[Armenia]]n monk of the early 14th century. He is mainly known for writing a history of the Kingdom of [[Cilician Armenia]]. Though his works are regarded by modern scholars as a valuable source from the time period, they are also regarded as frequently unreliable.

==Life==
Nerses Balients had been converted to [[Catholicism]] by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].&lt;ref&gt;Mutafian, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the "United Brothers" (or "Unitarians") founded by the Dominican [[Barthelemy of Bologna]], bishop of [[Maragha]], which advocated a strict union of the Armenian Church with the Catholic Church. According to his writings, Nerses also used to call himself "Bishop of [[Urmia]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Armeniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Armenie'', p. 608&lt;/ref&gt;

He visited [[Pope Clement V]] in [[Avignon]] and authored and translated various works while there.

==Writings==
{{see also|Armeno-Mongol alliance}}
Nerses Balients is the author of a history of the kings of [[Cilician Armenia]], especially as regards their relations with the Mongols.

==Combination with Sempad==
Segments of the work of Nerses Balients have been inserted into [[Sempad the Constable|Sempad]]'s ''Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie'', a version of which was compiled by the modern historian Edouard Dulaurier, who added information from Nerses Balients to expand on the period after Sempad's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Arméniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie'', [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-51557&amp;M=imageseule Original]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{see also|Mongol raids into Palestine}}
One challenged passage&lt;ref&gt;Reuven-Amitai, "Mongol Raids into Palestine"&lt;/ref&gt; in this work is where Nerses wrote that the Armenian King [[Hetoum II of Armenia|Hetoum II]], during his 1299 offensives in [[Syria]] with the Mongols, went with a small force as far as the outskirts of [[Cairo]], and then spent some fifteen days in Jerusalem visiting the [[Holy Places]]:

{{quote|The king of Armenia, back from his raid against the Sultan, went to Jerusalem. He found that all the enemies had been put to flight or exterminated by the Tatars, who had arrived before him. As he entered into Jerusalem, he gathered the Christians, who had been hiding in caverns out of fright. During the 15 days he spent in Jerusalem, he held Christian ceremonies and solemn festivities in the Holy Sepulchre. He was greatly comforted by his visits to the places of the pilgrims. He was still in Jerusalem when he received a certificate from the Khan, bestowing him Jerusalem and the surrounding country. He then returned to join Ghazan in Damas, and spend the winter with him|[[Recueil des Historiens des Croisades]], Historiens Armeniens I, p.660&lt;ref&gt;[http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-51557&amp;M=imageseule Historiens Armeniens, p.660]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some historians considered Nerses Balient's statement as an indication that Mongols may have conquered, or at least been present in, Jerusalem in 1299. [[Claude Mutafian]], in ''Le Royaume Arménien de Cilicie'' mentions the writings and the 14th century Armenian Dominican which claim that the Armenian king visited Jerusalem as it was temporarily removed from Muslim rule.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Mutafian, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Demurger]], in ''Jacques de Molay'', mentions the possibility that the Mongols may have occupied Jerusalem, quoting an Armenian tradition describing that Hethoum celebrated mass in Jerusalem in January 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as Dr. Sylvia Schein, have regarded this statement as an indication that Mongols may have been present in Jerusalem in 1299. In her 1991 book, Schein wrote that the Armenian information about Hetoum's visit was confirmed by Arab chroniclers.&lt;ref&gt;Schein, ''Fidelis Crucis'', p. 163.  "According to an Armenian source confirmed by Arab chroniclers, Hetoum II with a small force reached the outskirts of Cairo and then spent some fifteen days in Jerusalem visiting the Holy Places.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other historians have strongly criticized Nerses Balienc's statement, and Schein's interpretation. Dr. Angus Donal Stewart in his 2001 book ''The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks'', called the statement by Nerses Balienc an "absurd claim" from an unreliable source, and said that the Arab chroniclers did not confirm it in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 14. "At one point, 'Arab chroniclers' are cited as being in support of an absurd claim made by a later Armenian source, but on inspection of the citations, they do no such thing." Also Footnote #55, where Stewart further criticizes Schein's work: "The Armenian source cited is the ''[[RHC Arm. I]]'' version of the 'Chronicle of the Kingdom', but this passage was in fact inserted into the translation of the chronicle by its editor, Dulaurier, and originates in the (unreliable) work of Nerses Balienc... The "Arab chroniclers" cited are Mufaddal (actually a Copt; the edition of Blochet), al-Maqrizi (Quatremere's translation) and al-Nuwayrf. None of these sources confirm Nerses' story in any way; in fact, as is not made clear in the relevant [Schein] footnote, it is not the text of al-Nuwayrf that is cited, but D. P. Little's discussion of the writer in his ''Introduction to Mamluk Historiography'' (Montreal, 1970; 24-27), and in that there is absolutely no mention made of any Armenian involvement at all in the events of the year. It is disappointing to find such a cavalier attitude to the Arabic source material."&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, Reuven Amitai, also did a detailed comparison of all of the available primary sources about the events around the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazindar]], and concluded that the Armenian account was in error, as it did not match up with other similar sources about the same events, was provably full of exaggerations and inaccuracies, and had been written as to glorify the Armenian king Hetoum. Amitai also pointed out that despite  Schein's acceptance of the source as genuine, that even the original editor of the work, [[Edouard Dulaurier]], had denied the veracity of the Armenian account.&lt;ref&gt;''Mongol Raids'', p. 246. "A less charitable attitude can be taken towards the other Armenian source, written by the anonymous continuator of Constable Smpad's work. His account is full of exaggerations and inaccuracies, the first of which is the year given for the campaign (751 of the Armenian calendar which equals 5 Jan. 1302 - 4 Jan. 1303). This unknown writer does not even mention Mulay or the Mongols in the raid into Palestine. In their stead only King Het'um of Armenia is found: after the victory of Hims, the king rushed forward to pursue the fleeing sultan. He was joined by 4,000 of his troops. After eleven days of hard riding, Het'um arrived at a location near Cairo called Doli (which I cannot identify). Throughout the pursuit, the sultan was but 10-12 miles ahead of the king. The latter soon withdrew from Doli because he was afraid of being captured. On his return, Het'um entered Jerusalem and gathered all the Christians from the city who had hitherto hidden in caves. During the 15 days he spent in Jerusalem, Het'um performed magnificent Christian ceremonies and also received a patent from Ghazan granting him the city and its surroundings. Afterwards, Het'um left Jerusalem and rejoined Ghazan in Damascus, spending the rest of the winter with him. Even the editor of this work, Edouard Dulaurier, unequivocally denies the veracity of the account and writes that the author's purpose was to glorify King Het'um. There is little resemblance between the facts described here and the Mamluk works or even the account of the historian Het'um, who certainly cannot be accused of lacking a desire to eulogize the Armenian king. It is quite improbable that the Mamluk writers would have missed an opportunity to attack [the muslim] Ghazan for such a despicable action, i.e., abandoning Muslim territory, especially Jerusalem to Christian depredations."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Edouard Dulaurier actually writes that Nerses may have added a few fantastic details to exaggerate Hetoum's accomplishments somewhat, specifically disputing one instance in which Nerses claims that Hetoum went as far as [[Cairo]], when [[Ghazan]] himself is known to have sent 15,000 men only as far as [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Arméniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie'', p. 659-660 [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-51557&amp;M=imageseule Note 1, p. 659]:&lt;br&gt;"The account of the battle of Homs, in which [[Ghazan]] routs the Egyptians, on December 23, 1299, can be compared with that of Hayton, ''De Tartare'', cap. XLII, and the narration of M. [[d'Ohsson]], ''Hist. des Mongols'', liv. VI, Chap. vi, t. IV, p.233-240. It is obvious that Nerses Balients added here a few fantastic details, devised to enhance the role played by the king of Armenia Hetoum II, as an auxiliary of the Tartars. We can very certainly put in doubt the pursuing of the Egyptians by this prince, after the battle, as far as the place named Doli by the compiler, which he located near [[Cairo]]. Indeed, the Mongol general who had been dispatched with a body of 15,000 men to pursue Sultan Nacer, did not go farther than Gaza, and stopped at the desert limit between Syria and Egypt". End of the note.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nevada Test Site craters.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Subsidence crater]]s remaining after underground nuclear (test) explosions at the north end of the Yucca flat, [[Nevada]] test site]]

A '''nuclear bunker buster''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.261.7309&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as an '''earth-penetrating weapon''' ('''EPW'''), is the [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] equivalent of the conventional [[bunker buster]]. The non-nuclear component of the weapon is designed to penetrate [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]], or [[concrete]] to deliver a nuclear warhead to an underground target. These weapons would be used to destroy hardened, underground [[military]] [[bunker]]s or other below-ground facilities. An underground explosion releases a larger fraction of its energy into the ground, compared to a [[surface burst]] or [[air burst]] explosion at or above the surface, and so can destroy an underground target using a lower [[nuclear weapon yield|explosive yield]]. This in turn could lead to a reduced amount of [[radioactive]] [[nuclear fallout|fallout]]. However, it is unlikely that the explosion would be completely contained underground. As a result, significant amounts of rock and soil would be rendered radioactive and lofted as dust or vapor into the atmosphere, generating significant fallout.

== Base principle ==
While conventional bunker busters utilize several methods to penetrate concrete structures, these are for the purpose of destroying the structure directly, and are generally limited in how much of a bunker (or system of bunkers) they can destroy by depth and their relatively low explosive force (versus nuclear weapons).

The primary difference between conventional and nuclear bunker busters is that, while the conventional version is meant for one target, the nuclear version can destroy an entire underground bunker system.

The main principles in modern bunker design are largely centered around survivability in nuclear war. As a result of this both American and Soviet sites reached a state of "super hardening", involving defenses against the effects of a nuclear weapon such as spring- or counterweight-mounted (in the case of the R-36) control capsules and thick concrete walls (three to four feet for the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman ICBM]] launch control capsule) heavily reinforced with [[rebar]]. These systems were designed to survive a near miss of 20 megatons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Liquid-fueled missiles such as those historically used by Russia are more fragile and easily damaged than solid-fueled missiles such as those used by the United States. The complex fuel storage facilities and equipment needed to fuel missiles for launch and de-fuel them for frequent maintenance add additional weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Therefore, a similar degree of silo "hardening" does not automatically equate to a similar level of missile "survivability".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Major advancements in the accuracy and precision of nuclear and conventional weapons subsequent to the invention of the missile silo itself have also rendered many "hardening" technologies useless. With modern weapons capable of striking within feet of their intended targets, a modern "near miss" can be much more effective than a "hit" decades ago. A weapon need only cover the silo door with sufficient debris to prevent its immediate opening to render the missile inside useless for its intended mission of rapid strike or counter-strike deployment.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A nuclear bunker buster negates most of the countermeasures involved in the protection of underground bunkers by penetrating the defenses prior to detonating. A relatively low yield may be able to produce seismic forces beyond those of an air burst or even ground burst of a weapon with twice its yield.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Additionally, the weapon has the ability to impart more severe horizontal [[shock wave]]s than many bunker systems are designed to combat by detonating at or near the bunker's depth, rather than above it.

Geologic factors also play a major role in weapon effectiveness and facility survivability. Locating facilities in hard rock may appear to reduce the effectiveness of bunker-buster type weapons by decreasing penetration, but the hard rock also transmits shock forces to a far higher degree than softer soil types. The difficulties of drilling into and constructing facilities within hard rock also increase construction time and expense, as well as making it more likely construction will be discovered and new sites targeted by foreign militaries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Methods of operation ==

=== Penetration by explosive force ===
[[Concrete]] structure design has not changed significantly in the last 70 years. The majority of protected concrete structures in the U.S. military are derived from standards set forth in ''[[Fundamentals of Protective Design]]'', published in 1946 (US Army Corps of Engineers). Various augmentations, such as [[glass]], [[fiber]]s, and [[rebar]], have made concrete less vulnerable, but far from impenetrable.

When explosive force is applied to concrete, three major fracture regions are usually formed: the initial crater, a crushed aggregate surrounding the crater, and "scabbing" on the surface opposite the crater. Scabbing, also known as [[spall]]ing, is the violent separation of a mass of material from the opposite face of a plate or slab subjected to an impact or impulsive loading, without necessarily requiring that the barrier itself be penetrated.

While soil is a less dense material, it also does not transmit shock waves as well as concrete. So while a penetrator may actually travel further through soil, its effect may be lessened due to its inability to transmit shock to the target.

=== Hardened penetrator ===
[[File:Secant ogive.svg|thumb|A secant ogive]]
Further thinking on the subject envisions a hardened penetrator using kinetic energy to defeat the target's defenses and subsequently deliver a nuclear explosive to the buried target.

The primary difficulty facing the designers of such a penetrator is the tremendous heat applied to the penetrator unit when striking the shielding (surface) at hundreds of meters per second. This has partially been solved by using metals such as [[tungsten]] (the metal with the highest melting point), and altering the shape of the projectile (such as an [[ogive]]).

Altering the shape of the projectile to incorporate an [[ogive]] shape has yielded substantial improvement in penetration ability. [[Rocket sled]] testing at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] has demonstrated penetrations of 100 to {{convert|150|ft|m}} in concrete {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} when traveling at {{convert|4000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The reason for this is [[liquefaction]] of the concrete in the target, which tends to flow over the projectile. Variation in the speed of the penetrator can either cause it to be vaporized on impact (in the case of traveling too fast), or to not penetrate far enough (in the case of traveling too slowly). An approximation for the penetration depth is obtained with an [[Impact depth|impact depth formula]] derived by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]].

=== Combination penetrator-explosive munitions ===
Another school of thought on nuclear bunker busters is using a light penetrator to travel 15 to 30 meters through shielding, and detonate a nuclear charge there. Such an explosion would generate powerful shock waves, which would be transmitted very effectively through the solid material comprising the shielding (see "scabbing" above).

== Policy and criticism of fallout ==
The main criticisms of nuclear bunker busters regard fallout and nuclear proliferation. The purpose of an earth-penetrating nuclear bunker buster is to reduce the required yield needed to ensure the destruction of the target by coupling the explosion to the ground, yielding a shock wave similar to an earthquake. For example, the United States retired the [[B53 nuclear bomb|B-53 warhead]], with a yield of nine [[TNT equivalent|megatons]], because the [[B61 nuclear bomb|B-61 Mod 11]] could attack similar targets with much lower yield (400 [[kiloton]]s),{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} due to the latter's superior ground penetration. By burying itself into the ground before detonation, a much higher proportion of the explosion energy is transferred to [[seismic shock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/faspir/2001/v54n1/weapons.htm |title=Low-Yield Earth-Penetrating Nuclear Weapons By Robert W. Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to the [[surface burst]] produced from the B-53's [[laydown delivery]]. Moreover, the globally dispersed [[fallout]] of an underground B-61 Mod 11 would likely be less than that of a [[surface burst]] B-53. Supporters note that this is one of the reasons nuclear bunker busters should be developed. Critics claim that developing new nuclear weapons sends a proliferating message to non-nuclear powers, undermining non-proliferation efforts.

Critics also worry that the existence of lower-yield nuclear weapons for relatively limited tactical purposes will lower the threshold for their actual use, thus blurring the sharp line between conventional weapons intended for use and weapons of mass destruction intended only for hypothetical deterrence, and increasing the risk of escalation to higher-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.hsfk.de/index.php?id=9&amp;no_cache=1&amp;detail=3124&amp;no_cache=0&amp;cHash=0991198fec |title=Intervention und Kernwaffen – Zur neuen Nukleardoktrin der USA |accessdate=2008-02-15 |place=[[Germany|DE]] |first=Stephanie Sonius|last=Harald Müller |year=2006 |language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042934/http://www.hsfk.de/index.php?id=9&amp;no_cache=1&amp;detail=3124&amp;no_cache=0&amp;cHash=0991198fec |archivedate=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local fallout from any nuclear detonation is increased with proximity to the ground. While a megaton-class yield [[surface burst]] will inevitably throw up many tons of (newly) radioactive debris, which falls back to the earth as fallout, critics contend that despite their relatively minuscule explosive yield, nuclear bunker busters create more local fallout per kiloton yield.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Also, because of the subsurface detonation, radioactive debris may contaminate the local groundwater.

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] advocacy group points out that at the [[Nevada Test Site]], the depth required to contain fallout from an average-yield [[underground nuclear test]] was over 100 meters, depending upon the weapon's yield. They contend that it is improbable that penetrators could be made to burrow so deeply. With yields between 0.3 and 340 kilotons, they argue, it is unlikely the blast would be completely contained.

Another criticism is that bunkers can be built at greater depth to make them more difficult to reach. The target's vulnerability is then limited to openings like the ventilation system, which are susceptible to conventional explosives. Proponents of nuclear bunker busters respond that deeper bunkers entail higher costs, limiting the potential enemies who can withstand nuclear bunker busters.

Critics further state that the testing of new nuclear weapons would be prohibited by the proposed [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. Although Congress refused to ratify the CTBT in 1999, and therefore this treaty has no legal force in the US, the US has adhered to the spirit of the treaty by maintaining a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) |format=PDF |publisher=MIIS |url=http://cns.miis.edu/inventory/pdfs/ctbt.pdf |date=10 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025003946/http://cns.miis.edu/inventory/pdfs/ctbt.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents, however, contend that lower explosive yield devices and subsurface bursts would produce little to no climatic effects in the event of a nuclear war, in contrast to multi-megaton air and surface bursts (that is, if the [[nuclear winter]] hypothesis proves accurate). [[air burst|Lower fuzing heights]], which would result from partially buried warheads, would limit or completely obstruct the range of the burning [[Effects of nuclear explosions|thermal rays]] of a nuclear detonation, therefore limiting the target, and its surroundings, to a fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for subsurface bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11897 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114008/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11897 |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} ''A Nuclear Winter's Tale: Science and Politics in the 1980s'', Lawrence Badash, p.235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NUUrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=radioactive+fallout+particles+surface+volume&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=radioactive%20fallout%20particles%20surface%20volume&amp;f=false The Medical implications of nuclear war]

== Targets and the development of bunker busters ==
[[File:B-61 bomb.jpg|thumb|200px|[[B61 nuclear bomb]]]]
As early as 1944, the Barnes Wallis [[Tallboy bomb]] and subsequent [[Grand Slam bomb|Grand Slam]] weapons were designed to penetrate deeply fortified structures through sheer explosive power. These were not designed to directly penetrate defences, though they could do this (for example, the [[Valentin submarine pens]] had [[ferrous concrete]] roofs {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick which were penetrated by two Grand Slams on 27 March 1945), but rather to penetrate under the target and explode leaving a [[camouflet]] (cavern) which would undermine foundations of structures above, causing it to collapse, thus negating any possible hardening. The destruction of targets such as the [[V-3 cannon|V3 battery]] at [[Fortress of Mimoyecques|Mimoyecques]] was the first operational use of the Tallboy. One bored through a hillside and exploded in the [[Saumur]] rail tunnel about {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} below, completely blocking it, and showing that these weapons could destroy any hardened or deeply [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavated]] installation. Modern targeting techniques allied with multiple strikes could perform a similar task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| place = United Kingdom | publisher = Ministry of Defence | title = RAF Bomber Command Grand Slam raids | url = http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/bombercommandgrandslamraids.cfm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226053516/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/bombercommandgrandslamraids.cfm |archivedate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jul44.html | title = RAF Bomber Command Campaign Diary July 1944 | place = UK | contribution = July 1944 | at = (6 July "Mimoyecques V-Weapon Site" photograph shows clearly the camouflet effect) | publisher = Ministry of Defence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514061638/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jul44.html |archivedate=2005-05-14 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/bombercommandsaumurtunnel9thjune1944.cfm | title = RAF Bomber Command Saumur Tunnel Raid| contribution = Saumur | publisher = Ministry of Defence | place = UK |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226011740/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/bombercommandsaumurtunnel9thjune1944.cfm |archivedate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Development continued, with weapons such as the nuclear [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61]], and conventional thermobaric weapons and [[GBU-28]]. One of the more effective housings, the GBU-28 used its large mass ({{convert|2130|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and casing (constructed from barrels of surplus 203&amp;nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s) to penetrate {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of concrete, and more than {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} of earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = Rice | url = http://es.rice.edu/projects/Poli378/Gulf/gwtxt_ch6.html#GBU-28 | type = report to Congress | title = The Conduct of the Persian Gulf War | contribution = GBU-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202221842/http://es.rice.edu/projects/Poli378/Gulf/gwtxt_ch6.html#GBU-28 |archivedate=2007-02-02 |deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The B61 Mod 11, which first entered military service after the Cold war had ended, in January 1997, was specifically developed to allow for bunker penetration, and is speculated to have the ability to destroy hardened targets a few hundred feet beneath the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = USA weapons | publisher = Nuclear weapon archive | url = http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B61.html | contribution = The B61 (Mk-61) Bomb |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227003412/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B61.html |archivedate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While penetrations of {{convert|20|-|100|ft|m}} were sufficient for some shallow targets, both the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States were creating bunkers buried under huge volumes of soil or reinforced concrete in order to withstand the multi-megaton thermonuclear weapons developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Bunker penetration weapons were initially designed within this [[Cold War]] context. One likely Soviet Union/Russian target, [[Mount Yamantau]], was regarded in the 1990s by Maryland Republican congressman, [[Roscoe Bartlett]], as capable of surviving "half a dozen"(6) repeated nuclear strikes of an unspecified yield, one after the other in a "direct hole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://viewzone2.com/yamantaux.html |title=Yamantau Whats going on in the Yamantau mountain complex?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelivingmoon.com/45jack_files/03files/Yamantau_Mountain_Complex_Russia.html |title=Secret Bases Russia Yamantau Mountain Complex Beloretsk, Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian [[continuity of government]] facility at [[Kosvinsky Mountain]], finished in early 1996, was designed to resist US earth-penetrating warheads and serves a similar role as the American [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowonheartland.net/2012/02/russias-top-secret-bases.html |title=WINDOW ON HEARTLAND Geopolitical notes on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424050959/http://www.windowonheartland.net/2012/02/russias-top-secret-bases.html |archivedate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/1997/bmd970404a.htm  "Moscow builds bunkers against nuclear attack"], by [[Bill Gertz]], ''[[Washington Times]]'', 1 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the Kosvinsky completion date is regarded as one explanation for US interest in a new nuclear bunker buster and the declaration of the deployment of the [[B61 nuclear bomb|B-61]] mod 11 in 1997, Kosvinsky is protected by about 1000 feet of [[granite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/kosvinsky.htm |title=Global Security.org Kosvinsky Mountain, Kos'vinskiy Kamen', Gora, MT 59°31'00"N   59°04'00"E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapon was revisited{{dubious|date=May 2014}} after the Cold War during the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], and again during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. During the campaign in [[Tora Bora]] in particular, the United States believed that "vast underground complexes," deeply buried, were protecting opposing forces. Such complexes were not found. While a nuclear penetrator (the "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator", or "RNEP") was never built, the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] was allotted budget to develop it, and tests were conducted by the U.S. [[Air Force Research Laboratory]]. The RNEP was to use the 1.2 megaton [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]] physics package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencesecurity.livejournal.com/2003.html |title=RNEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent development (c. 2012) is the GBU-57 [[Massive Ordnance Penetrator]], a 30000-pound conventional gravity bomb. The USAF's B-2 Spirit bombers can each carry two such weapons.

==Russian spy interest==

[[File:Ottovonfreising.jpg|thumb|upright|Otto of Freising, as depicted on a medieval stained glass window in the Cistercian Abbey of Heiligenkreuz, Austria]]
'''Otto of Freising''' ({{lang-la|Otto Frisingensis}}; c. 1114 – 22 September 1158) was a [[German people|German]] churchman and chronicler. He was '''Otto I''' [[Bishop of Freising]] as from 1138.

==Life==
Otto was born in [[Klosterneuburg]] as the fifth son of [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria|Leopold III]], [[Rulers of Austria|margrave of Austria]], by his wife [[Agnes of Germany|Agnes]], daughter of the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. By her first husband, [[Frederick I, Duke of Swabia|Frederick I]] of [[Hohenstaufen]], [[duke of Swabia]], Agnes was the mother of the [[King of Germany|German king]] [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] and grandmother of the emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]. Otto's sister, [[Judith of Babenberg|Judith or Ita]], was married to Marquess [[William V of Montferrat]]. Otto was thus related to the most powerful families in Germany and northern Italy.

The records of his life are scanty and the dates somewhat uncertain. He studied in [[Paris]], where he took an especial interest in [[philosophy]]. He is said to have been one of the first to introduce the philosophy of [[Aristotle]] into Germany, and served as [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of a new foundation in [[Austria]].

Having entered the [[Cistercian]] order, Otto convinced his father to found [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in 1133, thus bringing literacy and sophisticated agriculture (including [[wine]] making) to the region that would become [[Vienna]]. He became abbot of the Cistercian monastery of [[Morimond Abbey|Morimond]] in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] about 1136, and soon afterwards was elected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|bishop of Freising]]. This diocese, and indeed the whole of [[Bavaria]], was then disturbed by the feud between the [[House of Welf|Welfs]] and the Hohenstaufen, and the church was in a deplorable condition; but a great improvement was brought about by the new bishop in both ecclesiastical and secular matters.

In 1147 Otto took part in the disastrous [[Second Crusade]]. The section of the crusading army led by the bishop was decimated, but Otto reached [[Jerusalem]] and returned to Bavaria in 1148 or 1149. He enjoyed the favour of Conrad's successor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], was probably instrumental in settling the dispute over the [[duchy of Bavaria]] in 1156, and was present at the famous [[diet of Besançon]] in 1157. Still retaining the [[Religious habit|habit]] of a Cistercian monk, he died at Morimond on 22 September 1158. In 1857 a statue of the bishop was erected at Freising.

==Works==
Otto is most remembered for two important historical works.

===''Chronica de duabus civitatibus''===
The first of these is his ''Chronica sive Historia de duabus civitatibus'' (''Chronicle or history of the two cities''), a historical and philosophical work in eight books, which follows to some extent the lines laid down by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. Written during the time of the civil war in Germany (1143–1145), it contrasts [[Jerusalem]] and [[Babylon|Babel]], the heavenly and the earthly kingdoms, and also contains much valuable information about the history of his own time. The chronicle, which was held in very high regard by contemporaries, covers the years up until 1146, and from this date until 1209 it was continued by Otto, abbot of [[St. Blaise's Abbey in the Black Forest|St Blasius]] (d. 1223). In the ''Chronica'', Otto reports a meeting he had with Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]], who told him of a [[Nestorian Christian]] king in the east named [[Prester John]]. It was hoped this monarch would bring relief to the crusader states. This is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].

===''Gesta Friderici Imperatoris''===
Better known is Otto's ''Gesta Friderici imperatoris'' (''Deeds of Emperor Frederick''), written at the request of Frederick I and prefaced by a letter from the emperor to the author. The ''Gesta'' comprises four books, the first two of which were written by Otto and the remaining two, or parts of them, by his pupil [[Ragewin]] or [[Rahewin]]. It has been argued that the third book and the early part of the fourth were also the work of Otto. Beginning with the quarrel between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], the first book takes the history down to the death of Conrad III in 1152. It is not confined to German affairs, as the author digresses to tell of the preaching of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], of his zeal against the heretics, and of the condemnation of [[Pierre Abélard]]; he also discourses on philosophy and theology. The second book opens with the election of Frederick I in 1152 and deals with the history of the first five years of his reign, especially in Italy, in some detail. From this point (1156) the work is continued by Ragewin. Otto's Latin is excellent, and in spite of a slight partiality for the [[Hohenstaufen]], and some minor inaccuracies, the ''Gesta'' has been described as a "model of historical composition."

'''Paolo Giovio''' (also spelled ''Paulo Jovio''; [[Latin]]: ''Paulus Jovius''; 19 April 1483&amp;nbsp;– 11 December 1552) was an [[Italy|Italian]] physician, historian, biographer, and prelate.

==Early life==
Little is known about Giovio's youth. He was a native of [[Como]]; his family was from the [[Isola Comacina]] of [[Lake Como]]. His father, a [[notary]], died around 1500. He was educated under the direction of his elder brother [[Benedetto Giovio|Benedetto]], a humanist and historian. Although interested in literature, he was sent to [[Padua]] to study medicine. He graduated in 1511.

==Career==
Giovio worked as physician in Como but, after the plague spread in that city he moved to [[Rome]], settling there in 1513. [[Pope Leo X]] assigned him a ''cathedra'' (chair) of [[Ethics|Moral Philosophy]] and, later, that of [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]] in the Roman university. He was also knighted by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08530b.htm|title=Paulus Jovius|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|last = Schlager|first = Patricius|volume = 8|location = New York|publisher = Robert Appleton Company|date = 12 July 2013|origyear = 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period he started to write historical essays. He wrote a [[memoir]] of Leo soon after his death.

In 1517 Giovio was appointed as the personal physician for Cardinal [[Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici]] (the future Pope Clement VII). In the field he wrote some treatises, like the ''De optima victus ratione'', in which he expresses his doubts about the current [[pharmacology]], and the need to improve prevention before the cure.

Giovio helped Clement VII during the 1527 [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]]. From 1526 to 1528, he stayed on the island of [[Ischia]] as [[Vittoria Colonna]]'s guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year = 1995|title = Paolo Giovio: The Historian and the Crisis of Sixteenth-Century Italy|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sXrVSfSMu9gC|last = Zimmerman|first = T. C. Price|publisher = Princeton University Press|isbn = 9781400821839|chapter = Ischia, 1527-1528|pages = 86–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1528, he became [[bishop of Nocera de' Pagani]]. Giovio wrote an account of [[Dmitry Gerasimov]]'s embassy to Clement VII, which related detailed geographical data on [[Muscovy]].

In 1536 Giovio had a [[villa]] built for him on Lake Como, which he called ''Museo'', and which he used for his collection of portraits of famous people. After Clement's death, he retired. As well as paintings, he sought antiquities, etc., and his collection was one of the first to include pieces from the [[New World]]. A set of copies of the paintings from the collection, now known as the [[Giovio Series]], is on display in the [[Uffizi Gallery]].

==Death==
In 1549 [[Pope Paul III]] denied Giovio the title of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Como|Bishop of Como]], and he moved to [[Florence]], where he died in 1552.

==Works==
[[image:Francesco da Sangallo, monumento al Vescovo Paolo Giovio (1560) 1.JPG|thumb|Monument to Paolo Giovo by [[Francesco da Sangallo]], in [[San Lorenzo di Firenze|San Lorenzo]] Basilica, [[Florence]]]]
Giovio is chiefly known as the author of a celebrated work of contemporary history, ''Historiarum sui temporis libri&amp;nbsp;XLV'', of a collection of lives of famous men, ''Vitae virorum illustrium'' (1549‑57), and of ''Elogia virorum bellica virtute illustrium'', (Florence, 1554), which may be translated as ''Praise of Men Illustrious for Courage in War'' (1554). He is best remembered as a chronicler of the [[Italian Wars]]. His eyewitness accounts of many of the battles form one of the most significant primary sources for the period. Many pages of his work are devoted to [[Skanderbeg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparative literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BJ1RAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2 January 2014|year=1953|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giovio's notable work include:
*''De romanis piscibus'' (1524)
*''De legatione Basilii Magni Principis Moschoviae'' (1525)
*''Commentario de le cose de’ Turchi'' (1531)

The '''reverse Krebs cycle''' (also known as the '''reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle''', the '''reverse TCA cycle''', or the '''reverse citric acid cycle''') 
is a sequence of [[chemical reactions]] that are used by some bacteria to produce carbon compounds from [[carbon dioxide]] and water.

The reaction is the [[citric acid cycle]] run in reverse: Where the Krebs cycle takes complex [[carbon]] molecules in the form of sugars and oxidizes them to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, the reverse cycle takes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water to make carbon compounds.
This process is used by some [[bacteria]] to synthesise carbon compounds, sometimes using [[hydrogen]], [[sulfide]], or [[thiosulfate]] as [[electron donor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Tedo Zhordania''' ({{lang-ka|თედო ჟორდანია}}; 10 April 1854 – 22 October 1916) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historian, philologist, and educator.

Born in an Orthodox priest's family in the village of [[Mokvi]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], Zhordania studied theology in [[Kutaisi]], [[Tbilisi]], and [[Moscow]]. The leading Russian historian of that period, [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], recommended the young Georgian student to pursue his career in Moscow, but Zhordania returned to Tbilisi, where he taught geography at a theological college and supervised church schools. An amateur historian, Zhordania revealed, studied, and published a number of hitherto unknown historical records. Many of these sources were subsequently lost and are known to us exclusively from Zhordania's publications. He died in [[Kaspi]]. He was subsequently buried at the [[Didube Pantheon]] in Tbilisi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guntsadze|first1=Manuchar|last2=Turazashvili|first2=Natia|title=თედო ჟორდანიას თხზულებათა კრებულის პუბლიკაცია|journal=Georgian Studies|date=2012|volume=13–14|pages=244–245|url=http://georgianstudies.ge/docs/XIII%202010.pdf|trans-title=On Publication of the Collection of Works by Tedo Zhordania|language=Georgian, English|issn=1987-9563|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081518/http://georgianstudies.ge/docs/XIII%202010.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Town Mill''' is a Grade II [[listed building|listed]] 18th Century [[watermill]] located in the centre of [[Guildford]] on the [[River Wey]].&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Town Mill, Guildford|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1188091|website=Historic England|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest recorded mill on the site was one constructed by Walter de la Poyle in 1295.  This was a [[fulling mill]] as Guildford was an important location in the wool trade. This was probably the mill known as Kings Mill.&lt;ref name=Hillier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillier|first1=Jack|title=Old Surrey Watermills|date=1951|publisher=Skeffington|location=London|pages=106-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 17th century the mill had been extended to include corn milling with 4 pairs of stones, two for flour and two for animal feed.  The whole assembly was driven by three external water wheels.  The construction of the [[Wey and Godalming Navigations|Wey Navigation]] was a boon for the mill, enabling grain to be delivered to the mill by barge and the resulting sacks of flour to be taken, again by barge, to London.&lt;ref name="Stidder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stidder|first1=Derek|title=Watermills of Surrey|date=1990|publisher=Barracuda Books|location=Buckingham|isbn=0 86023 480 0|pages=78-79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1768 the buildings had become rather dilapidated and the eastern range was demolished and replaced by a three-storey red brick edifice with dentil moulding under the eaves of a tiled roof.&lt;ref name=Hillier /&gt; The western range was simply repaired and comtinued in use.  This section was known as the Hogsmeat Mill. At the same time the old [[undershot]] wheels were replaced with more efficient [[breast shot]] wheels. In 1852 the western section was replaced with an identical brick building styled to match the 1768 building. In 1827 it was reported that an extension to the Hogsmeat Mill was attached to the Guildford foundry, on the site now occupied by the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]], but this building was demolished by 1852.&lt;ref name=Stidder /&gt;

From 1770, an additional [[water wheel]] was being used to pump water to the town reservoir on [[Guildford|Pewsey Down]].&lt;ref name="GBCHydro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydro Tour Information Sheet|url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/9B9980FE-7332-423B-8922-B0B6DBBF6777/0/HydroTourInformationSheet.pdf|website=Guildford Borough Council|accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced by two [[water turbine]]s in 1896, then a single turbine in 1930, in use until 1952 when it was itself replaced by electric pumps nearby. In 2003, Guildford Borough Council arranged for the refurbishment and installation of an identical turbine as an example of [[renewable energy]]. Rather than pumping water, this turbine drives a generator to supply up to 260,000&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour|kWH]] of electricity into the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]], annually.&lt;ref name=GBCHydro /&gt; The turbine came on-line in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Guildford Borough Council wins "green" award for commitment to renewable energy for the hydro project | work = | publisher = Government Office for the South East| date = 13 November 2006 | url = http://www.go-se.gov.uk/gose/news/newsarchive/467693/ | accessdate =4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1930 turbine has since been preserved, and is on display at [[Dapdune Wharf]].&lt;ref name=GBCHydro /&gt;

The Mill is now used by the adjacent Yvonne Arnaud Theatre as a scenery workshop and studio theatre.&lt;ref name=Stidder /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4228">{{History of Romania}}
The '''Transylvanian School''' (''Școala Ardeleană'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) was a cultural movement which was founded after part of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] in [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]-ruled [[Transylvania]] accepted the leadership of the [[Pope]] and became the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic Church]] (ca.1700). The links with Rome brought to the [[Romanians|Romanian]] Tranylvanians the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The Transylvanian School's major centres were in the cities of [[Blaj]], [[Oradea]], [[Lugoj]] and [[Beiuş]].

Its members contemplated the [[origin of Romanians]] from a scientific point of view, bringing historical and [[Philology|philological]] arguments in favour of the thesis that the [[Romanians|Transylvanian Romanians]] were the direct descendants of the [[Roman Dacia|Roman colonists]] brought in [[Dacia]] after its conquest in early 2nd century AD.

The Transylvanian School had a notable impact in the [[Romanian culture]] of both Transylvania, but also of the Romanians living across the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], leading to the [[National awakening of Romania]].

[[Samuil Micu-Klein]], [[Gheorghe Şincai]], [[Petru Maior]] and Ion Budai-Deleanu, who were members of the Transylvanian School during the era of Romanian national awakening, emphasised the ancient purely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stuart Macintyre]], Editors: Daniel R.

In 1791, they contributed in the memorandum : "[[Supplex Libellus Valachorum|Supplex Libellus Valachorum Transylvaniae]]". In this memorandum they demanded similar rights for the Transylvanian Romanians, which the Hungarian nobles the enfranchised Saxon bourgeois and Székelys enjoyed by the [[Unio Trium Nationum|Union of the Three Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcel Cornis-Pope |author2=John Neubauer |title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries, Volume 2|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2004|page=255|ISBN=9789027234537|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=%22transylvanian+school%22+petition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFiuH8oMrLAhUiS5oKHdOAC58Q6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transylvanian%20school%22%20petition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document was presented to Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] by the Transylvanian School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cristian Romocea|title=Church and State: Religious Nationalism and State Identification in Post-Communist Romania|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2011|page=112|ISBN=9781441137470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2eTWl65GB1gC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22transylvanian+school%22+%22Supplex+Libellus+Valachorum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transylvanian%20school%22%20%22Supplex%20Libellus%20Valachorum%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transylvanian School created the current phonetic system of the [[Romanian alphabet]] based on the [[Latin alphabet]], largely derived from the [[Italian alphabet|Italian]] and the [[French alphabet]]s. This replaced the use of the medieval [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]] as well as the previously Latin alphabet based phonetic system which had been based on the [[Hungarian alphabet]]. Another notable contribution of the Transylvanian School was the usage of the first French and Italian neologisms.

The term "'''trash culture'''" entered into common use from the '80s to indicate artistic or entertainment expressions considered of low cultural profile, and thus able to stimulate and attract the audiences.

It refers, as an adjective, to books, movies, TV shows, etc. being characterized by poor taste, vulgarity themes and subjects voluntary chosen and with self-satisfaction to attract the audience through what is shoddy, of low quality, and culturally impoverished.

As a noun, it can be referred to the spread of trash, the theorists of trash, TV trash, or trash sub-culture. &lt;!--(I'm commenting this sentence out because it makes no sense as written. If you can reword this, with grammar, please do. Thanks!) Taste tendency based on the recycling, often pleased and  shown, of what is  culturally decayed. --&gt;

In this sense, trash culture is defined as the validation of the voyeuristic sight of the middle class which approaches the popular culture as style of consumption.

The concept of trash culture should not be confused or merged with the concept of "[[kitsch]]", even if the two are correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="TRASH TV E QUALITY TV: QUESTIONI DI KITSCH",|last=Sacchetto, Quattrocchi, Signorili|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitsch is linked to art in a permanent way, but it is also a social phenomenon which establishes itself as a way of being: in Western society it is characterized by the limitation of the artist's space of creation. Kitsch is essentially multiplication and reachability. It is based on the consumeristic civilization which creates to produce, and produces to consume. It is a repetition whose consequence is a new activity in the relationship between man and environment: consumerism.

In this sense the concept of trash culture can be considered an evolution of the 19th-century concept of kitsch, a development of a consumeristic behavior that, at the beginning, was related to the lowest social classes. Now the phenomenon has embraced a wider range of classes, reaching the contemporary middle class and sometimes the high class. As kitsch was a social phenomenon that established itself as a way of being,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trash Aesthetics: Popular Culture and Its Audience a cura di Deborah Cartmell. Pluto Pr (10 marzo 1997).|last=Cartmell|first=Deborah|publisher=Pluto Pr|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so too trash culture can be defined, but in this one the aim of a continuous process of creation and consumption is the externalization and the accentuation of the self being, that can be expressed through the way of dressing, wearing accessories, and through the self social approach.

== Trash literature ==

The popular culture that surrounds us in our daily lives bears a striking similarity to some of the great works of literature of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition|last=Keller Simon|first=Richard|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In television, movies, magazines, and advertisements we are exposed to many of the same stories as those critics who study the great books of Western literature, but we have simply been encouraged to look at those stories differently.

The great literature and cultural work of the past has been rewritten for today's consumer society, with supermarket tabloids such as the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' and celebrity gossip magazines like ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' serving as contemporary versions of the great dramatic tragedies of the past. Today's advertising repeats the tale of the Golden Age, but inverts the value system of a classic utopia; the shopping mall combines bits and pieces of the great garden styles of Western history, and now adds consumer goods; ''Playboy'' magazine revises Castiglione's Renaissance courtesy book, ''The Book of the Courtier''; and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine revises the women's coming-of-age novels of Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Edith Wharton.

== Trash TV ==

When speaking about [[Tabloid talk show|trash TV]], the term is referred to a whole branch of TV production that tends to exaggerate and to take themes to an extreme level. The objective of this kind of entertainment is to hit the audience through frenzy, accumulation and the absence of any distinction. Trash TV is very often close to ridiculousness, and exaggerating is the key resource: it exaggerates quantities and proportions, the physical and the body dimensions.

The term "trash TV"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vulgarians at the Gate: Trash TV and Raunch Radio : Raising Standards of Popular Culture: Trash TV and Raunch Radio - Raising the Standards of Popular Culture.|last=Allen|first=Steve|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; entered into everyday language in the 80s, to indicate artistic expressions considered of low cultural profile, but able to stimulate an audience. Starting from the 80s, in fact, the private broadcasting channels started to be very spread, and this led to new marketing strategies, focused on the possibility of attracting a larger audience paying for more exclusive shows. Now, TV shows have to build up the brand of the TV station, creating content that cannot be found on the public channels or the competitors.


== Cheap rich ==

Probably, the most important and evident proof of how trash culture is affecting common people's tastes and preferences is laying on the spread of cheap richness as a way of self-expression and self-satisfaction.

Someone can be defined as a "cheap rich" if he/she is wearing ostentatiously certain kind of clothes, jewels or accessories. The aim of people dressed in this way is simply to become striking and to be showy, without considering the real value of the items worn. The key purpose of cheap richness is, in fact, to show eye-catching clothes and accessories that are not of considerable real value or quality, but they look like they were, thanks to golden and sparkling details. The cheap riches usually wear common fashion jewelry, but they display it as if they were wearing expensive and exclusive items. The same can be said for clothes. For example, it is common to associate furs with wealth and opulence, and therefore a person willing to look wealthy and rich is going to buy a fake fur and to wear it ostentatiously. The person cannot afford the expenditure for a real fur, but desperately wants to wear fur and to look like someone that could afford it.

We can find popular examples of cheap riches both in the African-American cultural tradition and in the white trash culture. Many VIPs are dressing themselves in ways that are easily reproducible in items of lower quality but equal prominence.

=== Cheap rich in African-American culture ===

In African-American, hip-hop, and popular cultures, it is common to depict images of African-American rappers brandishing large, golden rings or necklaces, singing songs about themselves or others coming out of a difficult, "ghetto" situation and, afterwards, becoming wealthy because of their music. 

Perceivably, the message for fans may be that they could also imitate wealthy individuals by the aposematic display of golden accessories - which may or may not be genuine - and might thereby attain some sense of conformity, interpersonal acceptance, enjoy social reciprocity; or even of conferring to themselves semblance of upward mobility. 

This can indeed be appealing to a broad range of peoples over diverse geographical regions, cultures, classes, and linguistic spheres; in contradistinction to other contemporary styles whereby the wearer's aim is to "falsely appear" as though from a lower Socioeconomic status.

=== Cheap rich in White trash culture ===

African-American rappers are not unique example of VIPs wearing clothes easily reproducible with poor quality items by cheap riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Did White Trash Become the New Normal?: A Southern Lady Asks the impertinent question.|last=Hays|first=Charlotte|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=Hardcover|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous singer Madonna, for example, is being depicted as a trash artist, both in apparel and in behaviors since the 80s, when her career started.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">The '''Wilton culture''' is the name given by [[archaeologist]]s to an archaeological culture which was common to parts of south and east [[Africa]] around six thousand years ago, during the [[Stone Age]] period. The culture is characterized by a greater number of tool types, distinguishing it from its predecessors.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtin|first1=Philip|last2=Feierman|first2=Steven|last3=Thompson|first3=Leonard|last4=Vansina|first4=Jan|title=African History: From Earliest Times to Independence (print)|publisher=Pearson|edition=Second|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first described by [[John Hewitt (herpetologist)|John Hewitt]] after he excavated with the collaboration of C. W. Wilmot a cave on the farm Wilton.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt J. (1921).  On several implements and ornaments from Strandloper sites in the Eastern Province. S. Afr. J. Sci. 18: 454-467&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Locations==
Occupation sites include that at [[Kalambo Falls]] and the valley of [[Twyfelfontein]].&lt;ref name="Tourbrief"&gt;{{cite web
|title=Twyfelfontein
|publisher=Tourbrief.com
|url=http://www.tourbrief.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=272&amp;Itemid=98
|accessdate=3 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a partially preserved camp dating to 2300 BC was found in Gwisho, near the [[Kafue River]].&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Its tools are broadly analogous to the European [[mesolithic]] [[Microlith]]s, which are a common [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] type. Later examples of the culture however indicate usage of [[iron]]. There are sites in southern Africa which exhibit evidence of rock art by the Wilton people.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;

==Gwisho==
Tools developed in Gwisho were more sophisticated than those of its predecessors. The Wilton people in Gwisho developed a [[bone industry]], which produced items such as awls, ornaments and composite arrows. They also constructed and utilized wooden tools to uproot edible roots, which was a staple in their diet.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="curtin2"&gt;African History: From Earliest Times to Independence (print), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Most of their food supply came from harvesting edible matter.&lt;ref name="curtin2"/&gt;

It is speculated by anthropologists that all the people of Gwisho belonged to a single 'kinship group', a group of which all members are related to one another by ancestry or various alternative ways.&lt;ref name="curtin2"/&gt;
