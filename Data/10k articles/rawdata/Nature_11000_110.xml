'''Adularescence''' is an [[optical phenomenon]], similar to [[labradorescence]] and [[aventurescence]], that is produced in [[gemstone]]s such as [[Moonstone_(gemstone)|moonstones]].

==Description==
The effect of adularescence, also commonly referred to as ''[[Lustre_(mineralogy)#Schiller|schiller]]'' or ''shiller'', is best described as a milky, bluish [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or glow originating from below the surface of the gemstone. The schiller, appearing to move as the stone is turned (or as the light source is moved), gives the impression of lunar light floating on water (accounting for moonstone's name).&lt;ref&gt;Long, Bill (2004), "[http://www.drbilllong.com/MoreWords/ShiningII.html Varieties of Light II: Pleochroism, Nacreous, Adularescence, A(d)venturescence]."&lt;/ref&gt; Though white schiller is the most common, in rarer specimens, orange or blue lusters are produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semipreciousstonesguide.com/list-of-gemstone-phenomena/ Semi Precious Stones Guide: List of Gemstone Phenomena]&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect is most typically produced by [[adularia]], from which the name derives.&lt;ref&gt;King, R. J. (1990). "Minerals explained 12: Alkali feldspar (Part 2)." ''Geology Today'', 6 pp. 27-29. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adularescence Adularescence]," reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shipley&gt;Shipley, Robert M. (2007), ''Dictionary of Gems and Gemology'', Read Books, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Adularescence appears in numerous other gemstones, notably common [[opal]], [[rose quartz]] and [[agate]]. However, due to inclusions in these other stones, the effect is displayed differently. The schiller is scattered by inclusions and appears hazy; non-hazy specimens are specially referred to as "milky". Thus, adularescence occurring in non-adularia gemstones is termed differently&amp;nbsp;– the "girasol effect" and [[opalescence]] (for opals only) are two such terms. When the schiller forms an indistinct band, it is said to display a [[chatoyancy|chatoyant effect]]. Only clearly defined bands are referred to as "cat's eyes".&lt;ref name=Shipley/&gt;

As an optical phenomenon, adularescence exists only in the presence of light; it is a product of the interaction between light and the internal microstructures of the mineral and not a property of the mineral itself. The effect is produced by alternating layers of two types at a scale near the wavelength of light (c.&amp;nbsp;0.5&amp;nbsp;[[micron]])&amp;nbsp;– this leads to [[Bragg diffraction|light scattering and interference]].&lt;ref&gt;Nassau, Kurt (1978). "[http://minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/arc/color.htm The origins of color in minerals]," ''American Mineralologist'', vol. 63, pp. 219-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4421">'''Aeropause''' is the region in which the functional effects of the atmosphere on man and craft begin to cease.

==Background==
In the 1950s, there were discussions between the [[U. S. Air Force]] [[Randolph Air Force Base#School of Aviation Medicine|School of Medicine Aviation]] and the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Foundation]] regarding how to support the efforts to accomplish manned travel in the upper atmosphere. A research plan was developed that encompassed the aeromedical, aeronautical, astrophysical, and biological aspects that were deemed vital to manned travel in the upper atmosphere. At [[San Antonio, Texas]] in November 1951 a symposium was held with a focus aimed at forecasting the future research needed for manned flight that approached the upper limits of the atmosphere. At the symposium, the presentations and discussions focused on 4 major disciplines that comprised the areas of [[astrophysics]], [[aeronautical engineering]], [[radiobiology]], and [[aviation medicine]].&lt;ref name=Benson&gt;Benson Jr, Otis Otto., &amp; White, Clayton Samuel. (Eds.). (1952). Physics and Medicine of the Upper Atmosphere: A Study of the Aeropause. University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry George Armstrong|Armstrong, H. G.]] (1961). The atmosphere. Aerospace Medicine. HG Armstrong, editor. Baltimore. The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Aeropause==
At the time when the term '''''aeropause''''' became relevant to the pursuits of mankind into the upper regions of Earth’s atmosphere, there did not exist a precise description for the word. The judgement of experts in the various fields was solicited and input was sought to define the term aeropause.&lt;ref name=Benson/&gt; The terms from aeromedical and aeronautical disciplines along with terms from geophysics, astrophysics, and radiobiology were not sufficient to depict this region of the atmosphere where human endeavors sought to venture and explore. The current terms in use were limited and insufficient. The terms available and that came under consideration were [[aerosphere]], aeropause, and [[astronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, K. F. (Ed.). (1959). Man in space: the United States Air Force program for developing the spacecraft crew. Duell, Sloan and Pearce.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Clayton S. White, the expression aeropause is a coined word first spoken by Dr. [[Konrad Johannes Karl Büttner|Konrad Buettner]] of the Department of Space Medicine at Randolph Field during a conference.&lt;ref name=Benson/&gt; Again, referring to White: "aerosphere was visualized as that region in which flight was possible currently. The '''aeropause''' was the region just above this, to be different yesterday, today, and tomorrow, as progress in aviation ensued".&lt;ref name=Benson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (19 November 1951). Science: The Unfriendly Aeropause. Time. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubertus Strughold|Strughold, Hubertus]]. (1954). Atmospheric space equivalence. Journal of Aviation Medicine. 25(4): 420-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Haber]], Department of Space Medicine at Randolph Field, an expert in [[space medicine]] sought a more functional definition and said the: "'''aeropause''' should be defined as that region in which the functional effects of the atmosphere on man and craft begin to cease".&lt;ref name=Benson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buettner&gt;Buettner, K. J., &amp; Haber, H. (1952). The aeropause. Science. 115: 656-657.&lt;/ref&gt; The aeronautical engineer defined the aeropause as those areas of the atmosphere where the [[physiological]] necessities of the [[aircrew]] became the limiting factors for the design of aircraft and supporting equipment.&lt;ref name=Benson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strughold, H. (1956). The US Air Force experimental sealed cabin. Journal of Aviation Medicine. (27): 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (2003). Aeropause. McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms. 6E.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (2005). Aeropause. An Illustrated Dictionary of Aviation. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the aeropause requires a blend of several disciplines from the [[biological sciences]] and the [[physical sciences]]. Important fields necessary for research that involves the aeropause include [[aviation medicine]], [[geophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], [[aeronautical engineering]], [[biophysics]], and [[radiobiology]].&lt;ref name=Buettner/&gt;

===1910 to 1924===
==''The early demand for aeroplanes''==
Private flying initially stimulated the UK aviation industry and by October 1913 there were over 80 private airworthy aeroplanes, more than the airworthy planes in the recently formed [[Royal Flying Corps]]. Commercial flying only really started in 1919. Before the war there were no regular air services.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p476&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst it was the military market that really was the source of aviation development, in the years leading up to 1914 it was, in the UK, rather sporadic. In 1909 development on behalf of the Government was stopped as being too costly. In April 1911 Britain had only 6 military aeroplanes, 2 of which were obsolete. The French War Department owned 208. However, by the start of WW1 the Naval Wing of the [[R.F.C.]] had 93 and the Military Wing had 179.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p479&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Structure of the industry''==
===1910-1914===
As a new technology, there was a great deal of interest from a variety of sources but often it was individuals just enthused by aviation. Between 1909 and 1914 there were about 200 active constructors, although many of them only made one or two planes. But even the production of the larger firms was not very substantial, [[British and Colonial Aeroplane Company]], one of the largest produced just over 200 planes between 1910 and 1914.&lt;ref name="British Aircraft Industry 1969 p487"&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p487&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the aviation pioneers, such as [[Geoffrey de Havilland]], [[Thomas Sopwith]], [[Richard Fairey]], [[Robert Blackburn (aviation pioneer)|Robert Blackburn]], [[Frederick Handley Page]], [[Alliott Verdon Roe|A.V. Roe]] and the [[Short Brothers]] had a training in engineering and their companies were usually privately financed. There were several large engineering companies who also got involved, such as [[Vickers]] in 1911, [[Armstrong Whitworth]] in 1912 [[British and Colonial Aeroplane Company]] in 1910 and [[Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="British Aircraft Industry 1969 p487"/&gt;

Along with these companies there was the early development of seaplanes, particularly near Southampton, by companies such as [[S. E. Saunders]] (originally boat builders) and Pemberton-Billing (later [[Supermarine]]). Finally, there were several French subsidiary companies who built aero-engines.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) pp487-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914-1918===
Unsurprisingly the First World War led to a massive increase in the number of companies engaged in aircraft production, 1,529 companies in October 1918, but once the War was over the vast majority returned to their pre-war activities. However, the aircraft being produced in 1918 were essentially enhanced versions of the 1914 aircraft. The development of the aviation industry between 1914 and 1918 was more one of production and logistics than scientific or technical.

===1918 -1924===
On 2 January 1918 the [[Air Ministry]] was founded and on 1 April 1918 the [[Royal Air Force]] was established, independent of the Army and Royal Navy. Both organisations were to fashion the nature of the aviation industry in the UK.

The first task for the government at the end of the war was to dispose of their stocks of aircraft and to deal with those on order. The [[Ministry of Munitions]] set up a Disposal Board and sold the entire surplus stock to a private company, [[Aircraft Disposals Company]], with [[Frederick Handley Page]] as one of the key personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p491&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the war was finished and the government demand for aircraft ceased some of the remaining aircraft companies tried to diversify into other activities but with limited success or simply closed down. For instance, [[Airco]] looked at car manufacture and was bought by the [[Daimler Company]] parent company [[Birmingham Small Arms]] whilst [[Martinsyde]] and [[Sopwith Aviation Company|Sopwith]] briefly tried motor cycles. By 1920 the British aerospace industry consisted of 28 aeroplane constructors and a dozen aero engine designers. However, much of their work was of a trivial nature and engine orders were so low that Rolls Royce nearly left the aviation sector.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p.490&lt;/ref&gt;

The aviation industry was left with the core of pre-war producers and a few companies whose interest in aviation had been aroused. This latter category included companies such as the Norwich engineering firm [[Boulton &amp; Paul]], [[Westland Aircraft]], the wartime offshoot of engine manufacturers [[Petters Ltd]] and Gloucestershire, later, [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] formed from Cheltenham-based luxury liner outfitters H. H. Martyn.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p488&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless there was still determination to stay particularly from the enthusiastic pioneers such de Havilland and Sopwith. As soon as [[Airco]] and [[Sopwith Aviation Company]] were declared bankrupt,(due to the Treasury demanding payment for excess profits)  within months [[Tommy Sopwith]] and [[Geoffrey de Havilland]] both established new companies, H.G. Hawker Engineering later [[Hawker Aircraft]] and [[De Havilland Aircraft Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p.493&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil Aviation==== 
The Government established a Civil Aerial Transport Committee (that included [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Tommy Sopwith]]) that reported in December 1918. Their key recommendation was that steps should be taken to foster civil aviation in order, in part, to maintain a manufacturing base that could supply the country’s military needs.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1985 The Growth of Aviation in Britain. Journal of Contemporary History Vol. 20 No.1 
P24-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, Government policy for civil aviation was, initially, according to the then [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[Winston Churchill]], on 11 March 1920 in the House of Commons to let it "fly by itself……any attempt to support it artificially by floods of State money will not ever produce a really sound commercial aviation service which the public will use, and will impose a burden of an almost indefinite amount upon the Exchequer".

Air transport companies were established in 1919-20, several of which were subsidiaries of aircraft manufacturers, such as [[Handley-Page]], [[Airco]] and [[Blackburn Aircraft]]. A number of the companies failed or found themselves in difficulty, due to high operating cost, low demand that was also seasonal, high fares and heavily subsidised French competition and so it was decided in April 1922 to offer support and by October subsidies were given to individual airlines operating set routes.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1985 The Growth of Aviation in Britain. Journal of Contemporary History Vol. 20 No.1 
P25-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters were improved when aircraft specifically designed for commercial operation were introduced. The [[DH.34]] and [[Handley Page W.8]] lowered the operating costs for airlines, making them more economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1985 The Growth of Aviation in Britain. Journal of Contemporary History Vol. 20 No.1 
P27&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, however, the state did involve itself in civil aviation and on the advice of the Hambling Committee, creating [[Imperial Airways]] in 1924 from the four main air transport companies. However, the Air Ministry did not actively engage with the development of commercial aircraft, despite the recommendation of the 1918 Civil Aerial Transport Committee and was later criticised by the 1938 Cadman Report for this.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p492&lt;/ref&gt; 


====Military Aviation==== 
The [[Air Ministry]] worked in the early years on the basis that there would be no war in Europe in the immediate future and that the main requirement for aircraft would be policing the colonies. Such activity would not require sophisticated aeroplanes to be developed.  

To ensure that the aircraft industry did not shrink to a size dangerous for national defence there came into being an arrangement with [[Society of British Aircraft Constructors]] that contracts could be shared around a limited number of companies, this became known as The Ring.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fearon 1969: The Formative Years of the British Aircraft Industry, 1913-1924 The Business History Review Vol. 43 No. 4 (Winter 1969) p493&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current major projects==

===Manned civil aircraft===
*[[Airbus A380]], [[Airbus A350 XWB|A350 XWB]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A330|A330]] and the [[Airbus A320 family]] have their wings and fuel systems built in the UK. The A380 is the world's largest civil passenger plane in production. Rolls-Royce offers its Trent 900 for the A380 and has so far secured 61% of the market based on operator decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolls-royce.com/civil_aerospace/products/airlines/trent900/market.jsp Rolls-Royce.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026233533/http://www.rolls-royce.com/civil_aerospace/products/airlines/trent900/market.jsp |date=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iain Gray, former Airbus UK Managing Director, has claimed that an Airbus A380, fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, has a UK content of about 40-50%. The A350 XWB has so far achieved 564 firm orders and has its wings developed in Filton and assembled in Broughton. Rolls-Royce is currently the only engine supplier to the A350 XWB with the Trent XWB.
* [[Hawker 800]]XP, the Airbus plant in Broughton builds the fuselage and wings for the Hawker 800XP variant. This work employs about 450 people at the plant in North Wales.
* [[Bombardier Aerospace]] facilities in Northern Ireland play an important role in nearly every Bombardier aircraft programme. The most notable are the production of the fuselage for the [[Learjet 40]] and [[Learjet 45]], the production of the centre fuselage for the [[Challenger 300]] and other programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeroworldnet.com/10nr091002.htm Aeroworldnet.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824224201/http://www.aeroworldnet.com/10nr091002.htm |date=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the newly proposed C-Series, Belfast is planned to design and produce the wings, rear fuselage and nacelles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/Bombardier2/|title=Bombardier CSeries CS100 / CS300 Regional Jets|work=Aerospace-Technology.com}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manned military aircraft===

* [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], the British aerospace industry has a 37.5% share in the production of the Eurofighter Typhoon and a 33% share in the development of the aircraft. The main participants are BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. The UK had 40,000 jobs involved in the construction of the Eurofighter Typhoon, across 400 suppliers. Comparatively, the next largest contributor to the Eurofighter Typhoon, Germany, had 25,000 jobs involved and 400 suppliers.&lt;ref name="TyphoonStats"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us|website=Eurofighter Typhoon|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[BAE Hawk]] is one of the best-selling advanced jet trainers in the world and has generated billions of pounds in exports for the British aerospace industry. BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce are the two main participants and, so far, over 900 Hawks have been sold worldwide. The latest variant is the "AJT" version, or "Advanced Jet Trainer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/avhawk.html Vectorsite.net] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr9M11W4?url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avhawk.html |date=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[F-35 Lightning II]], the UK aerospace industry has a workshare of about 20% in the aircraft and has two companies in "Team JSF", BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. BAE Systems designed and produces the aft fuselage, fuel system, horizontal and vertical stabilizers among other things. Rolls-Royce has a 40% workshare in the F136 alternative F35 Lightning II engine and provides the Liftfan for all F35Bs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teamjsf.com/jsf/data.nsf/public/2826ACE7FD02555585257053004954B2/$file/BAEInvolvementChart_DEC2005.pdf Teamjsf.com] {{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Airbus A400M]] has a workshare roughly equivalent to its share of procurement, which equates to about 14%. Due to traditional Airbus roles, Airbus UK developed the wings for the A400M and outsourced some of the manufacturing; however, the final assembly takes place in Filton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-defence.co.uk/a400m.html|title=a400m.html|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil and military UAVs and UCAVs===
[[File:Farnborough 2006 1 001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[BAE Systems HERTI]]]]
* [[BAE HERTI]], developed by BAE Systems. It first flew in 2004 and was successfully deployed to Afghanistan on trials in 2007. An armed version, named BAE Fury, was revealed in 2008.
* [[BAE Mantis]], a MALE UAV technology demonstrator, developed by BAE Systems, which first flew in 2009. It was hailed as the world's first fully autonomous drone by BAE Systems. Technology from it was to be used in an Anglo-French MALE UAV named Telemos, however, France effectively abandoned Telemos in 2012 after it joined a collaboration with Germany and Italy instead. The Royal Air Force has since selected the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper#Certifiable Predator B|Certifiable Predator B]] from the U.S.-based [[General Atomics]] to fulfill its future MALE UAV requirements.
* [[BAE Taranis]], a UCAV technology demonstrator developed by BAE Systems in partnership with Rolls-Royce, QinetiQ and GE Aviation Systems. Technology derived from it is to be used in the development of an Anglo-French Future Combat Air System that will equip the air forces of the UK and France by 2030.
* [[Future of the Royal Air Force#Future Combat Air System (FCAS)|Future Combat Air System]], an Anglo-French UCAV currently in development. It will use technology derived from BAE Taranis and [[Dassault nEUROn]]. It is expected to enter service by 2030.
* [[Hybrid Air Vehicles HAV 304 Airlander 10]], a hybrid airship developed by [[Hybrid Air Vehicles]] based in Bedfordshire. It is currently the world's-largest aircraft.
* [[QinetiQ Zephyr]], a [[High-Altitude Long Endurance|HALE]] UAV developed by QinetiQ. In July 2010, it made the world's longest recorded flight of an unrefuelled unmanned aerial vehicle with a flight that lasted 336 hours, 22 minutes and 8 seconds.
* [[Selex ES]] has developed a range of small battlefield UAVs, such as the [[Selex ES Falco|Falco]] and ASIO. Most of these have been developed in collaboration with Italian companies.
* [[Thales Watchkeeper WK450]], an ISTAR UAV developed by Thales UK in partnership with [[Elbit Systems]] of Israel. It is based on the [[Elbit Hermes 450|Hermes 450]]. The British Army plans to operate a fleet of 54 Watchkeeper UAVs. France has expressed interest in buying the system and an armed version has also been pitched to Poland.

===Helicopters===
[[File:EH101 Merlin HMS Monmouth 2007.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[AgustaWestland AW101]]]]
*[[AgustaWestland AW101]], a medium-lift helicopter developed for both military and civil applications. It was designed by Westland Helicopters in collaboration with Italy's [[Agusta]]. It made its first flight in 1987. It is manufactured in Yeovil, England by AgustaWestland, a joint company formed by GKN of the UK and Finmecannica of Italy in 2000. However, GKN sold its 50% share of AgustaWestland to Finmecannica in 2004, giving Finmecannica total ownership of the company. As of August 2016, the AW101 has been exported to 11 countries.
*[[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat]], a significantly improved version of the [[Super Lynx]]. It is manufactured by AgustaWestland in Yeovil, England. It first flew in 2009 and entered operational service in 2014 with the British Army. It has been exported to South Korea and the Philippines.
*[[AgustaWestland Apache]], a licence-built version of the American AH-64D Apache Longbow featuring several unique modifications, including Rolls-Royce Turbomeca engines, a new electronic defensive aids suite and a folding rotor blade mechanism. 59 of the 67 WAH-64 Apaches were built by Westland Helicopters (now AgustaWestland) in Yeovil, England.

===Engines===
[[File:A380-trent900.JPG|right|300px|thumb|[[Rolls-Royce Trent|Rolls-Royce Trent 900]]]]
[[File:Boeing 787first flight.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A [[Boeing 787]] powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]] engines.]]
* [[Eurojet EJ200]], the powerplant of the Eurofighter Typhoon. Rolls-Royce has a 33% share in development and a 34.5% share of production. The EJ200 is based on the XG.40 engine research programme carried out by Rolls-Royce and the UK Ministry of Defence in the 1980s.
* [[General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136]], the alternative engine for the F-35 Lightning II. Rolls-Royce had a 40% workshare in the engine. Development was cancelled in December 2011 after failing to obtain Pentagon support for further development.
* [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Limited|Rolls-Royce Turbomeca]] [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour|Adour MK951]], an Anglo-French co-development for the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and later adopted for the Hawk trainer jet. It was also recently used in the BAE Taranis UCAV technology demonstrator. Rolls-Royce has a 50% workshare in the Adour and the final assembly line is in Bristol, United Kingdom.
* [[Europrop International]] [[Europrop TP400|TP400-D6]], the powerplant of the Airbus A400M. Rolls-Royce has a 25% workshare, which includes final assembly, the high-pressure compressor, the low-pressure shaft, the intermediate case, and the bearing support structure. However, much of this work is carried out in Germany, such as the final assembly, because Rolls-Royce has a larger workshare in relation to the UK aircraft purchase. The solution is that Rolls-Royce Deutschland does some of the work and thus can claim a part of the German workshare in the aircraft.
*[[Rolls-Royce LiftSystem]], the STOVL component for the F35B. It is entirely developed and produced by Rolls-Royce. As with the Rolls-Royce share in the F136, the liftfan development is led by the company's Bristol facility with considerable input from its Indianapolis offices.
*[[Rolls-Royce Trent]] family. 
**Trent 500 is the only engine offered for the Airbus A340-500 and A340-600. 
**Trent 800 is offered for the Boeing 777 and the Trent 700 is offered for the Airbus A330, where it has achieved large success.
**Trent 900 is Rolls-Royce's offering for the Airbus A380 and it has achieved a workshare of more than 50% against the [[Engine Alliance GP7000|Engine Alliance GP7200]].
**Trent 1000 is the launch engine for all variants of the Boeing 787 and, by November 2007, over 600 Trent 1000s had been ordered by 19 airlines. This gives the Trent 1000 a market share of slightly more than 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/showPR.jsp?PR_ID=40577 Rolls-Royce.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121190730/http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/showPR.jsp?PR_ID=40577 |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**Trent XWB is the newest Rolls-Royce engine of the Trent series. It will power the Airbus A350 XWB and has currently achieved 800 orders. In November 2007, Rolls-Royce declared that it will build a new factory in Singapore to final assemble some of the Trent XWBs and Trent 1000s.

The '''Arabian-Nubian Shield''' (ANS) is an exposure of [[Precambrian]] crystalline rocks on the flanks of the [[Red Sea]]. The crystalline rocks are mostly [[Neoproterozoic]] in age.  Geographically - and from north to south - the ANS includes parts of [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Yemen]], and [[Somalia]]. The ANS in the north is exposed as part of the [[Sahara Desert]] and [[Arabian Desert]], and in the south in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], [[Asir]] province of Arabia and [[Yemen Highlands]].

The ANS was the site of some of man's earliest geologic efforts, principally by the [[ancient Egyptians]] to extract [[gold]] from the rocks of Egypt and NE Sudan.  This was the most easily worked of all metals and does not tarnish.  All of the gold deposits in Egypt and northern Sudan were found and exploited by Egyptians.  The earliest preserved [[geologic map]] was made in 1150 BCE to show the location of gold deposits in Eastern Egypt; it is known as the [[Turin papyrus]].  New gold discoveries have been found in Sudan, Eritrea, and Saudi Arabia.

Pharonic Egyptians also quarried [[granite]] near [[Aswan]] and floated this down the Nile to be used as facing for the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]].  The Greek name for Aswan, ''Syene''; is the type locality for the [[igneous rock]] [[syenite]].  The Romans followed this tradition and had many quarries especially in the northern part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt where [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and [[granite]] were mined and shaped for shipment. 

Precious and industrial metals, including gold, silver, copper, zinc, tin, and lead, have been mined in Saudi Arabia for at least 5,000 years. The most productive mine in Saudi Arabia, [[Mahd adh Dhahab]] ("Cradle of Gold"), has been periodically exploited for its mineral wealth for hundreds or even thousands of years and is reputed to be the original source of King Solomon's legendary gold.  Today, mining at Mahd adh Dhahab is conducted by the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, Ma'aden. Deposits of iron, tungsten, mineral sands, copper and phosphates have been found in many locations. Mining in the Eastern Desert of Egypt and Sudan is limited due to shortage of water and infrastructure. One option would be to bring water from the Nile by pipeline.

==Development of the Arabian-Nubian Shield==
[[File:USGS Arabian-Nubian Shield Terranes.png|thumb|300px|Arabian-Nubian Shield prior to the [[Red Sea Rift]], with Arabian Shield terranes labelled]]
The Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) is the northern half of a great collision zone called the [[East African Orogeny]]. This collision zone formed near the end of [[Neoproterozoic]] time when [[List of shields and cratons|East and West Gondwana]] collided to form the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. The East African orogeny extends southward to the [[Mozambique Belt]], and is a subset of the overall [[Pan-African orogeny]].  The assembly of Gondwana coincided with the breakup of [[Rodinia]], closure of the [[Mozambique Ocean]], and growth of the shield at 870 [[mega-annum|Ma]]  This shield growth extended for the next 300 Ma., and included [[island arc]] convergence and [[terrane]] [[suture (geology)|suturing]] at 780 Ma, with final assembly by 550 Ma.  At this time, the East African Orogen became a passive margin and the southern shore of the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Peter |last2=Woldehaimanot |first2=Beraki |editor1-last=Yohida |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Windley |editor2-first=B.F. |editor3-last=Dasgupta |editor3-first=S. |title=Development of the Arabian-Nubian Shield: perspectives on accretion and deformation in the northern East African Orogen and the assembly of Gondwana, in Proterozoic East Gondwana: Supercontinent Assembly and Breakup, Geological Society Special Publication No. 206 |date=2003 |publisher=The Geological Society |location=London |pages=289-325}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shield is divided into crustal blocks or [[tectonostratigraphic terrane]]s delineated by [[ophiolite]] [[shear zone]]s or sutures.  These terranes are paired across the [[Red Sea]], starting from the south, these include Nakfa (870-840 Ma) with Asir (785-720 Ma,850-790 Ma), Haya (870-790 Ma) with Jiddah (870-760 Ma), Gabgaba (735-700 Ma) and Gebeit (832-810 Ma) with Hijaz (870-807 Ma), and Eastern Desert (810-720 Ma) with Midyan (780-710 Ma).  In addition the Halfa (2.6-1.2 [[giga-annum|Ga]],750-718 Ma) and Bayuda (806 Ma) terranes are in the western portion of the shield, and the Hulayfah (720 Ma), Ha'il (740 Ma), Afif (750-695 Ma,840-820 Ma,1.86-1.66 Ga), Ad Dawadimi (695-680 Ma), and Ar Rayn (667 Ma) terranes in the eastern portion.&lt;ref name=Peter/&gt;

Key amalgamation events, starting 780-760 Ma, with the formation of the Tabalah-Tarj Shear Zone, the [[gneiss]] Afaf Belt, and the 600 km long and 565 km wide Bi'r Umq and Nakasib Suture (780-760 Ma), an ophiolite-decorated fold-shear zone, between the Jiddah-Haya and Hijaz-Gebeit Terranes.  Then between 750-660 Ma, the Atmur-Delgo Suture formed as Halfa Terrane ophiolite [[nappe]]s were [[thrust fault|thrust]] onto the Bayuda Terrane.  Simultaneously, the Allaqi-Heiani-Sol and Hamed-Onib-Yanbu Suture formed, consisting of nappes and portions of ophiolite along an east-trending shear zone between the Gebeit-Hijaz and Eastern Desert Terrane and Midyan Terranes.  Between 680-640 Ma, the 600 km long and 5-30 km wide Hulayfah-Ad Dafinah-Ruwah Suture formed between the Afif Terrance and terranes to the southwest.  Simultaneously, the Halaban Suture formed between the Afif and Ad Dawadimi Terranes as a nappe of Halaban ophiolite thrust westward.  In addition, the Ar Amar Suture, consisting of the Al Amar Fault zone with ophiolite lenses, between the Ad Dawadimi and Ar Rayan Terranes, while the Nabitah Fault Zone formed in Asir Terrane.  The final amalgamaton event occurred 650-600 Ma, when the Keraf Suture, consisting of ophiolite folded and sheared rocks, formed between the Bayuda-Halfa and Gebeit-Gabgaba Terranes.&lt;ref name=Peter/&gt;

Post-amalgamation events include the formation of the Huqf [[stratigraphic unit|Supergroup]] (732-540 Ma) in Oman and W. Saudi Arabia, which accumulated in basement basins, the first 1100 m of which include glaciomarine deposits with [[diamictite]]s and [[dropstone]]s from the [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]] glaciations.  Gneiss belts and domes forming in the Late Neoproterozoic include the Kirsh gneiss in the Arabian shield and the Meatiq gneiss dome in the Eastern Desert.  Late Neoproterozoic shear zones include the Hamisana Shear Zone (665-610 Ma), the Ar Rika- Qazaz Shear Zone (640-610 Ma) within the Najd Fault System, and the Oko Shear Zone (700-560 Ma).&lt;ref name=Peter/&gt;  

A number of features have been ascribed to late stage [[extensional tectonics]] including a widespread NE-SW trending [[Dike (geology)|dyke]] swarm, NE-SW trending normal faults and NW-SE trending [[sedimentary basins]] filled with post-orogenic [[molasse]] deposits&lt;ref&gt;Blasband, B., White, S., Brooijmans, P., De Boorder, H. &amp; Visser, W. 2000. Late Proterozoic extensional collapse in the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Journal of the Geological Society, 157, 615-628. {{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~dxt038000/Egypt%20Website/PDFs/General/BlasbandJGSL00.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219203559/http://www.utdallas.edu/~dxt038000/Egypt%20Website/PDFs/General/BlasbandJGSL00.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustal weaknesses before 500 Ma influenced [[continental rifting]], as the Arabian peninsula moved away from Africa, and the formation of the [[Red Sea Basin]] at the start of the [[Oligocene]].  By then, some of the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] rocks had been eroded, if ever deposited.  In fact, the 1200 km wide ANS orogenic belt, has a present-day layered crustal structure, with a uniform [[Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87_discontinuity|Moho]] depth of 35-45 km.  Post-rift deposition of [[evaporite]]s occurred until the [[Pliocene]], when a marine environment took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindquist |first1=Sandra |title=The Red Sea Basin Province: Sudr Nubia(!) and Maqna(!)

==Gold Deposits in Egypt and Nubian Sudan==
As Rosemarie and Dietrich Klemm point out, "...gold deposits exploited in antiquity occur almost exclusively in the Neoproterozoic sequences of the ANS in the Eastern Desert in Egypt and Northern Sudan."  The shield in this part of Africa consists of a cratonic African basement or "infrastructure", overlain by a Pan-African [[overthrust]] "superstructure".  The infrastructure consists of [[migmatite]] [[gneiss]] and gneiss domes such as Gebel Hafafit and Gebel Meatiq.  The metamorphism is associated with overthrust tectonics, but bear no relationship to the ancient gold mines.  The superstructure consists of an [[ophiolite]]-like sequences with [[island arc]] [[volcanics]], Hammamat sediments, and post orogenic [[granite]]s.  The ophiolites range in age from 746-832 [[mega-annum|Ma]] and are mainly [[serpentite]]s with elevated gold values of 25 [[parts per billion|ppb]].  The Hammamat sediments, common in [[Wadi Hammamat]] and referred to as "bekhen" stone, consist of [[greywacke]]s and [[siltstone]]s, which are slightly enriched in gold.  The Hammamat sediments include [[dike (geology)|dike]] [[intrusion]]s and the [[dacite]] to [[rhyolite]] Dokhan volcanics, which formed in the early stages of [[orogeny]] at 600-625 Ma.  These volcanics include the Roman imperial [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] quarries.  The granite intrusions include two sequences, an older one 614-709 Ma, and a younger sequence at 544-596 Ma, which includes the Aswan granite at 565 Ma.  The margin of the includes [[granodiorite]] and [[diorite]], and most importantly, [[auriferous]] [[quartz vein]]s.  These veins mineralized from [[hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal flow]] inside tectonic extensional gaps, or within cavities from shearing.  These characteristics were exploited by [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] prospectors.  This is especially true for ancient gold exploitations oriented in NNW-SSE shear zones, such as the sites at Hammama, Abu Had-North, Wad Atalla el-Mur, Atalla, Umm el Esh Sarga, Fawakhir, El-Sid, Umm Soleimat and Hamuda.&lt;ref name="Klemm"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klemm |first1=Rosemarie |last2=Klemm |first2=Dietrich |title=Gold and Gold Mining in Ancient Egypt and Nubia |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=Heidelberg |isbn=9783642225079 |pages=32-40,52,342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadi el-Sid was the chief mining area for the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], with high gold grades of 30 grams per ton (g/t) in the mineralized quartz veins within sheared ophiolite sequences of serpentinite and [[metabasalt]], [[imbrication (sedimentology)|imbricated]] with Hammamat sediments, in direct contact with the [[tonalite]] margins of the Fawakhir granite [[pluton]].  The ophiolite [[nappe]] dates from 850 to 770 Ma, while the Fawakhir pluton dates from 574 ma.  These gold-rich veins are oriented according to post-tectonic extension, something the Egyptian prospectors understood.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt;{{rp|140-146}}  

The well of Umm el-Fawakhir area includes a Large Ptolemaic settlement and round stone mills dating from the Roman or Early Arab Period to the oval stone mills of the New Kingdom.  Even fist hammers from the Old/Middle Kingdom are present.  [[Tailings]] were reworked by the Louison Company from the [[1930s]] until 1956.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt;{{rp|140-141,146}}

== Applications ==

The description of raindrop shape has some rather practical uses.  Understanding rain is particularly important with regard to the propagation of electromagnetic signals.  A portion of atmosphere that has rain in it, or a rain cell, has the characteristic of attenuating and [[Polarization (waves)|de-polarizing]] EM signals that pass through it.  The attenuation of such a signal is approximately proportional to the square of the frequency of the signal, and the de-polarization is proportional to the shape distribution of raindrops in the rain cell.

'''Cable fault''' location is the process of locating periodic faults, such as insulation faults in [[Underground Cable|underground cables]], and is an application of [[electrical measurement systems]]. In this process, mobile [[shock discharge generator]]s are among the devices used.

[[File:Fehlerortungsgeraet-fog101.jpg|thumb|Early fault location device]]

== Cable faults ==
[[File:Kabelfehler.jpg|thumb|Example of a cable fault]]
Cable faults are damage to cables which effect a resistance in the cable. If allowed to persist, this can lead to a [[Electrical breakdown|voltage breakdown]]. There are different types of cable faults, which must first be classified before they can be located. The insulation of the cable plays a significant role in this. While paper-impregnated cables are particularly susceptible to external chemical and thermal influences, in high-voltage [[Polyethylene|PE]] or [[Cross-linked polyethylene|XLPE]] cables the polyethylene insulation of the conductor is affected, leading to partial breakdowns and cracks that “eat away” the insulation.

=== Screening faults ===
A contact between conductor and screen generates a varying resistance.

=== Phase faults ===
The contact between multiple conductors generates a varying resistance.

=== Sheath faults ===
Sheath faults are damage of the cable sheath that allows the surroundings contact with the cable screen.

=== Faults due to moisture ===
Water penetrates into the cable sheath and contacts the conductors. [[Electrical impedance|Impedance changes]] at the fault location make measuring more difficult. The resistance usually lies in the high-ohmic range.

=== Disruptions ===
Combination of series and parallel resistances, usually in the form of a wire break. The voltage is interrupted, i.e. Ω=∞ .

== Cable testing ==
To locate a fault in the cable, the cable must first be tested for faults. Cable testing is therefore usually performed first in cable fault location. During the cable test, flash-overs are generated at the weak points in the cable, which can then be localised.

== Locating the cable fault ==
[[File:Cable-measuring-van.jpg|thumb|Fault location technique on-site]]
[[File:Staatsgeschenk.jpg|thumb|right|Cable test van in China, 1975]]
The measures necessary for determining fault locations can be subdivided into individual steps.

=== Fault classification ===
Insulation and resistance measurement provides information on the fault characteristics. An insulation test measures the insulation resistance between conductor and screen; from the periodic measurement of resistance you can derive the absorption properties of the insulating material.

=== Pre-location  ===
Pre-location is used to determine the fault distance. There are predominantly two methods for this.

==== Pulse reflection method ====
A pulse induced at the starting end of the cable reaches the cable fault with a speed of v/2 and then is reflected back toward the starting end of the cable. The elapsed time multiplied by the diffusion speed v/2 gives the distance to the source of the fault. See also: ''[[Time-domain reflectometer]]''.

==== Transient method ====
In the transient method, a breakdown is triggered at the cable fault. This effects a low-resistance short circuit for a few milliseconds. This in turn produces two travelling waves diffusing in opposite directions. These waves are reflected at the cable ends so that they then travel toward each other again in the direction of the cable fault. The waves are unable to pass the fault because of the [[Electric arc|arc]] produced by the short circuit, so they are therefore reflected back again as with the pulse reflection method, which due to the burning short circuit results in a reversal of polarity. There are various ways to decouple and analyse these transients.

=== Route tracing and pinpointing ===
Route tracing is used to determine where the faulty cable lies and pinpointing is the process of determining the exact position of the cable fault.

=== Cable identification ===
In cable identification, the faulty cables are identified from the fault-free cables at the already determined site.

== Loop tests for locating faults in underground cables ==
In addition to pulse reflection method and transient method, there are two popular loop tests for finding the location of faults in underground cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricaleasy.com/2017/06/loop-tests-for-locating-faults-in-underground-cables.html|title=Loop Tests for Locating Faults in Underground Cables|website=www.electricaleasy.com|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murray loop test ===
[[File:Murray loop bridge.svg|alt=Murray loop bridge|thumb|Murray loop bridge]]
Murray loop test employes the principle of wheatstone bridge for locating the fault.To perform this test, it is necessary to have a sound cable running alongside the faulty cable. One end of the faulted cable is connected through a pair of [[resistor]]s to the voltage source. Also a [[null detector]] is connected. The other end of the cable is shorted. The circuit is shown in the figure at right. The bridge is brought to balance by changing the values of ''R&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;B2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the distance to the fault location is calculated by solving the bridge equation. See also: [[Murray loop bridge]]

=== Varley loop test ===
The similar Varley loop uses fixed resistors for RB1 and RB2, and inserts a variable resistor in the faulted leg. Test sets for cable testing can be connected for either bridge technique. If the fault resistance is high, the sensitivity of the Murray bridge is reduced and the Varley loop may be more suitable.

== Fault conversion ==
After the cable fault is identified and located, it is then possible to “burn it in” using [[burner device]]s, in other words to convert it from a high-impedance fault to a low-impedance fault. For this a Burn Down Instrument, such as Baur ATG2 Burn Down Transformer or a similar device, can be used.  A Burn Down Instrument has a Voltage Generator connected via Transformer and allows individual control of output voltage and current, a vital step for burning down High Impedance Faults.

== Cable test van ==
The conventionally used aid in cable fault testing and location is the cable test van. The van is installed with conventional cable measuring systems for quickly reaching the location of any cable fault. In 20 years that followed, over 2000 fault location vehicles were manufactured, more than half of which were intended for the former USSR. These methods of cable fault location quickly became established in Western Europe as well.

'''Cellular confinement systems''' (CCS)—also known as geocells—are widely used in construction for [[erosion control]], [[Mechanically stabilized earth|soil stabilization]] on flat ground and steep slopes, [[channel (geography)|channel]] protection, and structural reinforcement for [[structural load|load]] support and earth retention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geosyntheticsmagazine.com/articles/0606_f6_ground_rules.html Geosynthetics in landscape architecture and design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214074232/http://geosyntheticsmagazine.com/articles/0606_f6_ground_rules.html |date=2015-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical cellular confinement systems are [[geosynthetic]]s made with [[Ultrasonic welding|ultrasonically welded]] [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) strips or [[novel polymeric alloy]] (NPA)—and expanded on-site to form a honeycomb-like structure—and filled with [[sand]], soil, [[rock (geology)|rock]], gravel or [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;State of California Department of Transportation, Division of Environmental Analysis, Stormwater Program.

== History of cellular confinement ==
Research and development of cellular confinement systems (CCS) began with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1975 to devise a method for building tactical roads over soft ground.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, S.L. &amp; Watkins J.E. 1977, Investigation of Construction Techniques for Tactical Bridge Approach Roads Across Soft Ground. Soils and Pavements Laboratory, US Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, MS, Technical Report S771, September 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  Engineers found that sand-confinement systems performed better than conventional crushed stone sections and they could provide an expedient construction technique for access roads over soft ground, without being adversely affected by wet weather conditions.
&lt;ref&gt;Webster, S.L. 1979, Investigation of Beach Sand Trafficability Enhancement Using Sand-Grid Confinement and Membrane Reinforcement Concepts – Report 1, Geotechnical Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, MS, Technical Report GL7920, November 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster, S.L. 1981, Investigation of Beach Sand Trafficability Enhancement Using Sand-Grid Confinement and Membrane Reinforcement Concepts – Report 2, Geotechnical Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, MS, Technical Report GL7920(2), February 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army Corps of Engineers in Vicksburg, Mississippi (1981) experimented with a number of confining systems, from plastic pipe mats, to slotted aluminum sheets to prefabricated polymeric systems called sand grids and then, cellular confinement systems.  Today cellular confinement systems are typically made from strips 50–200&amp;nbsp;mm wide, ultrasonically welded at intervals along their width. The CCS is folded and shipped to the job site in a collapsed configuration (see picture above).

Efforts for civilian commercialization of the cellular confinement system by the Presto Products Company, led to the Geoweb®.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prestogeo.com/ Prestogeo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This cellular confinement system was made from high density polyethylene (HDPE), relatively strong, lightweight&lt;ref&gt;Webster, S.L. 1986, Sand-Grid Demonstration Roads Constructed for JLOTS II Tests at Fort Story, Virginia, Geotechnical Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, MS, Technical Report GL8619, November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and suitable for [[geosynthetic]] extruding manufacturing. The cellular confinement system was used for load support, slope erosion control and channel lining and earth retention applications in the United States and Canada in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Gregory N. "Geocells: a 25-year Perspective Part ‘l: Roadway Applications." Geotechnical Fabrics Report (2004).Richardson, Gegory N. "Geocells, a 25-year Perspective Part 2: Channel Erosion Control and Retaining Walls." Geotechnical Fabrics Report 22.8 (2004): 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel, P. &amp; Flato, G. 1987, Flow Resistance and Critical Flow Velocities for Geoweb Erosion Control System, Research and Applications Branch – National Water Research Institute Canada Centre for Inland Waters, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bathurst, R.J, Crowe, R.E. &amp; Zehaluk, A.C. 1993, Geosynthetic Cellular Confinement Cells for Gravity Retaining Wall – Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, Geosynthetic Case Histories, International Society for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, March 1993, pp. 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, R.E., Bathurst, R.J. &amp; Alston, C. 1989, Design and Construction of a Road Embankment Using Geosynthetics, Proceedings of the 42’nd Canadian Geotechnical Conference, Canadian Geotechnical Society, Winnipeg, Manitoba, October 1989, pp. 266–271&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Early research (Bathurst and Jarrett, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;Bathurst, R. J. &amp; Jarrett, P. M. 1988, Large-Scale Model Tests of Geocomposite Mattresses Over Peat Subgrades, Transportation Research Record 1188 – Effects of Geosynthetics on Soil Properties and of Environment on Pavement Systems, Transportation Research Board, 1988, pp. 2836&lt;/ref&gt; found that cellular confinement reinforced gravel bases are "equivalent to about twice the thickness of unreinforced gravel bases" and that geocells performed better than single sheet reinforcement schemes ([[geotextile]]s and [[geogrid]]s) and were more effective in reducing lateral spreading of infill under loading than conventional reinforced bases. However, Richardson (2004) (who was onsite at the US Corps of Engineers CCS Vicksburg facility) laments 25 years later on the "near absence of research papers on geocells in all of the [[geosynthetic]] national and international conferences."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Gregory N. "Geocells: a 25-year perspective Part ‘l: roadway applications." (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive review of available research literature by Yuu, et al (2008) concluded that the use of CCS technology in base reinforcement of paved roads and railways in particular was limited, due to the lack of design methods, lack of advanced research in the last two decades and limited understanding of the reinforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Yuu, J., Han, J., Rosen, A., Parsons, R. L., Leshchinsky, D. (2008) “Technical Review of Geocell-Reinforced Base Courses over Weak Subgrade,” The First Pan American Geosynthetics Conference &amp; Exhibition proceedings (GeoAmericas), Appendix VII, Cancun, Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately in the last decade research and development in geocell systems expanded significantly. Extensive research has been conducted in recent years on CCS reinforcement for roadway applications at many leading research institutes around the world, to understand the mechanisms and influencing factors of confinement reinforcement, evaluate its effectiveness in improving roadway performance, and develop design methods for roadway applications (Han, et al. 2011).&lt;ref name="Kief"/&gt;

Han (2013) summarizes comprehensive research conducted at the University of Kansas including static and cyclic plate loading tests, full-scale moving wheel tests, and numerical modeling on geocell-reinforced base courses with different infill materials and discusses the main research findings from these studies regarding permanent, elastic, and creep deformations, stiffness, bearing capacity, and stress distribution, and the development of design methods for geocell-reinforced bases. These studies showed that base courses reinforced with [[Novel Polymeric Alloy]] geocells reduced the vertical stresses at the interface between subgrade and base course, reduced permanent and creep deformations, increased elastic deformation, stiffness, and bearing capacity of base courses.&lt;ref&gt;Han, J., Thakur, J.K., Parsons, R.L., Pokharel, S.K., Leshchinsky, D., and Yang, X. (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Additional literature reviews can be found in Kief et al (2013).&lt;ref name="Kief"/&gt; and Marto (2013) &lt;ref&gt;Marto, A., Oghabi, M., Eisazadeh, A., (2013), Electronic Journal of Geotechnical Engineering. vol 18, Bund. Q., 3501-3516&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent innovations in cellular confinement technology ==

The strength and stiffness of pavement layers determines the performance of highway pavements while aggregate use impacts the cost of duration of installation; therefore alternatives are needed to improve pavement quality using new materials with less aggregate usage (Rajagopal et al 2012).&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;Rajagopal, K., Veeraragavan, A., Chandramouli, S. (2012). “Studies on Geocell Reinforced Road Pavement Structures,” Geosynthetics Asia 2012, Thailand&lt;/ref&gt; Geocells are recognized as a suitable [[geosynthetic]] reinforcement of granular soils to support static and moving wheel loads on roadways, railways and similar applications. But stiffness of the geocells was identified as a key influencing factor for geocell reinforcement, and hence the rigidity of the entire pavement structure.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emersleben, A. (2013). “Analysis of Geocell Load Transfer Mechanism Using a New Radial Load Test. Sound Geotechnical Research to Practice 2013. GeoCongress, San Diego, 345-357&lt;/ref&gt;
 	 
Utilizing recent advances in polymer and nano technology, extensive R&amp;D was carried out to improve geocell wall stiffness, thermal and elastic properties and long term creep resistance by [http://www.prs-med.com PRS Geotech]. The result was a cellular confinement system ([[Neoweb|PRS-Neoloy]]) manufactured from Neoloy, a [[novel polymeric alloy]] (NPA). NPA is a composite alloy of polyamide nano-fibers dispersed in a polyethylene matrix. It provides ductility similar to HDPE with elastic behavior similar to engineering thermoplastics, to create a stiffer and creep resistant CCS more suitable for heavy duty applications, such as base reinforcement of highways, railways, container yards, etc. that are subject to long-term heavy static and dynamic loading.&lt;ref name="Kief"/&gt;

Laboratory plate loading tests, full-scale moving wheel tests, and field demonstrations showed that the performance of geocell-reinforced bases depends on the elastic modulus of the geocell. Geocells with a higher elastic modulus had a higher bearing capacity and stiffness of the reinforced base. NPA Geocells showed higher results in ultimate bearing capacity, stiffness, and reinforcement relative to geocells made from HDPE (Pokharel, et al, 2009).&lt;ref name="Pokharel2009"&gt;Pokharel, S. K. , Han J., Leshchinsky, D., Parsons, R. L., Halahmi, I. (2009). “Experimental Evaluation of Influence Factors for Single Geocell-Reinforced Sand,” Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C., January 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; NPA geocells showed better creep resistance and better retention of stiffness and creep resistance particularly at elevated temperatures, verified by plate load testing, numerical modeling and full scale trafficking tests (Han, et al. 2011)&lt;ref name="Han2011"&gt;Han, J., Pokharel, S. K., Yang, X. and Thakur, J. (2011). Unpaved Roads: Tough Cell - Geosynthetic Reinforcement Shows Promise, Roads and Bridges, 40-43&lt;/ref&gt;(Pokharel, et al 2011).&lt;ref name="Pokharel2011"&gt;3.

=== Application vs. long-term performance ===

CCS have been successfully installed in thousands of projects worldwide. However, it is incumbent to differentiate between low load applications, such as slope and channel applications, and new heavy-duty applications, such as in the base layer of asphalt pavement structures of heavily trafficked motorways and highways.  While all polymeric materials used in CCS creep over time and under loading, the question is; what is the rate of degradation, under which conditions, how will this impact performance, and when will it fail?
 		 	
The lifespan of CCS in slope protection applications, for example, is less critical as vegetative growth and root interlock stabilize the soil. This in effect compensates for any long-term loss of confinement in the CCS. Similarly, load support applications for low volume roads that are not subject to heavy loading usually have a short design life; therefore minor loss of performance is tolerable. However, in critical applications such as reinforcement of the structural layer of asphalt highway pavements, long-term dimensional stability is critical. The required design life for such roads under heavy traffic loads is typically 20–25 years, requiring verifiable long-term durability.
 		 	
=== Development of standards for CCS ===

There were few test standards for geocells and fewer for their use in design. Test standards for CCS were developed more than 40 years ago, while other test methods evolved from 2D planar [[geosynthetic]]s. These do not reflect the composite behavior of 3D geometry of CCS, nor do they test long-term parameters such as: dynamic elastic stiffness, permanent plastic deformation and oxidation resistance. However, ISO/ASTM procedures have been developed for testing polymers in the space and automobile industries, as well as for other geosynthetic products. These new standards for CCS were proposed and under discussion by leading experts in [[geosynthetic]]s in ASTM technical committee D-35. The stated goal is to set new industry standards that more accurately reflect 3D cellular confinement system geometry and material performance in the field rather than lab tests of individual strips and virgin materials that are typically used today.

A recent development in standards for the use of reinforcement geosynthetics in roadways was recently published by in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Vega, E., van Gurp, C., Kwast, E. (2018). Geokunststoffen als Funderingswapening in Ongebonden Funderingslagen (Geosynthetics for Reinforcement of Unbound Base and Subbase Pavement Layers), SBRCURnet (CROW), Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; This standard covers geocell (as well as geogrid) applications, support mechanisms, and design principles. It also emphasizes the importance of the geocell material attributes (stiffness and creep resistance) and how they influence long-term reinforcement factors. Additional guidelines for the use of geocells in roadway applications are currently under development by the ISO and ASTM organizations, but have not yet been published.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM technical committee D-35 on geosynthetics, www.astm.org &lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==

A Cellular Confinement System when infilled with compacted soil creates a new composite entity that possesses enhanced mechanical and geotechnical properties. When the soil contained within a CCS is subjected to pressure, as in the case of a load support application, it causes lateral stresses on perimeter cell walls. The 3D zone of confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles while vertical loading on the contained infill results in high lateral stress and resistance on the cell-soil interface. These increase the shear strength of the confined soil, which:
* Creates a stiff mattress or slab to distribute the load over a wider area
* Reduces punching of soft soil
* Increases shear resistance and bearing capacity
* Decreases deformation
Confinement from adjacent cells provides additional resistance against the loaded cell through passive resistance, while lateral expansion of the infill is restricted by high hoop strength. Compaction is maintained by the confinement, resulting in long-term reinforcement.

On site, the geocell sections are fastened together and placed directly on the subsoil's surface or on a [[geotextile]] filter placed on the subgrade surface and propped open in an accordion-like fashion with an external stretcher assembly. The sections expand to an area of several tens of meters and consist of hundreds of individual cells, depending on the section and cell size.  They are then filled with various infill materials, such as soil, sand, aggregate or recycled materials and then compacted using vibratory compactors. Surface layers many be of asphalt or unbound gravel materials.

== Applications ==

=== Roadway load support ===
Cellular Confinement Systems (CCS) have been used to improve the performance of both paved and unpaved roads by reinforcing the soil in the subgrade-base interface or within the base course. The effective load distribution of CCS creates a strong, stiff cellular mattress. This 3D mattress reduces vertical differential settlement into soft subgrades, improves shear strength, and enhances load-bearing capacity, while reducing the amount of aggregate material required to extend the service life of roads. As a composite system, cellular confinement strengthens the aggregate infill, thereby simultaneously enabling the use of poorly graded inferior material (e.g. local native soils, quarry waste or recycled materials) for infill as well as reducing the structural support layer thickness.
Typical load support applications include reinforcement of base and subbase layers in flexible pavements, including: asphalt pavements; unpaved access, service and haul roads; [[Route Trident|military roads]], railway substructure and ballast confinement; working platforms in intermodal ports; airport runways and aprons, permeable pavements; pipeline road support; green parking facilities and emergency access areas.

=== Steep soil slope and channel protection ===
The three-dimensional lateral confinement of CCS along with anchoring techniques ensures the long-term stability of slopes using vegetated topsoil, aggregate or concrete surfacing (if exposed to severe mechanical and hydraulic pressures). The enhanced drainage, frictional forces and cell-soil-plant interaction of CCS prevents downslope movement and limits the impact of raindrops, channeling and hydraulic shear stresses. The perforations in the 3D cells allow the passage of water, nutrients and soil organisms. This encourages plant growth and root interlock, which further stabilizes the slope and soil mass, and facilitates landscape rehabilitation. Typical applications include: construction cut and fill slopes and stabilization; road and rail embankments; pipeline stabilization and storage facility berms; quarry and mine site restoration; channel and coastline structures. They can be built as an underlying mass or as a facing.

=== Earth retention ===
{{main|Mechanically stabilized earth}}
CCS provide steep vertical [[Mechanically stabilized earth|mechanically stabilized earth]] structures (either gravity or reinforced walls) for steep faces, walls and irregular topography. Construction of CCS earth retention is simiplified as each layer is structurally sound thereby providing access for equipment and workers, while eliminating the need for concrete formwork and curing. Local soil can be used for infill when suitable and granular, while the outer faces enable a green or tan fascia of the horizontal terraces/rows utilizing topsoil.  Walls also can be used for lining channels and in cases of high flow, it is required that the outer cells contain concrete or cementious slurry infill. CCS have been used to reinforce soft or uneven soil foundations for large area footings, for retaining wall strip footings, for load sharing of covers over pipelines and other geotechnical applications.

=== Reservoirs and landfills ===
CCS provides membrane liner protection, while creating stable soil, berms and slopes, for non-slip protection and durable impoundment of liquids and waste.  Infill treatment depends on the contained materials: concrete for ponds and reservoirs; gravel for landfill drainage and [[leachates]], vegetated infill for landscape rehabilitation. Concrete work is efficient and controlled as CCS functions as ready-made forms; CCS with concrete forms a flexible slab that accommodates minor subgrade movement and prevents cracking. In medium and low flow-velocities, CCS with [[geomembrane]]s and [[gravel]] cover can be used to create impermeable channels, thereby eliminating the need for concrete.

== Sustainable construction ==
CCS is a green solution that makes civil infrastructure projects more sustainable. In load support applications, by reducing the amount and type of infill needed to reinforce soil, the usage of haul and earthmoving equipment is reduced. This in turn decreases fuel use, pollution and the carbon footprint, and at the same time minimizes on-site disruption from dust, erosion and runoff. When used for slope applications, perforated CCS provides excellent soil protection, water drainage and growth stratum for plants. The long-term design life of advanced CCS technology means that maintenance and the associated environmental costs are significantly reduced, as are long-term economic costs.

== Additional details ==
* CCS strip widths, hence the [[In situ|on-site]] height, come in various sizes from 50 to 300&amp;nbsp;mm.
* CCS walls are usually made from textured or structured polymer sheet so as to increase frictional resistance against the infill soil from displacement.
* CCS are made of HDPE, NPA, low-density polyethylene and nonwoven heat-bonded [[geotextile]]s.
* CCS walls are typically perforated so as to allow for drainage from one cell to another.
* On steep slopes CCS may have a tendon or cable extending through the central region up the slope and anchored to, or within, a concrete plinth so as to resist downgradient sliding of the system.
* The backfilling of CCS on long and wide slopes is quite labor-intensive.  Construction equipment called phneumatic sand-slingers or stone-slingers have been used advantageously.

'''Chanekeh''', '''Chaneque''' or '''Ohuican Chaneque''', as they were called by the [[Aztec]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Bowles (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; are [[legendary creatures]] in [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[folklore]]. They are conceived of as [[Little_people_(mythology)|small, sprite-like beings]], elemental forces and guardians of nature.

By tradition, these beings would attack intruders, frightening them so that their soul would abandon their body, which the chaneques enclosed in the depth of the land. If the victim did not recover their soul through a specific [[ritual]], he or she would become ill and die soon after.

In some contemporary legends, chaneques are described as children with the face of old men or women, that make people go stray during three or seven days, after which the victims cannot recall anything that happened... although it is thought that they are taken by the chaneques to their home in the [[Underworld]], of which the entrance is a dry ''[[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]]'' tree. 
 	
In Catholic beliefs, the chaneque are the souls of the children who died without Christian baptism, and may be from precolonial times, they are a sort of violent child demon who prey on people who wander in the forest or jungles of Mexico, they confuse people to make them lost and prey on them at night, eating them, to get rid of them you have to turn your shirt inside out or yell Juan 3 times to break their spell [https://archive.is/20131006112526/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313,4605173&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL ^].&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313,4605173&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar mythical beings are common in Mesoamerican and other Latin American folkloric traditions generally, referred to in Spanish as ''[[Duende (mythology)|duende]]''.  In the folkloric tradition of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], these elementals are known as ''[[alux]]ob'' in [[Yucatec Maya]].

{{other uses}}
'''Charybdis''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|b|d|ᵻ|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Χάρυβδις, {{IPA-el|kʰárybdis|pron}}, ''Kharybdis'') was a [[sea monster]] in the [[Greek Mythology]], which was later rationalized{{when defined as|date=November 2018}} as a [[whirlpool]] and considered a shipping hazard in the [[Strait of Messina]].

==Description==
[[File:Strait of Messina.jpg|thumb|320px|The Strait of Messina, with Scylla (underlined in red) and Charybdis on the opposite shores]]
The sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel. Opposite her was [[Scylla]], another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Odyssey|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Book XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other. To be "[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater. In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large [[whirlpool]] instead of a sea monster.

The theoretical size of Charybdis remains unknown, yet in order to consume [[Greece|Greek]] ships the whirlpool can be estimated to about 23 meters (75&amp;nbsp;ft) across. Charybdis has been associated with{{qualify evidence}} the [[Strait of Messina]], off the [[coast]] of [[Sicily]] and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]].  ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=thuc.%204.24 4.24.5].''&lt;/ref&gt; Were Charybdis to be located in the Strait of Messina it would in fact have the size to accommodate the whirlpool. A whirlpool does exist there, caused by currents meeting, but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions.

== Genealogy ==
A later myth makes Charybdis the daughter of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia|Scholiast]] on Homer's ''Odyssey''&lt;/ref&gt; and living as a loyal servant to her father.[[File:Strait of Messina, cariddi.JPG|thumb|The narrowest point of [[Strait of Messina]] as seen from the village of Torre Faro]]

==Mythology==

=== Origin ===
Charybdis aided her father Poseidon in his feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and, as such, helped him engulf lands and islands in water. Zeus, angry over the land she stole from him, captured and chained her to the sea-bed. Charybdis was then cursed by the god into a hideous bladder of a monster, with flippers for arms and legs, and an uncontrollable thirst for the sea. As such, she drank the water from the sea thrice a day to quench it, which created whirlpools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Charybdis/charybdis.html|title=Charybdis|website=www.[[greekmythology]].com|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Kharybdis.html|title=CHARYBDIS (Kharybdis) - Whirlpool Monster of Greek Mythology|website=www.[[theoi]].com|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lingered on a rock with Scylla facing her directly on another rock, making a strait.

===The ''Odyssey''===
[[File:Scylla and Charybdis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 19th-century engraving of the Strait of Messina, the site associated with Scylla and Charybdis]] [[Odysseus]] faced both Charybdis and Scylla while rowing through a narrow channel. He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis, thus forcing them to pass near Scylla, which resulted in the deaths of six of his men. Later, stranded on a raft, Odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near Charybdis. His raft was sucked into her maw, but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair. On the next outflow of water, when his raft was expelled, Odysseus recovered it and paddled away safely.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' Book 12, [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey12.htm#_Toc90268048 lines 201-59 and 430-50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jason and the Argonauts===
The [[Argonauts]] were able to avoid both dangers because [[Hera]] ordered the [[Nereid]] [[nymph]] [[Thetis]], [[Achilles]]' mother, to guide them through the perilous passage.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius , ''Argonautica'' Book 4, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApolloniusRhodius4.html lines 821 – 960]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesop===
[[Aristotle]] mentions in his ''Meteorologica'' that [[Aesop and the Ferryman|Aesop]] once teased a ferryman by telling him a myth concerning Charybdis. With one gulp of the sea she brought the mountains to view; islands appeared after the next. The third is yet to come and will dry the sea altogether, thus depriving the ferryman of his livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Gert-Jan van Dijk, ''Ainoi, logoi, mythoi: fables in archaic, classical, and Hellenistic Greek literature'', Brill NL 1997,; [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKQFJduPIdcC&amp;q=charybdis#v=snippet&amp;q=charybdis&amp;f=false pp.351-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal sediment transport''' (a subset of [[sediment transport]]) is the interaction of coastal land forms to various complex interactions of physical processes.&lt;ref name="Komar"&gt;Komar, Paul D. Crc Handbook of Coastal Processes and Erosion. Crc Series in Marine Science. Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;Bird, E. C. F. Coasts. An Introduction to Systematic Geomorphology,. Cambridge, Mass.,: M.I.T. Press, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary agent in coastal sediment transport is wave activity (see [[Wind wave]]), followed by tides and storm surge (see [[Tide]] and [[Storm surge]]), and near shore currents (see [[Sea#Currents]]) .&lt;ref name="Komar" /&gt; Wind-generated waves play a key role in the transfer of energy from the open ocean to the coastlines.&lt;ref name="Komar" /&gt; In addition to the physical processes acting upon the '''shore''', the size distribution of the sediment is a critical determination for how the beach will change (see '''Grain size determination'''). These various interactions generate a wide variety of '''beaches'''. (see [[Beach]]). Other than the interactions between coastal land forms and physical processes there is also the addition of modification of these landforms through anthropogenic sources (see '''human modifications'''). Some of the anthropogenic sources of modification have been put in place to halt erosion or prevent harbors from filling up with sediment.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt; In order to assist community planners, local governments, and national governments a variety of models have been developed to predict the changes of beach sediment transport at coastal locations. Typically, during large wave events, the sediment gets transported off the beach face a deposited offshore generating a sandbar. Once the significant wave event has diminished, the sediment then gets slowly transported back onshore.&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;

== History ==

In the mid-1970s a significant amount of attention was paid to coastal sediment transport. In part, due to the National Sea Grant College Program and the U.S. Congress Mandated Sea Grant Act of 1976. One of the research areas included "''the development and the experimental verification of hydrodynamic laws governing the transport of marine sediments in the flow fields occurring in coastal waters.''" &lt;ref name="Seymour"/&gt; From this request for research, the Office of Sea Grant reviewed, accepted, and funded the Nearshore Sediment Transport Study (NSTS). Due to unforeseen complications the NSTS conducted only two major field experiments and a validation experiment.&lt;ref name="Seymour"/&gt; This was a significant contribution to the field of coastal sediment transport and helped initialize a great deal of future research.

== Glossary ==

; shore : zone between the water's edge at normal low tide and the landward limit of effective wave action.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;
; shoreline : the water's edge, migrating up and down with the tide.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;
; foreshore : exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide.
; backshore : extending above normal high tide level.
; nearshore zone : between shoreline and the line where the waves begin to break.&lt;ref name="Bird"/&gt;
; beach : an accumulation of loose sediment sometimes confined to the backshore but often extending across the foreshore as well.

== Beach profile measurements ==

A variety of measurements are used to determine the beach profile, sediment grain size, and various other important parameters to determine what is influencing coastal sediment transport. Below are a few of the multitude.

=== Coastal research amphibious buggy (CRAB) ===

A three-wheeled vehicle deployed at the beach to measure the beach profile. (more information can be found at http://frf.usace.army.mil/vehicles2.stm)

=== Emory beach profile measurement ===

[[File:Method for collecting beach sediment and beach profile.jpg|thumb|right|A simple depiction of measuring a beach profile and compiling a median grain size.]]
In order to determine what the profile of a beach looks like, one method for determination is the Emory Beach Profiling Method. Initiating a benchmark, the researcher establishes a control point to start the surveys at. Typically this is far enough away from the swash zone that large changes in elevation will not occur during the sampling time. Once the initial benchmark is established, the researcher will take the Emory sampling device and measure the change in elevation over the distance the device is covering. Then, they will pick up the device and move it to the end point of their last survey, and so on. Until they reach the shoreline. Typically this is done during neap tide (see [[Tide]] for more information on neap tide).

=== Grain size determination ===

Since the sand grain diameters can vary throughout the entire beach the median grain size is used to determine sediment fall velocity. Determining sediment fall velocity allows the determination of what sediment is left where...&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, Robert G., and Robert A. Dalrymple.

* Breakwaters
* Dredging of harbor entrances
* Dumping of material on the coast and offshore
* Reduction of coastal vegetation (cutting, burning, grazing, pollution)

== Models ==

Models for the prediction of sediment transport in coastal regions have been used since the mid 1970s.&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;Seymour, Richard J. Nearshore Sediment Transport. New York ; London: Plenum Press, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some transport models are:

Later, with the introduction of radio, code letters were also used as radio call signs.

==History==

In 1857, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] sponsored the ''Commercial Code of Signals for the Use of All Nations at Sea'', which introduced four letter flag signal codes to identify individual ships.  The Commercial Code of Signals, c. 1900, was modified to become the [[International Code of Signals]]. By the 1860s, individual ships were being allocated code letters in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. From 1874, code letters were recorded in [[Lloyd's Register]] as part of each individual vessel's entry in the register. Generally, code letters allocated to a ship remained with that ship, although there are known cases where new code letters have been allocated following a change of port of registry or owner. Code Letters were sometimes reallocated once a ship had been struck from the register, but no two ships bore the same code letters at the same time.&lt;ref name=Code&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~j_lowe/C%20Signals%20Codes.htm |title=The allocation and use of ship identification signal codes for merchant ships to WWII |publisher= Jeremy Lowe |accessdate=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of radio for communications, code letters were used also as radio call signs.&lt;ref name=Callsign&gt;[http://www.seefunknetz.de/oxka.htm This website] has a transcript of radio communications between {{MS|Hans Hedtoft}} (OXKA) and FV ''Johannes Krüss'' (DEQW).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flags used==
Code letters used the twenty-six flags that represent the letters of the alphabet, plus the ten flags that represent the digits 0 - 9 also have been used.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; The substitute flags have not been used for call signs.

Each flag has own name. If the ship's call sign is "'''3EJH2'''" {{ICS|Three}}{{ICS|Echo}}{{ICS|Juliet}}{{ICS|Hotel}}{{ICS|Two}} (Panama Flag)&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; the seamen never say "Three E J H Two". They say "Three Echo Juliet Hotel Two" to avoid misunderstanding as every country seamen have own pronunciation of letters and during speech over radio letters can be inaudible.

If call sign has 4 characters, the first character or figure of ship's call signs means country code for the ships registered under this country flag. If call sign has 5 characters, the first two characters or figure plus character of ship's call signs means country code for the ships registered under this country flag. The variations 4 or 5 characters due to 36 characters (26 letters + 10 digits) are not enough for all countries. For or the [[Soviet Union]] was used character "'''U'''" as the first character in call signs: cargo ship [[SS Metallurg Anosov|''Metallurg Anosov'']] had call sign "'''USMW'''" {{ICS|Uniform}}{{ICS|Sierra}}{{ICS|Mike}}{{ICS|Whiskey}}. In case that the ship changes the flag she has to change call sign also. For example, the ship [[SS Heinrich Arp|''Heinrich Arp'']]: Code Letters "'''RDWL'''" (1923-34) {{ICS|Romeo}}{{ICS|Delta}}{{ICS|Whiskey}}{{ICS|Lima}} were changed to Code Letters "'''DHKV'''" (1934-45) {{ICS|Delta}}{{ICS|Hotel}}{{ICS|Kilo}}{{ICS|Victor}} and from 1946 once more to the Soviet Union Ship's call sign (unknown, but first character was "U").

If the ship is scrapped or sunk, her call sign can be given to another ship and, usually after a long time.

The last three characters of ship's call sign usually mean nothing, but can be one of them used as a code of the government Shipping Companies if the country has more than one Shipping companies.

Today, each sea-going ship must keep on board the book or computer's play-disk "List of Ship Stations and Maritime Mobile Service Identity Assignments" of [[ITU]] publication, fresh edition, where listed all sea-going ships and their call signs also. This book must be fresh due to renewal (new edition had place every some years). in this book (or disk) mentioned:
"Call sign formed from the international call sign series in accordance with Article 19, Section III of the [[Radio Regulations]] ([[ITU Radio Regulations|RR]]). The sign = (equal) in this column indicates that the name of the ship is used to identify the station in radiotelephony."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S02020000244501PDFE.PDF  ITU &gt;&gt; "Radio Regulations Articles", Edition of 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/terrestrial/mars/Pages/ListVDescriptionoffields.aspx ITU &gt;&gt; List of Ship Stations and Maritime Mobile Service Identity Assignments - Description of fields.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some canals or narrow places have special requirements for the vessels to hoist their call sign flags during the transit through the area. The [[Suez Canal]] was once such place where this requirement was made. Thanks to technological advances in the navigation abilities of marine craft, this action is no longer compulsory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12534">[[File:Spaghetti Rock.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1.0 – A vertical viewpoint of a rock outcrop that has undergone ductile deformation to create a series of asymmetric folds.]]

In [[Earth science]], as opposed to [[Materials science|Materials Science]], '''Ductility''' refers to the capacity of a [[rock (geology)|rock]] to deform to large strains without macroscopic fracturing.&lt;ref name="Fossen"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=01PI5jhjiiQC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=ductile+geology+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=ductile%20geology%20definition&amp;f=false|title=Structural Geology|last=Fossen|first=H.|date=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521516648|pages=|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such behavior may occur in unlithified or poorly [[Diagenesis#Lithification|lithified]] [[sediment]]s, in weak materials such as [[halite]] or at greater depths in all rock types where higher temperatures promote [[dislocation creep|crystal plasticity]] and higher [[overburden pressure|confining pressure]]s suppress brittle fracture. In addition, when a material is behaving ductilely, it exhibits a linear [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] vs [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] relationship past the elastic limit.&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;

Ductile deformation is typically characterized by diffuse deformation (i.e. lacking a discrete [[fault (geology)|fault plane]]) and on a [[Stress–strain curve|stress-strain]] plot is accompanied by steady state sliding at failure, compared to the sharp stress drop observed in experiments during [[Brittleness|brittle failure]].&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;

==Brittle-Ductile Transition Zone==
{{main|brittle-ductile transition zone}}
The brittle-ductile transition zone is characterized by a change in rock failure mode, at an approximate average depth of 10–15&amp;nbsp;km (~ 6.2–9.3 miles) in [[continental crust]], below which [[rock (geology)|rock]] becomes less likely to fracture and more likely to deform ductilely. The zone exists because as depth increases confining pressure increases, and brittle strength increases with confining pressure whilst ductile strength decreases with increasing temperature. The transition zone occurs at the point where brittle strength equals ductile strength.&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt; In [[glacial]] [[ice]] this zone is at approximately {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on|-1}} depth.

Not all materials, however, abide by this transition. It is possible and not rare for material above the transition zone to deform ductilely, and for material below to deform in a brittle manner. The depth of the material does exert an influence on the mode of deformation, but other substances, such as loose soils in the upper crust, malleable rocks, biological debris, and more are just a few examples of that which does not deform in accordance to the transition zone.&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoshihara|first=Hiroshi|date=2014-01-06|title=Plasticity Analysis of the Strain in the Tangential Direction of Solid Wood Subjected to Compression Load in the Longitudinal Direction|url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_09_1_1097_Yoshihara_Plasticity_Analysis_Tangential_Longitudinal|journal=BioResources|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1097–1110|doi=10.15376/biores.9.1.1097-1110|issn=1930-2126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brittle Ductile.png|thumb|350x350px|Fig. 1.1 – A generalized diagram of the deformation mechanisms and structural formations that dominate at certain depths within the Earth's crust.]]

The type of dominating deformation process also has a great impact on the types of rocks and structures found at certain depths within the Earth's crust. As evident from Fig. 1.1, different geological formations and rocks are found in accordance to the dominant deformation process. Gouge and [[Breccia]] form in the uppermost, brittle regime while [[Cataclasite]] and [[Pseudotachylite]] form in the lower parts of the brittle regime, edging upon the transition zone. [[Mylonite]] forms in the more ductile regime at greater depths while Blastomylonite forms well past the transition zone and well into the ductile regime, even deeper into the crust.

== Quantification ==
Ductility is a material property that can be expressed in a variety of ways. Mathematically, it is commonly expressed as a ''total quantity of elongation'' or a ''total quantity of the change in cross sectional area'' of a specific rock until macroscopic brittle behavior, such as fracturing, is observed. For accurate measurement, this must be done under several controlled conditions, including but not limited to [[Pressure]], [[Temperature]], [[Water content|Moisture Content]], Sample Size, etc., for all can impact the measured ductility. It is important to understand that even the same type of rock or mineral may exhibit different behavior and degrees of ductility due to internal heterogeneities small scale differences between each individual sample. The two quantities are expressed in the form of a ratio or a percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Materials Science &amp; Engineering|last=Callister|first=William|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]|year=2007|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

% Elongation of a Rock = &lt;math&gt;\%\Delta l = \frac{l_f-l_i}{l_i}\times100
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt; = Initial Length of Rock

&lt;math&gt;l_f 
&lt;/math&gt; = Final Length of Rock

% Change in Area of a Rock = &lt;math&gt;\%\Delta A = \frac{A_f-A_i}{A_i}\times100 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;A_i
 &lt;/math&gt; = Initial Area

&lt;math&gt;A_f &lt;/math&gt; = Final Area

For each of these methods of quantifying, one must take measurements of both the initial and final dimensions of the rock sample. For Elongation, the measurement is a uni-dimensional initial and final length, the former measured before any [[Stress (mechanics)|Stress]] is applied and the latter measuring the length of the sample after fracture occurs. For Area, it is strongly preferable to use a rock that has been cut into a cylindrical shape before stress application so that the cross-sectional area of the sample can be taken.

Cross-Sectional Area of a Cylinder = Area of a Circle =  &lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using this, the initial and final areas of the sample can be used to quantify the % change in the area of the rock.

[[File:Stress Strain Ductile Material.pdf|thumb|Fig. 1.2 – Stress vs Strain Curve displaying both ductile and brittle deformation behavior.]]

== Deformation ==
Any material is shown to be able to deform ductilely or brittlely, in which the type of deformation is governed by both the external conditions around the rock and the internal conditions sample. External conditions include temperature, confining pressure, presence of fluids, etc. while internal conditions include the arrangement of the crystal lattice, the chemical composition of the rock sample, the grain size of the material, etc.&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;

Ductilely Deformative behavior can be grouped into three categories: Elastic, Viscous, and Crystal-Plastic Deformation.

&lt;u&gt;Elastic Deformation&lt;/u&gt;

Elastic Deformation is deformation which exhibits a linear stress-strain relationship (quantified by Young's Modulus) and is derived from [[Hooke's law|Hooke's Law]] of spring forces (see Fig. 1.2). In elastic deformation, objects show no permanent deformation after the stress has been removed from the system and return to their original state.&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = E \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = Stress (In Pascals)

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = Young's Modulus (In Pascals)

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = Strain (Unitless)

&lt;u&gt;Viscous Deformation&lt;/u&gt;

Viscous Deformation is when rocks behave and deform more like a fluid than a solid. This often occurs under great amounts of pressure and at very high temperatures. In viscous deformation, stress is proportional to the strain rate, and each rock sample has its own material property called its [[Viscosity]]. Unlike elastic deformation, viscous deformation is permanent even after the stress has been removed.&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \eta\xi&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = Stress (In Pascals)

&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; = Viscosity (In Pascals * Seconds)

&lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; = Strain Rate (In 1/Seconds)

&lt;u&gt;Crystal-Plastic Deformation&lt;/u&gt;

Crystal-Plastic Deformation occurs at the atomic scale and is governed by its own set of specific mechanisms that deform crystals by the movements of atoms and atomic planes through the crystal lattice. Like viscous deformation, it is also a permanent form of deformation. Mechanisms of crystal-plastic deformation include [[Pressure solution]], [[Dislocation creep]], and [[Diffusion creep]].&lt;ref name="Fossen" /&gt;

== Biological materials ==
In addition to rocks, biological materials such as wood, lumber, bone, etc. can be assessed for their ductility as well, for many behave in the same manner and possess the same characteristics as abiotic Earth materials. This assessment was done in Hiroshi Yoshihara's experiment, "Plasticity Analysis of the Strain in the Tangential Direction of Solid Woo Subjected to Compression Load in the Longitudinal Direction." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study aimed to analyze the behavioral [[rheology]] of 2 wood specimens, the Sitka Spruce and Japanese Birch. In the past, it was shown that solid wood, when subjected to compressional stresses, initially has a linear stress-strain diagram (indicative of elastic deformation) and later, under greater load, demonstrates a non-linear diagram indicative of ductile objects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To analyze the rheology, the stress was restricted to uniaxial compression in the longitudinal direction and the post-linear behavior was analyzed using plasticity theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Controls included moisture content in the lumber, lack of defects such as knots or grain distortions, temperature at 20 C, relative humidity at 65%, and size of the cut shapes of the wood samples.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Results obtained from the experiment exhibited a linear stress-strain relationship during elastic deformation but also an unexpected non-linear relationship between stress and strain for the lumber after the elastic limit was reached, deviating from the model of plasticity theory. Multiple reasons were suggested as to why this came about. First, since wood is a biological material, it was suggested that under great stress in the experiment, the crushing of cells within the sample could have been a cause for deviation from perfectly plastic behavior. With greater destruction of cellular material, the stress-strain relationship is hypothesized to become more and more nonlinear and non-ideal with greater stress. Additionally, because the samples were inhomogeneous (non-uniform) materials, it was assumed that some bending or distortion may have occurred in the samples that could have deviated the stress from being perfectly uniaxial. This may have also been induced by other factors like irregularities in the cellular density profile and distorted sample cutting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The conclusions of the research accurately showed that although biological materials can behave like rocks undergoing deformation, there are many other factors and variables that must be considered, making it difficult to standardize the ductility and material properties of a biological substance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Peak Ductility Demand ==
Peak Ductility Demand is a quantity used particularly in the fields of architecture, geological engineering, and mechanical engineering. It is defined as the amount of ductile deformation a material must be able to withstand (when exposed to a stress) without brittle fracture or failure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhai|first=Chang-Hai|last2=Wen|first2=Wei-Ping|last3=Chen|first3=ZhiQiang|last4=Li|first4=Shuang|last5=Xie|first5=Li-Li|date=2013-02-01|title=Damage spectra for the mainshock–aftershock sequence-type ground motions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267726112002369|journal=Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering|volume=45|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.soildyn.2012.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is particularly useful in the analysis of failure of structures in response to earthquakes and seismic waves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It has been shown that earthquake aftershocks can increase the peak ductility demand with respect to the mainshocks by up to 10%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Energy economics''' is a broad [[science|scientific]] subject area which includes topics related to [[energy supply|supply]] and [[energy demand|use]] of [[energy]] in [[society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sickles, Robin (2008). "energy economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000082&amp;q=energy%20&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of [[academic discipline]]s, energy economics does not present itself as a self-contained academic discipline, but it is an applied subdiscipline of [[economics]]. From the list of [[Scientific discipline#Economics|main topics of economics]], some relate strongly to energy economics:
* [[Computable general equilibrium]]
* [[Econometrics]]
* [[Environmental economics]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Industrial organization]]
* [[Input–output model]]
* [[Microeconomics]]
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* [[Operations research]]
* [[Resource economics]]
Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy [[engineering]], [[geology]], [[political sciences]], [[ecology]] etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:
* [[Climate change]] and [[climate policy]]
* [[Demand response]]
* [[Elasticity (economics)|Elasticity]] of [[supply and demand]] in [[energy market]]
* Energy and [[economic growth]]
* [[Energy derivative]]s
* [[Energy elasticity]]
* [[Energy forecasting]]
* [[Energy market]]s and [[electricity market]]s  - [[liberalisation]], (de- or re-) [[regulation]]
* Economics of [[energy infrastructure]]
* [[Energy policy]]
* [[Environmental policy]]
* [[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] and [[security of supply]]
* [[Sustainability]]

Some institutions of higher education ([[universities]]) recognise energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a [[curriculum]]. The [[University of Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit| Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] are the top three research universities, and [[Resources for the Future]] the top research institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.ene.html IDEAS/RePEc]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other research departments, companies and professionals offering energy economics studies and consultations.

==History==
[[File:World energy prices 1991-2010.png|thumb|World prices for energy, 1991-2010. 2000=100.]]
Energy related issues have been actively present in economic literature since the [[1973 oil crisis]], but have their roots much further back in the history. As early as 1865, [[William Stanley Jevons|W.S. Jevons]] expressed his concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book ''The Coal Question''. One of the best known early attempts to work on the economics of exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by [[Harold Hotelling|H. Hotelling]], who derived a price path for [[non-renewable resources]], known as [[Hotelling's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hotelling |first=H. |title=The Economics of Exhaustible Resources |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |year=1931 |pages=137–175 |jstor=1822328 |doi=10.1086/254195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cochlea''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|l|i|ə}} is Latin for “snail, shell or screw” and originates from the Greek word κοχλίας ''kohlias''. The modern definition, the auditory portion of the [[inner ear]], originated in the late 17th century. Within the mammalian cochlea exists the [[organ of Corti]], which contains [[hair cell]]s that are responsible for translating the vibrations it receives from surrounding fluid-filled ducts into [[electrical impulse]]s that are sent to the brain to process sound.&lt;ref name=Dugdale /&gt; This spiral-shaped cochlea is estimated to have originated during the early [[Cretaceous Period]], around 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Further, the auditory innervation of the spiral-shaped cochlea also traces back to the Cretaceous period.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The evolution of the human cochlea is a major area of scientific interest because of its favourable representation in the [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; During the last century, many scientists such as evolutionary biologists and paleontologists strove to develop new methods and techniques to overcome the many obstacles associated with working with ancient, delicate artifacts.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; In the past, scientists were limited in their ability to fully examine specimens without causing damage to them.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; In more recent times, technologies such as micro-CT scanning became available.&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt; These technologies allow for the visual differentiation between fossilized animal materials and other sedimentary remains.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; With the use of X-ray technologies, it is possible to ascertain some information about the auditory capabilities of extinct creatures, giving insight to human ancestors as well as their contemporary species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt;

== Comparative anatomy ==
While the basic structure of the inner ear in [[lepidosaurs]] (lizards and snakes), [[archosaurs]] (birds and crocodilians) and [[mammals]] is similar, and the organs are considered to be homologous, each group has a unique type of auditory organ.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The hearing organ arose within the lagenar duct of stem reptiles, lying between the saccular and lagenar epithelia. In lepidosaurs, the hearing organ, the basilar papilla, is generally small, with at most 2000 hair cells, whereas in archosaurs the basilar papilla can be much longer (&gt;10mm in owls) and contain many more hair cells that show two typical size extremes, the short and the tall hair cells. In mammals, the structure is known as the organ of Corti and shows a unique arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells. All mammalian organs of Corti contain a supporting tunnel made up of pillar cells, on the inner side of which there are inner hair cells and outer hair cells on the outer side. The [[definitive mammalian middle ear]] and the elongated cochlea allows for better sensitivity for higher frequencies.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

=== Lepidosaurs ===
As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) middle ear transmits sound to the footplate of the columella, which sends a pressure wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. In contrast, lizards tend to have two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5–8&amp;nbsp;kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Archosaurs ===
In birds and crocodilians, the similarity of the structure of the [[basilar papilla]] betrays their close evolutionary relationship. The basilar papilla is up to about 10mm long and contains up to 16500 hair cells. While most birds have an upper hearing limit of only about 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, the barn owl can hear up to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz and thus close to the human upper limit.&lt;ref name=Koeppl /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
{{See also|Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles}}
Egg-laying mammals, the monotremes (spiny anteater and platypus), do not have a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7&amp;nbsp;mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Amphibians ===
Amphibians have unique inner ear structures. There are two sensory papillae involved in hearing, the basilar (higher frequency) and amphibian (lower frequency) papillae, but it is uncertain whether either is homologous to the hearing organs of lepidosaurs, archosaurs and mammals and we have no idea when they arose.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Fish ===
Fish have no dedicated auditory epithelium, but use various vestibular sensory organs that respond to sound. In most teleost fishes it is the saccular macula that responds to sound. In some, such as goldfishes, there is also a special bony connection to the gas bladder that increases sensitivity allowing hearing up to about 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Neanderthals to modern humans ===
The size of cochlea has been measured throughout its evolution based on the fossil record. In one study, the basal turn of the cochlea was measured, and it was hypothesized that cochlear size correlates with body mass. The size of the basal turn of the cochlea was not different in Neanderthals and Holocene humans, however it became larger in early modern humans and Upper Paleolithic humans. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the cochlea is similar between Neanderthals and Holocene humans, relative to plane of the lateral canal, whereas early modern and upper Paleolithic humans have a more superiorly placed cochlea than Holocene humans. When comparing hominins of the Middle Pleistocene and Neanderthals and Holocene humans, the apex of the cochlea faces more inferiorly in the hominins than the latter two groups. Finally, the cochlea of European middle Pleistocene hominins faces more inferiorly than Neanderthals, modern humans, and Homo erectus.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt;
Human beings, along with Apes, are the only mammals that do not have high frequency (&gt;32&amp;nbsp;kHz) hearing.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt; Humans have long cochleae, but the space devoted to each frequency range is quite large (2.5mm per octave), resulting in a comparatively reduced upper frequency limit.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The human cochlea has approximately 2.5 turns around the modiolus (the axis).&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Humans, like many mammals and birds, are able to perceive auditory signals that displace the eardrum by a mere picometre.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;

== The ear ==
Because of its prominence and preserved state in the fossil record, until recently, the ear had been used to determine phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; The ear itself contains different portions, including the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear and all of these show evolutionary changes that are often unique to each lineage [14]. It was the independent evolution of a tympanic middle ear in the Triassic era that produced strong selection pressures towards improved hearing organs in the separate lineages of land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The cochlea is the tri-chambered auditory detection portion of the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt; Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials.&lt;ref name=Fernandez /&gt; This leads to the investigation of the relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

This spiral-shaped cochlea that is in both marsupial and placental mammals is traced back to approximately 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name= Manley /&gt; The development of the most basic basilar papilla (the auditory organ that later evolved into the Organ of Corti in mammals) happened at the same time as the water-to-land transition of vertebrates, approximately 380 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The actual coiling or spiral nature of the cochlea occurred to save space inside the skull.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The longer the cochlea, the higher is the potential resolution of sound frequencies given the same hearing range.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The oldest of the truly coiled mammalian cochleae were approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

The earliest evidence available for primates depicts a short cochlea with prominent laminae, suggesting that they had good high-frequency sensitivity as opposed to low-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; After this, over a period of around 60 million years, evidence suggests that primates developed longer cochleae and less prominent laminae, which means that they had an improvement in low-frequency sensitivity and a decrease in high-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; By the early Miocene period, the cycle of the elongation of the cochleae and the deterioration of the laminae was completed.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Evidence shows that primates have had an increasing cochlear volume to body mass ratio over time.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; These changes in the cochlear labyrinth volume negatively affect the highest and lowest audible frequencies, causing a downward shift.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Non-primates appear to have smaller cochlear labyrinth volumes overall when compared to primates.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Some evidence also suggests that selective forces for the larger cochlear labyrinth may have started after the basal primate node.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt;
 
Mammals are the subject of a substantial amount of research not only because of the potential knowledge to be gained regarding humans, but also because of their rich and abundant representation in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; The spiral shape of the cochlea evolved later on in the evolutionary pathway of mammals than previously believed, just before the therians split into the two lineages marsupials and placentals, about 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley  /&gt;

=== The evolution of prestins ===

Parallel to the evolution of the cochlea, [[prestins]] show an increased rate of evolution in therian mammals. Prestins are located in the outer hair cells of mammalian cochlea and are considered motor proteins. They are found in the hair cells of all vertebrates, including fish, but are thought to have initially been membrane transporter molecules. A high concentration of prestins are found only in the lateral membranes of therian outer hair cells (there is uncertainty with regard to concentrations in monotremes). This high concentration is not found in inner hair cells, and is also lacking in all hair cell types of non-mammals.&lt;ref name=Koeppl2 /&gt;  Prestin also has a role in motility, which evolved a greater importance in the motor function in land vertebrates, but this developed vastly differently in different lineages. In certain birds and mammals, prestins function as both transporters and motors, but the strongest evolution to robust motor dynamics only evolved in therian mammals. It is hypothesized that this motor system is significant to the therian cochlea at high frequencies because of the distinctive cellular and bony composition of the organ of Corti that allows the prestins to intensify movements of the whole structure.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;
Modern ultra-sound echolocating species such as bats and toothed whales show highly evolved prestins, and these prestins show identical sequence alterations over time. Unusually, the sequences thus apparently evolved independent from each other during different time periods. Furthermore, the evolution of neurotransmitter receptor systems (acetylcholine) that regulate the motor feedback of the outer hair cells coincides with prestin evolution in therians. This suggests that there was a parallel evolution of a control system and a motor system in the inner ear of therian mammals.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Homoplasies (convergent evolution) ===
Land vertebrates evolved middle ears independently in each major lineage, and are this the result of parallel evolution.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The configurations of the middle ears of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Furthermore, it is apparent that the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.&lt;ref name=Kitazawa /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">A '''failed supernova''' is an [[transient astronomical event|astronomical event]] in [[time domain astronomy]] in which a star suddenly brightens as in the early stage of a [[supernova]], but then does not increase to the massive flux of a supernova. They could be counted as a subcategory of [[supernova imposter]]s. They have sometimes misleadingly been called '''unnovae'''.&lt;ref name=woosley&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2012ApJ...752...32W|arxiv=1110.3842|title=Long Gamma-Ray Transients from Collapsars|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=752|pages=32|author1=Woosley|first1=S. E.|last2=Heger|first2=Alexander|year=2012|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/752/1/32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Failed supernovae are thought to create [[stellar black hole]]s by the collapsing of a [[red supergiant]] star in the early stages of a supernova. When the star can no longer support itself, the core collapses completely, forming a [[stellar-mass black hole]], and consuming the nascent supernova without having the massive explosion. For a distant observer, the red supergiant star will seem to wink out of existence with little or no flare-up. The observed instances of these disappearances seem to involve [[supergiant star]]s with masses above 17 [[solar masses]].

Failed supernovae are one of several events that theoretically signal the advent of a [[black hole]] born from an extremely massive star, others including [[hypernova]]e and long-duration [[gamma-ray burst]]s.

==Structure and process==
Theoretically, a [[red supergiant]] star may be too massive to explode into a [[supernova]], and collapse directly into being a [[black hole]], without the bright flash. They would however generate a burst of [[gravitational wave]]s. This process would occur in the higher mass red supergiants, explaining the absence of observed supernovae with such [[supernova progenitor|progenitors]].&lt;ref name=SciAm-2015-11&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Scientific American |title= Gone Without A Bang |author= Lee Billings |volume= 313 |issue= 5 |date= November 2015 |pages= 26–27 |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican1115-26b |bibcode = 2015SciAm.313e..26B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT-2011-04-02&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.universetoday.com/84596/finding-the-failed-supernovae/ |title= Finding the Failed Supernovae |author= Jon Voisey |date= 2 April 2011 |publisher= [[Universe Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quark2QSR-2014-01-20&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fromquarkstoquasars.com/failed-supernova/ |title= Failed Supernovae |author= Colin Robson |date= 20 January 2014 |publisher= From Quarks to Quasars }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AstronomyMagazine-2016-09-27/&gt;

The '''gemstone irradiation''' is a process in which a [[gemstone]] is artificially [[Irradiation|irradiated]] in order to enhance its optical properties. High levels of [[ionizing radiation]] can change the [[atomic structure]] of the gemstone's [[crystal lattice]], which in turn alters the optical properties within it.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_170&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurlbut|Kammerling|1991|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the gemstone's color may be significantly altered or the visibility of its inclusions may be lessened. The process, widely practised in [[jewelry industry]],&lt;ref name=Omi&gt;{{Harvnb|Omi|Rela|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is done in either a [[nuclear reactor]] for [[neutron]] bombardment, a [[particle accelerator]] for [[electron]] bombardment, or a [[gamma ray]] facility using the [[radioactive isotope]] [[cobalt-60]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_170/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/irradiated-gemstones.html|title = Fact Sheet on Irradiated Gemstones|publisher = The U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]|date = February 2008|accessdate = November 30, 2008}} ''This article incorporates text from the source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Irradiation has enabled the creation of gemstone colors that do not exist or are extremely rare in nature.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_170/&gt;

==Radioactivity and regulations==
[[File:irrdiamond.jpg|thumb|Pure diamonds, before and after irradiation and annealing. Clockwise from left bottom: 1) Initial (2×2 mm) 2-4) Irradiated by different doses of 2-MeV electrons 5-6) Irradiated by different doses and annealed at 800 °C.]]
The term ''irradiation'' is a very broad one, which covers bombardment by [[subatomic particle]]s as well as the use of the full range of [[electromagnetic radiation]], including (in order of increasing [[frequency]] and decreasing [[wavelength]]) [[infrared|infrared radiation]], [[visible spectrum|visible light]], [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref name=Nassau_343&gt;{{Harvnb|Nassau|1980|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Certain natural gemstone colors, such as blue-to-green colors in [[diamond]]s, are the results of the exposure to natural radiation in the earth, which is usually [[Alpha particle|alpha]] or [[beta particle]].&lt;ref name=King_48&gt;{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited penetrating ability of these particles result in partial coloring of the diamond's surface.&lt;ref name=King_48/&gt; Only high-energy radiation such as gamma ray or [[neutron]] can produce fully saturated body colors,&lt;ref name=King_48/&gt; and the sources of these types of radiation are rare in nature, which necessitates the artificial treatment in jewelry industry.

Irradiation, particularly when done in a nuclear reactor, can make gemstones slightly radioactive,&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_172&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurlbut|Kammerling|1991|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; so they are typically set aside for a couple of months to allow any residual radioactivity to [[radioactive decay|decay]].&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; The first documented artificially irradiated gemstone was created by English chemist [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1905, by burying a diamond in powdered [[radium bromide]].&lt;ref name=Tilden_145&gt;{{Harvnb|Tilden|1916|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_158&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurlbut|Kammerling|1991|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having been kept there for 16 months, the previously colorless diamond became green.&lt;ref name=Tilden_145/&gt; This method produced a dangerously high degree of long-term residual radioactivity and is no longer in use.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_216&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurlbut|Kammerling|1991|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, radium-treated green diamonds are still occasionally found in markets, which can be detected by a [[Geiger counter]] or by making [[autoradiograph]]s on [[photographic film]]s.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_216/&gt;

The concerns for possible health risks related to the residual radioactivity of the gemstones led to government regulations in many countries.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_170/&gt; In the United States, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) has set strict limits on the allowable levels of residual radioactivity before an irradiated gemstone can be distributed in the country.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; All neutron- or electron beam-irradiated gemstones must be tested by an NRC-licensee prior to release for sales.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; In India, the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] started irradiating gemstones in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Book of Gems|first = Nataraja|last = Sarma|isbn = 81-291-0819-4|publisher = Rupa. Co|chapter = Author's note}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, the [[Office of Atoms for Peace]] (OAP) conducts the process for private sectors, irradiating {{convert|413|kg}} of gemstones from 1993 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gems Enhancement by Irradiation Technique|url = http://www.oaep.go.th/clinictechno/gems_eng.html|year = 2006|publisher = Office of Atoms for Peace|accessdate = December 4, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061222092148/http://www.oaep.go.th/clinictechno/gems_eng.html|archivedate = December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly irradiated gemstone is [[topaz]], which becomes blue after the process.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; Blue topaz is very rare in nature and almost always the result of artificial irradiation.&lt;ref name=Skuratowicz_13&gt;{{Harvnb|Skuratowicz|Nash|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Gem Trade Association, approximately 30&amp;nbsp;million [[Carat (unit)|carat]]s ({{convert|6000|kg|abbr=on}}) of topaz are irradiated every year globally, 40&amp;nbsp;percent of which were done in the United States as of 1988.&lt;ref name=Ashbaugh_III_205&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashbaugh III|1988|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, no topaz is neutron irradiated in the US; major treatment areas are Germany and Poland.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} A lot of linear accelerated treatment is done in Bangkok.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Diamonds are usually irradiated to become yellow, blue-green or green, although other colors are possible.&lt;ref name=Skuratowicz_13/&gt;

[[Quartz]] may be irradiated to produce [[amethyst]] and other colors.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Colorless [[beryl]]s, also called goshenite, become pure yellow when irradiated, which are called golden beryl or heliodor.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_170/&gt;

[[Pearl]]s are irradiated to produce gray blue or gray-to-black colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sofianides|Harlow|1991|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of using a cobalt-60 gamma ray facility to darken white Akoya pearls were patented in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Univ_Texas&gt;{{cite web|title = Pearl|url = http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/347k/redesign/gem_notes/pearl/pearl_main.htm|publisher = Department of Geological Sciences, [[University of Texas at Austin]]|year = 1998|accessdate = May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the gamma ray treatment does not alter the color of the pearl's [[nacre]], therefore is not effective if the pearl has a thick or non-transparent nacre.&lt;ref name=Univ_Texas/&gt; Most black pearls available in markets prior to the late 1970s had been either irradiated or dyed.&lt;ref name=Univ_Texas/&gt;

=== Uniformity of coloration ===
Gemstones that have been subjected to artificial irradiation generally show no visible evidence of the process,&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_127&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurlbut|Kammerling|1991|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some diamonds irradiated in an [[electron beam]] may show color concentrations around the [[culet]] or along the keel line.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_127/&gt;

In topaz, some irradiation sources may produce mixtures of blue and yellow-to-brown colors, so heating is required as an additional procedure to remove the yellowish color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sofianides|Harlow|1991|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color stability ===
In some cases, the new colors induced by artificial irradiation may fade rapidly when exposed to light or gentle heat,&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_057&gt;{{Harvnb|Hurlbut|Kammerling|1991|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; so some laboratories submit them to a "fade test" to determine color stability.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_057/&gt; Sometimes colorless or pink beryls become deep blue upon irradiation, which are called Maxixe-type beryl. However, the color easily fades when exposed to heat or light, so it has no practical jewelry application.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut_170/&gt;

The '''Grid Analysis and Display System'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentation of GrADS |publisher=Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies, Institute of Global Environment and Society, [[George Mason University]] |url=http://www.iges.org/grads/gadoc/ |accessdate=14 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407042441/http://www.iges.org/grads/gadoc/ |archivedate=7 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''GrADS''') is an interactive [[desktop computer|desktop]] tool that is used for easy access, manipulation, and visualization of [[earth science]] data. The format of the data may be either [[binary file|binary]], [[GRIB]], [[NetCDF]], or [[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF]]-SDS (Scientific Data Sets). GrADS has been implemented worldwide on a variety of commonly used [[operating system]]s and is freely distributed over the [[Internet]].

'''GrADS''' uses a 4-Dimensional data environment: [[longitude]], latitude, vertical level, and time. Data sets are placed within the 4-D space by use of a [[file descriptor|data descriptor file]]. '''GrADS''' interprets station data as well as gridded data, and the grids may be regular, non-linearly spaced, [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]], or of variable resolution. Data from different data sets may be graphically overlaid, with correct spatial and time registration. It uses the ''ctl'' mechanism to join differing time group data sets. Operations are executed interactively by entering [[FORTRAN]]-like expressions at the command line. A rich set of built-in functions are provided, but users may also add their own functions as external routines written in any programming language.

Data may be displayed using a variety of graphical techniques: line and bar graphs, scatter plots, smoothed [[contour line|contours]], shaded contours, [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], wind [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, grid boxes, shaded grid boxes, and station model plots. Graphics may be output in [[PostScript]] or image formats. '''GrADS''' provides geophysically intuitive defaults, but the user has the option to control all aspects of graphics output.

'''GrADS''' has a programmable interface ([[scripting language]]) that allows for sophisticated analysis and display applications.  Scripts can display buttons and drop menus as well as graphics, and then take action based on user point-and-clicks. GrADS can be run in [[Batch processing|batch mode]], and the scripting language facilitates using GrADS to do long overnight batch jobs. As of version 2.2.0, graphics display and printing are now handled as independent plug-ins. A C-language Python extension for GrADS called GradsPy was introduced in version 2.2.1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24854">The [[ecology]] of the [[Great Plains]] is diverse, largely owing to their great size. Differences in rainfall, elevation, and latitude create a variety of habitats including [[short-grass prairie|short grass]], [[mixed-grass prairie|mixed grass]], and [[tall-grass prairie]]s, and [[riparian]] ecosystems.&lt;ref name=“Hultman”&gt;{{cite book | last= Hultman |first= G. Eric. | date= 1978 | title= Trees, shrubs, and flowers of the Midwest | url= | location= Chicago |publisher= Contemporary Books |page= | isbn= 0809276933 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;


The Great Plains extend from [[Mexico]] in the south through the central [[United States]] to central [[Canada]]. Many sub-regions exist within the area.

The region is home to many animals, including [[American bison]], [[pronghorn]], [[mule deer|mule]], and [[white tailed deer]], and birds such as ducks, hawks, and sparrows, along with many invertebrate species.

Settlement of "America's breadbasket" led to ecological destruction. Widespread agriculture led to the near-complete extermination of the American bison in the late 1800s and the reduction of the tallgrass prairie to less than 1% of its former extent.&lt;ref name="tallgrass prairie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve|url=https://www.nps.gov/tapr/index.htm|website=National Park Service|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plains are now largely agricultural, with large ranches and farms. However, restoration efforts in some areas, like [[Montana]]'s [[American Prairie Reserve]], are leading to the gradual expansion of the threatened ecosystem.

== Climate ==

The climate is  unique due to the many different wind patterns that flow throughout the region, traveling from east to west and north to south. Due to the fact that this region is geographically positioned in the center of the United States and Canada, there are many different air mass types that pass through and affect the constantly shifting weather patterns. This means that the Great Plains has a less consistent climate due to its central location than a region located on the coast. This is shown by how the western Great Plains is semi-arid, while the eastern portion of the Great Plains is much wetter. It has the four [[season]]s of summer, autumn, winter, spring, but each season brings new extremes in the weather conditions. For example, the southern portions of the region typically experience 70 to 100 days each year over 90&amp;nbsp;°F, while the northern portions typically see only 10 to 20 days above 90&amp;nbsp;°F. It’s the air masses that come in from all directions that bring this variable climate.

Each air mass type brings in different temperature and moisture properties. The continental polar air mass brings in cold and dry air from central Canada, traveling south across the region. The continental tropical air mass comes in from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, bringing in hot and dry air while moving north. The maritime tropical air mass comes from the southwest United States and Northern Mexico, and it tends to bring in warm and moist air, but sometimes the air that comes in is dry. The last air mass that affects this ecoregion is the maritime polar air mass. It comes in from the [[Pacific Ocean]] and moves east over the mountain regions. It brings in cool moist air that changes to warm dry air after moving over the mountains. These air masses cause the seasons to be very extreme and drastic. The winter time brings harsh and varied weather. The midsummer months bring in warm moist and dry air, depending on the area within the region and what air masses affect those areas.

Paralleling the varying climate patterns is the precipitation. The areas nearest the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where the atmospheric moisture is greatest, will receive more than forty inches of precipitation annually. The wastern areas of the region, such as Montana, receive less than fourteen inches annually. In the winter time, the southern region has less than an inch of snowfall, while the northern regions receive more than forty. The spring time is also a season that brings much precipitation to the Great Plains through the cold, dry air masses that interact with the air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, creating outbreaks of severe thunderstorms with heavy rainfall, high winds, hail, and tornadoes.  Most of the winter season in the Northern Plains actually has a snow blanket over a majority of the winter season. This shows how there is consistent precipitation over the region during the winter months, while in the heat of summer there is more chance for drought with sporadic heavy rains.

=== Climate change ===

Due to the highly variable climatic regimes across the Great Plains, many aspects of [[climate change]] are not expected to affect all areas of the eco-region equally. In regards to precipitation, this means an exacerbation of extremes where dry areas in the south are expected to get drier and wetter areas in the north to get wetter. In turn this will increase the intensity of already problematic droughts across the region as well as creating the potential for flooding in the wetter north. The percent change in precipitation for both areas is dependent upon different emission scenarios; with higher emission levels in the future being conducive to greater extremes. Dramatic increases in average annual temperature are also expected, with average winter temperatures already having risen 7&amp; nbsp;°F in the past 30 years. These increased temperatures are expected to cause warmer winters with warmer springs as well as hotter summers in the south-central plains.

In regards to the biotic communities of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt in a variety of ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms out of sync with their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.

== Geology, topography, and soil ==

Originally massive glaciers that formed in Canada moved southward over the central and low-elevation plains located in the United States.  These glaciers and their deposits had great effects on the surface of the land they covered, with biggest changes occurring between the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Ohio River]]s. One key [[abiotic factor]] that affects Great Plains is weather in relation to the low- relief topography as result of glacial smoothing. Low relief topography is used to describe areas that have little difference in altitude throughout the region. Low relief landscapes, such as the various types of grasslands found throughout the Great Plains, have an effect on rainfall distribution. Rainfall in this ecoregion increases from west to east resulting in various types of prairie grasslands.

Topography in the Great Plains actually affects soil composition in areas of different elevation. Higher accumulations of [[soil organic matter]] are found in lower landscape positions such as grasslands than in higher landscape positions such as buttes, mesas, and escarpments found throughout the north western areas of the ecoregion. In the short grass regions such as the High Plains of the Great Plains, soil typically stores no moisture annually because vegetation depends on whatever water exists in the soil during dry spells. Soil in this region is typically drained, composed of loam and clay. Specialized plants such as various species of [[forbs]] and shrubs utilize this soil. Some adaptations that plants have acquired in this region include massive and intricate root systems that make up around 90 percent of the plants biomass. This allows the plants to stay securely planted in ground and have roots that reach moisture in the deepest sections of the soil. In tall grass prairies, water is less scarce and the soil contains more moisture resulting a smaller root biomass.

== Hydrology ==

The Great Plains ecoregion comprises a number of water bodies which play an integral role in its unique hydrology. There are thirteen rivers that are considered to be located within the Great Plains region. Most of the rivers that originate in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] region in the west are a source of irrigation for farms. These rivers benefit greatly from melted snow pack from the mountains, which feeds the rivers during the growing season. Another water source in the Great Plains is wetlands, with the greatest concentrations located in the northern glaciated region of the plains. Up to half of areas in the northern Great Plains are wetlands. These, as well as the wetlands in the [[Nebraska]] [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sandhills]], serve as major breeding, staging, and nesting habitat for migratory waterfowl. [[Dry lake|Playas]], or temporary lakes, in the southwestern United States also provide habitats for migrating waterfowl from Canada and the United States during the winter.

[[File:PlayaLake-USFWS.jpg|thumb|A playa lake during the wet season. Playa lakes are important breeding grounds for migratory waterfowl.]]

The [[Ogallala aquifer]], or the High Plains aquifer, is an integral fresh water source for the entirety of the Great Plains region, providing drinking water to 80% of the population and irrigating 13 million acres of land. Precipitation, seasonal lakes, and prehistoric water reserves serve as sources of water for the aquifer, which lies beneath 174,000 square miles of the Central and Southern regions, contains 3.25 billion acre-feet of water, and which is used by around 200,000 irrigation wells. Around 95% of the water pumped out of the aquifer is used for irrigation for the extensive areas of farmland in the Great Plains. The playa lakes, or seasonal lakes, are the primary sources of recharge for the aquifer, with an average of 0.5 inches per year as the recharge rate for the entire High Plains region. Population, agricultural, and economic growth have increased the demand for water in the areas that rely on the aquifer, causing the average level of water in the aquifer to drop by 13 feet since 1950.

== Environmental threats ==

The environmental threats that pose the most harm toward the Great Plains include water depletion, land degradation, and increasing temperature change. The winter months have become much warmer in the Plains, whether it is in the North, near [[North Dakota]], or in the South, throughout [[Texas]] and bordering states, excluding the winters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Though the winters are getting warmer, it is predicted that the summer months will have a greater increase than the temperatures in the winter months.&lt;ref name="Cambridge2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambridge University|title=Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States|year=2009|publisher=US Global Change Research Program|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effects of this increase in temperature is predicted to cause more frequent extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. This great increase in temperature will be the cause of the increased depletion of already declining water sources. Depleting water in the Great Plains will affect all populations in a negative way. "Most of the water used in the Great Plains comes from the High Plains aquifer (sometimes referred to by the name of its largest formation, the Ogallala aquifer), which stretches from [[South Dakota]] to Texas."&lt;ref name="Cambridge2009" /&gt; Conserving water in the Great Plains is one of the most important factors in keeping the Great Plains sustainable. It is also very important that farmers who use the land are sustainable in their practices. Since there are many different sustainable ways of farming, it is hard to decide which way would be the most sustainable. However, according to the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, farmers are not very likely to change their ways, leaving the outcome questionable for the Great Plains.&lt;ref name="Sims1969"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=J.|author2=Saarinen, T. |title=COPING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT: GREAT PLAINS FARMERS AND THE SUDDEN STORM|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=1969|volume=59|issue=4|pages=677–686|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1969.tb01806.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "What is really needed are new methods, concepts, and measuring techniques".&lt;ref name="Sims1969" /&gt; The biggest challenge in changing the sustainability in such a large ecoregion is getting the a large portion of farmers using the land to practice in a way that does not harm the land, which poses to be a challenge since there are so many different farming practices. "Prairie conservation requires: 1) New technology...to prioritize and set context to save prairie, 2) ecologically based initiatives to reverse significant losses in area and condition of native grasslands, 3) rethinking of standardized tools in the range management profession, and 4) a new natural resource agency."&lt;ref name="Past, Present, Future ecosystems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samson|first1=Fred B.|last2=Knopf|first2=Fritz L.|last3=Ostlie|first3=Wayne R.|title=Great Plains Ecosystems: Past, Present, and Future|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=usgsstaffpub|page=7|website=University of Nebraska|publisher=University of Nebraska}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitats==

There are many different types of habitats in the Great Plains, because of its great size. Differences in latitude and longitude, as well as differences in elevation and proximity to water, shape the ecosystems of these grasslands.

===Tallgrass prairies===
[[File:Tallgrass prairie flora Andropogon gerardii.jpg|thumb|Flowering [[big bluestem]], a characteristic tallgrass prairie plant]]
[[Tallgrass prairie]]s are found in the southern and eastern section of the great plains. It once covered 170 million acres in North America. Now, less than 4% remains, mostly in the [[Kansas]] [[Flint Hills]].&lt;ref name="tallgrass prairie" /&gt; This area is lower and wetter than the High Plains and is warmer than many other regions. Some areas here receive more than 40 inches of annual precipitation. Grasses here include bluestems, along with many other species. Historically, many areas of the Midwest that are now forested were once tallgrass prairie. Fire is very important in maintaining the prairie. Without it, many areas can become forested.

===Short-grass prairies===
[[Short-grass prairie]]s are found in the high plains of [[Colorado]], Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, [[New Mexico]], North Dakota, [[Oklahoma]], South Dakota, Texas, and [[Wyoming]]. 70% of the original short-grass prairie remains today, making it one of the least fragmented prairie ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Wrangle"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Short Grass Prairie|url=https://wrangle.org/ecotype/north-american-short-grass-prairie|website=World Rangeland Learning Experience|publisher=World Rangeland Learning Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristic flora ==

Grasslands occur where there is insufficient rain to support trees, thus only grasses and a few shrubs can survive. There are three kinds of grasslands on the great plains, short grass prairie, mixed grass, and long grass prairie. In each of these, grass species serve all the keystone roles. They provide food, shelter, act as larval hosts for numerous species and acted as the primary food for buffalo. These grasses are of vital importance to the ecosystem and protect the soil from the strong winds that whip through the prairie. They are all drought resistant and have strong short roots that hold the soil in place.&lt;ref name=“Hultman” /&gt;

In short grass prairie there are two dominant plants, [[buffalo grass]] (''Bouteloua dactyloides''), is a strong and hardy grass that is the favorite of grazers.

Big bluestem grass is 4–8 feet tall and was the favorite food of the buffalo.

== Characteristic fauna ==

A "keystone species" is a species that "has disproportionate importance in their community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moquet|first=N.|author2=Gravel, D. |author3=Massol, F. |author4=Calcagno, V. |author5=Blasius, B. |title=Extending the concept of keystone species to communities and ecosystems|journal=Ecology Letters|year=2013|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1111/ele.12014|pmid=23062191|editor1-last=Blasius|editor1-first=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keystone species on the great plains include the bison and the prairie dog. Many other species live on the grasslands, including deer, rabbits, mice, and many types of birds.

===Prairie dogs===
[[File:Cynomys ludovicianus.jpg|thumb|left|Two black-tailed prairie dogs]]
In the Great Plains, the [[prairie dog]] is a keystone species. Studies comparing species abundances in areas of colonization against areas with no prairie dog colonization show clear evidence that the prairie dog does have a significant impact on its surroundings by altering vegetation and therefore affecting habitat and food availability for other species. There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the prairie dog’s extensive grazing on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the prairie dog also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the [[desert cottontail]], [[striped skunk]] and [[deer mouse]] use for shelter. A strong characteristic of keystone species is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the prairie dog does this. In conclusion, the prairie dog is an iconic animal species North America. Its close link to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining keystone species of the ecoregion.

There are several types of prairie dogs in the ecoregion, including [[black-tailed prairie dog|black-tailed]], [[white-tailed prairie dog|white-tailed]], and [[Gunnison's prairie dog|Gunnison's]], though the black-tailed is the most abundant and widespread.

===Bison===

[[File:Bison Bull in Nebraska.jpg|thumb|An American bison. (''Bison bison'')]]
The American bison (Bison bison) once roamed the Great Plains grasslands in vast herds.  Their total population numbers were once in the tens of millions and spanned most of North America.&lt;ref name="Freese2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freese|first=Curtis H.|title=Second Chance for the Plains Bison|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2007|volume=136|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2006.11.019|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bison was, in colloquial terms, the lawnmower of the grasslands, but their dwindling numbers have severely reduced their ecological impact. The bison's large influence as a grazer, a major converter of plant to animal biomass, and a key link in nutrient recycling have been lost.&lt;ref name="Knapp1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knapp|first=Alan K.|title=The Keystone Role of Bison in North American Tallgrass Prairie|journal=BioScience|year=1999|volume=49|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.2307/1313492|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their grazing habits were pivotal in allowing for the establishment of much of the biodiversity observed today in the region, including the prairie dog.&lt;ref name="Freese2007" /&gt; Along with fire, bison were responsible for the removal of excess plant material that accumulated in the grassland.&lt;ref name="Knapp1999" /&gt; With the accumulation of dead plant material, seed germination is greatly hindered and biodiversity is held stagnant. The purging of excess biomass helped to promote and maintain biodiversity among plant species on the plains.  While the American bison once played a keystone role in both the establishment and maintenance of the Great Plain’s current biodiversity, the severely reduced population that still remains has little ecological effect on the Great Plains ecoregion.

== Endangered species ==

[[File:Indiana bat.jpg|thumb|An Indiana bat (''Myotis sodalis'')]]
The [[Indiana bat]] is an important predator within the Great Plains. The Indiana bat perpetuates biodiversity by consuming moths, mosquitoes, and flies under the night sky. This bat sleeps in abandoned caves and mines during the winter months for hibernation and under tree bark during the warmer seasons. This Indiana bat is endangered mainly due to human disturbance within the caves. However, help is underway to protect this species. Besides showing hospitality to these bats, gates are going up to prohibit visitors from entering the caves and mines during the hibernation months. Studies are also ensuing to try and discover other factors diminishing the Indiana bat’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife - Indiana Bat Fact Sheet|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/greenmountain/htm/greenmountain/links/wildlife/tes_links/indiana_bat_factsheet.htm|work=The United States Forest Service Federation|publisher=USDA Forest Service|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dwindling species of the Great Plains is the [[Cypripedium candidum|Small White Lady’s Slipper]]. There are only 100 of these orchids left. [[Invasive species]] and land conservationists have equally played a part in demolishing this population; as well as people plucking these flowers. The only working conservation action to salvage the Small White Lady’s Slippers requires controlled fires; eliminating surrounding invasive plants and providing the Small White Lady’s Slippers with enough surface area and nutrients to repopulate. This plant needs to grow next to a fungus in order to survive because of the symbiotic relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510072234/http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/wildflowers/smallwhiteladysslipper.html|archivedate=10 May 2013|last=Lynn|first=A.|title=Small White Lady's Slipper Plants|url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/wildflowers/smallwhiteladysslipper.html|work=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The cable was first brought ashore in July 27, 1866, after several failed attempts.&lt;ref name=CBC_2016&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IrishCentral&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=James |date=9 February 2018 |title=Canadian government want Kerry Island to become UNESCO World Heritage site |url=https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/canada-kerry-island-unesco-world-heritage-site |work=Irish Central |location= |access-date=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cable was brought to Heart's Content by the ''[[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]]'', the largest steamship afloat at the time.&lt;ref name=TCE_HC&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Pitt |first1=Robert D. |last2=Pitt |first2=Janet E.M. |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |title=Heart's Content |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/hearts-content/ |access-date=7 July 2018 |language= |edition= |date=13 April 2015 |publisher=Government of Canada |series= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages= |archive-url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable maintenance ships would regularly visit Heart's Content to repair and perform maintenance on the cables.&lt;ref name=lighthouse&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_hl_eng.aspx?id=15052&amp;i=72313 |title=Heart's Content Lighthouse |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations |publisher=[[Parks Canada]] |access-date=7 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first messages were sent across the cable using [[Morse code]], with three people working at the Heart's Content station to send and receive these messages.&lt;ref name=CBC_2016&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the cable station was originally established in Heart's Content by the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]], it was later taken over by the [[Western Union Telegraph Company]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=HistoricPlaces_district&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=19612 |title=Heart’s Content Registered Heritage District |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Canada's Historic Places |publisher=[[Parks Canada]] |access-date=7 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Anglo-American Telegraph Company owned the station, they commission the construction of staff housing in Heart's Content.&lt;ref name=HistoricPlaces_district&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The town saw another construction boom when Western Union purchased the station.&lt;ref name=HistoricPlaces_district&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, over 200 people in Heart's Content worked for the cable company, bringing in trained professionals from [[Canada]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name=HistoricPlaces_district&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the years succeeding [[World War One]], cable traffic began to slow down and automated equipment started being installed at the station.&lt;ref name=HistoricPlaces_district&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The station was closed in 1965, due to the telegraph cable becoming obsolete with the emergence of [[Submarine_communications_cable#Transatlantic_telephony|trans-oceanic telephone cables]] and [[communications satellites]].&lt;ref name=PHS_About&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Heart's Content Cable Station.jpg|thumb|The Heart's Content Cable Station, with the 1876 original building on the left (red) and 1918 extension on the right (white)]]
Construction of the cable station office started in 1875 and was completed in 1876.&lt;ref name=HistoricPlaces&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PHS_About&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by J.J.

'''Hispanic America''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Hispanoamérica'', or ''América hispana''), also known as '''Spanish America''' (Spanish: ''América española''), is the region comprising the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking nations]] in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;All of the following dictionaries only list "Spanish America" as the name for this cultural region. None list "Hispanic America." All list the [[demonym]] for the people of the region discussed in this article as the sole definition, or one of the definitions, for "Spanish American". Some list "Hispanic," "Hispanic American" and "Hispano-American" as [[synonym]]s for "Spanish American."

These countries have significant commonalities with each other and with [[Spain]], its former [[Spanish Empire#The Empire On Which The Sun Never Sets: The Golden Age (1521–1643)|European metropole]]. In all of these countries, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the main language, sometimes sharing official status with one or more [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] (such as [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], or [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]), or [[English language|English]] (in Puerto Rico).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2098.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Field Listing – Languages|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Field Listing – Religions|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hispanic America is sometimes grouped together with [[Brazil]] under the term "[[Ibero-America]]", meaning those countries in the Americas with cultural roots in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;The adjective "Ibero-American" usually refers only to countries of the Western Hemisphere, but in the title of the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] it refers to Iberian ''and'' (Ibero-)American countries, plus [[Equatorial Guinea]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanic America also contrasts with [[Latin America]], which includes not only Hispanic America, but also Brazil, as well as the former [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonies]] in the Western Hemisphere (areas that are now in either the [[United States of America]] or [[Canada]] are usually excluded).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Latin+America "Latin America"] The Free Online Dictionary (''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 2000, 4th ed.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of the Americas]] began in 1492, and ultimately was part of a larger historical process of world [[discovery (observation)|discovery]], through which various [[Europe]]an powers incorporated a considerable amount of territory and peoples in the Americas, Asia, and Africa between the 15th and 20th centuries. Hispanic America became the main part of the vast [[Spanish Empire]].

[[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s [[Peninsular War|takeover of Spain]] in 1808 and the consequent chaos initiated the dismemberment of the Spanish Empire, as the Hispanic American territories began their [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for emancipation]]. By 1830, the only remaining Spanish American and Asian territories were the [[Philippines|Philippine]] archipelago and the islands of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], until the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]].

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language in most Hispanic American countries, and it is spoken by the vast majority of the population. [[Native American languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Mexico]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] amongst other countries. In some Hispanic American countries, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains the largest variety of indigenous languages than any other Hispanic American country, and the most spoken native language is Nahuatl.

In [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaraní hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo language|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as "national languages" along with Spanish.

Other European languages spoken in Hispanic America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]]; [[German language|German]], in southern [[Chile]] and portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Paraguay]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Argentina, Venezuela, and Uruguay; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] in Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patagonline.com/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] can be heard around Buenos Aires. Non-European or Asian languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay; [[Korean language|Korean]] in Argentina and Paraguay; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile; and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] throughout South America.

In several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken. Creole languages of mainland Latin America, similarly, are derived from European languages and various African tongues.

The [[Garifuna language]] is spoken along the Caribbean coast in [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Belize]] mostly by the [[Garifuna people]] a mixed race [[Zambo]] people who were the result of mixing between Indigenous Caribbeans and escaped Black slaves. Primarily an [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language]], it has influences from Caribbean and European languages.

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
[[Hispanic cuisine]] as the term is applied in the Western Hemisphere, is a misnomer. What is  usually considered Hispanic cuisine in the United States is mostly [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Central American]] cuisine. Mexican cuisine is composed of mainly indigenous—[[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]]—and Spanish influences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Mexican cuisine]] is considered [[intangible cultural heritage]] by UNESCO and can be found all over the United States.

In the United States, with its growing Hispanic population, food staples from [[Mexican cuisine]] and the cuisine from other Hispanic countries have become widely available. Over the years, the blending of these cuisines has produced unique American forms such as [[Tex-Mex cuisine]]. This cuisine, which originated in Texas, is based on maize products, heavily spiced ground beef, cheese and tomato sauces with chilies. This cuisine is widely available not just in the United States but across other countries, where American exports are found. In Florida, Cuban food is widely available. All of these Hispanic foods in the United States have evolved in character as they have been commercially americanized by large restaurant chains and food companies.

The cuisine of Spain has many regional varieties, with [[Mediterranean]] flavors based on  [[olive oil]], garlic, and [[tomato]]es and due to its long Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines, has been graced with a great variety and availability of [[seafood]].  In the inland communities of Spain, there is a long tradition of cured meat of different kinds, in addition to an abundance of dishes such as roasts and stews, based on beef, pork, lamb, and poultry. The European and Arab heritage of Spain is reflected in its food, along with cosmopolitan influences beginning in the many new ingredients brought in from the New World since the 16th century, e.g. tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and the more modern tastes introduced from Europe since the 19th century, especially through French and Italian dishes. It is only in the last ten years {{When|date=January 2014}} that Hispanic American dishes have been introduced in Spain. In the United States and Canada, the number of Hispanic restaurants has become a growing trend, following the ''[[tapas]]''-style restaurants fashion that first appeared in North America in the 1990s.

Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican cuisines, on the other hand, tend to use a lot of [[pork]] and can depend heavily on starchy [[root vegetable]]s, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], and [[rice]]. The most prominent influences on their Spanish culinary traditions were introduced by African slaves, and to a lesser degree, French influence from Haiti and later Chinese immigrants. The use of spicy chile peppers of varying degrees of strength used as flavour enhancers in Mexican tradition is practically unknown in traditional Spanish–Caribbean dishes. The cuisine of Haiti, a country with a [[Francophone]] majority, is very similar to its regional neighbors in terms of influences and ingredients used.

The [[Argentine cuisine|Argentine]] diet is heavily influenced by the country's position as one of the world's largest [[beef]] and [[wine]] producers, and by the impact that [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigration had on its national culture. Grilled meats are a staple of most meals as are [[pasta]]s, potatoes, rice, [[paella]] and a variety of vegetables (Argentina is a huge exporter of agricultural products). Italian influence is also seen in the form of [[pizza]] and [[ice cream]], both of which are integral components of national cuisine. Chilean cuisine is similar to that of Argentina, though seafood is much more dominant in this coastal nation. As another one of the world's largest producers, wine is as much a staple drink to Chileans as beer is to Germans.

In [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], potato dishes are typical since the potato is originally from this region. Beef and [[chicken]] are common sources of meat. In the Highlands is the ''cuy'', a South American name for [[guinea pig]], a common meat. Given the coastal location, both countries have extensive fishing fleets, which provide a wealth of seafood options, including the signature South American dish, [[ceviche]]. While potato is an important ingredient in the Highlands, Rice is the main side dish on the coast.

This diversity in staples and cuisine is also evident in the differing regional cuisines within the national borders of the individual countries.

====Flag====
[[File:Flag of the Hispanicity.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Flag of the Hispanic People|Flag of Hispanic Heritage]]. Motto: ''Justicia, Paz, Unión y Fraternidad'' ("Justice, Peace, Union and Fraternity").&lt;ref name=flag&gt;{{cite web|author=Raeside, Rob (ed.)|title=Flag of the Race|date=1999-10-11|work=Flags of the World|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-raza.html|accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While relatively unknown, there is a flag representing the countries of Spanish America, its people, history and shared cultural legacy.

It was created in October 1933 by Ángel Camblor, [[Captain (land)|captain]] of the [[Military of Uruguay|Uruguayan army]]. It was adopted by all the states of Spanish America during the [[Pan-American Conference]] of the same year in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="flag" /&gt;

The white background stands for peace, the [[Inti]] [[solar deity|sun god]] of [[Inca mythology]] symbolizes the light shining on the Americas, and the three crosses represent [[Christopher Columbus]]' [[caravel]]s, the ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'', and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', used in his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] from Spain to the [[New World]] in 1492. The [[Lilac (color)#Deep lilac|deep lilac]] color of the crosses evokes the color of the [[lion]] on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Crown of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;Image of the [[:Image:Estandarte de la Corona de Castilla.png|standard of the Crown of Castile]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10005">The '''New England Fifty Finest''' is a list of [[mountain]]s in [[New England]], used in the [[mountaineering]] sport of [[peak bagging]]. The list comprises the 50 summits with the highest [[topographic prominence]] — a peak's height above the lowest contour which encloses that peak and no higher peak. The list includes 20 peaks in [[Maine]], 15 in [[Vermont]], 14 in [[New Hampshire]], and one in [[Massachusetts]].

This list differs substantially from lists of peaks by elevation, such as the [[Four-thousand footers|New England 4000 Footers]].  For instance, only one peak in the [[Presidential Range]] is on this list because the others do not have a major prominence, being connected to [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] by ridgelines that are nowhere below {{convert|4900|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}}. Mount Washington has an [[elevation]] above [[sea level]] of {{convert|6288|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} but has a prominence of about {{convert|6150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} because it stands that high above its [[key col]] — the lowest ground on the ridge line connecting Washington to the higher peaks of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]].  Washington's key col is at the [[Champlain Canal]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the lowest ground on the [[water divide]] between the [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]]s.  

Of the 48 New Hampshire Four-thousand Footers, only eight are also on this list, including [[Mount Lafayette]] and [[Carter Dome]], which are the high points of the [[Franconia Range]] and the [[Carter-Moriah Range]], respectively. The list includes several [[monadnock]]s, including the eponymous [[Mount Monadnock]], and the high points of several small mountain ranges which have high prominence by virtue of their isolation from higher peaks by surrounding low ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42282">'''Ramsar sites''' are natural locations under the protection of the [[Ramsar Convention]] for the conservation and sustainable utilization of [[wetlands]]. As of March 2013 there were 35 '''Ramsar sites in Russia,''' totalling an area of {{convert|10323767|ha|km2|disp=output only}}.&lt;ref name="Ramsar list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramsar List|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/sitelist.pdf|publisher=Ramsar.org|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Russian sites registered in the Ramsar Convention, on 11 October 1976 (during the [[Soviet era]]), were [[Kandalaksha Bay]] [[Lake Khanka]] and the [[Volga River]] [[river delta|delta]].

The area is on a major migration route for birds, between West Siberia and wintering grounds from western Europe to southwestern Asia.&lt;ref name="ramsar-tobol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobol-Ishim Forest-steppe|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/679|website=RAMSAR Sites Information Service|publisher=RAMSAR Programme|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Located on the border between Russia and Mongolia, Torry Lakes is a system of soda lakes in the steppe region southeast of [[Lake Baikal]].  The biodiversity of the site is very high because it is a meeting zone of many fauna communities: taiga, tundra, broad-leaved forests, and steppe.  Over 305 bird species have been recorded, including 90 breeding species.  Much of the site is protected by the [[Daursky Nature Reserve]].&lt;ref name="ramsar-torey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Torey Lakes|url=http://www.ramsar.org/torey-lakes|website=RAMSAR Sites Information Service|publisher=RAMSAR Programme|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| 
| The Upper Dvuobje site is a network of floodplain tributaries of the [[Ob River]] on the [[West Siberian Plain]].  The site features meandering river channels, permanent and seasonal lakes, forested islands, and meadows.  Because of the wide variety of habitats interacting with each other, the terrestrial and aquatic life is diverse.  Migrating birds number 500,000 to 3 million each year, and 300,000 are estimated to breed on the site.&lt;ref name="ramsar-upper-dvuobje"&gt;{{cite web|title=Upper Dvuobje|url=http://www.ramsar.org/upper-dvuobje|website=RAMSAR Sites Information Service|publisher=RAMSAR Programme|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The Utkholok site is located on the west coast of the [[Kamchatka peninsula]], on and surrounding Cape Cape Utkholoksky, which juts out into the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and the wetlands of the Utkholok River and Kvachina River.  With extensive tundra wetlands (mostly [[Empetrum|Crowberry]] and [[Carex|sedges]]) and bogs, the area is important to migrating and breeding birds, particularly the [[Bean Goose]] (Anser fabalis).  The rivers are important spawning grounds for [[Golden trout]].&lt;ref name="ramsar-utkholok"&gt;{{cite web|title=Utkholok|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/696|website=RAMSAR Sites Information Service|publisher=RAMSAR Programme|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norway]] has 47 [[national park]]s, of which 37 are on the mainland and 7 on [[Svalbard]]. National parks in Norway are stricter than many other countries, and nearly all motorized vehicles are prohibited. The [[freedom to roam]] applies, thus hiking, skiing and camping throughout the park are permitted, given that consideration to nature is taken. Roads, accommodation and national park centers are located outside the national parks. The parks are under the management of the [[Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management]] and the local [[county governor (Norway)|county governor]].&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.dirnat.no/multimedia/48381/Kart-og-informasjon-eng.pdf |title=Maps and information |publisher=[[Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management]] |format=PDF |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234128/http://english.dirnat.no/multimedia/48381/Kart-og-informasjon-eng.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ytre Hvaler National Park|Ytre Hvaler]] is a [[marine park]] and all parks in Svalbard also contain marine areas. [[Sør-Spitsbergen National Park|Sør-Spitsbergen]] is the largest park, covering an area of {{convert|13286|km2|abbr=on}}, although only {{convert|5141|km2|abbr=on}} is land.&lt;ref name=svalbard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dirnat.no/attachment.ap?id=1043 |title=Protected Areas in Svalbard |publisher=[[Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management]] |accessdate=14 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65uFT8vgO?url=http://www.dirnat.no/attachment.ap?id=1043 |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest park on the mainland is [[Hardangervidda National Park|Hardangervidda]], which covers an area of {{convert|3422|km2|abbr=on}}. [[Gutulia National Park|Gutulia]] is the smallest, covering {{convert|23|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=info /&gt;

== Geography and history ==
At least 60% of Norway's area is mountainous, lakes or bogs (non-arable land, some of it is used as pastures); 37% is forest of various kinds; and only 3% arable land. It is estimated that between 1900 and 2003 areas more than 5&amp;nbsp;km from intense construction activity has decreased from 48% to 12% in Norway.

Until about one hundred years ago there was relatively little threat to ecosystems in Norway. The first initiatives to protect land were voiced in 1904, by [[Yngvar Nielsen]], leader of the [[Norwegian Mountain Touring Association]] (DNT). The association continued to lobby cases in 1923 and 1938. The natural protection act of 1954 prepared a legal basis for establishing protection areas, and the two first national parks were established in 1962 and 1963. The act of 1954 also established ''Statens naturvernråd'' ("''Governmental Natural protection council''") as an advisory body for the government. The council presented a draft for further natural protecting in 1964, suggesting 16 national parks. These suggestions were approved by [[Stortinget]]. It took 25 years, until 1989, before 15 of their suggestions were fulfilled. The 16th suggestion became a ''naturreservat''. The council presented another suggestion in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Ny landsplan for nasjonalparker / fra en arbeidsgruppe oppnevnt 3. September 1982 ; utredningen avgitt til Miljøverndepartementet April 1986. Oslo, 1986 (Norges offentlige utredninger ; NOU 1986: 13). {{ISBN|82-00-71038-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was approved by Stortinget in April 1993. Following this approval, a "second generation" of national parks, as well as expanding borders for the elder, were established from 2001.

The post-industrial era that started in the last 1960s saw areas being protected as national parks or other protected status as a means to regulate the construction of vacation homes, roads, fishing, hunting, and gathering plants.  This trend has accelerated in the last 10 years.  In addition to preserving rare plant and animal life, areas are protected to maintain reference points for environmental research, recreational resources for Norwegians, and as an inheritance for future generations.  The [[Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management|Directorate for Nature Management]] maintains indicators for the health of nature in Norway, including such measures as biological diversity, erosion, signs of pollution.

For the most part, national parks are open to hiking, cross-country skiing and camping.  Most have a limited number of overnight cabins.

In addition to national parks, the Norwegian government has designated larger areas for protection.  Included in these areas are 153 landscapes covering 14071&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 1,701 nature reserves covering 3,418&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 24 national parks covering 21,650&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 102 natural memorials, and 98 smaller protected areas.  This accounts for 12.1% of Norway's mainland area.

The Norwegian government aims to increase this area over time to at least 15%.  They have signalled an interest in preserving marine ecosystems, including the [[fjord]]s of the western parts of Norway, and the archipelago southwest from [[Oslo]].

[[File:Mount Whitney 2003-03-25.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Whitney]] is the highest summit of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[State of California]], and the [[contiguous United States]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''46 [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of the U.S. [[California|State of California]] with at least {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic elevation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.

[[Elevation|Topographic elevation]] is the vertical distance above the reference [[geoid]], a mathematical model of the Earth's [[sea level]] as an [[equipotential]] [[Gravity|gravitational]] surface.  The [[topographic prominence]] of a [[summit]] is the elevation difference between that summit and the highest or key [[col]] to a higher summit.  The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the minimum [[great-circle distance]] to a point of equal elevation.

This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  There are [[List of the ultra-prominent summits of the United States|126 ultra-prominent summits in the United States]].

All elevations include an adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].

If an elevation or prominence is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.

'''''Mauritius v.

The [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was asked on the 31st of March 2011 to function as registry in the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Tribunal Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcacases.com/pcadocs/MU-UK%2020150318%20Award.pdf|title=

==Disputes over arbiters==
In 2011 the government of Mauritius challenged Sir [[Christopher Greenwood]]'s role in the arbitration proceedings on the grounds that his role as a UK Foreign and Commonwealth legal adviser could bias him in favour of the United Kingdom's claims to the Chagos Islands. However, this was rejected by the tribunal on the basis that this "neither constituted nor continued an already existing relationship." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120117155009/http://www.asil.org/ilib120106.cfm The American Society of International Law (Archived)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over jurisdiction==
On the 15 January 2013 the tribunal released procedural order no. 2. In this order the tribunal rejected a British request that the tribunal should deal with British jurisdictional challenges in a preliminary phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/28/britain-tribunal-chagos-islands-marine-area |title=Britain faces UN tribunal over Chagos Islands marine reserve |last1=Bowcott |first1=Owen |last2=Vidal |first2=John |date=January 28, 2013 |website=The Guardian |accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1793 |title=PCA Press Release, The Republic of Mauritius v.

== Award of the arbitral tribunal ==
On the 18 March 2015, the arbitral tribunal ruled that the [[Chagos Marine Protected Area]] was "not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention" and declared unanimously that in establishing the MPA surrounding the Chagos Archipelago the United Kingdom had breached its obligations under Articles 2(3), 56(2), and 194(4) of the Convention.&lt;ref name="Ruling"&gt;[http://www.pcacases.com/pcadocs/MU-UK%2020150318%20Award.pdf In the Matter of the Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration - before - an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea- between - the Republic of Mauritius - and - the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland], award of the arbitral tribunal dated 18 March 2015, accessed July 25, 2016, paragraphs 544-547: "In concluding that the declaration of the MPA was not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, the Tribunal has taken no view on the substantive quality or nature of the MPA or on the importance of environmental protection. The Tribunal’s concern has been with the manner in which the MPA was established, rather than its substance. It is now open to the Parties to enter into the negotiations that the Tribunal would have expected prior to the proclamation of the MPA, with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for protecting the marine environment, to the extent necessary under a “sovereignty umbrella”... DECLARES, unanimously, that in establishing the MPA surrounding the Chagos Archipelago the United Kingdom breached its obligations under Articles 2(3), 56(2), and 194(4) of the Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Geothermal Data System''' ('''NGDS''') is an American [[Distributed computing|distributed data network]] that collects and provides public access to digital [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] exploration and development information. Data includes [[borehole]] temperature measurements, [[geothermal gradient]]s, active [[Fault (geology)|faults]], and [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] analyses.

==History==
NGDS was initially funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] Geothermal Technologies Program (awards DE-EE0001120 and DE-EE002850), as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

The National Geothermal Data System makes use of the large collection of [[hard copy]] documents stored in state [[geological survey]] archives.&lt;ref name="Survey2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Florida Geological Survey|title=Florida Geological Survey Biennial Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDZJAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=The Survey|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/open-energy-data-makes-significant-progress-with-green-button-standard/ "Open energy data makes significant progress with Green Button standard"]. ''Tech Republic'',  Alex Howard | May 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These documents include maps, field notes and [[Well logging|well logs]] relevant to [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] exploration and development. Some of the information was originally gathered for use by the oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/business/geothermal-industry-grows-with-help-from-oil-and-gas-drilling.html?_r=0 "Geothermal Industry Grows, With Help From Oil and Gas Drilling"] ''The New York Times''. By KATE GALBRAITH JULY 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  NGDS facilitates the [[digitization]] of this data, and ensures that data from various sources is stored in a compatible format to facilitate standardized search terms and [[geospatial analyses]].  Participating agencies maintain ownership and control of data they contribute.

Once digitized, the NGDS provides free public access to the data by means of a distributed network of online databases, and also provide the public with [[free and open-source software]] with which to search and view the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-geothermal-data-system/ "New Geothermal Data System Could Open Up Clean-Energy Reserves"]. ''Scientific American'',  William Ferguson on February 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2013/02/oregons_geothermal_resources_o.html "Oregon's geothermal resources on display in new online interactive map"]. ''The Associated Press'' on February 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating Agencies==
NGDS primary contributors include the [[United States Geological Survey]], [[Southern Methodist University]], and the [[Association of American State Geologists]].

Most agencies that contribute data to NGDS host their data on their own [[Server (computing)|server]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katu.com/news/local/Interactive-map-shows-Oregons-geothermal-resources-191044801.html "Interactive map shows Oregon's geothermal resources"]. ''Katu''. By Jeff Barnard&lt;/ref&gt; some smaller agencies submit their data to contract-designated ''hubs'', while still owning their data. NGDS hub states include [[Arizona]], [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Nevada]].

&lt;!--[[File:ngds-hub-states-map.png|thumb|alt=NGDS Hub States alt text|A map demonstrating NGDS hub states; the states administered by hub states; and states that independently host their own data]]--&gt;

Participating agencies also submit [[metadata]] records to a central web-accessible catalog, describing the data that has been contributed to NGDS. Both NGDS data and the NGDS catalog can be accessed by common [[web browser]]s and [[web application]]s. NGDS data can also be accessed by [[geographic information system]] software applications including [[ArcGIS]], [[UDig]], [[QGIS]], and [[GvSIG]].

The '''Natural History Society of Northumbria''' is a voluntary organization to promote the study of [[natural history]] and protect the wildlife of the North East of England.

Its offices and library are in the [[Hancock Museum|Great North Museum: Hancock]], whose building, land and collections it owns. It leases them to [[Newcastle University]], on whose behalf they are administered by [[Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums]]. It possesses a substantial natural history library and archive, and maintains the [[Gosforth Park Nature Reserve]]. It also carries out research and provides lectures, field outings and educational courses, as well as publishing scientific papers. It has over 950 members.&lt;ref name="What we do"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/about-whatwedo.php |title=About &gt; What we do |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Natural History Society of Northumbria |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

*The Society was formed on 19 August 1829 as an offshoot of the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne]], which had been founded in 1793. It was initially named the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne, and acquired its present name later. It began with a membership of 134.
*In 1832, in order to house the Society's collections, subscriptions were raised to build a new museum, the Newcastle Museum. This was on land behind the Literary &amp; Philosophical Society's building (now part of [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle station]]). It was opened to the public in 1834.
*In 1878, plans were announced for the building of a bigger museum, the '''Great North Museum: Hancock''' (as it is now called). John Hancock (see below), a local naturalist and taxidermist, was the driving force behind the project. The Prince and Princess of Wales officially opened the Museum on 20 August 1884, amid great celebrations hosted by [[Sir William Armstrong|Sir William]] and Lady Armstrong of Cragside. It was named the Hancock Museum in 1891 in memory of John and Albany Hancock, and acquired its present name in 2009 after a refurbishment.
*In 1924, the [[Gosforth Park Nature Reserve]] came into being, initially as a bird sanctuary, when W. E. Beck, a member of the Society, leased the shooting rights over [[Gosforth Park]] from its owners, the High Gosforth Park Company. In 1929, Mr Beck, suffering ill health, handed over these rights to the Society, which has managed it for wildlife ever since.
*In 1949, the Society became the official bird-ringing organization for the [[Farne Islands]], and this work continues today. In 1951, the Society began to systematically study [[grey seal]]s on the Farne Islands, commencing the longest period of continuous research in any British grey seal colony.
*In 1960, the Society, struggling to maintain the Hancock Museum, reached an agreement with Kings College (now Newcastle University) in which the latter acquired a 99-year lease of the museum and collections. A management committee was created and made responsible for running the museum and preserving the collection. The Society is still represented on this today.
*In 1961-62, the Society helped in the birth of the Northumberland and Durham Naturalists' Trust, now the [[Northumberland Wildlife Trust]] and [[Durham Wildlife Trust]]. a symbiotic relationship exists with these to this day.
*In 2006, the Hancock Museum was taken out of service and extensively refurbished, re-emerging as part of the [[Great North Museum]] in 2009.

== Notable members ==
[[John Hancock (ornithologist)|John Hancock]] (1808–1890) was an ornithologist, producing his Catalogue of the Birds of Northumberland and Durham in 1874. His greatest talent, however, was as a taxidermist, and his collection of mounted British birds  can still be seen today in the Bird Gallery of the Great North Museum: Hancock.

[[Albany Hancock]] (1806–1873), brother of John Hancock, specialised in the anatomy of sea creatures, especially [[sea slug]]s or [[nudibranch]]s, and depicted them in minute detail. His watercolour drawings are held in the Society's archives.

[[Joshua Alder]] (1792–1867) was a [[zoologist]], specialising in [[tunicate]]s and [[gastropod]]s.

[[William Chapman Hewitson]] (1806–1878) was a wealthy collector, particularly of [[beetle]]s, [[lepidoptera]]ns, bird's nests and eggs. He built up an extensive collection of [[butterfly|butterflies]] of the world, and was an accomplished illustrator.

[[File:Israel Natural Gas Lines Map EN.svg|thumb|200px|Israeli natural gas lines network map]]

'''Natural gas in Israel''' is a primary energy source in [[Israel]], mainly utilized for electricity production and to lesser degree in the industry. Israel began producing natural gas from its own offshore gas fields in 2004. Between 2005 to 2012, Israel had imported gas from Egypt via the [[Arab_Gas_Pipeline#Arish–Ashkelon_pipeline|al-Arish-Ashkelon pipeline]], which was terminated due to [[Egyptian crisis (2011–14)|Egyptian Crisis of 2011-14]]. As of 2014, Israel produced over 7.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of [[natural gas]] a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2249rank.html CIA. The World Factbook. Natural gas - production.]&lt;/ref&gt; Israel had 199 billion cubic meters (cu m) of proven reserves of natural gas as of the start of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html#is]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, Israel began exporting natural gas to the Kingdom of [[Jordan]].

==History==
[[File:Fossil fuel consumption in Israel.svg|right|thumb|Consumption of fossil fuel energy sources in Israel since 1980. Coal consumption rose steadily since 1980 when it was negligible.  Natural gas consumption was nearly zero in 2003 and has risen steadily since.]]
Historically, Israel relied on external imports for meeting most of its energy needs, spending an amount equivalent to over 5% of its GDP per year in 2009 on imports of energy products.&lt;ref name="gas1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gas discovery tempers Israeli recession blues |first=Amotz |last=Asa-El |url=http://articles.marketwatch.com/2009-01-27/news/30797823_1_gas-discovery-delek-group-natural-gas/2 |newspaper=MarketWatch |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128053526/http://articles.marketwatch.com/2009-01-27/news/30797823_1_gas-discovery-delek-group-natural-gas/2 |archivedate=28 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation sector relies mainly on [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]], while the majority of electricity production is generated using imported coal.

Until the early 2000s, natural gas use in Israel was minimal. In the late 1990s, the government of Israel decided to encourage the usage of natural gas because of environmental, cost, and resource diversification reasons. At the time however, there were no domestic sources of natural gas and the expectation was that gas would be supplied from overseas in the form of [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] and by a future pipeline from Egypt (which eventually became the [[Arish–Ashkelon pipeline]]). Plans were made for the [[Israel Electric Corporation]] to construct several gas-driven power plants, for erecting a national gas distribution grid, and for an LNG import terminal. Soon thereafter, gas began to be located within Israeli territory, first in modest amounts and a decade later in very large quantities located in deep water off the Israeli coastline. This has greatly intensified the utilization of natural gas within the Israeli economy, especially in the electrical generation and industrial sectors, with consumption growing from an annual average of {{convert|350|e6cuft|m3|abbr=on|order=flip}} between 2000 and 2002 to {{convert|129|e9cuft|m3|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 2010.&lt;ref name=eiarpt/&gt;

In 2000, a modest discovery was made when a 33-billion-cubic-metre (BCM), or 1,200-billion-cubic-foot, natural-gas field was located offshore [[Ashkelon]], with commercial production starting in 2004. {{As of|2014}} however, this field is nearly depleted—earlier than expected due to increased pumping to partially compensate for the loss of imported Egyptian gas in the wake of unrest associated with the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011]]. In 2009, a significant gas find named [[Tamar gas field|Tamar]], with [[proven reserves]] of 223 BCM or {{convert|223|e9m3|disp=out}} (307 BCM total proven + probable) was located in deep water approximately {{convert|90|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} west of [[Haifa]], as well as a smaller 15 BCM ({{convert|15|e9m3|disp=out}}) field situated nearer the coastline.&lt;ref name="gas4"&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Delek Group Subsidiaries Announce Preliminary Results of 3D Seismic Survey &amp; Updates on Tamar &amp; Mari-B Fields |publisher=[[Delek Group]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://ir.delek-group.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=160695&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1433914 |accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gas2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tamar offshore field promises even more gas than expected |first=Avi |last=Bar-Eli |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/tamar-offshore-field-promises-even-more-gas-than-expected-1.281861 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gas3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Noble increases Tamar gas reserve estimate 15 pct |first=Steven |last=Scheer |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/03/israel-naturalgas-idUSLDE65209Q20100603 |newspaper=Reuters |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TamarUpd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tamar Reserves Update|url=http://maya.tase.co.il/bursa/report.asp?report_cd=875826-00&amp;CompCd=232&amp;Type=Pdf|publisher=Isramco Negev 2, LP.|accessdate=2 February 2014|page=2|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, results of 3D seismic surveys and test drilling conducted since 2010 have confirmed that an estimated 621 BCM ({{convert|621|e9m3|disp=out}}) natural-gas deposit exists in a large underwater geological formation nearby the large gas field already discovered in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Shoshanna|last2=Khan|first2=Sarmad|title=Israel Shares Rise as Gas Field Reserves Are Increased|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-13/dubai-stocks-climb-on-property-profit-prospects-abu-dhabi-gains.html|accessdate=13 July 2014|agency=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gas7"&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Noble Energy Announces Successful Leviathan Appraisal Results and Increases Resource Size |publisher=[[Noble Energy]] |date=19 December 2011 |url=http://investors.nobleenergyinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=634137 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gas5"&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Significant Discovery Announced at Leviathan-1 |publisher=[[Delek Group]] |date=29 December 2010 |url=http://ir.delek-group.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=160695&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1511164 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barkat|first=Amiram|title=Leviathan gas reserves raised again|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000840788|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=[[Globes]]|date=1 May 2013|author2=Koren, Hillel}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''The Economist'' stated that Israel had "verified" gas finds of 35 trillion cubic feet as of early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21595039-obstacles-still-block-flow-oil-and-gas-eastern-mediterranean-too Israel’s and Palestine’s gas and oil: Too optimistic?&lt;/ref&gt; The US Energy Information Administration listed Israel as having 7.0 trillion cubic feet of proved reserves as of 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=3&amp;pid=3&amp;aid=6 Natural gas proved reserves], 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamar field began commercial production on 30 March 2013 after four years of extensive development works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Shoshanna|title=Israel Begins Gas Production at Tamar Field in Boost to Economy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-30/israel-begins-gas-production-at-tamar-field-in-boost-to-economy.html|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=30 March 2013|author2=Ackerman, Gwen|agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supply of gas from Tamar is expected to provide a boost to the Israeli economy, which has suffered losses of more than NIS20 billion between 2011 and 2013 resulting from the disruption of gas supplies from neighboring Egypt (and which are not expected to resume due to Egypt's decision to indefinitely suspend its gas supply agreement to Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barkat|first=Amiram|title=Israel in talks to export gas via Egypt|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000904162|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=[[Globes]]|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barkat|first=Amiram|script-title=he:עצמאות אנרגטית: החלה הזרמת הגז הטבעי ממאגר "תמר"; צפוי להגיע לישראל תוך 24 שעות|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000833050|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=[[Globes]]|date=30 March 2013|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Energy Independence: Gas from Tamar Expected to Arrive in 24 Hours}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Israel, as well as its other neighbor Jordan, which also suffered from disruption of gas deliveries from Egypt, had to resort to importing significantly more expensive and polluting liquid heavy fuels as substitute sources of energy. The ensuing energy crisis in Israel was lifted once the Tamar field came online in 2013, while Jordan committed to a US$10 billion, 15-year gas supply deal totaling 45 BCM from the Israeli Leviathan field which is scheduled to come online in late 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leviathan partners say all conditions met to supply natgas to Jordan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-jordan-natgas/leviathan-partners-say-all-conditions-met-to-supply-natgas-to-jordan-idUSL5N1QP1NO|accessdate=10 March 2018|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is estimated to save Jordan US$600 million per year in energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Omari|first1=Raed|title='Lands for Israel gas pipeline acquired'|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/lands-israel-gas-pipeline-acquired%E2%80%99|accessdate=10 March 2018|publisher=[[The Jordan Times]]|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the owners of the Tamar and Leviathan fields announced that they are negotiating an agreement with a consortium of Egyptian firms, subject to regulatory approval in both countries, for the supply of up to 64 BCM of gas over 10 years valued at up to US$15 billion. Although Egypt has been making strides in developing new gas fields in recent years to help it meet rising domestic demand, it also has idle LNG exporting capacity and the deal has the potential to help make it an important regional gas export hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel announces major gas deal with Egypt|url=http://www.dw.com/en/israel-announces-major-gas-deal-with-egypt/a-42647022|accessdate=10 March 2018|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The large gas discoveries so far have confirmed that the Levant basin of the Eastern Mediterranean contains significant quantities of natural gas and, potentially, crude oil.

Remote gas well sites require local flow metering of the mineral reserve's gas flow rate for asset and revenue accounting purposes.  Differential pressure [[flow meter]]s are commonly used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sarHIbCVOUAC |title=Instrumentation reference book |author=Walt Boyes |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7506-7123-1 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, local flow metering was done using high maintenance mechanical circular [[chart recorder]]s. Today these have been replaced with electrically powered [[remote terminal unit]]s (RTU). Multiple remote terminal units communicate to a central host system via radio systems or tap into the [[cellular phone]] system. The host (or central control room) communicates with the RTUs and radio communication infrastructure is referred to as a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ([[SCADA]]) system. In addition to [[gas flow computer|gas flow metering]], the RTU also provides some local, self-contained, site control such as well shut-in in the event of abnormal gas flow conditions. However the bulk of the RTU's function is to provide the host with site specific data which includes the above-mentioned gas flow metering data, plus process related data including [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and/or well pressure, [[natural gas condensate|condensate]] tank levels etc.

==Not all RTUs are the same==
The distinguishing feature of the remote [[gas well]] RTU is a "[[gas flow computer]]". This is essentially a sophiscated subprogram or [[flow computer]] algorithm. The [[oil well]] RTU is much less complex since liquid oil flow metering is simpler. In the case of electrical utility RTU, there is a critical need for precise event time monitoring so that the first breaker to trip (closest to the fault) can be determined.
As these sites are remote such that utility electrical power is rarely available, the RTUs must be powered by an array of [[photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s plus batteries.  The batteries enable the RTU to continue to function when the sun is below the horizon or is obscured by heavy cloud cover. These RTUs also must be extremely rugged and energy efficient, i.e., must function to &amp;minus;35&amp;nbsp;°C. Energy efficient RTUs vastly reduce the cost of the solar battery system especially at higher latitudes.

As a result of [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|military occupation]] and civil unrest, the official statistics have not been revised since 2001 and are largely based on [[2-D seismic]] data from three decades ago. International geologists and consultants have estimated that unexplored territory may contain vastly larger reserves. The majority of Iraq's proven reserves of oil comes from the following cities: Basra (Being #1), Baghdad (Being #2), Ramadi (Being #3), and finally, Ba'aj (Being the last oil rich city).&lt;ref name="EIAIraq"&gt;{{cite web

A measure of the [[uncertainty]] about Iraq's oil reserves is indicated by widely differing estimates. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) estimated in 2003 that Iraq had {{convert|112|Goilbbl|e9m3}}. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) in 1995 estimated proven reserves were {{convert|78|Goilbbl|e9m3|abbr=on}}. Iraq's prewar deputy oil minister said that potential reserves might be {{convert|300|Goilbbl|e9m3|abbr=on}}. The source of the uncertainty is that due to decades of war and unrest, many of Iraq's oil wells are run down and unkept. Repairs to the wells and oil facilities should make far more oil available economically from the same deposits. Iraq may prove to contain the largest extractable deposits of oil in the entire Middle East once these upgrading and facility improvements have advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Original research|section|date=February 2014}}
After more than a decade of sanctions and two Gulf Wars, Iraq’s oil infrastructure needs modernization and investment. Despite a large reconstruction effort, the Iraqi oil industry has not been able to meet hydrocarbon production and export targets. The [[World Bank]] estimates that an additional $1 billion per year would need to be invested just to maintain current production. Long-term Iraq reconstruction costs could reach $100&amp;nbsp;billion or higher, of which more than a third will go to the oil, gas and electricity sectors. Another challenge to Iraq's development of the oil sector is that resources are not evenly divided across sectarian lines. Most known resources are in the Shiite areas of the south and the Kurdish north, with few resources in control of the [[Sunni]] population in the center.

In 2006, Iraq's oil production averaged {{convert|2.0|Moilbbl/d}}, down from around {{convert|2.6|Moilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of production prior to the coalition invasion in 2003.&lt;ref name="EIAIraq"/&gt; Iraq's [[Reserves-to-production ratio|reserve to production ratio]] is 158 years. After the end of the invasion the production increased on a high level, even though there is an invasion from the so-called ''[[ISIL]]'' the production in March 2016 stood at 4.55 million barrels a day. Which seems to well become a new all-time peak year for Iraq if OPEC talks about freezing or reduce production held in April 2016 will not lead to a reduction. The old peak was 1979 with 171.6 million tons of oil compared to 136.9 million tons produced in 2011 and 152.4 million tons in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/business/339163-iraq-oil-production-prices/|title=Iraq oil output hits record high ahead of production freeze talks|work=rt.com|accessdate=16 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425180438/https://www.rt.com/business/339163-iraq-oil-production-prices/|archivedate=25 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp-country/fr_fr/Documents/Rapportsetpublications/statistical_review_of_world_energy_2013.pdf|title=statistical review of world energy 2013|work=British Petroleum|accessdate=16 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131130806/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp-country/fr_fr/Documents/Rapportsetpublications/statistical_review_of_world_energy_2013.pdf|archivedate=31 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil extraction contracts awarded==

===2009===
On June 30 and December 11, 2009, the [[Ministry of Oil (Iraq)|Iraqi Ministry of Oil]] awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields. The winning oil companies entered joint ventures with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts include extraction of oil for a fixed gain of $1.40 per barrel for the oil companies with the remainder going to Iraq.&lt;ref name="aljazeera091211"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/12/200912117243440687.html|title=Oil firms awarded Iraq contracts|work=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=11 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513094000/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/12/200912117243440687.html|archivedate=13 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera090630"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/06/200963093615637434.html|title=BP group wins Iraq oil contract|work=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=11 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906080359/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/06/200963093615637434.html|archivedate=6 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached.

Oil fields contracted include the "super-giant" [[Majnoon Field]], [[Halfaya Field]], [[West Qurna Field]] and [[Rumaila Field]]. The [[East Baghdad Field]], situated in part under [[Sadr City]], did not receive any bids and the Iraqi oil ministry is considering working the field itself. Oil minister [[Hussein al-Shahristani]] told Iraqi public television that the increasing oil production "would finance infrastructure projects across Iraq - schools, roads, airports, housing, hospitals".&lt;ref name="aljazeera090630"/&gt;

McKee, What's a Museum: What he says it is. How Ralph Appelbaum built a monopoly in the field of exhibition design. Architecture Magazine, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has offices in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Beijing]], [[Berlin]], [[Moscow]], and [[Dubai]].

==Overview==
The firm was founded in 1978 by Ralph Appelbaum (born 1942), a graduate of [[Pratt Institute]] and former [[Peace Corps]] volunteer (in [[Peru]]). Appelbaum currently directs RAA's undertakings, and retains daily involvement in selected commissions.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in 1999 that the firm was composed of "architects, designers, editors, model builders, historians, childhood specialists, one poet, one painter and one astrophysicist."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D8163AF932A15757C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=He Turns the Past Into Stories and the Galleries Fill Up |accessdate=2018-04-18 |first=Deborah |last=Soloman |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1999-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's best-known project is the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which is the United States' official memorial to the Holocaust. Established in 1993, the museum has been described as a "turning point in museology".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

==Major projects==
According to its website, RAA has completed "700 commissions in over 40 countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raai.com/about/|title=Ralph Appelbaum Associates|website=raai.com|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sierra de Los Tuxtlas''' ('''Tuxtlas Mountains''') are a [[volcanic belt]] and [[mountain range]] along the southeastern [[Veracruz]] [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] in Eastern Mexico. The [[Biósfera Los Tuxtlas|Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve]] (Biósfera Los Tuxtlas) includes the coastal and higher elevations of the Sierra de Los Tuxtlas.

The volcanic mountains were used as a [[basalt]] source by the [[Olmec]] culture during the [[Formative stage|Early Formative period]] (1500 BCE to about 400 BCE). Quarried basalt was transported by raft through a network of rivers, to sites in the [[Olmec heartland]] for use in creating monuments, including [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Mexico and Central America&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Peaks in this range include Volcano Santa Marta and [[San Martin Tuxtla|Volcano San Martín Tuxtla]], both rising above 1,700 meters.  San Martín Tuxtla is the only recently active volcano in the belt, erupting in 1664 and again in May 1793.  It is a broad [[alkaline]] [[shield volcano]] with a one kilometer wide summit.  Hundreds of smaller [[cinder cone]]s are prevalent throughout the Sierra.

Other, [[extinct volcano]]es include San Martin Pajapan (1,160 meters) and Cerro El Vigia (800 meters).

The Sierra de Los Tuxtlas volcanoes are an insular anomaly. The volcanoes are separated from the nearest volcano in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] to the west by about 150 miles (250&amp;nbsp;km), and from the [[Central American Volcanic Belt]] to the southeast by almost 200 miles (330&amp;nbsp;km).

[[File:Ecoregion NT0161.svg|thumb|200px|Map of '''Sierra de los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest''' [[ecoregion]]]]

==Natural history==
The upper flanks of the San Martin Tuxtla and Santa Marta volcanoes are covered with the [[neotropic]]al '''Sierra de los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest''' [[ecoregion]], of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] biome.  The lower portions are covered with stunted pastures and grasslands.

A '''submarine pipeline''' (also known as '''marine''', '''subsea''' or '''offshore''' pipeline) is a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] that is laid on the [[seabed]] or below it inside a trench.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"&gt;Dean, p. 338-340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"&gt;Gerwick, p. 583-585&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the pipeline is mostly on-land but in places it crosses water expanses, such as small seas, straits and rivers.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.2"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Submarine pipelines are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.2"/&gt; A distinction is sometimes made between a ''flowline'' and a pipeline.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP.24"&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The former is an ''intrafield'' pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea [[wellhead]]s, manifolds and the [[Oil platform|platform]] ''within'' a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an ''export pipeline'', is used to bring the resource to shore.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"/&gt; Sizeable pipeline construction projects need to take into account a large number of factors, such as the offshore ecology, geohazards and environmental loading – they are often undertaken by multidisciplinary, international teams.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"/&gt;
[[File:Kart rorledning lite.gif|right|thumb|Example of a submarine pipeline route: the Langeled pipeline.]]

==Route selection==
One of the earliest and most critical tasks in a submarine pipeline planning exercise is the route selection.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.11"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; This selection has to consider a variety of issues, some of a political nature, but most others dealing with [[geohazard]]s, physical factors along the prospective route, and other uses of the seabed in the area considered.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanP.342"&gt;Dean, p. 342-343&lt;/ref&gt; This task begins with a fact-finding exercise, which is a standard desk study that includes a survey of [[geological map]]s, [[bathymetry]], fishing charts, [[Aerial photography|aerial]] and [[satellite imagery|satellite]] photography, as well as information from navigation authorities.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanP.342"/&gt;

===Physical factors===
[[File:Submarine Pipeline vs seabed.svg|thumb|Interaction between a submarine pipeline and the seabed onto which it rests (four possible scenarios).]]
The primary physical factor to be considered in submarine pipeline construction is the state of the seabed – whether it is smooth (''i.e.'', relatively flat) or uneven (corrugated, with high points and low points). If it is uneven, the pipeline will include free spans when it connects two high points, leaving the section in between unsupported.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.13"&gt;Palmer &amp;King, p. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; If an unsupported section is too long, the [[Bending|bending stress]] exerted onto it (due to its weight) may be excessive. Vibration from current-induced vortexes may also become an issue.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanS.7.2.2"&gt;Dean, Sect. 7.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective measures for unsupported pipeline spans include seabed leveling and post-installation support, such as berm or sand infilling below the pipeline. The [[Soil mechanics|strength of the seabed]] is another significant parameter. If the soil is not strong enough, the pipeline may sink into it to an extent where inspection, maintenance procedures and prospective tie-ins become difficult to carry out. At the other extreme, a rocky seabed is expensive to trench and, at high points, abrasion and damage of the pipeline's external coating may occur.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanS.7.2.2"/&gt; Ideally, the soil should be such as to allow the pipe to settle into it to some extent, thereby providing it with some lateral stability.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.13"/&gt;

[[File:Pipeline_protection_-_burial_below_seabed_gouge.svg|thumb|One of a number of reasons why submarine pipelines are buried below the seabed: to protect them against the [[Seabed gouging by ice|gouging action of drifting ice features]], such as [[iceberg]]s.]]

Other physical factors to be taken into account prior to building a pipeline include the following:&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanS.7.2.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;Been"&gt;Palmer &amp; Been, p. 182–187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Croasdale&amp;al"&gt;Croasdale et al. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Seabed mobility'': [[Sand waves]] and [[Dune|megaripple]]s are features that move with time, such that a pipeline that was supported by the crest of one such feature during construction may find itself in a trough later during the pipeline's operational lifespan. The evolution of these features is difficult to predict so it is preferable to avoid the areas where they are known to exist. 
* ''[[Submarine landslide]]s'': They result from high sedimentation rates and occur on steeper slopes. They can be triggered by [[earthquake]]s. When the soil around the pipe is subjected to a slide, especially if the resulting displacement is at high angle to the line, the pipe within it can incur severe bending and consequent [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile failure]].
* ''[[Current (Ocean)|Current]]s'': High currents are objectionable in that they hinder pipe laying operations. For instance, in shallow seas tidal currents may be quite strong in a strait between two islands. Under these circumstances, it may be preferable to bring the pipe elsewhere, even if this alternative route ends up being longer.
* ''[[Wave]]s'': In shallow waters, waves can also be problematic for pipeline laying operations (in severe wave regimes) and, subsequently, to its stability, because of the water's [[tidal scour|scouring action]]. This is one of a number of reasons why ''landfalls'' (where the pipeline reaches the shoreline) are particularly delicate areas to plan.
* ''Ice-related issues'': In freezing waters, floating ice features often drift into shallower waters, and their keel comes into contact with the seabed. As they continue to drift, they [[Seabed gouging by ice|gouge the seabed]] and can hit the pipeline.&lt;ref name="Barrette"&gt;Barrette 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stamukha|Stamukhi]] can also damage this structure, either by exerting high local stresses on it or by causing to soil around it to fail, thereby inducing excessive bending. [[Strudel (ice)|Strudel]] are another pipeline hazard in cold waters – water gushing through them can remove the soil from below the structure, making it vulnerable to overstress (due to self-weight) or vortex-induced oscillations. Pipeline route planning for areas where these risks are known to exist has to consider laying the pipeline in a back-filled trench.

===Other uses of the seabed===
Proper planning of a pipeline route has to factor in a wide range of human activities that make use of the seabed along the proposed route, or that are likely to do so in the future. They include the following:&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanS.7.2.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.16"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Other pipelines'': If and where the proposed pipeline intersects an existing one, which is not uncommon, a bridging structure may be required at that juncture in order to cross it. This has to be done at a right angle. The juncture should be carefully designed so as to avoid interferences between the two structures either by direct physical contact or due to hydrodynamic effects. 
*''[[Fishing vessel]]s'': Commercial fishing makes use of [[trawling|heavy fishing nets]] dragged on the seabed and extending several kilometers behind the trawler. This net could snag the pipeline, with potential damage to both pipeline and vessel.
*''[[Anchor|Ship anchor]]s'': Ship anchors are a potential threat to pipelines, especially near harbors.   
*''Military activities'': Some areas still have [[Naval mine|mines]] originating from former conflicts but that are still operational. Other areas, used for bombing or gunning practices, may also conceal live [[ammunition]]. Moreover, at some locations, various types of instrumentation are laid on the seafloor for submarine detection. These areas have to be avoided.

==Submarine pipeline characteristics==
Submarine pipelines generally vary in diameter from {{convert|3|in|mm}} for gas lines, to {{convert|72|in|mm}} for high capacity lines.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt; Wall thicknesses typically range from {{convert|10|mm|in }} to {{convert|75|mm|in }}. The pipe can be designed for fluids at high temperature and pressure. The walls are made from high-yield strength steel, 350-500&amp;nbsp;MPa (50,000-70,000&amp;nbsp;psi), [[weldability]] being  one of the main selection criteria.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt; The structure is often shielded against external [[corrosion]] by coatings such as bitumastic or [[epoxy]], supplemented by [[cathodic protection]] with [[Galvanic anode|sacrificial anodes]].&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.185"&gt;Ramakrishnan, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Concrete]] or [[fiberglass]] wrapping provides further protection against abrasion. The addition of a concrete coating is also useful to compensate for the pipeline's negative [[buoyancy]] when it carries lower density substances.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.186"&gt;Ramakrishnan, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipeline's inside wall is not coated for petroleum service. But when it carries seawater or corrosive substances, it can be coated with [[epoxy]], [[polyurethane]] or [[polyethylene]]; it can also be cement-lined.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.185"/&gt;  In the petroleum industry, where leaks are unacceptable and the pipelines are subject to internal pressures typically in the order of 10&amp;nbsp;MPa (1500 psi), the segments are joined by full penetration welds.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.185"/&gt; Mechanical joints are also used. A [[Pigging|pig]] is a standard device in [[pipeline transport]], be it on-land or offshore. It is used to test for [[Hydrostatic pressure#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic pressure]], to check for dents and crimps on the sidewalls inside the pipe, and to conduct periodic cleaning and minor repairs.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;

== Pipeline construction ==
Pipeline construction involves two procedures: assembling a large number of pipe segments into a full line, and installing that line along the desired route. Several systems can be used – for a submarine pipeline, the choice in favor of any one of them is based on the following factors: physical and environmental conditions (''e.g.'' currents, wave regime), availability of equipment and costs, water depth, pipeline length and diameter, constraints tied to the presence of other lines and structures along the route.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.583"/&gt;  These systems are generally divided into four broad categories: ''pull/tow'', ''S-lay'', ''J-lay'' and ''reel-lay''.&lt;ref name="DeanSP.347-350"&gt;Dean, p.347-350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingChap.12"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, Chap.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP.910-912"&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 910-912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WilsonChap1"&gt;Wilson, Chap.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SubmarinePipelinesConstruction PullTowSystems.svg|thumb|Simplified drawings showing three configurations used to tow subsea pipelines offshore to the planned installation site (not to scale).]]

===The pull/tow system===
In the pull/tow system, the submarine pipeline is assembled onshore and then towed to location. Assembly is done either parallel or perpendicular to the shoreline – in the former case, the full line can be built prior to tow out and installation.&lt;ref name="BrownP.1"&gt;Brown, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A significant advantage with the pull/tow system is that pre-testing and inspection of the line are done onshore, not at sea.&lt;ref name="BrownP.1"&gt;Brown, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It allows to handle lines of any size and complexity.&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP.910-912"&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 910-912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.412"/&gt; As for the towing procedures, a number of configurations can be used, which may be categorized as follows: surface tow, near-surface tow, mid-depth tow and off-bottom tow.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingS12.4"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, 12.4&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Surface tow'': In this configuration, the pipeline remains at the surface of the water during tow, and is then sunk into position at lay site. The line has to be buoyant – this can be done with individual buoyancy units attached to it.&lt;ref name="BrownP.1"&gt;Brown, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Surface tows are not appropriate for rough seas and are vulnerable to lateral currents. 
*''Near-surface tow'': The pipeline remains below the water surface but close to it – this mitigates wave action. But the [[spar buoy]]s used to maintain the line at that level are affected by rough seas, which in itself may represent a challenge for the towing operation. 
*''Mid-depth tow'': The pipeline is not buoyant – either because it is heavy or it is weighted down by hanging chains. In this configuration, the line is suspended in a [[catenary]] between two towing vessels. The shape of that catenary (the ''sag'') is a balance between the line's weight, the tension applied to it by the vessels and hydrodynamic lift on the chains.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP415"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of allowable sag is limited by how far down the seabed is.  
*''Off-bottom tow'': This configuration is similar to the mid-depth tow, but here the line is maintained within 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;m (several feet) away from the bottom, using chains dragging  on the seabed. 
*''Bottom tow'': In this case, the pipeline is dragged onto the bottom – the line is not affected by waves and currents, and if the sea gets too rough for the tow vessel, the line can simply be abandoned and recovered later. Challenges with this type of system include: requirement for  an abrasion-resistant coating, interaction with other submarine pipelines and potential obstructions (reef, boulders, etc.). Bottom tow is commonly used for river crossings and crossings between shores.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP417"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saipem 7000.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Saipem 7000]]'', a semi-submersible crane vessel equipped with a J-lay pipe-laying system.]]

===The S-lay system===
In the S-lay system, the pipeline assembly is done at the installation site, on board a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: pipe handling conveyors, welding stations, X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc.&lt;ref name="GerwickS.15.2"&gt;Gerwick,15.2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''S'' notation refers to the shape of the pipeline as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a ''stinger'' that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the ''overbend''). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the ''sagbend'') before coming into contact with the seabed (''touch down point''). The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via ''tensioners'') in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending.&lt;ref name="GerwickS.15.2"&gt;Gerwick,15.2&lt;/ref&gt; This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as ''lay-barge'' construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature – despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.395"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; But it may have to contend with severe sea states – these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and pipe welding.&lt;ref name="GerwickS.15.2"/&gt; Recent developments in lay-barge design include [[dynamic positioning]] and the J-lay system.&lt;ref name="GerwickS.15.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.397"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===The J-lay system===
In areas where the water is very deep, the S-lay system may not be appropriate because the pipeline leaves the stinger to go almost straight down. To avoid sharp bending at the end of it and to mitigate excessive sag bending, the tension in the pipeline would have to be high.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.401"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so would interfere with the vessel's positioning, and the tensioner could damage the pipeline. A particularly long stinger could be used, but this is also objectionable since that structure would be adversely affected by winds and currents.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.401"/&gt; The J-lay system, one of the latest generations of lay-barge, is better suited for deep water environments. In this system, the pipeline leaves the vessel on a nearly vertical ramp (or tower). There is no overbend – only a sagbend of [[catenary]] nature (hence the ''J'' notation), such that the tension can be reduced. The pipeline is also less exposed to wave action as it enters the water.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.402"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike for the S-lay system, where pipe welding can be done simultaneously at several locations along the vessel deck's length, the J-lay system can only accommodate one welding station. Advanced methods of automatic welding are used to compensate for this drawback.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.615"&gt;Gerwick, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Reel-lay system===
In the reel-lay system, the pipeline is assembled ''onshore'' and is spooled onto a large drum typically about {{convert|20|m|ft}} x {{convert|6|m|ft}} in size,&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP.145"&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; mounted on board a purpose-built vessel. The vessel then goes out to location to lay the pipeline. Onshore facilities to assemble the pipeline have inherent advantages: they are not affected by the weather or the sea state and are less expensive than seaborne operations.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.412"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Pipeline supply can be coordinated: while one line is being laid at sea, another one can be spooled onshore.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.611"&gt;Gerwick, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; A single reel can have enough capacity for a full length flow line.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.611"/&gt; The reel-lay system, however, can only handle lower diameter pipelines – up to about 400&amp;nbsp;mm (16&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP.144"&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the kind of steel making up the pipes must be able to undergo the required amount of plastic deformation as it is bent to proper curvature (by a spiral J-tube) when reeled around the drum, and straightened back (by a straightener) during the layout operations at the installation site.&lt;ref name="GerwickP.610"&gt;Gerwick, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stabilisation==
Several methods are used to stabilise and protect submarine pipelines and their components. These may be used alone or in combinations.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bevan, John|title=The Professional Divers's Handbook|edition=second|year=2005|publisher=Submex Ltd|location=5 Nepean Close, Alverstoke, GOSPORT, Hampshire PO12 2BH |language=English|isbn= 978-0950824260|page=34|chapter=Section 1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trenching and burial ===
[[File:SubmarinePipelines_Posttrenching.svg|right|thumb|Simplified drawing showing a typical jetting system for trenching below a submarine pipeline that is lying on the seafloor.]]
A submarine pipeline may be laid inside a [[trench]] as a means of safeguarding it against fishing gear (''e.g.'' [[anchor]]s) and [[trawling|trawling activity]].&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingSect.12.5.1"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, sect. 12.5.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.212"&gt;Ramakrishnan, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; This may also be required in shore approaches to protect the pipeline against [[Current (stream)|current]]s and [[wind wave|wave action]] (as it crosses the [[surf zone]]). Trenching can be done prior to pipeline lay (''pre-lay trenching''), or afterward by seabed removal from below the pipeline (''post-lay trenching''). In the latter case, the trenching device rides on top of, or straddles, the pipeline.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingSect.12.5.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.212"/&gt; 
Several systems are used to dig trenches in the seabed for submarine pipelines:
*Jetting: This is a post-lay trenching procedure whereby the soil is removed from beneath the pipeline by using powerful pumps to blow water on each side of it.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.420"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP.214"&gt;Ramakrishnan, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mechanical cutting: This system uses chains or cutter disks to dig through and remove harder soils, including [[boulder]]s,&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.421"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; from below the pipeline.
*Plowing: The [[Plough|plowing]] principle, which was initially used for pre-lay trenching, has evolved into sophisticated systems that are lighter in size for faster and safer operation.    
*Dredging/excavation: In shallower water, the soil can be removed with a [[dredging|dredger]] or an [[excavator]] prior to laying the pipeline. This can be done in a number of ways, notably with a ′′cutter-suction′′ system, with the use of buckets or with a [[backhoe]].&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingSect.12.5.1"/&gt;
″A buried pipe is far better protected than a pipe in an open trench.″&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.424"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly done either by covering the structure with rocks [[Quarry|quarried]] from a nearby shoreline. Alternatively, the soil excavated from the seabed during trenching can be used as backfill. A significant drawback to burial is the difficulty in locating a leak should it arise, and for the ensuing repairing operations.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.425"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mattresses===
[[File:Pipeline matrasses on barge1.jpg|thumb|Concrete mattresses on barge]]
Mattresses may be laid over the pipeline, or both under and over it depending on the substrate.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;
*Frond mattresses have an effect similar to seaweed and tend to cause sand to accumulate. They must be anchored to the bottom to prevent being washed away.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;
*Concrete mattresses are used to help hold part of the pipeline in place by their weight and reduce scour. They are usually heavy enough to be held in place by their own weight, as they are made from concrete blocks linked together by rope.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;
*Combination mattresses of concrete mattress with overlaid frond mattress are also used.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;

===Ground anchors===
Clamps holding the pipeline to piles may be used to prevent lateral movement.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;

===Saddle blocks===
Precast concrete saddle blocks may be used to provide lateral support and hold the pipeline down more firmly.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;

===Sandbags and groutbags===
These may be packed at the sides or under a pipeline to provide vertical and/or lateral support.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;

===Gravel dumps===
Gravel may be dumped over parts of a pipeline to reduce scour and help stabilise against lateral movement.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.8" /&gt;

==Environmental and Legal issues==
The [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context|Espoo Convention]] created certain requirements for notification and consultation where a project is likely to have transboundary environmental effects. Scholars are divided on how effective Espoo is at mitigating environmental harm. [[Law of the Sea]] concepts involved in the construction of transboundary pipelines concern territorial waters, [[continental shelves]], [[exclusive economic zones]], [[freedom of the high seas]] and protection of the environment. Under [[international law]] the high seas are open to all states to law underwater pipelines and for various other types of construction.&lt;ref name=baltic&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 39| issue = 2| pages = 99–121| last = Karm| first = Ellen| title = Environment and Energy: The Baltic Sea Gas Pipeline| journal = Journal of Baltic Studies| date = June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwater pipelines pose environmental risk because pipelines themselves may become damaged by ship's anchors, corrosion, [[tectonic]] activity, or as a result of defective construction and materials. [[Stanislav Patin]] has said that study on the effects of natural gas on underwater ecosystems, fish and other marine organisms has been limited. Researchers found a cause-effect relationship between mass fish mortality and natural gas leaks after drilling accidents in the [[Sea of Azov]] in 1982 and 1985.&lt;ref name=baltic/&gt;

Concerns about the environmental risks of underwater pipelines have been raised on numerous occasions. There have been at least two serious incidents involving [[oil pipelines]] on the [[UK's continental shelf]]. There have also been several "minor spills and gas leaks" involving other [[North Sea pipelines]]. In 1980 a pipeline was damaged by a ship's anchor and in 1986 a pipeline valve failed due to pressure changed. Both incidents resulted in oil spills. Several Baltic countries expressed concerns about the [[Nord Stream pipeline]]. The route of the 1,200 km underwater pipeline would travel through fishing areas of the [[Baltic Sea]], as well as area where chemical weapons from [[World War II]] had been discarded.&lt;ref name=baltic/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="102050">This table lists those stars/objects which have [[Flamsteed designation]]s by the [[constellation]] in which those stars/objects lie. The name given is that of the article if it does not reflect the Flamsteed designation. If the star has a Greek-letter [[Bayer designation]] this is used in preference except where such designation contains an extra attached number; for example, "Rho-1 Cancri" is less common than "55 Cancri".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">A '''temperature gradient''' is a [[physical quantity]] that describes in which direction and at what rate the [[temperature]] changes the most rapidly around a particular location. The temperature gradient is a [[Dimensional analysis|dimensional quantity]] expressed in [[Units of measurement|units]] of degrees (on a particular temperature scale) per unit [[length]]. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit is [[kelvin]] per [[meter]] (K/m). It can be found in the formula for dQ/dt, the rate of heat transfer per second.

Temperature gradients in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] are important in the atmospheric sciences ([[meteorology]], [[climatology]] and related fields).

== Mathematical description ==
Assuming that the temperature ''T'' is an [[intensive quantity]], i.e., a single-valued, [[Continuous function|continuous]] and [[Derivative|differentiable]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of three-dimensional space (often called a [[scalar field]]), i.e., that

:&lt;math&gt;T=T(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' are the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] of the location of interest, then the temperature gradient is the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla T = \begin{pmatrix}
{\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}},  
{\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}}, 
{\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
...

== Physical processes ==

=== Climatology ===
On a global and annual basis, the dynamics of the atmosphere (and the oceans) can be understood as attempting to reduce the large difference of temperature between the [[Geographical pole|poles]] and the equator by redistributing warm and cold air and water, known as Earth's heat engine.

=== Meteorology ===
Differences in air temperature between different locations are critical in weather forecasting and climate. The absorption of solar light at or near the planetary surface increases the temperature gradient and may result in [[convection]] (a major process of [[cloud]] formation, often associated with [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]). 
[[Surface weather analysis|Meteorological fronts]] are regions where the horizontal temperature gradient may reach relatively high values, as these are boundaries between [[air mass]]es with rather distinct properties.

Clearly, the temperature gradient may change substantially in time, as a result of diurnal or seasonal heating and cooling for instance. This most likely happens during an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]]. For instance, during the day the temperature at [[Lithosphere|ground level]] may be cold while it's warmer up in the atmosphere. As the day shifts over to night the temperature might drop rapidly while at other places on the land stay warmer or cooler at the same [[elevation]]. This happens on the [[West Coast of the United States]] sometimes due to geography.

=== Weathering ===
Expansion and contraction of rock, caused by temperature changes during a [[wildfire]], through [[Weathering#Thermal stress|thermal stress weathering]], may result in [[thermal shock]] and subsequent structure failure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6016">{{Carboniferous stages}}
The '''Tournaisian''' is in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] [[geologic timescale]] the lowest [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] or oldest [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian]], the oldest [[system (stratigraphy)|subsystem]] of the [[Carboniferous]]. The Tournaisian age lasted from {{Period start|Tournaisian}}  Ma to {{Period start|Visean}} [[Megaannum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It is preceded by the [[Famennian]] (the uppermost stage of the [[Devonian]]) and is followed by the [[Viséan]].

==Name and regional alternatives==
The Tournaisian was named after the [[Belgium|Belgian]] city of [[Tournai]]. It was introduced in scientific literature by Belgian geologist [[André Hubert Dumont]] in 1832. Like many Devonian and lower Carboniferous stages, the Tournaisian is a unit from West European regional stratigraphy that is now used in the official international time scale.

The Tournaisian correlates with the regional North American [[Kinderhookian]] and lower [[Osagean]] stages and the Chinese Tangbagouan regional stage. In British stratigraphy, the Tournaisian contains three substages: the Hastarian, Ivorian and lower part of the Chadian (the upper part falls in the Viséan).&lt;ref&gt;Heckel &amp; Clayton (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphy==
The base of the Tournaisian (which is also the base of the Carboniferous [[system (stratigraphy)|system]]) is at the first appearance of the [[conodont]] ''Siphonodella sulcata'' within the [[evolution|evolutionary lineage]] from ''Siphonodella praesulcata'' to ''Siphonodella sulcata''. The first appearance of [[ammonite]] species ''Gattendorfia subinvoluta'' is just above this and was used as a base for the Carboniferous in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Menning ''et al.'' (2006); for the old definition, see Paeckelmann &amp; Schindewolf (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GSSP]] for the Tournaisian is near the summit of La Serre hill, in the [[commune (administrative division)|commune]] of [[Cabrières, Hérault|Cabrières]], in the [[Montagne Noire]] (southern [[France]]).&lt;ref&gt;The GSSP was published by Paproth ''et al.'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The GSSP is in a section on the southern side of the hill, in an 80&amp;nbsp;cm deep trench, about 125 m south of the summit, 2.5&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the village of Cabrières and 2.5&amp;nbsp;km north of the hamlet of [[Fontès]].

The top of the Tournaisian (the base of the Viséan) is at the first appearance of the [[fusulinid]] species ''Eoparastaffella simplex'' ([[morphotype]] 1/morphotype 2).

The Tournaisian contains eight conodont [[biozone]]s:
*the zone of ''[[Gnathodus]] pseudosemiglaber'' and ''[[Scaliognathus anchoralis]]''
*the zone of ''Gnathodus semiglaber'' and ''[[Polygnathus communis]]''
*the zone of ''[[Dollymae bouckaerti]]''
*the zone of ''Gnathodus typicus'' and ''[[Siphonodella]] isosticha''
*the zone of ''Siphonodella quadruplicata'' and ''[[Patrognathus]] andersoni'' (upper zone of ''Patrognathus andersoni'')
*the lower zone of ''Patrognathus andersoni''
*the zone of ''Patrognathus variabilis''
*the zone of ''Patrognathus crassus''

The Tournaisian coincides with [[Romer's gap]], a period of remarkable little terrestrial fossils, thus constituting a discontinuity between the [[Devonian]] and the more modern terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s of the Carboniferous.

'''Vahana''' ({{lang-sa|वाहन}}, {{IAST|Vāhana}}, literally "that which carries, that which pulls") denotes the being, typically an animal or mythical entity, a particular Hindu deity is said to use as a vehicle. In this capacity, the vahana is often called the deity's "mount". Upon the partnership between the deity and his vahana is woven much [[Hindu iconography|iconography]] and [[Hindu mythology|mythology]]. Deities are often depicted riding (or simply mounted upon) the vahana. Other times, the vahana is depicted at the deity's side or symbolically represented as a divine attribute. The vahana may be considered an [[:wikt:accoutrement|accoutrement]]&lt;ref&gt;Accoutrement = "that which accompanies".&lt;/ref&gt; of the deity: though the vahana may act independently, they are still functionally emblematic or even [[:wikt:syntagmatic|syntagmatic]] of their "rider". The deity may be seen sitting or standing on the vahana. They may be sitting on a small platform called a ''[[howdah]]'', or riding on a saddle or bareback.&lt;ref name="GLOSSARY"&gt;[http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/aglossaryv.html#vahana Glossary: Vahana].  Undated.  Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vah'' in [[Sanskrit]] means ''to carry'' or ''to transport''.

==Symbolism==
In Hindu [[iconography]], positive aspects of the vehicle are often [[emblem]]atic of the deity that it carries. [[Nandi bull|Nandi]] the bull, vehicle of Shiva, represents strength and virility. [[Shri Dinka murti|Dinka]] the mouse, vehicle of Ganesha, represents speed and sharpness. [[Parvani]] the peacock, vehicle of Skanda, represents splendor and majesty. The [[hamsa (bird)|hamsa]], vehicle of Saraswati, represents wisdom, grace and beauty.

However, the vehicle animal also symbolizes the evil forces over which the deity dominates. Mounted on Parvani, Skanda reins in the peacock's vanity. Seated on Dinka the rat (Mushika), Ganesh crushes useless thoughts, which multiply like rats in the dark. [[Shani]], protector of property, has a vulture, raven or crow in which he represses thieving tendencies. Under Shani's influence, the vahana can make even malevolent events bring hope.

==Origin folklore==
[[File:Bhagavata Purana manuscript, 18 century.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=An old-looking paper manuscript page with Sanskrit text and colorful illustrations|A Bhagavata Purana manuscript page depicting the story of [[Atri]] and [[Anasuya]] meeting the [[Trimurti]] riding on their respective vahanas. (PhP 4.1.21-25). (Paper, late 18th century, [[Jaipur]]).]]
The vehicle of a deity can vary according to the source, the time, and the place. In popular tradition, the origin of each vehicle is told in thousands of different ways.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2015}} Three examples:

:*While the god [[Ganesha]] was still a child, a giant mouse began to terrorize all his friends. Ganesha trapped him with his [[pasha (Hinduism)|lasso]] and made him his mount. Mushika was originally a [[gandharva]], or celestial musician. After absent mindedly walking over the feet of a [[rishi]] (sage) named Vamadeva, Mushika was cursed and transformed into a mouse. However, after the rishi recovered his temper, he promised Mushika that one day, the gods themselves would bow down before him. The prophecy was fulfilled when the mouse became the vahana of Ganesha.

:*Before becoming the vehicle of Shiva, Nandi was a deity called [[Nandikeshvara]], lord of joy and master of music and dance. Then, without warning, his name and his functions were transferred to the aspect of Shiva known as the deity [[Nataraja]]. From half-man, half-bull, he became simply a bull. Since that time, he has watched over each of Shiva's temples, always looking towards him.

:*[[Kartikeya]], the war-god known as Murugan in [[Southern India]], is also mounted on a peacock. This peacock was originally a demon called [[Surapadma]], while the rooster was called the angel[Krichi]. After provoking Murugan in combat, the demon repented at the moment his lance descended upon him. He took the form of a tree and began to pray. The tree was cut in two. From one half, Murugan pulled a [[rooster]], which he made his emblem, and from the other, a peacock, which he made his mount. In another version, Karthikeya was born to kill the demon, [[Tarakasura]]. He was raised by the [[Krittika]]s and led the divine armies when he was 6 days old. It is said that after defeating Tarakasura, the god forgave him and transformed him into his ride, the peacock.

==Origin theories==

The vahana and deity to which they support are in a reciprocal relationship. Vahana serve and are served in turn by those who engage them. Many vahana may also have divine powers or a divine history of their own. Case in point, the aforementioned Nataraja story, represents a [[WIKTIONARY:conflation|conflation]] of Hindu gods with local gods, [[Syncretism|syncretizing]] their mythos as their territories began to overlap. According to one source, "they could be a synthesis between [[Vedas|Vedic]] deities and [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] totemic deities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Compared to other belief systems==
The animal correspondences of Hindu vehicles are not consistent with [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], or other belief systems which may tie a particular animal to a particular deity. For example, the goddess [[Lakshmi]] of the Hindus has elephants, or an owl, or (a rare instance of a non-animal vehicle) the lotus blossom as her vehicle. The goddess [[Athena]] of ancient [[Greece]] also had an owl as her emblematic familiar, but the meanings invested in the owls by the two different belief systems are not the same, nor are the two goddesses themselves similar, despite their mutual identification with owls.

[[Lakshmi]] is, among other things, primarily the goddess of wealth, and her owl is a warning against distrust and isolationism, even selfishness. Athena, though also a goddess of prosperity, is primarily the goddess of wisdom, and her owl symbolizes secret knowledge and scholarship. Perhaps due to their shared geography, the Greco-Roman interpretation is paralleled in [[Roman Catholic]] [[iconography]], in which [[St. Jerome]], most famed for editing the [[New Testament]], is often (though not always) depicted with an owl as a symbol of wisdom and scholarship.&lt;ref name="NMSU"&gt;[http://artdepartment.nmsu.edu/faculty/zarursite/retablo/col-saints.html The Collection: St. Jerome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022221000/http://artdepartment.nmsu.edu/faculty/zarursite/retablo/col-saints.html |date=2012-10-22 }}, gallery of the religious art collection of [[New Mexico State University]], with explanations. Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the tribe, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] religious iconography attributes a wide range of attributes to the owl, both positive and negative, as do the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Russia]]n cultures, but none parallel the Hindu attributes assigned to the owl as Lakshmi's divine vehicle.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;[http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Mythology&amp;title=Owls+Lore+Culture&amp;page=3 Owl and Mythology], p. 3.  Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hold that similar analyses could be performed cross-culturally for any of the other Hindu divine vehicles, and in each case, any parallels with the values assigned to animal totems in other cultures are likely to be either coincidence, or inevitable (as in linking bulls to virility), rather than evidence of parallel development. In [[dialectic]], this is countered by the retort that each totem or vahana, as an aspect of ''[[ishta-devata]]'' (or an ''ishta-devata'' or ''[[asura]]'' in its own right), has innumerable ineffable teachings, [[insight]]s and [[Prajna (Vedic)|spiritual wisdom]]; comparative analysis yields benefit, though knowledge and understanding is not served by collapsing their qualities into homogenous [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]].

These correspondences are not always consistent. [[Ganesh]], for example, is sometimes shown with a peacock as his vehicle, although a peacock is the customary vehicle of his brother [[Kartikeya]] (also known as [[Murugan]], [[Subramanya]], [[Kartikeya|Skanda]] and other names) as well as the vehicle sometimes associated with the goddess [[Saraswati]]. Even more rarely, the elephant-headed [[Ganesh]] may be seen riding another elephant, or a lion, or a many-headed serpent.&lt;ref name="GANAPTI"&gt;[http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/adetform2.html Forms of Ganesh: The Mouse Mount and Other Ganesh Mounts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302140610/http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/adetform2.html |date=2007-03-02 }}.

As the ''vahana'', the mount or vehicle of a deity, serves the function of doubling a God's or Goddess' powers. The vahana also represents the devotee's mind which allows the deity to guide the devotee. Durga the warrioress could not have destroyed the demon [[Mahishasura]] without the aid of her vehicle, lion, which was given by her father Himalaya, for the stated purpose. Lakshmi, goddess of fortune, dispenses both material and spiritual riches from her mount, Uluka the owl. Ganesh, remover of obstacles, cannot go everywhere despite his elephant-like strength. However, his vehicle, Mushika the mouse, who can crawl into the smallest crevice or Akhuketana the rat, who can survive just about anywhere, can assist Ganesh to overcome the greatest obstacles.
