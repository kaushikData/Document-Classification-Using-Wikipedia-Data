==Social sculpture and political art==

Local and nationally known artists were commissioned to create socio-political artwork presented through the mass media, concerning critical issues of the time, such as [[nuclear proliferation]], [[environmental degradation]], [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], and loss of privacy through technology. The forum stimulated discourse between local communities and nationally known artists through hands-on video workshops, interviews, lectures, performances, informal discussions and [[road trips]].&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Journal Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=Marcus|title='Art and the Media: An art project adopts techniques of the mass media'|journal=Albuquerque Journal Magazine, Impact|date=January 28, 1986|volume= 9| issue = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], Albuquerque Arts Alliance, the Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Art, and the New Mexico Arts Division.&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Living Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Patrick|author2=Widmer, Gwenn|title='Front Pages, Frontier Living: Disappearing Space (Even in the West)'|journal=Albuquerque Living Magazine|date=January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ART/MEDIA operated as a ''museum without walls'' with an office located in the historical [[Kimo Theater]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]].&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Living Magazine"/&gt; Inspired by the concept/model of [[Joseph Beuys]] [[social sculpture]], that have the potential to transform society, ART/MEDIA was an extended artwork that included human interactions, creating structures and systems within society using language, thought, objects, events and actions.&lt;ref name="The Santa Fe Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|title='Beyond the Andrews (on Paul Bob)'|newspaper=The Santa Fe Reporter|date=February 12, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was documented by seminal video artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] who founded [[The Kitchen]] in [[New York City]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="City Arts"&gt;{{cite journal|title='ART/MEDIA Funded by National Endowment for the Arts and New Mexico Arts Division'|journal=City Arts|date=November–December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The concept for the project originated in 1984 with artists Duane Griffin, Patrick Clancy and Scott Portman who later joined with Co-Directors [[Eve Andree Laramee]] and Ann Zimmerman to found the project and organization. The [[Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Arts]] was the fiscal sponsor under 501c3 not-for-profit status. Bob Gaylor, then director of SFCCC and invited Griffin and Laramee to be part of a [[Think Tank]] at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] where they met with [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Edward "Ned" Hall]], [[Jerome Rothenberg]], and other artists and thinkers. Empowered by this experience, a team of advisors were assembled. Gaylor served as a primary advisor throughout the project, along with Gordon Church of the City of Albuquerque Cultural Affairs Office. The Albuquerque Arts Alliance and the City of [[Albuquerque]] became the second fiscal sponsor, providing an office in the historical [[Kimo Theater]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] introduced the organizers to [[Godfrey Reggio]], director of the film [[Koyannisqatsi]] (1982) who provided guidance on organizing [[Social Sculpture]] events as ''[[public service announcements]]''.  Reggio, having been involved in numerous progressive political causes, took interest because his Institute for Regional Education had developed a multi-media campaign of PSA's for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] on the invasion of privacy and use of technology to control behavior in 1972. Grants were received from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the InterArts and the Artist Forums categories and the New Mexico Arts Division.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8485">An '''acting governor''' is a [[constitution]]al position created in some [[U.S. state]]s when the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] dies in office or resigns. In some states, the governor may also be declared to be incapacitated and unable to function for various reasons including, illness and absence from the state for more than a specified period.

In these instances, the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] will declare which official is to serve as governor and whether this person will have all of the powers of the office or only specified ones. In many states, the person succeeding to the governorship or becoming acting governor is the [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]; however, not all states have such a position. If the state constitution provides for an acting governor in the event of the governor's disability, it will also provide for a method by which the governor can be declared to be no longer disabled.

==Examples of acting governors==
===Alabama===
[[George C. Wallace]] was shot in an assassination attempt in May of 1972. With him out of state recovering for more than 120 days, Lt. Governor [[Jere Beasley]] acted as governor from June 5 to July 7, 1972, at which time Governor Wallace returned to the state and returned to office. 

===New Jersey===
In [[New Jersey]], a state which now has an office of lieutenant governor, in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. In case of the inability of the current governor to fulfill the gubernatorial duties through injury, the lieutenant governor serves as the acting governor. The acting governor performs powers and duties until the governor recovers from the injuries. If the governor's death or resignation occurs less than 16 months before end of the term, the new governor serves until the end of the term, otherwise a special election (in which the new governor may participate) is held. 

Prior to the establishment of the modern office of lieutenant governor following a constitutional referendum in 2005, a vacancy in the office of governor would lead to the president of the New Jersey Senate to become acting governor while still retaining the title of senate president. Following the resignation of [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, [[Donald DiFrancesco]] assumed the acting governor's post, serving until January 2002. Following DiFrancesco's departure from the senate, [[John O. Bennett]] and [[Richard J. Codey]] each served as acting governor as well. As control of the New Jersey Senate was evenly split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett each held the office of acting governor for three days in January 2002, until [[Jim McGreevey]] began his term as governor. Codey again served as acting governor following McGreevey's own resignation, serving from November 2004 until January 2006, when [[Jon Corzine]] took office as governor. The proximity of these events were a major factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of lieutenant governor in the 2005 referendum, effective with the 2009 election. Even before the amendment could take effect, on December 28, 2006, state transportation commissioner [[Kris Kolluri]] served as acting governor for a day, as Governor Corzine, the senate president, assembly speaker and attorney general, were all out of state, and Kolluri was next in the line of succession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=local&amp;id=4887263 "N.J. Gets New Governor... For a Day"], [[WPVI-TV]], December 28, 2006. Accessed June 25, 2007. "Transportation Commissioner Kris Kolluri will take over the post because Governor Corzine will be out of town. So will the Senate president, Assembly speaker and attorney general, all of whom are ahead of Kolluri in the line of succession."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
In [[Massachusetts]], in the event of a vacancy in the governor's office, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the office, but not the office for the remainder of the term, thus becoming acting governor, while retaining the lieutenant governor's office. In 1997, when [[William Weld]] resigned to pursue the ambassadorship to Mexico, [[Paul Cellucci]] took over as acting governor until after his 1998 election as governor, when he assumed office in January 1999. In 2001 when Cellucci resigned to become [[United States Ambassador to Canada]], [[Jane Swift]] became the acting governor for the remainder of the term, until January 2003.

===West Virginia===
In [[West Virginia]], if the governorship becomes vacant, the [[West Virginia Senate#Senate President|Senate President]] acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a special election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term.&lt;ref&gt;WV Constitution article VII, § 16.&lt;/ref&gt; A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Text_HTML/2000_SESSIONS/RS/Bills/hb4781%20enr.htm | title=H.B. 4781 (Enrolled March 11, 2009) | publisher=West Virginia Legislature, 2000 Sessions | accessdate=August 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. Then-Senate President [[Earl Ray Tomblin]] is the first person under the current state Constitution to act as governor following the November 15, 2010 resignation of [[Joe Manchin]] following his election to the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by the death of [[Robert Byrd]]. As there was more than one year remaining on Manchin's term as governor, a [[West Virginia gubernatorial special election, 2011|special election]] was held, which Tomblin won. He became governor on November 13, 2011 to complete the term.

==Disputes over powers of acting governors==
The powers of an acting governor came into dispute during the 1980 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election|primary]] [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|presidential campaign]] of [[Jerry Brown]], then [[governor of California]]. When he was campaigning out of state, which was often in late 1979 and early 1980, [[Mike Curb]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who was then serving as [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] often used his position as acting governor to [[veto]] legislation, promulgate [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, issue proclamations, and to do other things that Brown would not likely have done had he been present in the state. This eventually resulted in litigation, much of which went in Curb's favor. 

Powers of an acting governor had previously been questioned in the mid-1970s in [[Kentucky]]. In her capacity as acting governor of Kentucky in [[Julian Carroll]]'s absence, [[Thelma Stovall]], then-Lieutenant Governor, acting as governor, issued [[pardon]]s, called the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] into special session to enact legislation limiting [[property tax]] increases, and purported to [[veto]] the legislature's repeal of its ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The authority of the Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky to act as governor when the elected governor is out of state was repealed under a 1992 amendment to the [[Kentucky Constitution]].

In 1993, in Pennsylvania, Governor [[Robert P. Casey]] underwent [[surgery]] that left him incapacitated for months, thus leaving [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Mark Singel]] as acting governor. During that time, Singel fulfilled all duties of the office of governor.

Following the death of New Hampshire Governor [[Hugh Gallen]], [[Vesta M. Roy]], as president of the state Senate, served as acting governor of New Hampshire from December 30, 1982, to January 6, 1983.

Practices in this area are anything but uniform from state to state. In [[Rhode Island]], for example, the Lieutenant Governor never acts as governor, even if the Governor has left the state. In most of the states, when the governor dies, resigns or is removed from office (via impeachment conviction), the next in line become the new governor, succeeding to the office ''and'' powers.

In 2001, it came to light that Sullivan had posted anonymous online advertisements for [[bareback sex|unprotected anal sex]], preferably with "other HIV-positive men".

==Career==
In 1986, Sullivan began his career with ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine, serving as its editor from 1991 to 1996.&lt;ref name="journalist profile"/&gt; In that position, he expanded the magazine from its traditional roots in political coverage to cultural issues and the politics surrounding them. During this time, the magazine generated several high-profile controversies.&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt;

While completing graduate work at Harvard in 1988, Sullivan published an attack in ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine on [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], "All Rhodes Lead Nowhere in Particular," which dismissed recipients of the scholarship as "hustling apple-polisher[s]"; "high-profile losers"; "the very best of the second-rate"; and "misfits by the very virtue of their bland, eugenic perfection." "[T]he sad truth is that as a rule," Sullivan wrote, "Rhodies possess none of the charms of the aristocracy and all of the debilities: fecklessness, excessive concern that peasants be aware of their achievement, and a certain hemophilia of character."&lt;ref name=RhodesSpy&gt;Sullivan, Andrew. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y78i5nkBWxgC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;ots=-mu4mAX_KU&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=rhodes+to+nowhere+andrew+sullivan&amp;output=html_text All Rhodes Lead Nowhere in Particular]", ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'', October 1988, pp. 108–114. Quoted in Schaeper, Thomas J.; Schaeper, Kathleen. ''The Rhodes Scholarship, Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite'', Berghahn Books, 2010, pp. 281–285. {{ISBN|978-1845457211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Thomas Schaeper notes that "[i]ronically, Sullivan had first gone to the United States on a [[Harkness Fellowship]], one of many scholarships spawned in emulation of the Rhodes program."&lt;ref name=RhodesSpy/&gt;

In 1994, Sullivan published excerpts on [[race and intelligence]] from [[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray's]] controversial ''[[The Bell Curve]]'', which argued that some of the measured difference in [[IQ]] scores among racially defined groups was a result of [[Heredity|genetic inheritance]]. Almost the entire editorial staff of the magazine threatened to resign if material that they considered racist was published.&lt;ref name=intelligent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/andrew-sullivan-thinking-out-loud|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425202254/http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/andrew-sullivan-thinking-out-loud|archivedate=25 April 2009 |title=Andrew Sullivan: Thinking. Out. Loud. |newspaper=Intelligent Life |date=Spring 2009 |accessdate=24 October 2013|first=Johann |last=Hari}}&lt;/ref&gt; To appease them, Sullivan included lengthy rebuttals from 19 writers and contributors. He has continued to speak approvingly of the research and arguments presented in ''The Bell Curve'', writing, "The book ... still holds up as one of the most insightful and careful of the last decade. The fact of human inequality and the subtle and complex differences between various manifestations of being human—gay, straight, male, female, black, Asian—is a subject worth exploring, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2128199|title=The Bell Curve revisited.|date=17 October 2005|accessdate=22 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210010840/http://www.slate.com/id/2128199| archivedate= 10 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sullivan, this incident was a turning point in his relationship with the magazine's staff and management, which he conceded was already bad because he "was a lousy manager of people".&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; He left the magazine in 1996.

Sullivan began writing for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 1998, but was fired by editor [[Adam Moss]] in 2002. [[Jack Shafer]] wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine that he had asked Moss in an e-mail to explain this decision, but that his e-mails went unanswered, adding that Sullivan was not fully forthcoming on the subject. Sullivan wrote on his blog that the decision had been made by ''Times'' executive editor [[Howell Raines]], who found Sullivan's presence "uncomfortable", but defended Raines's right to fire him. Sullivan suggested that Raines had done so in response to Sullivan's criticism of the ''Times'' on his blog, and said he had expected that his criticisms would eventually anger Raines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2065829|title=Raines-ing in Andrew Sullivan|date=15 May 2002|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan has also worked as a columnist for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Sullivan |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/andrewsullivan/article1277182.ece |title=Back together: me, Fatboy Slim and the rest of the Upwardly Mobile Gang |work=The Sunday Times |date=23 June 2013 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Douthat]] and [[Tyler Cowen]] have suggested that Sullivan is the most influential political writer of his generation, particularly because of his very early and strident support for [[same-sex marriage]], his pioneering blog, his support of the [[Iraq War]], and his subsequent support of [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential candidacy.&lt;ref name=Douthat&gt;{{cite news|last=Douthat|first=Ross|title=The Influence of Andrew Sullivan|url=http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/the-influence-of-andrew-sullivan/?_r=0|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Ames]] has charged that Sullivan lacks journalistic integrity and has been responsible for a number of unethical and misleading articles during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ames|first=Mark|title=If Andrew Sullivan is 'The Future of Journalism' then Journalism is F*cked|url=http://thedailybanter.com/2013/01/if-andrew-sullivan-is-the-future-of-journalism-then-journalism-is-fcked/|accessdate=27 October 2013|newspaper=The Daily Banter|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Michael Oakeshott.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Oakeshott]] was a major intellectual influence on Sullivan]]

Sullivan describes himself as a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and is the author of ''The Conservative Soul''. He has supported a number of traditional [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] positions, favouring [[limited government]] and opposing [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] measures such as [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref name=lecture /&gt; However, on a number of controversial public issues, including same-sex marriage, [[social security]], [[progressive tax]]ation, [[anti-discrimination law]]s, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]], the United States government's [[Torture and the United States|use of torture]], and [[capital punishment]], he has taken positions not typically shared by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives in the United States]].&lt;ref name=lecture&gt;{{cite web|title="Conservatism And Its Discontents" T.H. White Lecture with Andrew Sullivan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjE49UnJiwE&amp;feature=plcp|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Sullivan said that "the catastrophe of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush-Cheney]] years ... all but exploded the logic of [[neoconservatism]] and its domestic partner-in-crime, [[supply-side economics]]."&lt;ref name="Yglesias Award Nominee"&gt;[http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2012/07/06/ygl-6/ "Yglesias Award Nominee"] ''The Dish'' 6 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important intellectual and political influences on Sullivan is [[Michael Oakeshott]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"/&gt; Sullivan describes Oakeshott's thought as "an anti-ideology, a nonprogramme, a way of looking at the world whose most perfect expression might be called inactivism."&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; He argues "that Oakeshott requires us to systematically discard programmes and ideologies and view each new situation ''[[sui generis]]''. Change should only ever be incremental and evolutionary. Oakeshott viewed society as resembling language: it is learned gradually and without us really realising it, and it evolves unconsciously, and for ever."&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; In 1984, he wrote that Oakeshott offered "a conservatism which ends by affirming a radical liberalism."&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; This "anti-ideology" is perhaps the source of accusations that Sullivan "flip-flops" or changes his opinions to suit the whims of the moment. He has written, "A true conservative—who is, above all, an anti-ideologue—will often be attacked for alleged inconsistency, for changing positions, for promising change but not a radical break with the past, for pursuing two objectives—like liberty and authority, or change and continuity—that seem to all ideologues as completely contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|url=http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/11/13/the-necessary-contradictions-of-a-conservative/|title=The Necessary Contradictions of a Conservative|publisher=The Daily DIsh|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, Sullivan was a fervent supporter of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and later [[Ronald Reagan]]. He says of that time, "What really made me a right-winger was seeing the left use the state to impose egalitarianism—on my school",&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in Britain tried to merge his admissions-selective school with the local [[comprehensive school]]. At Oxford, he became friends with future prominent conservatives [[William Hague]] and [[Niall Ferguson]] and became involved with [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politics.&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt;

From 1980 through 2000, he supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates in the United States,&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; with the exception of [[Bill Clinton]], who he supported during his first election campaign in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=Telly|title=Culture War: How the '90s Made Us Who We Are Today (Whether We Like It or Not)|date=14 July 2016|publisher=McFarland|page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRLaDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=andrew+sullivan+supported+clinton+1992&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XTc-kU9_yb&amp;sig=pz2PiLCauTEXnJ6UfdUnJTOD40c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj55YP83dzSAhVEOSYKHaP7ASQQ6AEIRjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=andrew%20sullivan%20supported%20clinton%201992&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, however, he supported the presidential campaign of [[John Kerry]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], angered by [[George W. Bush]]'s support of the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] designed to enshrine in the Constitution marriage as a union between a man and a woman, as well as what he saw as his administration's incompetence over its Iraq War management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Andrew|title=WHY I AM SUPPORTING JOHN KERRY|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1257816/posts|website=Free Republic|publisher=''The New Republic''|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]] for the Democratic nomination in the [[2008 US Presidential Election|2008 United States presidential election]], and Representative [[Ron Paul]] for the Republican nomination. He eventually endorsed Obama for president, largely because he believed that he would restore "the rule of law and Constitutional balance"; he also argued that Obama represented a more realistic prospect for "bringing America back to fiscal reason", and expressed a hope that Obama would be able to "get us past the culture war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/11/barack-obama-fo.html |title=The Daily Dish &amp;#124; By Andrew Sullivan (3 November 2008) – Barack Obama For President |publisher=Andrew Sullivan |accessdate=9 March 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305042620/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/11/barack-obama-fo.html |archivedate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan has continued to maintain that Obama is the best choice for president from a conservative point of view. During the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election campaign]], he wrote, "Against a radical right, reckless, populist insurgency, Obama is the conservative option, dealing with emergent problems with pragmatic calm and modest innovation.

===LGBT issues===
Sullivan, like [[Marshall Kirk]], Hunter Madsen, and [[Bruce Bawer]], has been described by [[Urvashi Vaid]] as a proponent of "legitimation", seeing the objective of the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]] as being "mainstreaming gay and lesbian people" rather than "radical social change".&lt;ref&gt;Vaid, Urvashi. ''Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay &amp; Lesbian Liberation.'' New York: Doubleday, 1996, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan wrote the first major article in the United States advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry,&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; published in ''The New Republic'' in 1989.&lt;ref name=groom&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|title=Here Comes the Groom|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/gay_marriage_votes_and_andrew_sullivan_his_landmark_1989_essay_making_a.html|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many gay rights organisations attacked him for the stance at the time. Many on "the gay left" believed that he was promoting "assimilation" into "straight culture", when the aim of most at that time was to alter codes of sexuality and society as a whole, rather than fitting gays into it.&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; However, his arguments eventually became widely accepted and formed the basis of the modern movement to allow same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=groom/&gt; In the wake of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' and ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''), ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed columnist [[Ross Douthat]] suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing, "No intellectual that I can think of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantantiated so rapidly in law and custom."&lt;ref name=Douthat/&gt;

Sullivan opposes [[hate crime]] laws, arguing that they undermine [[freedom of speech]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/hate_crimes_and.html |title=The Daily Dish &amp;#124; By Andrew Sullivan (3 May 2007) – Hate Crimes and Double Standards |publisher=Andrew Sullivan |accessdate=9 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090308132915/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/hate_crimes_and.html| archivedate= 8 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposes the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], arguing that it would "not make much of a difference" and that the "gay rights establishment" was wrong to oppose a version of the bill that did not include protections for [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/andrew-sullivan-supports-barney-frank-20071012/ |title=Andrew Sullivan Supports Barney Frank / Queerty |publisher=Queerty.com |accessdate=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan opposed calls to remove [[Brendan Eich]] as CEO of [[Mozilla]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/04/03/the-hounding-of-brendan-eich/|title=The Hounding of a Heretic|work=The Dish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/andrew-sullivan-blows-colberts-mind-with-defense-of-brendan-eich/|title=Andrew Sullivan Blows Colbert's Mind with Defense of Brendan Eich|date=10 April 2014|publisher=mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/5432/20140412/andrew-sullivan-sparks-ire-of-gay-community-over-defense-of-former-mozilla-ceo-brendan-eich.htm|title=Andrew Sullivan sparks ire of gay community over defense of former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich|work=Tech Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that "old-fashioned liberalism brought gay equality to America far, far faster than identity politics leftism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2015/01/27/the-lefts-intensifying-war-on-liberalism/|title=The Left's Intensifying War on Liberalism " The Dish|work=The Dish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Sullivan was named as an [[LGBT History Month]] icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbthistorymonth.com/andrew-sullivan |title=Andrew Sullivan |publisher=LGBTHistoryMonth.com |date=20 August 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War on terror===
Sullivan supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the United States and was initially hawkish in the [[war on terror]], arguing that weakness would embolden terrorists. He was "one of the most militant"&lt;ref name=intelligent/&gt; supporters of the Bush administration's counter-terrorism strategy immediately following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001; in an essay for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', he stated, "The middle part of the country—the great [[red states and blue states|red zone]] that voted for Bush—is clearly ready for war. The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead—and may well mount what amounts to a [[fifth column]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074734/|title=Gore, Sullivan, and "Fifth Column"|last=Noah|first=Timothy|work=Slate|date=2 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Alterman]] wrote in 2002 that Sullivan had "set himself up as a one-man [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]" running an "inquisition" to unmask "anti-war Democrats", "basing his argument less on the words these politicians speak than on the thoughts he knows them to be holding in secret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alterman|first=Eric|title=Sullivan's Travails|url=http://www.thenation.com/issue/april-8-2002#|accessdate=26 October 2013|newspaper=The Nation|date=8 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Sullivan criticised the Bush administration for its prosecution of the war, especially regarding the numbers of troops, protection of munitions, and treatment of prisoners, including the use of torture against detainees in United States custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sullivanarchives.theatlantic.com/index.php.dish_inc-archives.2005_01_09_dish_archive.html |title=Archives: Daily Dish |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191318/http://sullivanarchives.theatlantic.com/index.php.dish_inc-archives.2005_01_09_dish_archive.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he argues that [[enemy combatant]]s in the war on terror should not be given status as [[prisoners of war]] because "terrorists are not soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2005_07_03_dish_archive.html#112085651653164877 |publisher=andrewsullivan.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050717230946/http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives%2F2005_07_03_dish_archive.html |archivedate=17 July 2005 |title=The View From Your Window |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that the US government must abide by the [[rules of war]]—in particular, Article 3 of the [[Third Geneva Convention|Geneva Conventions]]—when dealing with such detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/07/hamdan_myths_an.html |work=The Daily Dish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106000231/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/ |archivedate=6 January 2009 |title=The Reality of War |deadurl=yes |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, Sullivan said that the torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq had jolted him back to "sanity".&lt;ref name=intelligent /&gt; Of his early support for the invasion of Iraq, he said, "I was terribly wrong. In the shock and trauma of 9/11, I forgot the principles of scepticism and doubt towards utopian schemes that I had learned."&lt;ref name=intelligent /&gt;

On the edition of 27 October 2006 of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', he described conservatives and Republicans who refused to admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as "cowards." On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: "After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of [[al Qaeda]] and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into thinking we could simply fight our way to victory against Islamist terror. I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/02/mccains-nationa.html |work=The Daily Dish |publisher=Andrew Sullivan |date=26 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305093346/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/02/mccains-nationa.html |archivedate=5 March 2009 |title=McCain's National Greatness Conservatism |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reversal on the Iraq issue and his increasing attacks on the Bush administration caused a severe backlash from many [[War hawk|hawkish]] conservatives, who accused him of not being a "real" conservative.&lt;ref name=intelligent /&gt;

Sullivan authored an opinion piece, "Dear President Bush," that was featured as the cover article of the October 2009 edition of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleland |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200910/bush-torture |title=Dear President Bush, |work=The Atlantic |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he called on former President Bush to take personal responsibility for the incidents and practices of torture that occurred during his administration as part of the war on terror.

===Israel===
Sullivan states that he has "always been a [[Zionist]]".&lt;ref&gt;A. Sullivan, [http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/05/mr-netanyahu-expects.html Mr Netanyahu "Expects"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523131119/http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/05/mr-netanyahu-expects.html |date=23 May 2011 }}, 20 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2009, he wrote that he could no longer take the [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] position on Israel seriously:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sullivan,[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/02/a-false-premise.html "A False Premise"], Sullivan's Daily Dish, 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[N]eo-conservatism, in large part, is simply about enabling the most [[irredentism|irredentist]] elements in Israel and sustaining a permanent war against anyone or any country who disagrees with the Israeli right [...] But America is not Israel. And once that distinction is made, much of the neoconservative ideology collapses.}}

In January 2010, Sullivan blogged that he was "moving toward" the idea of "a direct American military imposition" of a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], with [[NATO]] troops enforcing "the borders of the new states of Palestine and Israel". He commented, "I too am sick of the Israelis. [...] I'm sick of having a great power like the US being dictated to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/01/sick-of-the-israelis-and-the-palestinians.html|title=Sick|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=7 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100109011639/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/01/sick-of-the-israelis-and-the-palestinians.html| archivedate= 9 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His post was criticised by [[Noah Pollak]] of ''[[Commentary Magazine|Commentary]]'', who referred to it as "crazy", "heady stuff" based on "hubris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2010/01/06/andrew-sullivan-its-time-to-invade-israel/|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=7 January 2010|title=Andrew Sullivan: It’s Time to Invade Israel|author=[[Noah Pollak]]|publisher=[[Commentary Magazine|Commentary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, [[Leon Wieseltier]] suggested in ''The New Republic'' that Sullivan, a former friend and colleague, had a "venomous hostility toward Israel and Jews" and was "either a bigot, or just moronically insensitive" toward the [[Jews|Jewish people]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Wieseltier]], [http://www.tnr.com/article/something-much-darker Something Much Darker. Andrew Sullivan has a serious problem], ''[[The New Republic]]'', 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan rejected the accusation and was defended by some writers, while others at least partly supported Wieseltier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/19-Pundits-on-the-Sullivan-Wieseltier-Debate-2500 19 Pundits on the Sullivan-Wieseltier Debate], ''The Atlantic'', 11 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
Sullivan devoted a significant amount of blog space to covering the allegations of fraud and related protests after the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]]. Francis Wilkinson of ''[[The Week]]'' stated that Sullivan's "coverage—and that journalism term takes on new meaning here—of the uprising in Iran was nothing short of extraordinary. 'Revolutionary' might be a better word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francis Wilkinson |url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/98673/The_future_belongs_to_Andrew_Sullivan |title=The future belongs to Andrew Sullivan |publisher=Theweek.com |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was inspired by the Iranian people's reactions to the election results and used his blog as a hub of information. Because of the media blackout in Iran, Iranian Twitter accounts were a major source of information. Sullivan frequently quoted and linked to [[Nico Pitney]] of ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Read Andrew Sullivan in TheAtlantic magazine |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/06/is-iran-calming-down.html |title=Is Iran Calming Down? – The Daily Dish &amp;#124; By Andrew Sullivan |publisher=Andrew Sullivan |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Sullivan identifies himself as a faithful Catholic while disagreeing with some aspects of the Catholic Church's doctrine. In ''[[Virtually Normal]]'', he argues that the Bible forbids same-sex sexual activity only when it is linked to prostitution or [[Paganism|pagan]] rituals.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

He expressed concern about the election of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in an article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' on 24 April 2005, titled "The Vicar of Orthodoxy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Andrew Sullivan |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050502/sosullivan.html |title= The Vicar of Orthodoxy – TIME Magazine |work=Time |date=24 April 2005 |accessdate=9 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090320160656/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050502/sosullivan.html| archivedate= 20 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that Benedict was opposed to the modern world and women's rights, and considered gays and lesbians innately disposed to evil. Sullivan has, however, agreed with Benedict's assertion that reason is an integral element of faith.

Sullivan takes a moderate approach to religion, rejecting fundamentalism and describing himself as a "dogged defender of pluralism and secularism". He defended religious moderates in a series of exchanges with [[Atheism|atheist]] author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] in which Harris maintained that religious moderates provided cover for fundamentalists and made it impossible for anyone to effectively oppose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/209/story_20904_3.html |title=Is Religion 'Built Upon Lies'? |publisher=Beliefnet.com |accessdate=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blogging==
In late 2000, Sullivan began his blog, ''The Daily Dish''. The core principle of the blog has been the style of conservatism he views as traditional. This includes [[fiscal conservatism]], limited government, and classic libertarianism on social issues. Sullivan opposes government involvement with respect to sexual and consensual matters between adults, such as the use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and prostitution. He believes recognition of same-sex marriage is a civil-rights issue but expressed willingness to promote it on a state-by-state legislative [[federalism]] basis, rather than trying to judicially impose the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/2004-06-24/ex6.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040804191145/http://www.thestranger.com/2004-06-24/ex6.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2004 |title=The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper |publisher=Thestranger.com |date=24 June 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Sullivan's disputes with other conservatives have been over social issues and the handling of postwar Iraq.

Sullivan gave out yearly "awards" for various public statements, parodying those of the people the awards were named after. Throughout the year, nominees were mentioned in various blog posts. The readers of his blog chose winners at the end of each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Daily Dish Awards |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/awards.html |author= Andrew Sullivan |work=The Atlantic |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=17 March 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305024827/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/awards.html|archivedate= 5 March 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hugh Hewitt]] Award, introduced in June 2008 and named after a man Sullivan described as an "absurd partisan fanatic", was for the most egregious attempts to label Barack Obama as un-American, alien, treasonous, and far out of the mainstream of American life and politics.
* The [[John Derbyshire]] Award was for egregious and outlandish comments on gays, women, and minorities.
* The [[Paul Begala]] Award was for extreme liberal hyperbole.
* The [[Michelle Malkin]] Award was for shrill, hyperbolic, divisive, and intemperate right-wing rhetoric. ([[Ann Coulter]] was ineligible for this award so that, in Sullivan's words, "other people will have a chance.")
* The [[Michael Moore]] Award was for divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric.
* The [[Matthew Yglesias]] Award was for writers, politicians, columnists, or pundits who criticised their own side of the political spectrum, made enemies among political allies, and generally risked something for the sake of saying what they believed.
* The "Poseur Alert" was awarded for passages of prose that stood out for pretension, vanity, and bad writing designed to look profound.
* The [[Dick Morris]] Award (formerly the [[Nicholas Von Hoffman|Von Hoffman]] Award) was for stunningly wrong cultural, political, and social predictions. Sullivan renamed this award in September 2012, saying that Von Hoffman was "someone who in many ways got the future right—at least righter than I did."

In February 2007, Sullivan moved his blog from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' to ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', where he had accepted an editorial post. His presence was estimated to have contributed as much as 30% of the subsequent traffic increase for ''The Atlantic''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/business/media/21atlantic.html|title=A Venerable Magazine Energizes Its Web Site |work=The New York Times |date=21 January 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission''''', 558 U.S. 310 (2010), is a landmark [[U.S. constitutional law]], [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance,]] and [[United States corporate law|corporate law]] case dealing with regulation of [[political campaign]] spending by organizations. The [[United States Supreme Court]] held (5–4) on January 21, 2010, that the [[free speech]] clause of the [[First Amendment]] to the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting [[independent expenditure]]s for communications by [[nonprofit corporation]]s, for-profit [[corporations]], [[labor union]]s, and other [[Voluntary association|association]]s.&lt;ref name="Cillizza-22-1-2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/01/21/how-citizens-united-changed-politics-in-6-charts/|title=How Citizens United changed politics, in 7 charts|date=January 22, 2014|work=|agency=Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124174556/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/01/21/how-citizens-united-changed-politics-in-6-charts/|archive-date=January 24, 2017|dead-url=no|via=|last1=Cillizza|first1=Chris|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy-21-1-15"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/21/5-years-later-citizens-united-has-remade-us-politics|title=How Citizens United Has Changed Politics in 5 Years|date=January 21, 2015|work=|agency=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170124174819/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/21/5-years-later-citizens-united-has-remade-us-politics|archive-date=January 24, 2017|dead-url=no|via=|last1=Levy|first1=Gabrielle|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case, the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]] sought to air a film critical of [[Hillary Clinton]] and to advertise the film during television broadcasts shortly before the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primary election]] in which Clinton was running for U.S. President. 

The federal law, however, prohibited any corporation (or labor union) from making an "electioneering communication" (defined as a broadcast ad reaching over 50,000 people in the electorate) within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of an election, or making any expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a candidate at any time. The court found that these provisions of the law conflicted with the [[United States Constitution]].

The court upheld requirements, however, for public disclosure by sponsors of advertisements. The case did not affect the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties.

The decision was highly controversial and remains a subject of widespread public discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036448_2036452_2036614,00.html|title=Top 10 Controversial Supreme Court Cases|first=Ishaan|last=Tharoor|date=December 13, 2010|publisher=|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/books/review/dark-money-by-jane-mayer.html|title = 'Dark Money' by Jane Meyer|last = Ehrenhalt|first = Alan|date = January 19, 2016|work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="penguinrandomhouse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215462/dark-money-by-jane-mayer/9780307947901/|title=Dark Money by Jane Mayer - PenguinRandomHouse.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=654713560|title=Text-Only NPR.org : How Is Kavanaugh Likely To Rule On Critical Issues?

== Background ==
Section 203 of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 (known as BCRA or McCain–Feingold Act) modified the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] of 1971, {{UnitedStatesCode|2|441b}} to prohibit corporations and unions from using their general treasury to fund "electioneering communications" (broadcast advertisements mentioning a candidate in any context) within 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election.  During the 2004 presidential campaign, a conservative nonprofit [[501(c)(4)]] organization, [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]], filed a complaint before the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) charging that advertisements for [[Michael Moore|Michael Moore's]] film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', a [[docudrama]] critical of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration's]] response to the [[9/11|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]], produced and marketed by a variety of corporate entities, constituted political advertising and thus could not be aired within the 30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election.  The FEC dismissed the complaint after finding no evidence that broadcast advertisements featuring a candidate within the proscribed time limits had actually been made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2004/20040806mur.html FEC finding] August 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The FEC later dismissed a second complaint which argued that the movie itself constituted illegal corporate spending advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, which was illegal under the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 and the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974. In dismissing that complaint, the FEC found that:
{{quote|The complainant alleged that the release and distribution of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 constituted an independent expenditure because the film expressly advocated the defeat of President Bush and that by being fully or partially responsible for the film's release, Michael Moore and other entities associated with the film made excessive and/or prohibited contributions to unidentified candidates. The Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the Act because the film, associated trailers and website represented bona fide commercial activity, not "contributions" or "expenditures" as defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://transition.fec.gov/pdf/record/2005/Aug05.pdf "Compliance Cases Made Public"] (Press release). Federal Election Commission. August 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, Citizens United produced the documentary ''Celsius 41.11'', which is highly critical of both ''Fahrenheit 9/11 ''and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. The FEC, however, held that showing the movie and advertisements for it would violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, because Citizens United was not a bona fide commercial film maker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/aos/59174.pdf "Advisory Opinion 2004-30"] Federal Election Commission, September 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of these decisions, Citizens United sought to establish itself as a bona fide commercial film maker before the 2008 elections, producing several documentary films between 2005 and 2007. By early 2008, it sought to run television commercials to promote its political documentary ''Hillary: The Movie'' and to air the movie on [[DirecTV]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Robert |title='Hillary: The Movie' to Get Supreme Court Screening |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/14/AR2009031401603_pf.html |date=March 15, 2009 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the District Court==
In December 2007, Citizens United filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of several statutory provisions governing "electioneering communications".&lt;ref name=FECL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_C.shtml#search=hillary%20the%20movie |title=FEC Litigation |publisher=Federal Election Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asked the court to declare that the prohibition on corporate and union funding were facially unconstitutional, and also as applied to ''Hillary: The Movie,'' and to enjoin the Federal Election Commission from enforcing its regulations. Citizens United also argued that the Commission's disclosure and disclaimer requirements were unconstitutional as applied to the movie pursuant to the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]''.  It also sought to enjoin funding, disclosure and disclaimer requirements as applied to Citizens United’s intended ads for the movie.

In accordance with special rules in section 403 of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|BCRA]], a three-judge court was convened to hear the case. On January 15, 2008, the court denied Citizens United’s motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the suit had little chance of success because the movie had no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton, that it was therefore express advocacy, not entitled to exemption from the ban on corporate funding of electioneering communications, and that television advertisements for the movie within 30 days of a primary violated the BCRA restrictions on "electioneering communications".&lt;ref name="Ref_2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum Opinion |work=Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission |publisher=District Court for the District of Columbia |date=January 15, 2008 |url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-39 |format=PDF |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the Supreme Court in ''[[McConnell v. FEC]]'' (2003) had found the disclosure requirements constitutional as to all electioneering communications, and ''Wisconsin RTL'' did not disturb this holding because the only issue of that case was whether speech that did not constitute the functional equivalent of express advocacy could be banned during the relevant pre-election period.

On July 18, 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission. In accordance with the special rules in the BCRA, Citizens United appealed to the Supreme Court which docketed the case on August 18, 2008 and granted certiorari on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="Ref_2008a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket for 08-205 |publisher=[[U.S. Supreme Court]] |url={{SCOTUS URL Docket|08-205}} |date=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the Supreme Court==
During the original [[Oral argument in the United States|oral argument]], Deputy [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] Malcolm L. Stewart (representing the FEC) argued that under ''[[Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce]]'', the government would have the power to ban books if those books contained even one sentence expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate and were published or distributed by a corporation or labor union.&lt;ref name="Liptak2009a"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Liptak|first=Adam |title=Justices Seem Skeptical of Scope of Campaign Law |work= The New York Times |date=March 25, 2009 |page= A16|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/washington/25scotus.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this line of questioning, Stewart further argued that under ''Austin'' the government could ban the digital distribution of political books over the [[Amazon Kindle]] or prevent a union from hiring an author to write a political book.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Smith|first=Bradley| title=The Myth of Campaign Finance Reform |url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-myth-of-campaign-finance-reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[Jeffrey Toobin]], the Court expected after oral argument to rule on the narrow question that had originally been presented—Can Citizens United show the film? At the subsequent conference among the justices after oral argument, the vote was 5–4 in favor of Citizens United being allowed to show the film. The justices voted the same as they had in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'', a similar 2007 case, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito in the majority.&lt;ref name="Toobin 2012 New Yorker article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|authorlink=Jeffrey Toobin|title=Annals of Law: Money Unlimited|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/21/120521fa_fact_toobin|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote the initial opinion of the Court, [[holding (law)|holding]] that the BCRA allowed the showing of the film. A draft [[concurring opinion]] by Justice Kennedy argued that the court could and should have gone much further. The other justices in the majority agreed with Kennedy's reasoning, and convinced Roberts to reassign the writing and allow Kennedy's concurrence to become the majority opinion.&lt;ref name="Toobin 2012 New Yorker article" /&gt;

On the other side, [[John Paul Stevens]], the most senior justice in the minority, assigned the [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] to [[David Souter]], who announced his retirement from the Court while he was working on it. The final draft went beyond critiquing the majority. Toobin described it as "air[ing] some of the Court's dirty laundry," writing that Souter's dissent accused Roberts of having manipulated Court procedures to reach his desired result – an expansive decision that, Souter claimed, changed decades of election law and ruled on issues neither party to the litigation had presented.&lt;ref name="Toobin 2012 New Yorker article" /&gt;

According to Toobin, Roberts agreed to withdraw the opinion and schedule the case for reargument. When he did, the "Questions Presented" to the parties were, however, more expansive, touching on the issues Kennedy's opinion had identified. According to Toobin, the eventual result was therefore a foregone conclusion from that point on.&lt;ref name="Toobin 2012 New Yorker article" /&gt; Toobin's account has been criticized for drawing conclusions unsupported by the evidence in his article.&lt;ref name="Jeff Toobin on Citizens United"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Goldstein|title=SCOTUS Blog: Jeff Toobin on Citizens United|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/05/jeff-toobin-on-citizens-united|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2009, the last day of the term, the Court issued an order directing the parties to re-argue the case on September 9 after briefing whether it might be necessary to overrule ''Austin'' and/or ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'' to decide the case.&lt;ref name="Barnes2009"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Robert |title=Justices to Review Campaign Finance Law Constraints |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/29/AR2009062903997_pf.html |date=June 30, 2009 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Stevens noted in his dissent that in its prior motion for summary judgment, Citizens United had abandoned its [[facial challenge]] of BCRA §203's constitutionality, with the parties agreeing to the dismissal of the claim.&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;''CounterPunch'', February 4, 2010, [http://www.counterpunch.org/brauchli02042010.html Chucking Precedent at the High Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208213605/http://www.counterpunch.org/brauchli02042010.html |date=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sonia Sotomayor|Justice Sotomayor]] sat on the bench for the first time during the second round of oral arguments. This was the first case argued by then-Solicitor General and future Supreme Court Justice [[Elena Kagan]]. Former Bush Solicitor General [[Theodore Olson|Ted Olson]] and First Amendment lawyer [[Floyd Abrams]] argued for Citizens United, and former Clinton Solicitor General [[Seth Waxman]] defended the statute on behalf of various supporters.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hillary: The Oral Argument |url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2009/09/hillary_the_oral_argument.html |work= The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] called it "one of the most important First Amendment cases in years".&lt;ref name="Liptak2009b"&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam |title=Sotomayor Faces Heavy Workload of Complex Cases |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/us/politics/07scotus.html |work= The New York Times |date=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinions of the Court ==

===Majority opinion===
[[Image:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait crop.jpg|175px|thumb|Justice Kennedy, the author of the Court's opinion.]]

[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy's]] majority opinion found that the BCRA §203 prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf Syllabus : Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission], Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority wrote, "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech."&lt;ref name="TNY20120521"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=Money Unlimited: How Chief Justice John Roberts orchestrated the Citizens United decision|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/21/120521fa_fact_toobin?currentPage=all|accessdate=October 16, 2012|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Kennedy's opinion also noted that because the First Amendment does not distinguish between media and other corporations, the BCRA restrictions improperly allowed Congress to suppress political speech in newspapers, books, television, and blogs.&lt;ref name="LiptakJan2010"/&gt; The Court overruled ''Austin'', which had held that a state law that prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also overruled that portion of ''McConnell'' that upheld BCRA's restriction of corporate spending on "electioneering communications". The Court's ruling effectively freed corporations and unions to spend money both on "electioneering communications" and to directly advocate for the election or defeat of candidates (although not to contribute directly to candidates or political parties).

The majority ruled that the Freedom of the Press clause of the First Amendment protects ''associations'' of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on the identity of the speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals, therefore have free speech rights under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively and to speak on political issues.

The decision overruled ''Austin'' because that decision allowed different restrictions on speech-related spending based on corporate identity.  Additionally, the decision said that ''Austin'' was based on an "equality" rationale – trying to equalize speech between different speakers – that the Court had previously rejected as illegitimate under the First Amendment in ''Buckley''. The Michigan statute at issue in ''Austin'' had distinguished between corporate and union spending, prohibiting the former while allowing the latter. The ''Austin'' Court, over the dissent by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and O'Connor, had held that such distinctions were within the legislature's prerogative. In ''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission'', however, the majority argued that the First Amendment purposefully keeps the government from interfering in the "marketplace of ideas" and "rationing" speech, and it is not up to the legislatures or the courts to create a sense of "fairness" by restricting speech.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The majority also criticized ''Austin's'' reasoning that the "distorting effect" of large corporate expenditures constituted a risk of corruption or the [[appearance of corruption]]. Rather, the majority argued that the government had no place in determining whether large expenditures distorted an audience's perceptions, and that the type of "corruption" that might justify government controls on spending for speech had to relate to some form of "quid pro quo" transaction: "There is no such thing as too much speech."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  The public has a right to have access to all information and to determine the reliability and importance of the information. Additionally, the majority did not believe that reliable evidence substantiated the risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, and so this rationale did not satisfy [[strict scrutiny]].

The Court's opinion relied heavily on the reasoning and principles of the landmark campaign finance case of ''Buckley'' and ''[[First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti]]'', in which the Court struck down a broad prohibition against independent expenditures by corporations in ballot initiatives and referenda.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Specifically, the Court echoed ''Bellotti's'' rejection of categories based on a corporation's purpose.  The majority argued that to grant Freedom of the Press protections to media corporations, but not others, presented a host of problems; and so all corporations should be equally protected from expenditure restrictions.

The Court found that BCRA §§201 and 311, provisions requiring disclosure of the funder, were valid as applied to the movie advertisements and to the movie itself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The majority ruled for the disclosure of the sources of campaign contributions, saying that&lt;blockquote&gt;... prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation’s political speech advances the corporation’s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are "in the pocket" of so-called moneyed interests... This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |magazine=[[The Nation]] |title=The Republican Governors Thank You for Your Donation |first=Jamie |last=Raskin |authorlink=Jamie Raskin |date=January 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/republican-governors-thank-you-your-donation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Politico]] |title=Who is paying for political ads? |first1=Newton |last1=Minow |authorlink1=Newton Minow |first2=Henry |last2=Geller |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2011/12/who-is-payingfor-political-ads-070263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Concurrences ===
{{original research section|date=June 2015}}
[[Chief Justice Roberts]], with whom [[Justice Alito]] joined, wrote separately "to address the important principles of judicial restraint and ''[[stare decisis]]'' implicated in this case".&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZC.html Roberts opinion] et ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts wrote to further explain and defend the Court's statement that "there is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication."  Roberts explained why the Court must sometimes overrule prior decisions. Had prior Courts never gone against ''stare decisis'' (that is, against precedent), for example, "segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants".  Roberts' concurrence recited a plethora of case law in which the court had ruled against precedent.  Ultimately, Roberts argued that "''stare decisis''... counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones".&lt;ref name="Ref_b"/&gt;

[[Justice Scalia]] joined the opinion of the Court, and wrote a concurring opinion which [[Samuel Alito|Justice Alito]] joined in full and [[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]] joined in part. Scalia addressed [[Justice Stevens]]' dissent, specifically with regard to the [[original understanding]] of the First Amendment. Scalia wrote that Stevens' dissent was "in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment... It never shows why 'the freedom of speech' that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form."  He further considered the dissent's exploration of the Framers' views about the "role of corporations in society" to be misleading, and even if valid, irrelevant to the text. Scalia principally argued that the First Amendment was written in "terms of speech, not speakers" and that "Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker."&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZC1.html Scalia opinion] at ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalia argued that the Free Press clause was originally intended to protect the distribution of written materials and did not only apply to the media specifically.  This understanding supported the majority's contention that the Constitution does not allow the Court to separate corporations into media and non-media categories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]] wrote a separate opinion concurring in all but the upholding of the disclosure provisions. In order to protect the anonymity of contributors to organizations exercising free speech, Thomas would have struck down the reporting requirements of BCRA&amp;nbsp;§201 and §311 as well, rather than allowing them to be challenged only on a case-specific basis. Thomas's primary argument was that anonymous free speech is protected and that making contributor lists public makes the contributors vulnerable to retaliation, citing instances of retaliation against contributors to both sides of a then-recent California voter initiative. Thomas also expressed concern that such retaliation could extend to retaliation by elected officials. Thomas did not consider "as-applied challenges" to be sufficient to protect against the threat of retaliation.&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZX1.html Thomas opinion] at ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissent ===
{{original research section|date=June 2015}}
{{Very long|section|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:John Paul Stevens, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Justice Stevens, the author of the dissenting opinion.]]
A dissenting opinion by [[Justice Stevens]]&lt;ref name="Ref_d"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZX.html Steven's opinion] at ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; was joined by [[Justice Ginsburg]], [[Justice Breyer]], and [[Justice Sotomayor]]. To emphasize his unhappiness with the majority, Stevens read part of his 90-page dissent from the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/01/citizens-united-v-fec-in-plain-english/|title=Citizens United v. FEC in plain English|author=McElroy, Linda|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=January 22, 2010|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens concurred in the Court's decision to sustain BCRA's disclosure provisions but dissented from the principal holding of the Court. He argued that the Court's ruling "threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution." He added: "A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZX.html|title=Opinion of Stevens, J., Supreme Court of the United States. Citizens United, Appellant v. Federal Election Commission |last=Stevens|first=John Paul|date=January 21, 2010|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|access-date=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens also argued that the Court addressed a question not raised by the litigants when it found BCRA&amp;nbsp;§203 to be facially unconstitutional, and that the majority "changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; He argued that the majority had expanded the scope beyond the questions presented by the appellant and that therefore a sufficient record for judging the case did not exist. Stevens argued that at a minimum the Court should have remanded the case for a fact-finding hearing, and that the majority did not consider other compilations of data, such as the Congressional record for justifying BCRA §203.

Stevens argued that the Court had long recognized that to deny Congress the power to safeguard against "the improper use of money to influence the result [of an election] is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burroughs v. United States]]'', 290 U.S. 534 (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;  After recognizing that in ''Buckley v. Valeo'' the Court had struck down portions of a broad prohibition of independent expenditures from any sources, Stevens argued that nevertheless ''Buckley'' recognized the legitimacy of "prophylactic" measures for limiting campaign spending and found the prevention of "corruption" to be a reasonable goal for legislation.  Consequently, Stevens argued that ''Buckley'' left the door open for carefully tailored future regulation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Although the majority echoed many of the arguments in ''First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti'', Stevens argued that the majority opinion contradicted the reasoning of other campaign finance cases – in particular, ''Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce'' and ''McConnell v. Federal Election Commission'' – and found it telling that the majority, when citing such cases, referenced mainly dissenting opinions.

Stevens argued that the majority failed to recognize the possibility for corruption outside strict ''quid pro quo'' exchanges.  He referenced facts from a previous BCRA challenge to argue that, even if the exchange of votes for expenditures could not be shown, contributors gain favorable political access from such expenditures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The majority, however, had considered access to be insufficient justification for limiting speech rights.

Stevens responded that in the past, even when striking down a ban on corporate independent expenditures, the Court "never suggested that such quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes" (''Bellotti''). ''Buckley'', he said, also acknowledged that large independent expenditures present the same dangers as ''quid pro quo'' arrangements, although ''Buckley'' struck down limits on such independent expenditures. Using the record from a previous BCRA §203 challenge, he argued that independent expenditures were sometimes a factor in gaining political access and concluded that large independent expenditures generate ''more'' influence than direct campaign contributions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Furthermore, Stevens argued that corporations could threaten Representatives and Senators with negative advertising to gain unprecedented leverage. Stevens supported his argument by citing ''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', 556 U.S. _ (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court held that $3 million in independent expenditures in a judicial race raised sufficient questions about a judge's impartiality to require the judge to recuse himself in a future case involving the spender. Stevens argued that it was contradictory for the majority to ignore the same risks in legislative and executive elections, and argued that the majority opinion would exacerbate the problem presented in ''Caperton'' because of the number of states with judicial elections and increased spending in judicial races.

Second, Stevens argued that the majority did not place enough emphasis on the need to prevent the "appearance of corruption" in elections.  Earlier cases, including ''Buckley'' and ''Bellotti'', recognized the importance of public confidence in democracy.  Stevens cited recent data indicating that 80% of the public view corporate independent expenditures as a method used to gain unfair legislative access.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Stevens predicted that if the public believes that corporations dominate elections, disaffected voters will stop participating.

Third, Stevens argued that the majority's decision failed to recognize the dangers of the corporate form. ''Austin'' held that the prevention of corruption, including the distorting influence of a dominant funding source, was a sufficient reason for regulating corporate independent expenditures. In defending ''Austin'', Stevens argued that the unique qualities of corporations and other artificial legal entities made them dangerous to democratic elections. These legal entities, he argued, have perpetual life, the ability to amass large sums of money, limited liability, no ability to vote, no morality, no purpose outside profit-making, and no loyalty. Therefore, he argued, the courts should permit legislatures to regulate corporate participation in the political process.

Legal entities, Stevens wrote, are not "We the People" for whom our Constitution was established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Therefore, he argued, they should not be given speech protections under the First Amendment. The First Amendment, he argued, protects individual self-expression, self-realization and the communication of ideas. Corporate spending is the "furthest from the core of political expression" protected by the Constitution, he argued, citing ''Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont'',&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont'', 539 U.S. 146 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and corporate spending on politics should be viewed as a business transaction designed by the officers or the [[boards of directors]] for no purpose other than profit-making.  Stevens called corporate spending "more transactional than ideological".  Stevens also pointed out that any member of a corporation may spend personal money on promoting a campaign because BCRA only prohibited the use of general treasury money.

Fourth, Stevens attacked the majority's central argument: that the prohibition of spending guards free speech and allows the general public to receive all available information. Relying on ''Austin'', Stevens argued that corporations "unfairly influence" the electoral process with vast sums of money that few individuals can match, which distorts the public debate. Because a typical voter can only absorb so much information during a relevant election period, Stevens described "unfair corporate influence" as the potential to outspend others, to push others out of prime broadcasting spots and to dominate the "marketplace of ideas".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  This process, he argued, puts disproportionate focus on this speech and gives the impression of widespread support regardless of actual support. Thus, this process marginalizes the speech of other individuals and groups.

Stevens referred to the majority's argument that "there is no such thing as too much speech" as "facile" and a "[[straw man]]" argument. He called it an incorrect statement of First Amendment law because the Court recognizes numerous exceptions to free speech, such as fighting words, obscenity restrictions, time, place and manner restrictions, etc. Throughout his dissent, Stevens said that the majority's "slogan" ignored the possibility that too much speech from one source could "drown out" other points of view.

Fifth, Stevens criticized the majority's fear that the government could use BCRA §203 to censor the media. The focus placed on this hypothetical fear made no sense to him because it did not relate to the facts of this case – if the government actually attempted to apply BCRA §203 to the media (and assuming that Citizens United could not constitute media), the Court could deal with the problem at that time. Stevens described the majority's supposed protection of the media as nothing more than posturing. According to him, it was the majority's new rule in this case, that prohibited a law from distinguishing between speakers or funding sources. This new rule would be the only reason why media corporations could not be exempted from BCRA §203. In this, Stevens and the majority conceptualize the First Amendment's protection of "the press" quite differently. Stevens argues that the press is an entity, which can be distinguished from other persons and entities which are not press. The majority opinion viewed "freedom of the press" as an activity, applicable to all citizens or groups of citizens seeking to publish views.

Sixth, Stevens claimed that the majority failed to give proper deference to the legislature.  Stevens predicted that this ruling would restrict the ability of the states to experiment with different methods for decreasing corruption in elections.  According to Stevens, this ruling virtually ended those efforts, "declaring by fiat" that people will not "lose faith in our democracy".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Stevens argued that the majority's view of a self-serving legislature, passing campaign-spending laws to gain an advantage in retaining a seat, coupled with "strict scrutiny" of laws, would make it difficult for any campaign finance regulation to be upheld in future cases.

Seventh, Stevens argued that the majority opinion ignored the rights of shareholders.  A series of cases protects individuals from legally compelled payment of union dues to support political speech.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abood v. Detroit Board of Education]]'', 431 U.S. 209 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;  Because shareholders invest money in corporations, Stevens argued that the law should likewise help to protect shareholders from funding speech that they oppose.  The majority, however, argued that ownership of corporate stock was voluntary and that unhappy shareholders could simply sell off their shares if they did not agree with the corporation's speech. Stevens also argued that  [[Political Action Committees]] (PACs), which allow individual members of a corporation to invest money in a separate fund, are an adequate substitute for general corporate speech and better protect shareholder rights. The majority, by contrast, had argued that most corporations are too small and lack the resources and raw number of shareholders and management staff necessary to maintain compliance, accounting and administrative costs of a PAC. In this dispute, the opposing views essentially discussed differing types of entities: Stevens focused his argument on large, publicly held corporations while the justices in the majority, particularly Justice Scalia's concurring opinion, placed an emphasis on small, closely held corporations and non-profits.

Stevens called the majority's faith in "corporate democracy" an unrealistic method for a shareholder to oppose political funding.  A [[derivative suit]] is slow, inefficient, risky and potentially expensive.  Likewise, shareholder meetings only happen a few times a year, not prior to every decision or transaction.  Rather, the officers and boards control the day-to-day spending, including political spending.  According to Stevens, the shareholders have few options, giving them "virtually nonexistent" recourse for opposing a corporation's political spending.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Furthermore, most shareholders use investment intermediaries, such as mutual funds or pensions, and by the time a shareholder may find out about a corporation's political spending and try to object, the damage is done and the shareholder has funded disfavored speech.

Stevens concluded his dissent by writing:{{quote|At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.&lt;ref name="TNY20120521"/&gt;}}

== Subsequent developments ==
There was a wide range of reactions to the case from politicians, academics, attorneys, advocacy groups and journalists.

Republican campaign consultant [[Ed Rollins]] opined that the decision adds transparency to the election process and will make it more competitive.&lt;ref name="Rollins2010"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rollins|first=Ed |authorlink=Ed Rollins |title=Another shock to the Washington system |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/21/rollins.campaign.rules.obsolete/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advocacy groups====
[[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]], the group filing the lawsuit, said, "Today's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing Citizens United to air its documentary films and advertisements is a tremendous victory, not only for Citizens United but for every American who desires to participate in the political process."&lt;ref name="Ref_2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement from David N.

Campaign finance attorney Cleta Mitchell, who had filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief on behalf of two advocacy organizations opposing the ban, wrote that "The Supreme Court has correctly eliminated a constitutionally flawed system that allowed media corporations (e.g., The Washington Post Co.) to freely disseminate their opinions about candidates using corporate treasury funds, while denying that constitutional privilege to Susie's Flower Shop Inc.&amp;nbsp;...

[[Heritage Foundation]] fellow [[Hans A. von Spakovsky]], a former Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, said "The Supreme Court has restored a part of the First Amendment that had been unfortunately stolen by Congress and a previously wrongly-decided ruling of the court."&lt;ref name="Dinan2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dinan|first=Stephen |title=Divided court strikes down campaign money restrictions |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=January 21, 2010 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jan/21/divided-court-strikes-down-campaign-money-restrict/?page=2 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian [[Cato Institute]] analysts John Samples and Ilya Shapiro wrote that restrictions on advertising were based on the idea "that corporations had so much money that their spending would create vast inequalities in speech that would undermine democracy". They continued, "To make campaign spending equal or nearly so, the government would have to force some people or groups to spend less than they wished. And equality of speech is inherently contrary to protecting speech from government restraint, which is ultimately the heart of American conceptions of free speech."&lt;ref name="Samples2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samples|first1=John |last2=Shapiro|first2=Ilya |title=Free Speech for All |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=January 21, 2010 |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed an amicus brief that supported the decision,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission "Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission"], [[American Civil Liberties Union]], July 29, 2009, retrieved June 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "section 203 should now be struck down as facially unconstitutional", though membership was split over the implications of the ruling and its board sent the issue to its special committee on campaign finance for further consideration.&lt;ref name='Sun-ACLU'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Joseph | last=Goldstein | title=ACLU May Reverse Course On Campaign Finance Limits After Supreme Court Ruling | date=January 24, 2010 | url=http://www.nysun.com/national/aclu-may-reverse-course-on-campaign-finance/86899/ | work=[[New York Sun]] | accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's ''Citizens United'' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ACLU and ''Citizens United''|url=https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-and-citizens-united|date=March 27, 2012|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Academics and attorneys====
[[Bradley A. Smith]], professor of law at [[Capital University Law School]], former chairman of the FEC, founder of the [[Center for Competitive Politics]] and a leading proponent of deregulation of campaign finance, wrote that the major opponents of political free speech are "incumbent politicians" who "are keen to maintain a chokehold on such speech". Empowering "small and midsize corporations – and every incorporated mom-and-pop falafel joint, local firefighters' union, and environmental group – to make its voice heard" frightens them.&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bradley |title=The Citizens United Fallout, Democrats plan to redouble their efforts to stifle corporate free speech |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/eon0125bs.html |journal=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]] |date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to statements by President Obama and others that the ruling would allow foreign entities to gain political influence through U.S. subsidiaries, Smith pointed out that the decision did not overturn the ban on political donations by foreign corporations and the prohibition on any involvement by foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending by U.S. subsidiaries, which are covered by other parts of the law.&lt;ref name="Smith2010a"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Bradley |title=President Wrong on Citizens United Case |url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTVkODZiM2M0ODEzOGQ3MTMwYzgzYjNmODBiMzQzZjk= |work=[[National Review]] |date=January 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130002609/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTVkODZiM2M0ODEzOGQ3MTMwYzgzYjNmODBiMzQzZjk%3D |archivedate=January 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaign finance expert Jan Baran, a member of the [[Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform]], agreed with the decision, writing that "The history of campaign finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they can't talk back."  Baran further noted that in general [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[libertarians]] praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.&lt;ref name="Baran"&gt;{{cite news |last=Baran|first=Jan Witold |title=Stampede Toward Democracy |work=The New York Times |date=January 25, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/opinion/26baran.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the FEC, wrote that corporations relied more on the development of long-term relationships, political action committees and personal contributions, which were not affected by the decision. He held that while trade associations might seek to raise funds and support candidates, corporations which have "signed on to transparency agreements regarding political spending" may not be eager to give.&lt;ref name="WP-opinions"/&gt;

''The New York Times'' asked seven academics to opine on how corporate money would reshape politics as a result of the court's decision.&lt;ref name=NYTdebate&gt;{{cite news|title=How Corporate Money Will Reshape Politics: Restoring Free Speech in Elections |url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/how-corporate-money-will-reshape-politics |work=The New York Times  blog |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the seven wrote that the effects would be minimal or positive: Christopher Cotton, a [[University of Miami]] School of Business assistant professor of economics, wrote that "There may be very little difference between seeing eight ads or seeing nine ads (compared to seeing one ad or two). And, voters recognize that richer candidates are not necessarily the better candidates, and in some cases, the benefit of running more ads is offset by the negative signal that spending a lot of money creates.&lt;ref name=NYTdebate/&gt; [[Eugene Volokh]], a professor of law at UCLA, stated that the "most influential actors in most political campaigns" are media corporations which "overtly editorialize for and against candidates, and also influence elections by choosing what to cover and how to cover it". Holding that corporations like [[Exxon]] would fear alienating voters by supporting candidates, the decision really meant that voters would hear "more messages from more sources".&lt;ref name=NYTdebate/&gt; Joel Gora, a professor at [[Brooklyn Law School]] who had previously argued the case of ''Buckley v. Valeo'' on behalf of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], said that the decision represented "a great day for the First Amendment" writing that the Court had "dismantled the First Amendment 'caste system' in election speech".&lt;ref name=NYTdebate/&gt;

====Journalists====
The Editorial Board of the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' criticized McCain–Feingold's exception for media corporations from the ban on corporate electioneering, writing that it "makes no sense" that the paper could make endorsements up until the day of the election but advocacy groups could not. "While the influence of money on the political process is troubling and sometimes corrupting, abridging political speech is the wrong way to counterbalance that influence."&lt;ref name="Ref_2010a"&gt;{{cite web | title=High court ruling protects speech | url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/82636522.html | work=San Antonio Express-News Editorial Board | publisher=Hearst Newspapers | date=January 26, 2010 | accessdate=January 26, 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Dick in ''[[National Review]]'' countered a number of arguments against the decision, asking rhetorically, "is there something uniquely harmful and/or unworthy of protection about political messages that come from corporations and unions, as opposed to, say, rich individuals, persuasive writers, or charismatic demagogues?" He noted that "a recent Gallup poll shows that a majority of the public actually agrees with the Court that corporations and unions should be treated just like individuals in terms of their political-expenditure rights".&lt;ref name="Dick2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dick |first=Anthony |title=Defending Citizens United |url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTk4OTA4YzlkMDg5ZmQyMWQ3OTFiZjM4OWIxMmYxNGI= |work=[[National Review]] |date=January 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209114159/http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTk4OTA4YzlkMDg5ZmQyMWQ3OTFiZjM4OWIxMmYxNGI%3D |archivedate=February 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Gallup poll taken in October 2009 and released soon after the decision showed 57&amp;nbsp;percent of those surveyed agreed that contributions to political candidates are a form of free speech and 55&amp;nbsp;percent agreed that the same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions.

''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' editorial board member Steve Chapman wrote "If corporate advocacy may be forbidden as it was under the law in question, it's not just Exxon Mobil and Citigroup that are rendered mute. Nonprofit corporations set up merely to advance goals shared by citizens, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, also have to put a sock in it.

Although federal law after ''Citizens United v.

The constitutional law scholar [[Laurence H.

Former Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], whose opinions had changed from dissenting in ''Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce'' to co-authoring (with Stevens) the majority opinion in ''McConnell v.

[[Richard L.

Kathleen M. Sullivan, professor at [[Stanford Law School]] and Steven J.

Hasen]], Distinguished Professor of [[election law]] at [[Loyola Law School]] argued differently from his Slate article above, concentrating on the "inherent risk of corruption that comes when someone spends independently to try to influence the outcome of judicial elections", since judges are less publicly accountable than elected officials. Heather K. Gerken, Professor of Law at [[Yale Law School]] wrote that "The court has done real damage to the cause of reform, but that damage mostly came earlier, with decisions that made less of a splash." [[Michael Waldman]], director of the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] at [[N.Y.U. School of Law]], opined that the decision "matches or exceeds ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' in ideological or partisan overreaching by the court", explaining how "Exxon or any other firm could spend Bloomberg-level sums in any congressional district in the country against, say, any congressman who supports climate change legislation, or health care, etc." and [[Fred Wertheimer]], founder and president of [[Democracy 21]] considered that "Chief Justice Roberts has abandoned the illusory public commitments he made to 'judicial modesty' and 'respect for precedent' to cast the deciding vote for a radical decision that profoundly undermines our democracy," and that "Congress and presidents past have recognized this danger and signed numerous laws over the years to prevent this kind of corruption of our government."&lt;ref name=NYTdebate/&gt;

In a ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' Magazine survey of over 50 law professors, Richard Delgado ([[University of Alabama Law School|University of Alabama]]), [[Cass Sunstein]] ([[Harvard Law School|Harvard]]), and Jenny Martinez ([[Stanford Law School|Stanford]]) all listed ''Citizens United'' as the “worst Supreme Court decision since 1960,” with Sunstein noting that the decision is “undermining our system of democracy itself.”&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Sachs, The Worst Supreme Court Decisions Since 1960, TIME, October 6, 2015, http://time.com/4056051/worst-supreme-court-decisions/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This event received extensive comment from political bloggers, with a substantial amount of the coverage concentrated on whether or not foreign corporations would be able to make substantial political contributions in US elections. In the opinion, the Court had specifically indicated it was not overturning the ban on foreign contributions.

An ABC–''The Washington Post'' poll conducted February 4–8, 2010, showed that 80% of those surveyed opposed (and 65% strongly opposed) the ''Citizens United'' ruling, which the poll described as saying "corporations and unions can spend as much money as they want to help political candidates win elections". Additionally, 72% supported "an effort by Congress to reinstate limits on corporate and union spending on election campaigns".

A [[Gallup Poll]] conducted in October 2009, after oral argument, but released after the Supreme Court released its opinion, found that 57&amp;nbsp;percent of those surveyed "agreed that money given to political candidates is a form of free speech" and 55&amp;nbsp;percent agreed that the "same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions". In the same poll, however, respondents by 52% to 41% prioritized limits on campaign contributions over protecting rights to support campaigns and 76% thought the government should be able to place limits on corporation or union donations.&lt;ref name="Ref_n"&gt;Lydia Saad, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/125333/Public-Agrees-Court-Campaign-Money-Free-Speech.aspx Public Agrees With Court: Campaign Money Is "Free Speech" but have mixed views on other issues at heart of new Supreme Court ruling], Gallup, January 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_o"&gt;Jordan Fabian, [http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/77629-poll-public-agrees-with-principles-of-campaign-finance-decision Poll: Public agrees with principles of campaign finance decision], [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]], January 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poll also found that only 22 percent had heard of the case.

Polling conducted by Ipsos in August 2017 found that 48% of Americans oppose the decision and 30% support it, with the remainder having no opinion. It also found that 57% percent of Americans, favored "limits on the amount of money super PACs can raise and spend". &lt;ref&gt;Chris Jackson, [https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/center-for-public-integrity-2017-08-31 Majority of Americans Support Campaign Finance Reform], August 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''SpeechNow v. FEC''===
{{main|SpeechNOW v. FEC}}

SpeechNow is a nonprofit, unincorporated association organized as a section 527 entity under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The organization was formed by individuals who seek to pool their resources to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates. SpeechNow planned to accept contributions only from individuals, not corporations or other sources prohibited under the Federal Election Campaign Act. On February 14, 2008, SpeechNow and several individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act provisions governing political committee registration, contribution limits and disclosure. The plaintiffs contended that the Act unconstitutionally restricts their association guaranteed under the First Amendment. By requiring registration as a political committee and limiting the monetary amount that an individual may contribute to a political committee, SpeechNow and the other plaintiffs asserted that the Act unconstitutionally restricted the individuals' freedom of speech by limiting the amount that an individual can contribute to SpeechNow and thus the amount the organization may spend. SpeechNow also argued that the reporting required of political committees is unconstitutionally burdensome.&lt;ref name="FEC20121013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speechnow.org v.

On March 26, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in ''SpeechNow.org. v. FEC'' that the contribution limits of 2 U.S.C. §441a were unconstitutional as applied to individuals' contributions to SpeechNow. The court also ruled that the reporting requirements of 2 U.S.C. §§432, 433 and 434(a) and the organizational requirements of 2 U.S.C. §431(4) and §431(8) can be constitutionally applied to SpeechNow.&lt;ref name="FEC20121013" /&gt; A unanimous nine-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Courts Take On Campaign Finance Decision|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/us/politics/27campaign.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; struck down the federal limits on contributions to federal political committees that make only independent expenditures and do not contribute to candidates or political parties. This type of "independent expenditure committee" is inherently non-corruptive, the Court reasoned, and therefore contributions to such a committee can not be limited based on the government's interest in preventing political corruption.&lt;ref name="CampaignLegalCenter20121013"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to the Current Rules For Federal Elections: What Changed in the 2010 Election Cycle|url=http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1187:a-guide-to-the-current-rules-for-federal-elections&amp;catid|work=The Campaign Legal Center|publisher=The Campaign Legal Center|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the Supreme Court's decision in ''Citizens United v. FEC'', in which the Supreme Court held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting independent expenditures, the appeals court ruled that "contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption." As a result, the court of appeals held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to an independent group such as SpeechNow. Contribution limits as applied to SpeechNow "violate the First Amendment by preventing [individuals] from donating to SpeechNow in excess of the limits and by prohibiting SpeechNow from accepting donations in excess of the limits." The court noted that its holding does not affect direct contributions to candidates, but rather contributions to a group that makes only independent expenditures.&lt;ref name="FEC20121013" /&gt; The appeals court held that, while disclosure and reporting requirements do impose a burden on First Amendment interests, they "'impose no ceiling on campaign related activities'" and "'do not prevent anyone from speaking.'" Furthermore, the court held that the additional reporting requirements that the Commission would impose on SpeechNow if it were organized as a political committee are minimal, "given the relative simplicity with which SpeechNow intends to operate." Since SpeechNow already had a number of "planned contributions" from individuals, the court ruled that SpeechNow could not compare itself to "ad hoc groups that want to create themselves on the spur of the moment." Since the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate and who is funding that speech, the court held that requiring such disclosure and organization as a political committee are sufficiently important governmental interests to justify the additional reporting and registration burdens on SpeechNow.&lt;ref name="FEC20121013" /&gt;

===Public electoral financing===
{{main|McComish v. Bennett}}

On June 27, 2011, ruling in the consolidated cases of ''Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett'' (No. 10-238) and ''[[McComish v. Bennett]]'' (No. 10-239), the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional an Arizona law that provided extra taxpayer-funded support for office seekers who have been outspent by privately funded opponents or by independent political groups. A conservative 5–4 majority of justices said the law violated free speech, concluding the state was impermissibly trying to "level the playing field" through a public finance system. Arizona lawmakers had argued there was a compelling state interest in equalizing resources among competing candidates and interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mears|first=Bill|title=Justices strike down taxpayer-supported campaign spending law|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/06/27/scotus.arizona.campaign.finance/index.html|accessdate=October 16, 2012|publisher=CNN|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents said the law violated free-speech rights of the privately financed candidates and their contributors, inhibiting fundraising and spending, discouraging participation in campaigns and limiting what voters hear about politics.&lt;ref name="Reuters20110627"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vicini|first=James|title=Supreme Court strikes down Arizona campaign finance law|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/27/us-usa-court-politics-idUSTRE75Q46120110627|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 16, 2012|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice John Roberts said in the court's majority opinion that the law substantially burdened political speech and was not sufficiently justified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Reuters20110627" /&gt;

As a consequence of the decision, states and municipalities are blocked from using a method of public financing that is simultaneously likely to attract candidates fearful they will be vastly outspent and sensitive to avoiding needless government expense. "The government can still use taxpayer funds to subsidize political campaigns, but it can only do that in a manner that provides an alternative to private financing" said William R. Maurer, a lawyer with Institute for Justice, which represented several challengers of the law. "It cannot create disincentives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Justices Strike Down Arizona Campaign Finance Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/us/politics/28campaign.html?_r=0|accessdate=October 16, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling meant the end of similar matching-fund programs in Connecticut, Maine and a few other places according to David Primo, a political science professor at University of Rochester who was an expert witness for the law's challengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Campaign Funding Measure in Arizona Overturned|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304447804576411652081842860|accessdate=October 16, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 28, 2012|author1=Jess Bravin |author2=Brent Kendall }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Montana}}

Despite the ''Citizens United'' ruling, in December 2011, the [[Montana Supreme Court]], in ''[[Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Attorney General of Montana]],'' upheld that state's law limiting corporate contributions. Examining the history of corporate interference in Montana government that led to the Corrupt Practices Law, the majority decided that the state still had a compelling reason to maintain the restrictions. It ruled that these restrictions on speech were narrowly tailored and withstood strict scrutiny and thus did not contradict ''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission''.

While granting permission to file a [[certiorari]] petition, the US Supreme Court agreed to stay the Montana ruling, although Justices Ginsburg and Breyer wrote a short statement urging the Court "to consider whether, in light of the huge sums of money currently deployed to buy candidate's allegiance, ''Citizens United'' should continue to hold sway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stay Order in Pending Case |author=Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Breyer |date=February 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/021712zr1.pdf |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, over the dissent of the same four judges who dissented in ''Citizens United'', the Court simultaneously granted certiorari and summarily reversed the decision in ''American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v.

In addition to limiting the size of donations to individual candidates and parties, the Federal Election Campaign Act also includes aggregate caps on the total amount that an individual may give to all candidates and parties.

==Legislative responses==

''The New York Times'' reported that 24 states with laws prohibiting or limiting independent expenditures by unions and corporations would have to change their campaign finance laws because of the ruling.&lt;ref name="Urbina2010"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Urbina | first=Ian | title=24 States' Laws Open to Attack After Campaign Finance Ruling | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/23/us/politics/23states.html | date=January 22, 2010 | work=The New York Times | accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Citizens United'' and ''SpeechNow.org'' numerous state legislatures raised their limits on contributions to candidates and parties.&lt;ref name="CCP2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wachob|first=Luke|title=2013 State Legislative Trends: Campaign Contribution Limits Increase in Nine States|url=http://www.campaignfreedom.org/2014/05/09/legislative-review-2013-state-legislative-trends-campaign-contribution-limits-increase-in-nine-states/|date=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the federal level, lawmakers substantially increased contribution limits to political parties as part of the 2014 budget bill.&lt;ref name="Vogel121214"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Kenneth|title=Congress: A Powerful Democratic Lawyer Crafted the Campaign Finance Deal|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/democratic-lawyer-crafted-campaign-finance-deal-113549.html|date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such changes are widely perceived as efforts to place candidates and parties on something closer to equal footing with organizations making independent expenditures.&lt;ref name="Vogel121214"/&gt;

While many states and the federal government have raised contribution limits in response to ''Citizens United'', proposals aimed at discouraging political spending, or providing for public financing of campaigns, have been less successful.

Senator [[Dick Durbin]] (D-IL) proposed that candidates who sign up small donors receive $900,000 in public money, but the proposal has not been acted on by Congress. Others proposed that laws on corporate governance be amended to assure that shareholders vote on political expenditures.&lt;ref name="Alter" /&gt;

In February 2010, Senator [[Chuck Schumer|Charles E.

These gaps within the proposal attracted criticism from lawmakers on both political parties. "They are auctioning off pieces of the First Amendment in this bill...

Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California commented, "I wish there had been no carve-outs".&lt;ref name="Ref_2010e"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0625/Who-s-exempted-from-fix-for-Supreme-Court-campaign-finance-ruling|title=Who's exempted from 'fix' for Supreme Court campaign finance ruling?|date=June 25, 2010|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of 16 state legislatures have called for a [[constitutional amendment]] to reverse the court's decision: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Paul|title=Citizens United Constitutional Amendment: New Jersey Legislature Seeks Reversal Of Ruling|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/citizens-united-amendment-new-jersey_n_1981950.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Joan, [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/02/1220717/-Oregon-becomes-16th-state-to-call-for-amendment-overturning-Citizens-nbsp-United?detail=email "Oregon becomes 16th state to call for amendment overturning Citizens United"], Daily KOS, July 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these are non-binding resolutions, but three states – Vermont, California, and Illinois – called for an Article V Convention to draft and propose a federal constitutional amendment to overturn ''Citizens United''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Brandon|title=Illinois third state to call for constitutional convention to overturn ‘Citizens United’|url=http://rockrivertimes.com/2014/12/04/illinois-third-state-to-call-for-constitutional-convention-to-overturn-citizens-united/|newspaper=Rock River Times|date=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Minnesota]], the Minnesota Senate passed a similar resolution, "Senate File No. 17," on May 2, 2013, but the [[Minnesota House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] returned the measure to the General Calendar (meaning the measure did not pass) on May 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/MN/bill/SF17/2013 |title=MN SF17 &amp;#124; 2013-2014 &amp;#124; 88th Legislature |publisher=LegiScan |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-four states are needed to call an Article V convention.

On a local level, Washington D.C. and 400 other municipalities passed resolutions requesting a federal constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united4thepeople.org/local.html |title=State and Local Support &amp;#124; United For The People |publisher=United4thepeople.org |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Citizens United'', however, 13 states have actually raised their contribution limits.&lt;ref name="CCP2013"/&gt;

==Political impact==
The ''Citizens United'' ruling "opened the door" for unlimited election spending by corporations, but most of this spending has "ended up being funneled through the groups that have become known as super PACs."&lt;ref name=Mider-20-1-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mider|first1=Zachary|title=What Kind of Man Spends Millions to Elect Ted Cruz?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-01-20/what-kind-of-man-spends-millions-to-elect-ted-cruz-|accessdate=January 28, 2016|agency=Bloomberg|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics predicted that the ruling would "bring about a new era of corporate influence in politics," allowing companies and businesspeople to "buy elections" to promote their financial interests. Instead large expenditures, usually through "Super PACS," have come from "a small group of billionaires", based largely on ideology. This has shifted power "away from the political parties and toward the ... donors themselves. In part, this explains the large number and variety of candidates fielded by the Republicans in 2016."&lt;ref name=Mider-20-1-2016 /&gt;

===Super PACs===
''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission'' has often been credited for the creation of "[[Political Action Committee#Super PACs|super PACs]]", political action committees which make no financial contributions to candidates or parties, and so can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and unions. Certainly, the holding in ''Citizens United'' helped affirm the legal basis for super PACs by deciding that, for purposes of establishing a "compelling government interest" of corruption sufficient to justify government limitations on political speech, "independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Super-Soft Money: How Justice Kennedy paved the way for "SuperPACS" and the return of soft money.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2011/10/citizens_united_how_justice_kennedy_has_paved_the_way_for_the_re.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=October 25, 2012|author=Richard L. Hasen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took another decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, [[SpeechNOW.org v. FEC|''Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission'']], to actually authorize the creation of super PACs. While ''Citizens United'' held that corporations and unions could make independent expenditures, a separate provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, at least as long interpreted by the Federal Election Commission, held that individuals could not contribute to a common fund without it becoming a PAC. PACs, in turn, were not allowed to accept corporate or union contributions of any size or to accept individual contributions in excess of $5,000. In ''Speechnow.org'', the D.C. Circuit, sitting [[en banc]], held 9–0 that in light of ''Citizens United'', such restrictions on the sources and size of contributions could not apply to an organization that made only independent expenditures in support of or opposition to a candidate but not contributions to a candidate's campaign.

''Citizens United'' and ''SpeechNOW'' left their imprint on the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]], in which single individuals contributed large sums to "super PACs" supporting particular candidates. [[Sheldon Adelson]], the gambling entrepreneur, gave approximately fifteen million dollars to support [[Newt Gingrich]]. [[Foster Friess]], a Wyoming financier, donated almost two million dollars to [[Rick Santorum]]’s super PAC. [[Karl Rove]] organized super PACs that spent over $300 million in support of Republicans during the 2012 elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/11/karl-rove-offers-long-list-of-excuses-after-300-million-debacle.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114210357/http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/11/karl-rove-offers-long-list-of-excuses-after-300-million-debacle.php|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to indirectly providing support for the creation of super PACs, ''Citizens United'' allowed incorporated [[501c4|501(c)(4)]] public advocacy groups (such as the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, and the group Citizens United itself) and trade associations to make expenditures in political races. Such groups may not, under the tax code, have a primary purpose of engaging in electoral advocacy. These organizations must disclose their expenditures, but unlike super PACs they do not have to include the names of their donors in their FEC filings. A number of partisan organizations such as Karl Rove's influential conservative [[Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies]] and the liberal 21st Century Colorado have since registered as tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups (defined as groups promoting "social welfare") and engaged in substantial political spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berman|first=Ari|title=The .000063% Election|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-berman/super-pacs-2012_b_1281716.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/|title=Colbert Super PAC - Making a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow - ColbertSuperPac.com|website=www.colbertsuperpac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to claims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Schwartz |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/big-sky-big-money/the-rules-that-govern-501c4s/ |title=The Rules That Govern 501(c)(4)s &amp;#124; Big Money 2012 &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=October 30, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Glaun |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/08/super-pacs-funneling-money-through.html |title=Super PACs Utilize Secretive Nonprofits to Hide Funding in Pennsylvania, Utah &amp;#124; OpenSecrets Blog |publisher=Opensecrets.org |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truth-out.org/news/item/10289-secret-donors-vs-freedom-of-speech-the-tricky-task-of-reforming-election-abuse-by-nonprofits-part-two |title=Secret Donors vs. First Amendment: The Tricky Task of Reforming Election Abuse by Nonprofits (Part Two) |publisher=Truth-out.org |date=September 22, 2014 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of large secret donations,&lt;ref name="penguinrandomhouse.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F01%2F24%2Fbooks%2Freview%2Fdark-money-by-jane-mayer.html&lt;/ref&gt; and questions about whether such groups should be required to disclose their donors. Historically, such non-profits have not been required to disclose their donors or names of members. See ''[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama]]''.

In an August 2015 essay in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Markus Feldkirchen wrote that the ''Citizens United'' decision was "now becoming visible for the first time" in federal elections as the super-rich have "radically" increased donations to support their candidates and positions via super PACs. Feldkirchen also said in the first six months of 2015 the candidates and their super PACs received close to $400 million: "far more than in the entire previous campaign." He opined that super-rich donating more than ever before to individual campaigns plus the "enormous" chasm in wealth has given the super-rich the power to steer the economic and political direction of the United States and undermine its democracy.&lt;ref name=feldkirchen&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/donald-trump-and-other-super-rich-define-us-presidential-race-a-1052151.html| author=Markus Feldkirchen | title=The Oligarch Problem: How the Super-Rich Threaten US| work=[[Der Spiegel]]| date=September 10, 2015 | accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, ''The New York Times'' observed that just 158 super-rich families each contributed $250,000 or more, while an additional 200 families gave more than $100,000 for the 2016 presidential election. Both groups contributed almost half of the "early money" for candidates in the 2016 presidential election as of June 30, 2015 through channels like super PACs legalized by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/11/us/politics/2016-presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html |last1=Confessore|first1= Nicholas|last2= Cohen|first2= Sarah|last3= Yourish|first3= Karen| title=Buying Power: Here are 120 million Monopoly pieces, roughly one for every household in the United States |work=The New York Times |date=October 10, 2015 |accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Eric Lichtenblau  |author2=Nicholas Confessore|title=From Fracking to Finance, a Torrent of Campaign Cash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/politics/wealthy-families-presidential-candidates.html#donors-list|accessdate=November 26, 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weakening of "establishment" forces===
At least in the Republican Party, the Citizens United ruling has weakened the fund raising power of the Republican "establishment" in the form of the "three major" Republican campaign committees ([[Republican National Committee]], [[National Republican Congressional Committee]], [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]).&lt;ref name="Edsall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edsall|first1=Thomas B.|title=Meet the New Boss. Actually Quite Different From the Old Boss.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/opinion/trump-republican-establishment-elites.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region|accessdate=April 26, 2018|agency=New York Times|date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Thomas B. Edsall]] notes that in 2008, "the last election before the Citizens United decision", the three campaign committees "raised six times" the money that "nonparty conservative organizations" did — $657.6 million vs. $111.9 million. By 2016 those party committees raised less than the independent groups — $652.4 million v. $810.4 million. Thus the new funding "freed candidates to defy" the party establishment, although not it seems, move policy making away from traditional Republican priorities.&lt;ref name="Edsall"/&gt;

=== Republican advantage ===
Studies have shown that the Citizens United ruling gave Republicans an advantage in subsequent elections. One study by political scientists at University of Chicago, Columbia University and the London School of Economics found "that Citizens United increased the GOP’s average seat share in the state legislature by five percentage points. That is a large effect — large enough that, were it applied to the past twelve Congresses, partisan control of the House would have switched eight times. In line with a previous study, we also find that the vote share of Republican candidates increased three to four points, on average."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/24/how-citizens-united-gave-republicans-a-bonanza-of-seats-in-u-s-state-legislatures/|title=Analysis {{!}} How Citizens United gave Republicans a bonanza of seats in U.S. state legislatures|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdul-Razzak|first=Nour|last2=Prato|first2=Carlo|last3=Wolton|first3=Stephane|date=2017|title=How Outside Spending Shapes American Democracy|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2823778|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2823778|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study in ''the Journal of Law and Economics'' found "that Citizens United is associated with an increase in Republicans’ election probabilities in state house races of approximately 4 percentage points overall and 10 or more percentage points in several states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6397">The '''climate movement''' is the collective of [[nongovernmental]] organizations engaged in activism related to the issues of [[global warming|climate change]]. It is a subset of the broader [[environmental movement]], but some regard it as a new [[social movement]] itself given its scope, strength and activities.

==History==
The climate movement has rapidly evolved in the first decades of the 21st century, starting as one of the many causes of the environmental movement. 

Activism related to [[climate change]] began in the 1990s, when major environmental organizations became involved in the discussions about climate, mainly in the [[UNFCCC]] framework. In the 2000s several climate-specific organizations were founded, such as [[350.org]], [[Energy Action Coalition]], and the Global Call for Climate Action.

===Mobilization for Copenhagen 2009===
The [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen was the first UNFCCC summit in which the climate movement started showing its mobilization power at a large scale. Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended a march in Copenhagen on December 12 calling for a global agreement on climate.&lt;ref name="protest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8410414.stm |title=Climate activists condemn Copenhagen police tactics |date=13 December 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215101510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8410414.stm |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And activism went beyond Copenhagen, with more than 5,400 rallies and demonstrations took place around the world simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/24/international.climate.change.demonstrations/ | work=CNN | title=International day of demonstrations on climate change | date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

===The 2014 People’s Climate March===
[[File:People's Climate March 2014.jpg|thumb|500px|A photo from the People's Climate March in 2014, which brought together hundreds of thousands of people to demonstrate in favor of strong action on climate change.]]

The climate movement convened its largest single event in September 21, 2014, when it mobilized 400.000 activists in New York during the People’s Climate March (plus several thousands more in other cities), to demand a climate action from the global leaders gathered for the 2014 UN Climate Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3415162/peoples-climate-march-new-york-manhattan-demonstration/ |title=Hundreds of Thousands Converge on New York to Demand Climate-Change Action |publisher=time.com |accessdate=December 30, 2014 | location=New York | first=Charlotte | last=Alter | date=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://peoplesclimate.org/wrap-up/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil Fuel Divestment===
The [[Fossil fuel divestment|Fossil Fuel Divestment]] movement calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, states, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. [[350.org]] launched their Go Fossil Free campaign in 2012 with [[Bill McKibben]]'s "Do The Math" speaking tour around the country. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: "If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gofossilfree.org/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114164835/http://gofossilfree.org/about/ |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fossil Fuel Divestment movement escalated tactics in the spring of 2015, with 19 students arrested at Yale University, a week-long blockade of Harvard University's administrative buildings, a 70-student sit-in at Tulane University, and other arrestable actions.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Michael. "Yale Students Cited at Fuel-Divestment Protest." Bloomberg.com. Bloomberg, 9 Apr. 2015. Web. 15 Apr. 2015. &lt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-09/yale-students-invade-president-s-office-demanding-divestment&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardheatweek.org/ Harvard Heat Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipinski, Jed. "Tulane Students Occupy President's Office to Protest Fossil Fuel Investments." NOLA.com. NOLA Media Group, 14 Apr. 2015. Web. 15 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate Mobilization===
Since 2014, growing portions of the climate movement, especially in the United States have been organizing for an international economic response to climate change on the scale of the mobilization of the American [[home front during World War II]], with the goal of rapidly slashing carbon emissions and transitioning to 100% clean energy faster than the free market is likely to allow. Throughout 2015 and 2016, [[The Climate Mobilization]] led grassroots campaigns in the U.S. for this scale of ambition, and in July 2016, activists succeeded in getting text adopted into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s national platform calling for WWII-scale climate mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Russell|title=Beyond Paris: Finding the Courage to Face the Climate Emergency|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/07/19/beyond-paris-finding-courage-face-climate-emergency|work=CommonDreams|date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]] published an article in the [[The New Republic|New Republic]] rallying Americans to "declare war on climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKibben|first1=Bill|title=We Need to Literally Declare War on Climate Change|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii|work=New Republic|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of other movements==
The climate movement is closely connected to other parts of the environmental movement, in particular groups aiming for a sustainable society and sustainable energy.
Also the faith community has been active in the climate movement, both at an interfaith level (such as in Our Voices) and at the specific level of each denomination (such as the Global Catholic Climate Movement).

'''The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity homepage |work=congressionalbaseball.org |publisher=The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity |url=https://www.congressionalbaseball.org |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual [[baseball]] game played each summer by members of the [[United States Congress]]. The game began as a casual event among colleagues in 1909&lt;ref name=CBGFChistory&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Congressional Baseball Game |work=congressionalbaseball.org |publisher=The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity |url=https://www.congressionalbaseball.org/history/ |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually evolved into one of [[Washington, D.C.]]'s most anticipated annual pastimes, according to the [[Historian of the United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives Office of the Historian]]. In the game, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] form separate teams and play against each other.

Today, the game raises money for three local charities: The [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Clubs]] of Greater Washington, The [[Washington Nationals]] Dream Foundation, and The Washington Literacy Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/congressional-baseball-game-carries-long-tradition-raises-money-charity-n772261|title=What's the history behind the annual congressional baseball game?|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game is usually attended by crowds of congressional staffers and, occasionally, even dignitaries and [[President of the United States|US Presidents]].&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web | title=The Congressional Baseball Game: Statistics | url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Statistics/ | work=history.house.gov | publisher=Office of the Historian, and Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives | accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:John Tener Baseball.jpg|thumb|150px|left|John Tener organized the first Congressional baseball game]]
The 1909 game was organized by Representative [[John Tener]] of [[Pennsylvania]], a former professional baseball player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''[[Boston Daily Globe]]'' observed, ''"The game was brewing for weeks and the members of the house were keyed up a high pitch of enthusiasm. Deep, dark rumors were in circulation that 'ringers' would be introduced, but when they lined up at 4 o'clock the nine Republicans were stalwart, grand old party men, while the Democrats were of the pure Jeffersonian strain."''&lt;ref name="US House"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Game |url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/History/|publisher=US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|language=en|accessdate=June 17, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] beat their [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponents, 26–16 in the first game and continued their winning streak for the first six games. Republicans won their first game in 1916. Due to its growing popularity, the Congressional Baseball Game was first covered via radio in 1928. The radio broadcast continued in succeeding years.&lt;ref name="US House"/&gt;

The event has at times interrupted the work flow of Congress. In 1914, Speaker [[Champ Clark|James Beauchamp "Champ" Clark]] of [[Missouri]] became frustrated with the Congressional Baseball Game interfering with legislative business. An Appropriations bill on [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] cotton damage was to be debated on the House floor, but a quorum was not present because of the game.

Despite its appeal, the annual game occurred intermittently because of interruptions due to the [[Great Depression]], the Second World War, and intervention by the House leadership. For a while the game was held biennially, until the Washington Evening Star newspaper sponsored it annually from 1946 to 1958. Despite the sponsorship, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] of [[Texas]] ended the game in 1958, saying it had become too physically straining on the members and was causing injuries.&lt;ref name="US House"/&gt; With the new sponsor, the ''Roll Call'' Trophy was created, for the team that wins each [[best-of-five]] series.  It was first awarded in 1965—to the Republican team, which was the first team to win three games since ''Roll Call'' had begun its sponsorship. Since 1965, a new [[#Game results|trophy is awarded to the next team to win three games]] (over the next three, four, or five years), following the year in which the most recent trophy was awarded. As of the 2017 game, 14 trophies have been awarded—ten to the Republicans' team and four to the Democrats' team.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Baseball Game: History|url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/History|work=history.house.gov|publisher=Office of the Historian, and Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NLongworth-baseballgame.jpg|thumb|200px|Speaker Longworth throws out the first ball at the starting game at [[Griffith Stadium]], [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Mrs. Longworth]] seated below, May 3, 1928.]]
[[File:BaltimoreMemorialStadium1991.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial Stadium, Baltimore]]
The Game was originally played at the [[American League Park]]. However, after the park's destruction in a fire in March 1911, it was played at the [[Griffith Stadium]] built on the same site in Northwest Washington, D.C. In 1962, it was moved to the new District Stadium (later renamed [[Robert F. Kennedy Stadium]]). It remained there until 1972, when the Washington Senators moved to Texas becoming the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] as RFK did not need a long-term baseball seating layout or field. It moved for the next two decades to the [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] in Baltimore, Maryland, then to [[Langley High School (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Langley High School]] in McLean, Virginia for 1977; and [[Four Mile Run Park]] in Alexandria, Virginia. From 1995 to 2004, the game was played in [[Prince George's Stadium]] in Bowie, Maryland. From 2005 to 2007, the event returned to RFK Stadium when the [[Montreal Expos]] moved  to Washington to become the [[Washington Nationals]]. In 2008, [[Nationals Park]] was completed and the Nationals moved there along with the Congressional Baseball Game.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |title=Congressional Baseball Game Location |url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Location/ |work=history.house.gov |publisher=Office of the Historian, and Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives |access-date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, a post-game reception for members of Congress and their staffs was organized and sponsored by [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck and Company]]. However, attendance was very low until 1972 when Sears' Washington office Public Information officer, Larry Horist took over the management of the event, and established the Most Valuable Player awards to be voted by each team and presented by the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate. He also obtained photos of the players in their hometown uniforms, producing baseball cards packaged in gum wrappers. A limited number of autographed master sheets of the cards occasionally appear for sale on Internet auction sites. The cards included such personalities as Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] (D-MN), [[Barry Goldwater, Jr.]] (R-AZ), and professional player [[Wilmer Mizell|"Vinegar Bend" Mizell]] (R-NC). The cards were publicized in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and became part of the permanent collection of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stern|first=Seth|title=Hall of Fame: Mel Watt Lives His Dream|url=http://www.rollcall.com/features/Baseball-Program_2011/baseball/-207200-1.html|newspaper=Roll Call|date=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the 2017 team rosters, see footnote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2017 rosters |work=congressionalbaseball.org |publisher=The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity |url=https://www.congressionalbaseball.org/teams/ |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the modern Congressional Baseball Game comprises both House and Senate Members, this was not always the case. From 1909 to 1949, House Members exclusively filled the rosters—although there appears to have been no prohibition against Senators. Bicameral baseball was inaugurated in 1950, when Senator [[Harry P. Cain]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] joined the Republican team and Senator-elect [[George Smathers]] of [[Florida]], a former Representative, joined the Democratic team.&lt;ref name=rosters&gt;{{cite web | title=Congressional Baseball Game: Rosters | url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Rosters/ | work=history.house.gov | publisher=Office of the Historian, and Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives | accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few cases, former professional baseball players were elected to Congress and had a large impact on the game. In the case of [[Wilmer Mizell|Wilmer "Vinegar Bend" Mizell]] of [[North Carolina]], a former professional pitcher, the Republican team was victorious for each year that he played. Fielding a once-a-year team presented some problems for members, who often grew rusty when it came to batting. Strong pitching proved decisive in most games but, in 1963, neither team could field a pitcher. As a result, relief pitcher [[George Susce (pitcher)|George Susce]] of the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] pitched for both teams.

In 1917, Representative [[Jeannette Rankin]] of [[Montana]] tossed out the first pitch and kept score, becoming the first woman to participate in the annual event. More than 70 years later, in 1993, Representatives [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] of Florida, [[Maria Cantwell]] of Washington, and [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]] became the first women to break into the starting lineup.&lt;ref name="rosters" /&gt;

In 1971, the first [[African American]]s joined the game. [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[Walter E. Fauntroy]] of the District of Columbia and Rep. [[Ron Dellums]] of [[California]] joined the Democratic roster. Despite Fauntroy's hitting prowess, the Democrats lost their eighth straight annual game, 7–3.&lt;ref name=rosters /&gt;

In 1909, Rep. [[Joseph F. O'Connell]] of [[Massachusetts]] hit the first home run, gaining three runs for the Democrats. In the same year, Republican Rep. [[Edward B. Vreeland]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] was the first player to be withdrawn due to an injury. In 1957, Rep. [[Gerald Ford]] of [[Michigan]] hit the first known grand slam, while playing for the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Firsts &amp; Notables|url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Fanfare/|website=U.S. House of Representatives: History, Art, and Archives|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Republican Rep. [[Ron Paul]] of [[Texas]] hit what was believed to be (at that time) the first home run hit over the fence.&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"/&gt; Rep. [[John Shimkus]] of [[Illinois]] is the only other player to hit an out-of-the-park home run, doing so in 1997.&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyers|first=David|title=Home Run Lands Ron Paul in Hall of Fame|url=http://www.rollcall.com/features/Baseball-Program_2012/baseball/Home-Run-Lands-Ron-Paul-in-Hall-of-Fame-215686-1.html|newspaper=Roll Call|publisher=CQ Roll Call |date=June 27, 2012|accessdate=June 16, 2017 |quote=The Texas Republican is believed to be the first person to hit one out of the park in a Congressional Baseball Game.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was inducted into the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame prior to the 2012 game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivera|first=Francis|title=Ron Paul inducted into Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame – in Astros garb|url=http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/06/ron-paul-inducted-into-congressional-baseball-hall-of-fame-%E2%80%93-in-astros-garb/|newspaper=The Houston Chronicle|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniforms and fanfare==
In the early years of the game, each team wore a uniform that was either plain or had the words "Republicans" or "Democrats" embroidered on it. In modern games, members typically have worn uniforms of the professional baseball teams or [[college baseball]] teams in their congressional district or home state. In the 1920s, pomp and fanfare preceded each game. The [[United States Navy Band]] and [[United States Marine Corps Band]] traditionally kicked off the festivities with patriotic tunes. In 1926, the Republicans paraded into American League Field on a live elephant, while in 1932 both teams had costumed mascots entertain the crowds. During the 1960s, the teams had cheerleaders dressed in uniforms.&lt;ref name=fanfare&gt;{{cite web | title=Congressional Baseball Game: Fanfare | url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Fanfare/ | work=history.house.gov | publisher=Office of the Historian, and Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives | accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game results==
As of the 2018 game, Republicans lead the all-time series, 42–41–1.&lt;ref name=WinsAndLosses&gt;{{cite web |title=Wins &amp; Losses Through the Years |work=History, Art &amp; Archives / U.S. House of Representatives |publisher=Office of the Historian, Office of Art &amp; Archives, and Office of the Clerk / U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Baseball-Game/Statistics/ |accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The official website of the Congressional Baseball Game for Charity seemingly does not count three of those Republican wins, because its History page listed (in 2017, but prior to the 2017 game) the series record as 39–39–1 (in a blue, red, white, and black bar near the bottom of the page). The same page, however, states—in reference to the Roll Call Trophy—that "[t]o date, 10 of these coveted trophies have been awarded, eight to the Republicans and two to the Democrats." [http://www.congressionalbaseball.org/history/ History of the Congressional Baseball Game] (The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. Retrieved 2017-06-16). That statement indicates that the paragraphs of the History page were probably written after the 2002 game and before the 2005 game, because the tenth trophy was awarded in 2002 and the eleventh trophy was awarded in 2005.

The Republicans won their 35th game in 2002 and then won seven more games thereafter (in 2003 to 2008, plus 2016). As of 2002, the Democrats had won 32 games; from 2003 to 2016, the Democrats won seven more games, for a total of 39 wins (as of the 2016 game). Although the series record that is set forth in the bar near the bottom of the page includes the Democrats' seven wins between 2003 and 2016, the bar includes only four of the Republicans' seven wins during that same time period.

[[File:Marcos Clark Air Base cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand]] and [[Imelda Marcos]] at [[Clark Air Base]] on March 14, 1979]]

A "'''conjugal dictatorship'''" is the unofficial phrase to denote the rule of [[Philippines|Philippine]] president and dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his wife [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]] to describe a type of [[family dictatorship]].&lt;ref name="PhilStar2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pineda|first1=DLS|title=So you think you love Marcos?|url=http://www.philstar.com/supreme/2014/02/22/1292975/so-you-think-you-love-marcos|accessdate=October 4, 2015|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imelda film" &gt;Diaz, Ramona. ''[[Imelda (film)|Imelda]]''. Ramona Diaz-Independent Television Service, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated from a book titled ''The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos'' by [[Primitivo Mijares]] that was written in 1976 within the decade after the [[Proclamation No. 1081|proclamation]] of [[Martial law in the Philippines|martial law]].&lt;ref&gt;Mijares, Primitivo. ''The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos'', Union Square Publishing, Manila, 1976. {{ISBN|1-141-12147-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage of the term ==
Mijares, the author who coined the phrase, disappeared after the publication of his book and his son Boyet Mijares was later found dead after being tortured brutally&lt;ref name="familySecretMijares"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamora|first1=Fe|title=Family secret: How Primitivo Mijares disappeared|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/872907/family-secret-how-primitivo-mijares-disappeared|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="44yearsTooLong"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Cody|title=44 years too long: The martial-law victims, ‘desaparecidos’ and the families left behind|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/44-years-too-long-the-martial-law-victims-desaparecidos-and-the-families-left-behind/|publisher=[[BusinessMirror]]|date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dropped from a helicopter.&lt;ref name="marcosMartialLawNeverAgain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robles|first1=Raissa|title=Marcos Martial Law: Never Again|date=2016|publisher=Filipinos for a Better Philippines, Inc.|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=978-621-95443-1-3|url=https://www.facebook.com/MarcosMartialLawNeverAgain/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police investigations led by [[Panfilo Lacson]] claimed that Mijares' son was a victim of hazing by University of the Philippines Tau Gamma fraternity and the accused fraternity members were sentenced to death. Journalist Raissa Robles contests that the son, Luis Manuel “Boyet” Mijares, wasn’t even about to enter college, as he still had a year of high school to finish and that the fate of the accused fraternity members seems suspicious: two escaped from prison and the third died of a heart attack in detention.&lt;ref name="marcosMartialLawNeverAgain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.raissarobles.com/2016/03/20/my-book-on-marcos-martial-law-will-be-formally-launched-march-31-in-ateneo-qc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase alludes to the power held by both halves of the couple,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/14/insider-guide-manila-philippines-brutalism-bamboo "An insider's guide to Manila: where brutalism meets bamboo"], ''[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]''.

''[[Here Lies Love]]'', [[Todomundo]]/[[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]]. April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Imelda was able to hold many more positions in government than any other First Lady of the Philippines before her. These appointments allowed her to build structures in and around the capital of [[Manila]] and act as a ''de facto'' diplomat who traveled the world and met state leaders.&lt;ref name = "The Steel Butterfly 2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/imelda-marcos-the-steel-butterfly-still-soars.html?_r=0 The Steel Butterfly Still Soars].

February 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters, loyalists and even propagandists of the Marcos regime criticize the use of the term because they believe that the era of the Marcos' and Martial Law was the "[[golden age]]" of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/137759/filipinos-in-u-s-laud-the-late-sen-salonga "Filipinos in U.S. laud the late Sen.

March 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The children of the Marcos couple: [[Imee Marcos|Imee]], [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]], and [[Irene Marcos-Araneta|Irene]], reject the use of the term to describe their parents which they believe is an insult to their legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.inquirer.net/89472/the-luck-of-bongbong-marcos "The luck of Bongbong Marcos"], ''Philippine Daily Inquirer''.

September 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, opponents of the Marcos dictatorship use the word to highlight the [[Marcos scandals|excesses]] of the couple and the greed and [[Operation Big Bird|plunder]] that occurred during their 20-year rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/no-political-wound-is-deep-enough-to-hurt-forever-unless-you-are-aquino/248540/ "No political wound is deep enough to hurt forever… unless you are Aquino"], ''[[The Manila Times]]''. March 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, such as the relatives of the ''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]'', also use the term to describe [[human rights in the Philippines|human rights]] abuses by the regime during their rule together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/138116/138116 "Waiting for the other shoe(s) to drop"], ''Philippine Daily Inquirer''.

== ''The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos'' ==
A journalist who had become a propagandist and confidant for Ferdinand Marcos, Primitivo “Tibo” Mijares had served under Marcos since 1963 and claimed to have been privy to government’s high-level doings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.raissarobles.com/2016/03/20/my-book-on-marcos-martial-law-will-be-formally-launched-march-31-in-ateneo-qc/&lt;/ref&gt; As Chairman of the National Press Club, Mijares ran the Media Advisory Council, a state agency established to censor the press in 1973. Upon the declaration of martial law in September 1972, and with the power to choose which media outlet would be re-opened, the Mijares-led Media Advisory Council was accused of abusing its role and was criticized as a "money-raising tool," leading one of its members, Emil Jurado, to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ABS-CBN News|title=' The press in a straitjacket'|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=1248728974&amp;page_url=//www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=16958&amp;page_last_updated=2005-09-22T09:23:38&amp;firstName=Primitivo&amp;lastName=Mijares}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= The Manila Standard|title='The Press Under Martial Law'|url=http://www.thestandard.com.ph/opinion/columns/to-the-point-by-emil-jurado/202885/i-saw-history-in-the-making-4-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mijares himself, after failing to account for NPC funds, ran away to the US, and joined Manglapus' Movement for a Free Philippines and wrote the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Manipulated Press|title='The Press Under Martial Law'|url=http://mysite.dlsu.edu.ph/faculty/marianog/intprin/ofreneo.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042400/http://mysite.dlsu.edu.ph/faculty/marianog/intprin/ofreneo.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mijares said that he was offered a bribe amounting to US$100,000 to be dissuaded to testify about the human rights situation in the Philippines, and said that he refused the bribe. However, whether there was a bribe by Marcos' associates or whether Mijares himself extorted money from Marcos, and whether Mijares actually received money from Marcos remains unclear. Steve Psinakis, an anti-Marcos critic married into the Lopez family that owns ABS-CBN,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/03/15/16/freedom-fighter-steve-psinakis-passes-away&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in his memoir A Country Not Even His Own” (2008): “The investigation (referring to the U.S. Justice Department investigation) revealed that after his February 1975 defection, Mijares did, in fact extort money from Marcos by feeding him imaginary information for which Marcos was ignorant enough to pay considerable sums. While Mijares was still receiving money from Marcos, he was at the same time lambasting Marcos in the U.S. press, causing the Marcos regime irreparable damage. It is no wonder the only natural conclusion is that Marcos had his vengeance and did Mijares in.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Country Not Even His Own|last=Psinakis|first=Steve|date=2008|publisher=Anvil Publishing|url=http://chrisbonoan.blogspot.com/2015_09_01_archive.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A declassified U.S. Department of State cable dated February 24, 1975 further casts doubt on Mijares credibility, noting that "Mijares' moved not surprising to Manila Community which recognizes him as complete opportunist who recently was feeling hot breath of Martial Law Regime for certain recent extra-curricular activities. Allegedly, Mijares gambled away 50,000 dollars of GOP funds during a 1974 Las Vegas visit, misappropriated for personal use 7,000 dollars of the First Lady's personal funds and attempted to rape a well connected Philippine foreign service secretary while in New York for the trade center opening," and that "final push to action may in fact have been provided by Philippine opposition group in US and financial inducements of Lopez family members. Local Lopezes got word of San Francisco story February 21 and quickly began telephoning glad news around town."&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1975MANILA02351_b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the book's claims have been refuted after more than a decade since its publication. For example, the book insinuated that Marcos plotted the Plaza Miranda bombing to wipe out the entire Liberal Party leadership and that the weapon landing from China for the communists along the coast of Isabela was 'staged'. The communists have since admitted to the plot to bomb Plaza Miranda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EX-COMMUNISTS PARTY BEHIND MANILA BOMBING|url=http://washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/08/04/ex-communists-party-behind-manila-bombing/b987c165-4f26-4609-aeb5-cd05134c0cec/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and former NPA Victor Corpuz admitted that their plot was foiled when the weapons that they were about to receive from communist China was intercepted by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulf News|title='Ex-communist leader gets sentimental as divers find sunken ship'|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/philippines/ex-communist-leader-gets-sentimental-as-divers-find-sunken-ship-1.1060318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNlJoXfAH3c|title=MV Karagatan, The Ship of the Chinese Communist|last=I-Witness|first=GMA 7|publisher=YouTube|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2012/07/30/832892/untold-story-karagatan-i-witness&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dictator novel''' ({{lang-es|'''novela del dictador'''}}) is a [[literary genre|genre]] of [[Latin American literature]] that challenges the role of the [[dictator]] in Latin American society. The theme of ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]''&amp;mdash;the régime of a charismatic ''caudillo'', a political strongman&amp;mdash;is addressed by examining the relationships between [[Power (philosophy)|power]], dictatorship, and writing. Moreover, a dictator novel often is an allegory for the role of the writer in a Latin American society. Although mostly associated with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century non-fiction work ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. As an indirect critique of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s dictatorial régime in Argentina, ''Facundo'' is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it. As established by Sarmiento, the goal of the genre is not to analyze the rule of particular dictators, or to focus on historical accuracy, but to examine the abstract nature of [[Authority|authority figures]] and of authority in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be considered a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the ''caudillo'', and some general reflection on the nature of [[authoritarianism]]. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes ''[[I, the Supreme]]'' (1974), by [[Augusto Roa Bastos]], about [[Dr. Francia]] of Paraguay, and ''[[The Feast of the Goat]]'' (2000), by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], about [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in ''Reasons of State'' (1974), by [[Alejo Carpentier]], in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential in the development of a Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] dispensers of wisdom, like that of the ''caudillo'' whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.

==Literary context==
{{Literature}}
Literary critic [[Roberto González Echevarría]] argues that the dictator novel is “the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature”, and traces the development of this theme from “as far back as Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s and Francisco López de Gómara’s accounts of Cortés’s conquest of Mexico.”&lt;ref name="gonzech65"&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the [[Latin American Boom]], a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For critic [[Gerald Martin]], the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (as he says of Roa Bastos's ''I, the Supreme'') “the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's ''Facundo'' in 1845."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure “of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he is on the verge of losing.”&lt;ref name="gonzech65" /&gt;

== Definition ==

Miguel Ángel Asturias's ''[[El Señor Presidente]]'' (written in 1933, but not published until 1946) is, in the opinion of critic Gerald Martin, "the first real dictator novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other literary treatments of the dictator figure followed, such as Jorge Zalamea's ''El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto'', but the genre did not gain impetus until it was reinvented in the political climate of the [[cold war]], through the [[Latin American Boom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1984|p= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictator novel came back into fashion in the 1970s, towards the end of the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, "the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language."&lt;ref name="Keefe369"&gt;Keefe Ugalde, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  By this she means that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' or ''I, the Supreme'', offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: "the dictator becomes protagonist"&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt; and the world is often seen from his point of view. With the new focus on language, Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that "the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language."&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt; For example, in Jorge Zalamea's ''El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto'' the dictator bans all forms of language.&lt;ref name = "1Martin269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Raymond L. Williams, it was not until the 1970s, when enough Latin American writers had published novels dealing with military regimes, that "dictator novel" became common nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most celebrated novels of this era were Alejo Carpentier's ''Reasons of State'' (1974), Augusto Roa Bastos's ''I, the Supreme'' (1974), and Gabriel García Marquez's ''The Autumn of the Patriarch'' (1975). He defines the dictator novel as a novel which draws upon the historical record to create fictionalized versions of dictators. In this way, the author is able to use the specific to explain the general, as many dictator novels are centred around the rule of a one particular dictator.&lt;ref name = 1Martin266&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this group he includes those novelists who took to task authoritarian figures such as Vargas Llosa's ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' (1969) and Denzil Romero's ''La tragedia del Generalísimo'' (1984). He even includes Sergio Ramírez's ''¿Te dio miedo la sangre?'' (1977), a novel about Nicaraguan society under the Somoza dictatorship, which has been described as a "dictator novel without the dictator".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Craft| 1997|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and theme ==
The novelists of the dictator novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing.&lt;ref name="2Williams4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern techniques, constructed largely in the late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality.&lt;ref name = 2Williams4/&gt; Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to the dictator novel genre pioneered what came to be known as [[magical realism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.

A predominant theme of the dictator novel is power,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of ''Feast of the Goat'', is linked to the theme of dictatorship: "The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had everything to do with the enduring power of Latin American dictators".&lt;ref name="moses"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moses|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As novels such as ''El Señor Presidente'' became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America.&lt;ref name="2Williams11"/&gt; As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's ''I, The Supreme'', the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarría argues that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Patiño ..., [and] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supremo defines power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another constant theme which runs throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is the interdependence of the Latin American tyrant and [[American imperialism|United States imperialism]].&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; In Mario Vargas Llosa's ''The Feast of the Goat'', for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the [[CIA]], previously held for over 32 years in light of his anti-communist leanings.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt;

Gender is an additional overarching theme within dictator novels. National portraits in Latin America often insist on the importance of women (and men) that are healthy, happy, productive, and patriotic, yet many national literary treasures often reflect government rhetoric in the way they code active citizenship as male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biron|2000|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is an enduring motif in the dictator novel. There is a connection between the pen and the penis in Latin American fiction, but this pattern cannot be explained by machismo alone&amp;mdash;it is far more complex. According to Rebecca E. Biron, "where we find violent, misogynistic fantasies of masculinity, we also [find] violent social relations between actual men and women."&lt;ref name="biron16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biron|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Latin American works "include characters who act out violent fictions of masculinity, and yet their narrative structure provides readers with alternative responses to misogynistic fantasies of masculine identity formation".&lt;ref name="biron16" /&gt;

==Historical context==

===Dictators in Latin American history===
Since independence, Latin American countries have been subject to both right and left-wing [[authoritarian]] regimes, stemming from a history of [[colonialism]] in which one group dominated another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this long history, it is unsurprising that there have been so many novels "about individual dictators, or about the problems of dictatorship ''caudillismo'', ''caciquismo'', militarism and the like."&lt;ref name = 1Martin266/&gt; The legacy of colonialism is one of racial conflict sometimes pushing an absolute authority to rise up to contain it&amp;mdash;thus the tyrant is born. Seeking unlimited power, dictators often amend constitutions, dismantling laws which prevent their reelection. [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera|Licenciado Manuel Estrada Cabrera]], for example, altered the [[Guatemala]]n Constitution in 1899 to permit his return to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictators who have become the focus of the dictator novel (Augusto Roa Bastos's ''I, the Supreme'', for instance, is based on Paraguay's dictator of the early nineteenth century, the so-called Dr Francia) do not differ much from each other in terms of how they govern. As author González Echevarría states: "they are male, militaristic, and wield almost absolute personal power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their strong-arm tactics include exiling or imprisoning their opposition, attacking the freedom of the press, creating a centralized government backed by a powerful military force, and assuming complete control over free thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|pp=468, 470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez &gt;{{Harvnb|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite intense criticisms leveled at these figures, dictators involved in [[Nationalism|nationalist movements]] developed three simple truths, "that everybody belonged, that the benefits of Progress should be shared, and that industrial development should be the priority".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chasteen|2006|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epitácio Lindolfo da Silva Pessoa|Epitácio Pessoa]], who was elected President of Brazil in 1919, wanted to make the country progress regardless of whether or not Congress passed the laws he proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, during the [[Great Depression]], Latin American activist governments of the 1930s saw the end of [[neocolonialism]] and the infusion of nationalist movements throughout Latin America, increasing the success of [[import substitution industrialization]] or ISI.&lt;ref name = "Chasteen226"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chasteen|2006|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive side-effect of the collapse of international trade meant local Latin American manufacturers could fill the market niches left vacant by vanishing exports.&lt;ref name = Chasteen226/&gt;

In the twentieth century, prominent Latin American dictators have included the [[Somoza]] dynasty in Nicaragua, [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in Paraguay, and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, among others. As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized. As García Calderon noted as far back as 1925: "Does it want peace or is it controlled by certain interests?"&lt;ref name="Calderon469"&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism and the power of the tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people. In the case of Trujillo, "Nothing promises to reinvigorate his flagging popularity more than to face up to the Yankee aggressor in the name of la patria."&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, the pendulum swung in the other direction, introducing a series of 'left wing' governments to the region that curtailed civil liberties and set up their own messy version of popular dictatorships through a process that has been called "competitive authoritarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Elections Without Democracy: The Rise of Competitive Authoritarianism|journal=Harvard University Journal of Democracy|volume= 13| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these was President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, and came to include other countries in his Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras - and in some ways Argentina, though it was not an official member) in what was called the [[Pink tide|Pink Tide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ALBA: Inside Venezuela's Bolivarian Alliance|last=Hirst|first=Joel|publisher=Inter-American Institute for Democracy|year=2012|isbn=1477497625|location=Miami, USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Los Padres de la Patria ===
In 1967 during a meeting with [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[Julio Cortázar]], and [[Miguel Otero Silva]], the Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] launched a project consisting of a series of [[biography|biographies]] depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called ''Los Padres de la Patria'' (The Fathers of the Fatherland).&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in ''Patriotic Gore'', Fuentes recounts, "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, we thought it would be a good idea to have a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fuentes|1986|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa was to write about [[Manuel A. Odría]], [[Jorge Edwards]] about [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], [[José Donoso]] about [[Mariano Melgarejo]], and Julio Cortázar about [[Eva Perón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Donoso|1972|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the [[Latin American Boom|Latin American literary boom]], such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Langa Pizarro|2001|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the genre==

=== Forerunners ===
[[File:Juan Manuel de Rosas.jpg|alt=Painting of the head and shoulders of a man in 19th century military garb with ornate epaulettes and sash. He is looking at the viewer.|thumb|right|[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], Argentine caudillo, by [[Cayetano Descalzi]] (1809-1886)]]
Both [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' and [[José Marmol]]'s ''[[Amalia (novel)|Amalia]]'', published in the nineteenth century, were precursors to the twentieth century dictator novel; however, "all fictional depictions of the Latin American 'strong-man', have an important antecedent in Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's ''Facundo'', a work written as a sociolodical treatise".&lt;ref name = "Kristal10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Facundo'' is an indirect critique of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s dictatorship, directed against the actual historical figure, [[Juan Facundo Quiroga]], but is also a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture. Sarmiento's ''Facundo'' has remained a fundamental fixture because of the breadth of its literary exploration of the Latin American environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brotherston|1977|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Facundo'', Sarmiento criticizes the historical figure Facundo Quiroga, a provincial caudillo, who like Rosas (dictator of Argentina from 1829 to 1853) was opposed to the enlightened ideas of progress. After returning from exile, Sarmiento worked to reinvent Argentina, eventually becoming president himself from 1868 to 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brotherston|1977|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarmiento's analysis of Facundo Quiroga was the first time that an author questioned how figures like Facundo and Rosas could have maintained such absolute power,&lt;ref name = Kristal10/&gt; and in answering this question, ''Facundo'' established its place as an inspirational text to later authors. Sarmiento perceived his own power in writing ''Facundo'' as "within the text of the novel, it is the novelist, through the voice of omniscience, who has replaced God",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating the bridge between writing and power that is characteristic of the dictator novel.

Set in post-colonial Buenos Aires, ''Amalia'' was written in two parts and is a semi-autobiographical account of José Mármol that deals with living in Rosas's police state. Mármol's novel was important as it showed how the human consciousness, much like a city or even a country, could become a terrifying prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=109,151}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amalia'' also attempted to examine the problem of dictatorships as being one of structure, and therefore the problem of the state "manifested through the will of some monstrous personage violating the ordinary individual's privacy, both of home and of consciousness."&lt;ref name = 1Martin266/&gt; In the early twentieth century, the Spaniard [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]]'s ''[[Tirano Banderas]]'' (1926) acted as a key influence on those authors whose goal was to critique power structures and the status quo.

*''[[Tirano Banderas]]'' is a 1926 novel by Spanish writer Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan (aka [[Valle-Inclan]] or Valle). Although was published in Madrid (Spain), this novel is influenced by [[Facundo]] by Ramon Sarmiento and it is the first of dictator novels. It recounts the fall of the South American dictator Santos Banderas, which directs the fictitious region of Santa Fe de Tierra Firme of despotic mode and cruel to staying in power through terror and oppression. The work describes the behavior of the tyrant and the beginning of a revolutionary movement that will eventually overthrow him before his clumsiness.
*''[[El Señor Presidente]]'' is a 1946 novel by Guatemalan Nobel Prize-winning writer and diplomat [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]. Although the novel does not explicitly identify its setting as early twentieth-century Guatemala, Asturias was inspired by the 1898–1920 presidency of [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] for his title character.&lt;ref name = "2Williams11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel explores the nature of political dictatorship and its effects on society, and is an overtly political novel in which Asturias denounces Latin American dictators.&lt;ref name = 2Williams11/&gt; By keeping time and place ambiguous, Asturias's novel represents a break from former narratives, which until this point had been judged on how adequately they reflected reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asturias's distinctive use of dream imagery, onomatopoeia, simile, and repetition, combined with a discontinuous structure consisting of abrupt changes of style and viewpoint, sprang from [[surrealist]] and [[Ultraist movement|ultraist]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it made early use of a literary technique that would come to be known as magic realism.&lt;ref name = "2Swanson8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The President'' went on to influence a generation of Latin American authors, becoming an early example of the "new novel" and a precursor to the Latin American literary boom.&lt;ref name = 2Swanson8/&gt;
*[[Jorge Zalamea]], ''[[El gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto]]'' ("The Great Burundún Burundá is Dead", 1951). For Keefe Ugalde, "''El gran Burundún Burundá''&amp;nbsp;... occupies an important midway point in the evolution of the dictator novel"&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt; and Peter Neissa emphasizes "its cultural and political importance and subsequent influence on dictator narratives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Neissa|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Martin describes this "remarkable Colombian novelette" as seeming to contain "the seeds of García Márquez's mature style."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book describes the (fictional) dictator "Burundún's rise to power, selected events during his regime, and a description of his funeral."&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt;  It is at this funeral that it is revealed that the body of the dictator is absent, and has somehow been replaced by or transformed into "a great big parrot, a voluminous parrot, an enormous parrot, all swollen, inflated and wrapped in documents, gazettes, mail from abroad, newspapers, reports, annals, broadsheets, almanacs, official bulletins."&lt;ref name = 1Martin269/&gt;
*[[Enrique Lafourcade]]'s ''[[King Ahab's Feast]]'' (''La Fiesta del rey Acab'', 1959) portrays the fictional dictator César Alejandro Carrillo Acab, and opens with what Claude Hulet describes as an "amusingly ironic, tongue-in-cheek note in preface" which declares that "This is a mere work of fiction.&amp;nbsp;... Indeed, no one is unaware that neither the United Nations, nor the Organization of American States, permits the continued existence of regimes like the one that serves as pretext to this novel."  As Hulet observes, Lafourcade's "powerful and razor sharp satire" is directed "presumably against the Trujillo regime and others like it."&lt;ref&gt;Hulet, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alejo Carpentier]]'s, ''[[Reasons of State (novel)|Reasons of State]]'' (''El recurso del método'', 1974), is a synthesis of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently [[Gerardo Machado]], dictator of Cuba.&lt;ref name="2Williams3435"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half of his life in Europe,&lt;ref name = 2Williams3435/&gt; perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref name = 2Williams3435/&gt;
*[[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s ''[[I, the Supreme]]'' (''Yo, el Supremo'', 1974) is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]]. However, it is also a historical account, making use of real documents and accounts of people who knew Francia.&lt;ref name = "Boyers34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyers|1987|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roa's portrayal of a despot in Latin American fiction is distinguished "not only by the quantity of detail lavished on him, but by his remarkable capacity to seem at one moment a person, at another an embodiment of contradictory elements not usually associated with a single person, let alone a powerful tyrant".&lt;ref name = Boyers34/&gt; Its title was derived from the fact that Francia referred to himself as "El Supremo" or "the Supreme". Making use of non-traditional writing techniques, the novel is composed of separate discourses with their own distinctive styles, and the demarcation between them is often blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyers|1987|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Martin claims that Roa Bastos's novel "was more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', and critics seemed to suspect that its strictly historical importance might be even greater than that of García Márquez's fabulously successful creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' (''El otoño del patriarca'', 1975) details the life of an eternal dictator, "el macho", a fictional character who lives to be over 200 years old.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypal [[Caribbean]] tyrant. Márquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life autocrats, including [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] of his [[Colombia]]n homeland, [[Generalissimo]] [[Francisco Franco]] of [[Spain]] (the novel was written in [[Barcelona]]), and [[Venezuela]]'s [[Juan Vicente Gómez]]. One of the key characters of the novel is the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] General [[Saturno Santos]], who devotes himself to "inscrutable service to the patriarch."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Brotherston|1980|p= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this novel, García Márquez proposes an interesting contradiction: "that Latin America's patriarchs owe their most intimate support to their victims of longest standing; and that America's revolution is inconceivable without the Indian".&lt;ref name="Brotherstonchap53"&gt;{{Harvnb |Brotherston|1980|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrating the importance of the Indian in Latin America is all the more prudent given that García Márquez's home country, Colombia, is distinguished as literarily &lt;!-- or literally?? --&gt; not recognizing the Indian populations which are very much alive today.&lt;ref name = Brotherstonchap53/&gt;
*[[Luisa Valenzuela]]'s ''[[The Lizard's Tail]]'' (''Cola de lagartija'', 1983) is set in the period after Juan Perón's return to Argentina in 1973, when the Argentine president was heavily influenced by the sinister ''[[éminence grise]]'' [[José López Rega]]. The novel deals specifically with themes surrounding the nature of male-female relationships during this regime of military oppression. The novel's title is a reference to an instrument of torture that was invented in the [[Southern Cone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tomás Eloy Martínez]]'s ''The Perón Novel'' (''La novela de Perón'', 1985) uses a mixture of historical facts, fiction, and documents to retell the life story of [[Juan Domingo Perón]], "dramatizing the rivalries within the ranks of Peronism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the author to construct an intimate portrait of Perón rather than an historically accurate one. This method of analyzing Perón, that delves into his early history and family upbringing to theorize the motivation for his actions later in life, can be linked to Sarmiento's similar analyses of Facundo, and through him, Rosas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|pp=340–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' (''El general en su laberinto'', 1989) is a fictionalized account of the last days in the life of [[Simón Bolívar]]. Bolívar, also known as the Great Liberator, freed from [[Spain|Spanish]] rule the territory that would subsequently become [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], and [[Ecuador]]. However the character of the General is not portrayed as the glorious hero that traditional history has presented; instead García Márquez develops a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gertel| 1992| p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s ''[[The Feast of the Goat]]'' (''La fiesta del chivo'', 2000) recounts with "gruesome detail and dramatic intensity" the last days of the tyrant and dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], as he becomes infuriated that, despite being a long-standing ally of the United States because of his anti-communist stance, he is no longer in favour with the U.S. administration who have withdrawn their backing on discovering his extensive [[human rights]] violations.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; Following several interwoven storylines&amp;mdash;those of Trujillo, his assassins, and the daughter of a man who once served in Trujillo's inner circle of advisers, Urania Cabral&amp;mdash;this novel reveals both the political and social environment in the Dominican Republic, past and present.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; The story opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative in terms of remembering and understanding the past and its legacy for the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Neissa| 2004|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Burning'' picks up the story after 30 years of revolution, when the country is left as a wasteland and El Comandante - the central figure - has died; and how the student leader who has been a political prisoner and the soldier who became a general and dictator in his own right attempt to find meaning in the aftermath of a revolution that has collapsed.

=== 'Not quite' dictator novels ===

Latin American novels that explore political themes, but that do not centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”.&lt;ref name = "2Williams167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p= 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Libro de Manuel]]'' (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by [[Julio Cortázar]], is a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]].&lt;ref name = 2Williams167/&gt; ''[[In the Time of the Butterflies]]'' (1994), by [[Julia Alvarez|Julia Álvarez]], tells the story of the [[Mirabal sisters]], whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the [[Rafael Trujillo|Trujillo régime]] in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hickman|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine ''how'' the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hickman|2006|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of ''El imperio de los sueños'' 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by [[Giannina Braschi]], the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the [[Latin American Boom]] in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “[[United States of Banana]]” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner [[Segismundo]] overthrows his father, the King of the [[United States of Banana]], who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the [[Statue of Liberty]], for the crime of having been born. The story of ''[[Distant Star]]'' (1996), by [[Roberto Bolaño]], begins on 11 September 1973, with the ''[[1973 Chilean coup|coup d’état]]'' by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] against [[Salvador Allende]], the President of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.&lt;ref name = 2Williams167/&gt;

==Legacy==

Although it is difficult to establish the exact origin of the dictator novel in the nineteenth century, its [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] influence spans [[Latin American Literature]]. Most of the novels were written in the middle  years of the twentieth century, and each has a unique [[Literary language|literary style]] that employed techniques of the “new novel”, by which the writer rejected the formal structure of conventional [[literary realism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that “its simplistic assumption that reality is easily observable” is a narrative flaw.&lt;ref name="Swanson3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a genre, the dictator novel redefined the literary concept of “[[Novel|the novel]]” in order to compel the readers to examine the ways in which political and social mores affect their daily lives. Therefore, the regional politics and the social issues of the stories yielded to universal human concerns, thus the traditional novel’s “ordered world view gives way to a fragmented, distorted or fantastic narrative” in which the reader has an intellectually active role in grasping the ''thematic'' gist of the story.&lt;ref name="Swanson3" /&gt; Additional to the narrative substance, the novelists redefined the formal literary categories of ''author'', ''narrator'', ''character'', ''plot'', ''story'', and ''reader'', in order to examine the [[Etymology|etymological]] link between “author” and “authority”, wherein the figure of the novelist (the author) became very important to the telling of the tale. In the dictator novels, the writers questioned the traditional story-teller role of the novelist as the “privileged, paternal figure, as the authoritative ‘father’, or divine creator, in whom meaning would be seen to originate”, and so, the novelists fulfilled the role of the dictator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kerr|1992 |pp=viii-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''exarch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|ɑr|k}}) comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἔξαρχος, ''exarchos'', and designates holders of various historical offices, some of them being political or military and others being ecclesiastical.

In the late [[Roman Empire]] and early [[Byzantine Empire]], an ''exarch'' was a governor of a particular territory. Since the end of 3rd century, every [[Roman diocese]] was governed by [[vicarius]] who was called "exarch" in eastern parts of the Empire, dominated by Greek language and the use of Greek terminology.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989}} The office of exarch as a governor with extended political and military authority was later created in [[Byzantine Empire]], with jurisdiction over a particular territory, usually a frontier region at some distance from the capital [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956}}

In the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian Churches]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]]), the term exarch has three distinct uses: [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] who holds the office of exarch is the deputy of a [[patriarch]] and holds authority over bishops of the designated ecclesiastical region (thus, a position between that of patriarch and regular metropolitan); or, an auxiliary or titular bishop appointed to be exarch over a group of the faithful not yet large enough or organized enough to be constituted an eparchy or diocese (thus the equivalent of a [[vicar apostolic]]); and, a priest or deacon who is appointed by a bishop as his executive representative in various fields of diocesan administration (in Byzantine Empire, executive exarchs were usually collecting diocesan revenues for local bishops).

== Political exarchs ==
{{Further|Roman diocese|Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarchate of Africa}}
In the civil administration of the Byzantine Empire the exarch was, as stated above, the imperial governor of a large and important region of the Empire. The Exarchates were a response to weakening imperial authority in the provinces and were part of the overall process of unification of civil and military offices, initiated in early form by [[Justinian I]], which would lead eventually to the creation of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Thematic system]] by either the Emperor [[Heraclius]] or [[Constans II]].

After the dissolution of the Western Empire in the late fifth century, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] remained stable through the beginning of the Middle Ages and retained the ability for future expansion. [[Justinian I]] reconquered North Africa, Italy, Dalmatia and finally parts of Spain for the Eastern Roman Empire. However, this put an incredible strain on the Empire's limited resources. Subsequent emperors would not surrender the re-conquered land to remedy the situation. Thus the stage was set for Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] to establish the Exarchates to deal with the constantly evolving situation of the provinces.

In Italy the [[Lombards]] were the main opposition to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] power. In North Africa the [[Amazigh]] or [[Berber people|Berber]] princes were ascendant due to Roman weakness outside the coastal cities. The problems associated with many enemies on various fronts (the [[Visigoths]] in Spain, the [[Slavs]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] in the Balkans, the [[Sassanid]] Persians in the Middle East, and the Amazigh in North Africa) forced the imperial government to decentralize and devolve power to the former provinces.

The term Exarch most commonly refers to the Exarch of Italy, who governed the area of Italy and Dalmatia, still remaining under Byzantine control after the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasion of 568. The exarchate's seat was at [[Ravenna]], whence it is known as the "[[Exarchate of Ravenna]]". Ravenna remained the seat of the Exarch until the revolt of 727 over [[Iconoclasm]]. Thereafter, the growing menace of the [[Lombards]] and the split between eastern and western [[Christendom]] that Iconoclasm caused made the position of the Exarch more and more untenable. The last Exarch was killed by the Lombards in 751.

A second exarchate was created by Maurice to administer northern Africa, formerly a separate [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|praetorian prefecture]], the islands of the western Mediterranean and the [[Spania|Byzantine possessions in Spain]]. The capital of the [[Exarchate of Africa]] was [[Carthage]]. The exarchate proved both financially and militarily strong, and survived until the Arab Muslim conquest of Carthage in 698.

== Ecclesiastical exarchs ==

=== Early tradition ===
The term exarch entered ecclesiastical language at first for a [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] (an archbishop) with jurisdiction not only for the area that was his as a metropolitan, but also over other metropolitans within local political [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s. Since imperial [[vicarius]] (governor of a political diocese) was often called "exarch" in eastern, Greek speaking parts of the Empire, it became customary for the metropolitans of the diocesan capitals ([[Ephesus]] in [[Diocese of Asia]], [[Heraclea in Thrace]] and [[Caesarea in Cappadocia]]) also to use the title "exarch" in order to emphasize their precedence and primatial status over other metropolitans within local political dioceses.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989}}

The [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), which gave special authority to the see of Constantinople, as being "the residence of the emperor and the Senate," in its canons spoke of diocesan "exarchs", placing all metropolitans in dioceses of Asia, Thrace an Pontus (including metropolitas-exarchs of Ephesus, Heraclea and Caesarea) under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Constantinople. Metropolitans-exarchs of Ephesus tried to resist the supreme jurisdiction of Constantinople, but eventually failed since imperial government supported the creation of a centralized Patriarchate.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989}}

When the proposed government of universal Christendom by five patriarchal sees (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, known as the [[pentarchy]]), under the auspices of a single universal empire, was formulated in the legislation of [[Emperor Justinian I]] (527-565), especially in his Novella 131, and received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the [[Council in Trullo]] (692), the name "patriarch" became the official one for the heads of major autocephalous churches, and the title of "exarch" was further demoted by naming all metropolitans as "patriarchal exarchs" in their ecclesiastical provinces. The advance of Constantinople put an end to privileges of three older, original exarchates, which fell back to the state of ordinary metropolitan sees.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fortescue, Orthodox Eastern Church, 21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local ecclesiastical development in some regions also included the title of exarch. Since the Church of Cyprus was declared [[autocephalous]] (431), its Primate received the title of Exarch of Cyprus. On the similar principle the [[Archbishop of Mount Sinai and Raithu]] is an exarch, though in this case, as in that of Cyprus, modern Eastern Orthodox usage generally prefers the title "Archbishop".

=== Eastern Orthodox Churches ===
[[File:Грузинский экзархат - საქართველოს საეგზარქოსო - Exarchate of Georgia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Georgian Exarchate'' in the 19th century]]
[[File:Platon (Rozhdestvensky).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky), last ''Exarch of Georgia'' (1915-1917) and first ''Exarch of Caucasus'' (1917-1918)]]
In modern ecclesiastical practice of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], title of exarch was often used to designate the highest hierarchical office under the rank of patriarch. When Russian Patriarch [[Patriarch Adrian of Moscow|Adrian of Moscow]] died in 1700, Emperor [[Peter the Great]] abolished the patriarchal office and appointed Metropolitan [[Stefan Yavorsky]] as "exarch" and head of the governing council of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

After imperial Russia [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|annexed Georgia]] (eastern part in 1801, and western part in 1810), the ancient [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] (autocephalous since 750, whose head was since 1008 styled Catholicos-Patriarchs), was reorganized into ''Georgian Exarchate'' and the newly appointed ''Exarch of Georgia'' (since 1817 always an ethnic Russian) sat in the Russian Holy Synod at St. Petersburg.{{sfn|Fortescue|1908|p=295, 304-305, 351}} Since the entire region of [[Caucasus]] fell under the Russian rule, jurisdiction of ''Georgian Exarchate'' was expanded, encompassing territories of modern-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. On 7 April 1917, the Georgian Patriarchate was restored for the Archbishops of Mtsheta and Tbilisi, with the style Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, and the title ''Exarch of Georgia'' was extinguished, but only for the Georgian part of the Exarchate. Russian Orthodox Church and its exarch Platon (Rozhdestvensky) kept their jurisdiction over non-Georgian parts of the Caucasian region, and for those territories ''Caucasian Exarchate'' of the Russian Orthodox Church was created in the summer of 1917, with metropolitan Platon as ''Exarch of Caucasus''. In the spring of 1918, he was succeeded by metropolitan Cyril (Smirnov) as new ''Exarch of Caucasus'', but after his transfer to another post in the spring of 1920 no new exarch was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanitas.ru/eng/NEW%20ZION%20IN%20BABYLON%20-%20ch.%202.htm|title=Vladimir Moss, The Orthodox Church in the Twentieth Century|author=|date=|website=romanitas.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1870 the twenty-year-old struggle between Greeks and Bulgarians for the control of the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria culminated when the [[Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz]] created an independent Bulgarian ecclesiastical organization, known as the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]]. The Orthodox Church in [[Bulgaria]] had now become independent of the Greek-dominated [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Bulgarian Exarch, who resided in Constantinople, became the most famous bearer of the title of exarch; his adherents throughout region were called ''exarchists'', as opposed to the Greek ''patriarchists''.The ensuing struggle, waged especially in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], was not only religious but had a conspicuous political dimension of a contention between competing Greek and Bulgarian national aims. For more information see [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].

In 1921, eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church in [[Ukraine]] were reorganized as [[Ukrainian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church]], headed by patriarchal exarch, with seat in Kiev. The Ukrainian Exarchate existed until 1990 when it was granted a higher degree of ecclesiastical autonomy within the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1989, an autonomous [[Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church]] was formed, with jurisdiction over eparchies in [[Belarus]].

During the 20th century, the pentarchy-number principle, already abandoned in the case of [[Bulgaria]] (10th century), [[Serbia]] (14th century) and [[Russia]] (16th century), gave way to the desire of the now politically independent orthodox nations to see their sovereignty reflected in ecclesiastical autonomy - autocephaly - and the symbolic title to crown it: a 'national' Patriarch. For example, [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] was raised to the rank of Patriarchate in 1953.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the office of exarch can be also given to a special deputy of a [[Patriarch]], with jurisdiction over a community outside the home territory of the Patriarchate. Thus, in the United States, there are Exarchs representing, among others, the Serbian, Romanian, Bulgarian and Jerusalem Patriarchs. The style of the Exarchs of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem is "Exarch of the Holy Sepulcher".

The Mexican Orthodox parishes in five deaneries (Mexico City, D.F., State of Mexico, State of Jalisco, State of Veracruz and State of Chiapas) of the [[Orthodox Church in America]] are governed as the "Exarchate of Mexico", currently under the leadership of Bishop Alejo of Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/CAdioceseMX.asp?SID=8|title=Dioceses - Diocese of Mexico|author=|date=|website=www.oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third officer of the court of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who examines marriage cases (analogous to the Catholic [[defensor matrimonii]]), is called the Exarch.

=== Oriental Orthodox Churches ===
The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Patriarch of Antioch currently has under his authority an Exarch in India, known by the ancient title [[Maphrian]], although he is popularly referred to as [[Catholicos]]. This is not to be confused with the autocephalous [[Catholicos of the East|Catholicate of the East]], which is also located in India.

=== Latin Church ===
Historically, there have been a very few cases of the civil title of Exarch granted by the civil authority to prelates of the [[Latin Church]], as when [[Emperor Frederick I]] named the [[Archbishop of Lyon]] Exarch of [[Burgundy]] in 1157.
 
However, the ecclesiastical title of Exarch has disappeared in the Western Catholic Church, being replaced by the terms "[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]]" (ranking above Metropolitan Archbishop) and "[[Apostolic Vicar]]" (ranking below Suffragan Bishop).

=== Modern Eastern Catholic Churches ===
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
{{see also|Catholic Church hierarchy #Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law|List of Roman Catholic dioceses (alphabetical) #Dioceses (eparchies) of the Eastern Catholic Churches}}
In [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (of Eastern tradition but in full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope), the ecclesiastical title of Exarch is in common use, just as with its Orthodox counterparts.

These Churches are, in general, not identified with a particular liturgical rite. Thus, no less than fourteen of them use the one same [[Byzantine Rite]], mostly in one or other of only two languages, Greek and [[Church Slavonic]], but they maintain their distinct identities. Because of population shifts, half or so of these Churches have not just exarchates but full-scale [[eparchy|eparchies]] (bishoprics) or even archeparchies (archdioceses) outside their original territory.

====Apostolic exarchs====
[[Apostolic exarch]] is usually a consecrated bishop of a [[titular see]] to whom the Pope, as Bishop of the Roman See of the ''[[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]]'' [[Saint Peter|Peter]], has entrusted the pastoral care of the faithful of an autonomous Eastern Catholic [[particular Church]] ''sui iuris'' in an area, not raised to the rank of eparchy (diocese), that is situated outside the home territory of an Eastern Catholic Church. The office of ''apostolic exarch'' thus corresponds to what in the [[Latin Church]] is called an [[Apostolic vicar]]. Apostolic exarchates are generally exempt (immediately subject to the Holy See), with limited oversight by the [[Patriarch]], [[Major Archbishop]] or [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] in chief of the particular Eastern Church. It there is no metropolitan in a particular Eastern Catholic church, apostolic exarchates in their territories are directly subjected to Rome. For example, [[Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia]] belongs to the [[Byzantine Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia]], but since there is no metropolitan in that church, Apostolic Exarch of Serbia is directly subjected to the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dseby.html|title=Serbia (Apostolic Exarchate) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|first=David M.|last=Cheney|date=|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Patriarchal exarchs====
[[Patriarchal exarch]] is appointed in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as patriarch. Office of ''patriarchal exarch'' is often (not always) given to a consecrated bishop of a titular see. Their appointments are limited to the traditional territory of their church, with main task of governing the region not yet raised to the rank of eparchy (diocese). They may be suffragan to an archdiocese or archeparchy of the Eastern Catholic Church, or be immediately subject to the Patriarch.

====Archiepiscopal exarchs====
[[Archiepiscopal exarch]] is appointed in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as [[Major Archbishop]]. Office of ''archiepiscopal exarch'' is also usually given to a consecrated bishop of a titular see. Appointment of ''archiepiscopal exarchs'' is limited to the traditional territory of their particular church. They also may be suffragans to an archdiocese or archeparchy of their Eastern Catholic Church, or be immediately subject to the Major Archbishop.

====Coadjutor exarchs====
In particular cases, usually because of illness or some other problem, an exarch of any rank can be assisted by the appointment of a colleague who is called [[Coadjutor exarch]]. The position of ''coadjutor exarch'' towards his superior exarch is similar to the position of Latin [[coadjutor bishop]] towards his superior diocesan bishop. Coadjutor exarchs are appointed with rights of succession. For example, in 1993 titular Bishop [[Christo Proykov]] of Briula was appointed Coadjutor to Apostolic Exarch of Sofia, [[Methodius Stratiev]], and when later died in 1995, coadjutor exarch succeeded him as new Apostolic Exarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bproykov.html|title=Bishop Christo Proykov [Catholic-Hierarchy]|first=David M.|last=Cheney|date=|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Auxiliary exarchs====
In practice, exarch of any rank can be additionally assisted by an [[auxiliary exarch]], who is appointed in order to help the exarch in administration of his exarchate. Position of auxiliary exarch towards his superior exarch is similar to position of Latin [[auxiliary bishop]] towards his superior [[diocesan bishop]]. Auxiliary exarchs are appointed without the rights of succession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13059">'''Global imbalances''' refers to the situation where some countries have more assets than the other countries. In theory, when the [[current account]] is in [[balance (accounting)|balance]], it has a zero value: inflows and outflows of capital will be cancelled by each other. Hence, if the [[current account]] is persistently showing [[Balance of payments|deficits]] for certain period it is said to show an inequilibrium. Since, by definition, all current accounts and net foreign assets of the countries in the world must become zero, then other countries become indebted with the other nations.
During recent years, global imbalances have become a concern in the rest of the world. The [[United States]] has run long term  deficits, as well as many other advanced economies, while in Asia and emerging economies the opposite has occurred. 

[[File:GlobalImbalances.png|thumb]]

== A technical definition ==

They refer to global imbalances as "external positions of systemically important economies that reflect distortions or entail risks for the global economy".&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; 
The three parts of this definition can be re-defined further:
# External positions: this refers not only to current account flows, but also the [[net foreign assets]] of countries (which, if changes in the prices of those assets and liabilities are zero, then it is the accumulated sum of past net current account flows).
# Systemically important economies: these are the economic blocks running the imbalances, that are relevant to the world market operations, e.g. China, the [[Euro area]] or the United States.
# Reflect distortions or entail risks: this parts concerns both the causes (distortions) and possible consequences (risks) of the imbalances. This means that even an external imbalance that was not originated on some market distortion, would fall under the definition of global imbalances, if significant risks arise from it.

== History ==

Global imbalances are far from being a new phenomenon in economic history. There are many periods where they were present, although here only those periods where some data is available will be referred to.

The first period of global imbalances that will be presented, occurred during the years 1870 to 1914 (a former era of [[global financial system|financial globalisation]]) where massive flows of capital flew from the core countries of [[Western Europe]] to the countries of recent settlement overseas (especially the [[Americas]] and [[Australasia]]). Current account surpluses run by [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] reached approximately 9% of GDP, while for the destination of the flows. ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]) the deficit exceeded 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bordo|first=Michael|title=Historical Perspective on Global Imbalances|date=May 2005|series=NBER Working Paper Series|issue=11383 |ssrn=731038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of adjustment of these imbalances relates to the [[price specie flow mechanism]] of the classical [[gold standard]], which was smooth, in general, with exception of the [[Panic of 1890|Barings Crisis]] in 1890 for some countries.

During the [[First World War]], the participating countries abandoned gold convertibility, with exception of the United States. After the war, by 1926, the major countries got back to a gold standard, where the countries held reserves in dollars, sterling and francs, and the United States, Great Britain and France held gold. But this system had some serious flaws which prevented that the imbalances generated were adjusted smoothly. [[Real exchange rate]]s were misaligned, and the system began to lose credibility (since, at the time, it seemed that external concerns came second after domestic concerns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eichengreen|first=Barry|title=Fetters of gold and paper|url=http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/5359|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse began after 1929: speculative attacks on countries following expansionary policies to alleviate the effects of the Great Depression, and soon had to leave the gold standard. The United States continue until 1933. The imbalance during this period, however, where not as large in magnitude as they were before the First World War.

After the [[Second World War]], under the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. was the country with the largest gold reserves, and had to peg the dollar to gold at 35 dollars per ounce, as the rest of the world pegged to the dollar. Stronger restrictions existed on cross-border capital flows, compared to the gold standard, that did not allow countries to run big surpluses or deficits in the current account, as it was the case during the classical gold standard regime. The system ended in 1971, amidst expansionary policies in the United States, that lead European countries to begin converting their dollar claims into gold, threatening U.S. gold reserves.

Another periods of smaller imbalances began after the end of the Bretton Woods system, but their magnitude is much smaller than the ones of the beginning of the 21st century, involving different sets of countries and with different resolutions.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01266.x| title = A Framework for Assessing Global Imbalances1| year = 2010| last1 = Bracke | first1 = T. | last2 = Bussière | first2 = M. | last3 = Fidora | first3 = M. | last4 = Straub | first4 = R. | journal = The World Economy| volume = 33| issue = 9| pages = 1140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anton Brender 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Global imbalances: is the world economy really at risk?|year=2007|publisher=Dexia|isbn=978-2-87193-326-7|author=Anton Brender|author2=Florence Pisani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current episode===

Making a comparison with the former global imbalances, the current period has unprecedented features. This is the first time that capital flows go mostly from emerging market economies (mainly Asia and the Oil exporting economies), to advanced economies. Also, the foreign asset positions have become much larger in both gross and net terms, and the degree of capital mobility is the highest in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obstfeld|first=Maurice|author2=Alan Taylor|title=Globalization and Capital Markets|year=2002|series=NBER Working Paper Series|issue=8846 |ssrn=305072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the size of these imbalances are only comparable to the period previous to the First World War. Also the conditions under which they appeared are different. New participants that were in the periphery of global trade and finance before, have become an important part of the international markets, after a process of economic liberalisation, falling transportation costs, information technology and the deepening of financial markets and global chains of production. The financial links among the economies has also increased. And the macroeconomic and financial conditions improved, especially during 2003-2007, with record economic growth and low financial market volatility. As it will explained later, this are important factors in generating the increased globalisation of financial markets.

== Causes ==

The essential requirement to make large global imbalances in world, is the monetary globalisation or, in other words, freeing and opening the financial markets. Without this, it is not able to produce the  amount of capital flows between countries  However, not every monetary globalisation should lead to imbalances. Other factors are important as well.

One factor is increases in the bank savings from emerging countries, especially in  Asian Countries and Commodity Exporter economies, part of what is known as the [[Saving glut|Savings Glut]]. These economies increased their [[foreign exchange reserves]] to respond to future balance of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2011.02435.x| title = The Optimal Level of International Reserves for Emerging Market Countries: A New Formula and Some Applications| year = 2011| last1 = Jeanne | first1 = O. | last2 = Rancière | first2 = R. | journal = The Economic Journal| volume = 121| issue = 555| pages = 905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, there are some other reasons, such as low levels of social security in emerging countries, as well as the [[Fixed exchange rate|fixed]] or [[flexible foreign exchange]] systems of many of these countries. In some advanced countries, such as Germany,Japan and New Zealand, the ageing issue has been a very important factor increasing the amount of the savings.

So far, we have explained why some countries have accumulated many savings, but not why they are held abroad (besides the [[precautionary savings]] explanation). One reason, is that the financial development has not been followed at the same pace as the financial openness. This can be seen in a very small markets to generate safe assets where to store value from one period to the next. For this reason, many countries have decided to invest those assets abroad, in the more financially developed countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, in the form of [[Sovereign wealth fund|Sovereign Wealth Funds]], [[portfolio investment]]s and foreign reserves, indicating the existence of shortages in safe assets as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendoza|first=Enrique |author2=Vincenzo Quadrini |author3=José-Víctor Ríos-Rull|title=Financial Integration, Financial Development, and Global Imbalances|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=2009|volume=117|issue=3|pages=371–416|doi=10.1086/599706|citeseerx=10.1.1.422.4598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caballero|first=Ricardo |author2=Emmanuel Fahri |author3=Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas|title=An Equilibrium Model of "Global Imbalances" and Low Interest Rates|journal=American Economic Review|year=2008|volume=98|issue=1|pages=358–393|doi=10.1257/aer.98.1.358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that ageing population do not find profitable investment vehicles to invest at home, and end up investing them abroad.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anton Brender 2007"/&gt;

Also, some coincidental factors amplified the extent of the imbalances. The decreasing output volatility in advanced economies (i.e. [[Great Moderation]]), led to less savings and a decrease in risk aversion, that was reflected in deepening current account deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fogli|first=Alessandra|author2=Fabrizio Perri|title=The "Great Moderation" and the US External Imbalance|year=2006|series=NBER Working Paper Series|issue=12708 |ssrn=984513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Great Recession ==

Global imbalances helped fuel the financial crisis, even though it did not cause it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Mervyn|title=Global imbalances: the perspective of the Bank of England|journal=Financial Stability Review|date=February 2011|volume=15|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Savings Glut helped push down the yields on Treasury bonds, through the foreign purchases. This reduction in interest rate, in addition to other policy measures adopted by central banks, encouraged [[Risk-taking|risk taking]] and underestimation of risks, on the verge of [[financial innovation]], that might as well had been boosted by this financial environment. It also helped in the increase of leverage in advanced economies, and the formation of the housing market bubble in many of them, through the relaxed credit conditions. Also the increase in the financial linkages, lead to a rapid contagion across economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jmoneco.2009.10.009| title = Financial globalization, financial crises and contagion| year = 2010| last1 = Mendoza | first1 = E. G. | last2 = Quadrini | first2 = V. | journal = Journal of Monetary Economics| volume = 57| pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be hard to argue that the economic policies followed by the emerging markets, led to the ability of advanced economy to borrow cheaply abroad and finance the bubbles in the housing and financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obstfeld|first=Maurice|author2=Kenneth Rogoff|title=Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis: Product of Common Causes|date=November 2009|url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~obstfeld/santabarbara.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though many of the policies adopted or discussed since the beginning of the Great Recession, have centred on the sectors of Finance, Housing and Public Debt, among other issues, the presence of Global Imbalances still remains as a factor, that although reduced, points out the need of reforms of the international monetary and financial system to correct the imbalances, and hence, the distortions and market imperfections that gave them origin in first place.

The '''Highlands and Islands Alliance''' or '''Càirdeas''' was a [[Minor party#United Kingdom|minor]] Scottish [[electoral alliance]] that was active in the late 1990s. Founded in the Autumn of 1998 by [[Independent politician|non-partisan]] politicians local to the [[Highlands and Islands]], it only contested the inaugural [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|Scottish Parliament election of 1999]], where it collected a negligible 1.3% of the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|regional vote]] and despite a reasonably publicised campaign, failed to elect any of its candidates. Led by [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] activist Lorraine Mann, the Alliance was established to better represent marginalised communities in rural [[Scotland]], who they felt had been ignored by government in favour of those in the more densely populated [[Central Belt]]. Its policies were near exclusively centred on localism and rural issues, only contesting Scotland's regional [[Additional Member System#Scotland|additional member system]] so that electors could vote on nationwide matters through their constituency ballot. After the election, the group remained politically inactive until it was quietly disestablished in August 2004.

Although electorally unimportant, the Alliance's legal campaign to allow political [[job sharing]] in the [[Scottish Parliament]] attracted considerable media and academic coverage. The dispute has since become the subject of legislative research by both the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where it informed debate surrounding the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]].

Overseen by then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s administration, a [[Scottish Parliament]] was to be established in accordance with the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 Scottish devolution referendum]] result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cairney|McGarvey|2008|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Highlands and Islands Alliance was founded in the Autumn of 1998 by local activists who sought to "create a strong, independent voice for the [[Highlands and Islands]]"&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/parties_and_issues/313641.stm|title=Highlands and Islands Alliance|work=''BBC News''|date=14 April 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWCKvXHX?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/scotland_99/parties_and_issues/313641.stm|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for the [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|following year's inaugural election]].&lt;ref name="Job-share accept"&gt;Ward, Lucy {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/20/scotlanddevolution.devolution2|title=Job-share candidates cleared for poll|work=The Guardian|date=20 April 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWIKCcXK?url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/20/scotlanddevolution.devolution2|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; They believed that the [[Central Belt]] in the [[Scottish Lowlands]], the most densely populated area in the country, had received a disproportionate amount of attention from the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] in [[Westminster]] and that rural communities were being neglected as a consequence.&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; The group also wanted to redress the fact, that in their opinion, residents in the Highlands and Islands experienced "the lowest incomes and highest taxes in the UK".&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt; Alliance members believed that the establishment of a devolved parliament at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] was an opportunity to enhance their region's representation, commenting "[we] have great hopes that Holyrood will not emerge [[Matryoshka doll|Russian-doll]] like from Westminster".&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt;

Members instrumental in the Alliance's development included playwright Edwin 'Eddie' Stiven, [[Black Isle]] [[Councillor#United Kingdom|Councillor]] Bryan Beattie and the group's sole leader, [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] activist Lorraine Mann.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt; Prior to leading the party, Mann campaigned successfully and single-handedly against [[nuclear reprocessing]] at the [[Dounreay#Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment|Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment]] in Caithness, further serving as Convenor of [[Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping]].&lt;ref name="Boothroyd98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt; The Alliance was formerly registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 25 February 1999, with Beattie acting as nominating officer, as well as treasurer, and Mann as leader.&lt;ref name="Commission"/&gt; Consisting of about 280 members,&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/187809|title=The Highland road|work=The Economist|date=25 February 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWGHPIc2?url=http://www.economist.com/node/187809|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group were headquartered at Midoxgate House, a converted [[Sty|pigsty]] in the small hamlet of [[Fearn, Highland|Fearn]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"&gt;Seenan, Gerard {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/26/scotlanddevolution.devolution2|title=Scottish devolution: The highland alliance which sees no need to make policies|work=The Guardian|date=26 April 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWFNEYQj?url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/26/scotlanddevolution.devolution2|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission"/&gt; Before its official registration, the party steadily built up a respectable profile; this included interviews with ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 22 and 26 January, in which they declared their intention to stand in the Scottish Parliament election, as well as criticised the disconnection between Highland parliamentarians and the constituencies they represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2016|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Job-share"&gt;Ward, Lucy {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/26/gender.uk3|title=Putting New Labour's family-friendly policies to the test|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWGnC0Ap?url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/26/gender.uk3|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary campaign===
The Alliance ran an active parliamentary campaign, sometimes labelling themselves as '''Càirdeas''',&lt;ref name="Boothroyd98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission"/&gt; a [[Scottish Gaelic]] word that "has a meaning incorporating friendship, fellowship, relationship, goodwill and alliance."&lt;ref name="Boothroyd98"/&gt; Their efforts were an object of media attention, becoming the subject of several articles by [[BBC News]],&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'',&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt; ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt; ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;Cusick, James {{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/voting-for-a-new-britain-skye-voters-likely-to-bag-a-munro-1091215.html|title=Voting for a new Britain: Skye voters likely to bag a Munro|work=The Independent|date=2 May 1999|accessdate=21 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6stGHYFDY?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/voting-for-a-new-britain-skye-voters-likely-to-bag-a-munro-1091215.html|archivedate=21 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications. Leader Lorraine Mann also attended a [[land reform]] debate at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]] on 16 April, where she was joined by Iain Haughie of the [[Scottish Conservatives]], Dot Jessiman of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), [[Charles Kennedy]] of the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] and [[John Sewel, Baron Sewel|Lord Sewel]] of the [[Scottish Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/1999/pr421.hti|title=Aberdeen University enters the Devolution debate|publisher=University of Aberdeen|date=16 April 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sVGADUEu?url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/1999/pr421.hti|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite reasonable coverage in public life, the party produced a "disappointing"&lt;ref name="Boothroyd98"/&gt; result at the election, held on 6 May 1999.&lt;ref name="BBC Job-share"/&gt; They captured 2,607 votes, 1.3% of those cast in the Parliament's [[Additional Member System|additional member]] [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands and Islands electoral region]];&lt;ref name="National Result"/&gt; the group did not contest the region's individual [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] constituencies, leaving potential supporters to vote on nationwide issues as they saw fit.&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt;

At one time, commentators observed that the Alliance was "on the verge of taking one seat",&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt; with the "outside chance of winning one or two seats",&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; though all of the group's candidates were ultimately defeated.&lt;ref name="National Result"/&gt; Among them was [[Arthur Cormack]], an Alliance candidate otherwise known as a traditional Scottish singer.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12357958.display/|title=Shouting is drowning the voice of the people, claims Alliance|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=3 May 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWCp0eeQ?url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12357958.display/|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, the group remained electorally inactive until it was, without statement, voluntarily deregistered from the Electoral Commission on 24 August 2004.&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openelectoralcommission.org.uk/parties/PP94/highlands-and-islands-alliance-c-irdeas/|title=Highlands and Islands Alliance – Càirdeas|publisher=Open Electoral Commission|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWF04LOx?url=http://openelectoralcommission.org.uk/parties/PP94/highlands-and-islands-alliance-c-irdeas/|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and policies==
Ideologically, journalist James Cusick of ''The Independent'' observed that the Alliance had a "[[Political radicalism|radical]] edge that harks back to the [[Highland Land League]] of a century ago."&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; Although technically non-partisan, it received the formal endorsement of [[Post-communism|post-communist]] group [[Democratic Left Scotland]], which "was committed to ... renew radical socialist politics"&lt;ref name="Laybourn"&gt;{{harvnb|Laybourn|2006|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the fledgling Scottish Parliament's [[proportional representation]] (PR) electoral system.&lt;ref name="Laybourn"/&gt;

===Policy outline===
[[File:Fishing boats - geograph.org.uk - 1206220.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Alliance favoured [[community ownership]] of Scottish [[Fishery|fisheries]].]]
Mann suggested that the group were promoting "positions rather than policies",&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt; with representatives not bound to act on legislation according to party instruction. They instead proposed that any [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) elected from the Alliance would consult their electorate on how to vote through the internet, namely via [[E-Mail]], in what they hailed as a new form of "community democracy".&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; Described by political scientists [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and [[Martin Westlake]] as "localised",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|Westlake|2000|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Alliance nonetheless developed a detailed regional policy platform "on the basis that the distinctive voice of [the Highlands and Islands] should be heard".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cairney|McGarvey|2008|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the release of a publication, ''The Problems, in Fishing, Aquaculture, and the Marine Environment'', authored by Edwin Stiven and printed in [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]]. In it, Stiven recommends that fisheries in the west of Scotland should be free of all [[European Union]] (EU) influence and legal restrictions, advocating their complete return to [[community ownership]]; he further suggests management by sea [[Land trust|trusts]], similar to those established for [[Croft (land)|crofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|2001|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise regarding the EU, the Alliance called for more funding to be directed towards "communities which have found themselves on the periphery of investment."&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt;

Domestically, the group pushed for the diversification of funding from central government to promote sustainable jobs, including the establishment of a separate, Scottish [[agricultural policy]] that prioritised land reform and redistribution initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halfacree |first=Keith |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/espos_0755-7809_2001_num_19_1_1984 |title=Going 'back-to-the-land' again: extending the scope of counterurbanisation|year=2001|location=Lille|journal=Espace Populations Sociétés|issue=1–2|page=164|issn=0755-7809|accessdate=20 January 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wbpk0bXp|archivedate=20 January 2018|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; It further believed that attempted funding strategies in the Highlands and Islands were largely unworkable due to the lack of big business and investment, instead suggesting the formation of a regional Highland bank.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; Social policy proposals were similarly community-focused, and included support for affordable basic services and the upkeep of rural schools, namely [[Preschool#Scotland|preschool]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; Connected to this was the Alliance's proposal for a non-legislative assembly in which all of the region's parliamentarians ([[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MPs]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and MSPs) would convene and discuss policy development with their local constituents. The group also endorsed the founding of a watchdog to monitor the Highlands and Islands' [[quango]]s and public services.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;

Suggestions in transport included [[Skye Bridge#Toll controversy|ending toll collections on the Skye Road Bridge]], improving the region's ferry network, slashing fares for local public transport and establishing a community-owned airline;&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; these measures were to be encompassed into the Alliance's "Right to Move" scheme.&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; Nationally, the Alliance supported both the reduction of [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|student tuition fees]] and the maintenance of British [[Grant (money)#UK|student grants]].&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; Regarding the [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|continuation of the United Kingdom]], it took a neutral stance, simply stating "a Scotland which is treated fairly is more likely to want to stay within the union."&lt;ref name="BBC Policies"/&gt; The Alliance are recorded as supporters of the Scottish Gaelic language.&lt;ref name="Boothroyd98"&gt;{{harvnb|Boothroyd|2001|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job-sharing platform===
[[File:Inverness - Highland Council Headquarters (geograph 5000272).jpg|thumb|250px|Lorraine Mann was involved in a legal dispute with the [[Highland (council area)|Highland Council]] ''(offices pictured)'' over political [[Job sharing|job-sharing]].]]
The Alliance are perhaps best known for their controversial [[Job sharing|job-share]] candidacies. Such a proposal was suggested so that if the group were successful in obtaining a seat, the time a Holyrood representative would spend away from their rural constituents would not exceed a week, as they could interchange with their job-sharing partner.&lt;ref name="Guardian Job-share"/&gt; Fielding 20 candidates, the Alliance was the first British political party ever to achieve an absolute gender balance through its election nominations.&lt;ref name="Guardian Devolution"/&gt; Although each Alliance seat would be represented by two MSPs, the group insisted that they would share a single salary and expenses record.&lt;ref name="Guardian Job-share"/&gt;

Job-share proposals were eventually accepted by the [[Highland (council area)|Highland Council]]'s [[Returning officer#United Kingdom|Returning Officer]], Arthur McCourt, in April 1999.&lt;ref name="Job-share accept"/&gt; This followed a four-month dispute between the Alliance and the Highland Council, under the authority of the [[Scottish Office]], over the arrangement. However, it was revealed that McCourt was unaware of the job-share element, and subsequently deemed the nominations invalid.&lt;ref name="BBC Job-share"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/news/315456.stm|title=Party job-share row deepens|work=''BBC News''|date=9 April 1999|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWJ37lpw?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/news/315456.stm|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine Mann successfully took the case to an [[employment tribunal]] and the group fought the election on a job-sharing platform; that said, political scientist David Boothroyd speculates that the previously illegal status of their innovation lost them popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boothroyd|2001|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commons"/&gt; Legal support for job-sharing candidates was reversed at the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] in December 2000 as it was ruled the tribunal system had no jurisdiction over electoral law.&lt;ref name="Commons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NI Assembly"/&gt;

Under the advice of [[Advocacy group|pressure group]] [[New Ways To Work]],&lt;ref name="Guardian Job-share"/&gt; Mann then took the disagreement to another tribunal as a [[Sexism|sex-discrimination]] suit under the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] in November 2001,&lt;ref name="Commons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belcher|first1=Alice|last2=Ross|first2=Andrea|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/elr.2001.5.3.380|title=The Case for Job-Sharing Elected Representatives|journal=Edinburgh Law Review|date=September 2001|volume=5|issue=3|page=380|issn=1755-1692|accessdate=21 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6stFgL74r?url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/elr.2001.5.3.380|archivedate=21 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Council's decision was nonetheless upheld.&lt;ref name="NI Assembly"/&gt; The case has since been referenced by the parliamentary research papers of both the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where it informed debate surrounding the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]].&lt;ref name="Commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP01-75/RP01-75.pdf|last1=Strickland|first1=Pat|last2=Gay|first2=Oonagh|last3=Lourie|first3=Julia|last4=Cracknell|first4=Richard|title=The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Bill|publisher=House of Commons Library|date=22 October 2001|accessdate=6 August 2017|pages=27–28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sVFV9IlC?url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP01-75/RP01-75.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NI Assembly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2014/assembly_exec_review/10614.pdf|last1=Potter|first1=Michael|last2=McCaffrey|first2=Ray|title=Job Sharing in Political Representation|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=6 August 2017|page=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sVEinQEu?url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2014/assembly_exec_review/10614.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christianity and sexual orientation}}
The [[law of chastity]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) states that "sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife."&lt;ref&gt;[//www.lds.org/topics/same-sex-marriage "Same-Sex Marriage"], lds.org, accessed June 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, this commandment forbids all same-sex sexual behavior (whether intra-marriage or extramarital). Homosexuality-related violations of the law of chastity may result in [[disciplinary council|church discipline]].

The LDS Church has campaigned against government recognition of [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref name="LDS Church 2004" /&gt; and the issue of same-sex marriage has been one of the church's foremost political concerns since the 1990s. For example, church members represented as much as 80 to 90 percent of the early volunteers petitioning voters door-to-door and 50 percent of the campaign funds in support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title=Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage|date=November 14, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|first1=Jesse|last1=McKinley|first2=Kirk|last2=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church supported a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while at the same time allowing religious institutions to exercise their religious beliefs while hiring or providing university accommodations, stating it remained "unequivocally committed to defending the bedrock foundation of marriage between a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html|title=Mormon Church backs protection of gay rights in Salt Lake City|newspaper=Deseret News|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a curable illness===
In 1959, in response to a rash of arrests of gay men in Utah and Idaho, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[David O. McKay]] had apostles [[Spencer W. Kimball]] and [[Mark E. Petersen]] focus their assignment on curing gay members.&lt;ref name="Bookcraft" /&gt;{{rp|381}} At the time, the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' classified homosexuality as a mental illness, and Kimball was adamant that it could be cured. Speaking to church educators and LDS psychiatrists in 1965, Kimball said, citing a ''[[Medical World News]]'' article, that "[w]e know such a disease is curable," and that [[ex-gay]] Mormons had emerged from the church's counseling programs cured, although the cure was "like the cure for alcoholism subject to continued vigilance."&lt;ref name=Kimball-1965 /&gt; In 1970, Kimball was involved in creating an LDS publication for church leaders to "assist them to effect a cure and ... become normal again."&lt;ref name=KimballPetersen1970 /&gt; The pamphlet taught that church leaders may assist gay members by reciting scripture; appealing to their reason; encouraging them to abandon gay lovers and associates; praying with them; and encouraging them to replace any sexual expression of their homosexual feelings with heterosexual expressions like opposite-sex dating.&lt;ref name="Hope" /&gt;{{rp|2–6}} The pamphlet emphasized that "[h]omosexuality CAN be cured."&lt;ref name="Hope" /&gt;{{rp|7}} In 1973 the [[American Psychiatric Association]]’s removed homosexuality from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Haldeman |first= Douglas C. |date= April 1994 |title= The practice and ethics of sexual orientation conversion therapy |journal= [[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]] |volume= 62 |issue= 2 |pages= 221–227 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.62.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 the [[World Health Organization]] removed homosexuality from the list of disorders classified in the tenth edition of the [[International Classification of Diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cochran|first1=Susan D.|title=Proposed declassification of disease categories related to sexual orientation in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11)|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/92/9/14-135541/en/|website=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chhiber|first1=Ashley|title=World Health Organization told to declassify sexual orientation as basis of mental disorders|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/07/03/world-health-organization-told-to-declassify-sexual-orientation-as-basis-of-mental-disorders/|accessdate=4 February 2017|agency=Pink News|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a tendency===
In 1992 the church produced a booklet for leaders entitled ''Understanding and Helping Those With Homosexual Problems'',&lt;ref name="lds92" &gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding and Helping Those Who Have Homosexual Problems|date=1992|publisher=LDS Church|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/judeochristian/protestantism/mormon/mormon-homosexuality|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which removed all reference to homosexuality as a disease, instead framing it as "sinful behavior" that "should be eliminated" as well as "thoughts and feelings" which "should be overcome." LDS leaders have referenced contemporary scientific research, but have explained that this should not be taken as an official church position on "scientific questions," such as the causes of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt;

===As a confusion of gender===
{{Main|Gender minorities and the LDS church}}
On several occasions spanning the 70's to the early 2000's while discussing homosexuality, church leaders have alluded to their belief that the homosexual feeling may stem from a confusion over one's [[gender identity]] or [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="Lord" /&gt;{{rp|341}} Since then the church has acknowledged differences between gender identity and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://mormonandgay.lds.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions|website=Mormon and Gay|publisher=LDS Church|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trib Talk: LDS leaders Oaks, Christofferson will appear on Trib Talk to discuss religious freedom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJ6gL_xc-M?t=14m9s|accessdate=21 November 2016|agency=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petrey|first1=Taylor G.|title=A Mormon Leader Signals New Openness on Transgender Issues.

===Proposed historical tolerance===
Former LDS historian [[D. Michael Quinn]] has suggested that early church leaders had a more tolerant view of homosexuality given that during the 19th century, the Church (like American society as a whole) was relatively tolerant of same-sex [[intimate relationship]]s.

==Current theology and policy==

In 1999, [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], president of the church, officially welcomed gay people in the church,&lt;ref name=Why&gt;{{Citation |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |first= Gordon B. |last= Hinckley |title= Why We Do Some of the Things We Do |date= November 1999 |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/11/why-we-do-some-of-the-things-we-do |quote= Our hearts reach out to those who refer to themselves as gays and lesbians.

In November 2015, the church clarified that its members who are in a [[same-sex marriage]] are in apostasy and would be subject to church discipline.&lt;ref name="2015developments"/&gt;&lt;ref name = 2015policy&gt;Cimaron Neugebauer, [http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-church-issues-update-on-what-is-considered-apostasy "LDS Church adds same-sex marriage to definition of apostasy"], kutv.com, November 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, local leadership had more discretion in whether or how far to pursue church disciplinary action for members in same-sex marriages. Local church leaders still have discretion for same-sex couples who are cohabiting but not married. While explicitly including same-sex marriage in the church's definition of apostasy, the November 2015 update also addressed children of same-sex couples. In the updated policy, children living in a same-sex household may not [[Naming and blessing of children|receive a name and a blessing]], nor be baptized until at least 18 years of age, and must disavow same-sex marriage and no longer be living with a parent who is, or has been, in a same-sex relationship.&lt;ref name=Christofferson-explains&gt;{{cite web |last=Walch |first=Tad |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865640934/Elder-Christofferson-explains-updated-LDS-Church-policies-on-same-sex-marriage-and-children.html?pg=all |title=Elder Christofferson explains updated LDS Church policies on same-sex marriage and children |date=November 6, 2015 |work=Deseret News |accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="policy clarification"&gt;{{cite news | author=Tad Walch | title=LDS Church provides additional information on handbook policies about same-sex couples and their children | work=Deseret News | date=November 13, 2015 | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865641430/LDS-Church-provides-additional-information-on-handbook-policies-about-same-sex-couples-and-their.html?pg=all | accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology used by the church===
Although there is no official policy to this effect, some church leaders have stated that "homosexual", "lesbian", and "gay" should be used as adjectives to describe thoughts, feelings, or behaviors, and never as nouns to describe people.&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oaks95" &gt;{{cite web|last1=Oaks|first1=Dallin|title=Same-Gender Attraction|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/10/same-gender-attraction?lang=eng&amp;_r=1|website=lds.org|publisher=LDS Church|date=October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all leaders adhere to this approach. For example, Hinckley once stated in a public interview that "we have gays in the church."&lt;ref name=Lattin1997 /&gt; Those leaders who adopt this position argue that using these words to denote a person rather than a feeling would imply a person has no choice in regards to their sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="oaks95" /&gt; Church leaders and organizations have made reference to homosexuality as a sexual orientation&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="honorcode"&gt;{{Citation|author=Church Educational System|author-link=Church Educational System|title=Church Educational System Honor Code|publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]|place=Provo, Utah|url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822023539/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have only begun directly addressing [[bisexuality|bisexual]] members since October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-Sex Attraction|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/same-sex-attraction?lang=eng|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026171626/https://www.lds.org/topics/same-sex-attraction?lang=eng|archive-date=October 26, 2016|website=lds.org/topics|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=11 June 2017|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}} Compare to the archived page from the previous month .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Sexual Orientation|url=https://mormonandgay.lds.org/articles/about-sexual-orientation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025174921/https://mormonandgay.lds.org/articles/about-sexual-orientation|archive-date=2016-10-25|website=mormonandgay.lds.org|publisher=LDS Church|date=October 2016}} Compare to an archive of the original version of this website from a few days before [https://web.archive.org/web/20161022053954/http://mormonsandgays.org/ here].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]], church references condemning homosexuality are to be interpreted as a condemnation of sexual behavior, not of the people who have certain sexual feelings.&lt;ref name=Oaks-1984&gt;{{citation|last=Oaks|first=Dallin|title=Principles to govern possible public statement on legislation affecting rights of homosexuals|date=August 7, 1984|quote=Thus, the First Presidency's letters condemning homosexuality are, by their explicit terms, directed at the practices of homosexuality.}} Reprinted at [https://web.archive.org/web/20131126062717/http://affirmation.org:80/pdf/oaks_paper_02.pdf affirmation.org] and quoted at [https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030629/https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Eskridge.pdf illinoislawreview.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

"Homosexual problems", according to popular church vernacular, are defined as "homoerotic thoughts, feelings, or behaviors."&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt; In describing people with homosexual feelings, the church and its members will often refer to [[Same-sex attraction|"same-gender attractions"]]. This is used in contrast to people who have problems with opposite-gender attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Nelson|first=Russell M.|subjectlink=Russell M.

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The church uses the example of [[Jesus Christ]] being tempted as an example of how homosexuals can avoid sin.]]

===Homosexual inclinations===

The church does not condemn what it calls "susceptibilities," "inclinations", or "temptations" of any type that are not acted upon, pointing to the example of the [[temptation of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; Members with homosexual "inclinations" can participate as all other members of the church&lt;ref name="hinckley98" /&gt; and if they remain celibate or heterosexually married, they can participate in the religion to the same extent as straight members. Heterosexual marriage is considered a sacred covenant which should generally not be pursued if homosexual feelings are not under control.&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; Those with same-gender attractions are encouraged to talk to their ecclesiastical leader.&lt;ref name="SbT:Chastity"&gt;{{citation|title=Gospel Topics: Chastity|url=//www.lds.org/topics/chastity?lang=eng|work=lds.org|publisher=[[LDS Church]]|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FSY"&gt;{{cite book|title=For the Strength of Youth |publisher=LDS Church |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |page=36 |edition=9 |url=https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/ForTheStrengthOfYouth-eng.pdf?lang=eng |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are encouraged not to let their sexual feelings be the sole defining factor in their lives, but to see the whole person, extending their horizons beyond their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; They are advised that they should be careful not to blame their parents.

However, church leaders recognize the loneliness and difficulty that those with homosexual inclinations may have and encourage other members to reach out to them.&lt;ref name="LDS Church 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverance" /&gt; Oaks has said, “All should understand that persons (and their family members) struggling with the burden of same-sex attraction are in special need of the love and encouragement that is a clear responsibility of church members, who have signified by covenant their willingness to bear one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ.&lt;ref name="oaks95" /&gt;

The church does not participate in debate on whether homosexual susceptibilities develop from "nature" or "nurture", suggesting that such debates are better left to science.&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; Oaks has admitted that "perhaps such susceptibilities are inborn or acquired without personal choice" and "may have some relationship to inheritance," citing some scientific research.&lt;ref name="oaks95" /&gt; However, the church teaches that these inclinations will not continue beyond death&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; and that gender and gender roles are an eternal and essential characteristic of a soul.&lt;ref name="Proclamation"&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/family/proclamation |title= The Family: A Proclamation to the World |year= 1995 |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homosexual thoughts ===
The church teaches that all members should take responsibility in bridling their thoughts, attitudes, feelings, desires, and passions. All members are taught to avoid any talk or activity that may arouse immoral sexual feelings.&lt;ref name="SbT:Chastity" /&gt; Members are taught to "let virtue garnish [their] thoughts unceasingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|121|45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apostle [[Richard G. Scott]] has taught that through the [[atonement of Jesus Christ]], all desire to sin can be changed and individuals can experience lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Scott |first= Richard G. |author-link= Richard G. Scott |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2006/11/the-atonement-can-secure-your-peace-and-happiness |title= The Atonement Can Secure Your Peace and Happiness |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those with same-gender attractions, church leaders counsel that "the line of prudence is between the susceptibility and the feelings."&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; The church teaches that everyone has feelings they did not choose,&lt;ref name="oaks95" /&gt; and homosexual feelings can be powerful and difficult to control&lt;ref name="hinckley98" /&gt; but "regardless of the causes, these problems can be controlled and eventually overcome."&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt; Even though there is no church discipline for homosexual thoughts or feelings,&lt;ref name="oaks95" /&gt; the church teaches they should learn to accept responsibility for homosexual feelings&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt; and cite examples of how those born with inclinations to alcoholism, anger, or other undesirable traits have been able to control their thoughts and actions.&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; With better understanding of moral law, they teach these problems will be able to be fixed "routinely."&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt;

The church teaches that members should not indulge in activities that will intensify homosexual feelings, such as viewing pornography, masturbating, or participating in homosexual behavior.&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miracle"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kimball|first=Spencer W.|author-link=Spencer W. Kimball|title=[[The Miracle of Forgiveness]]|year=1969|publisher=[[Bookcraft]]|isbn=978-0-88494-192-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt; "Unhealthy" relationships, such as those with people that encourage homosexual behavior, should be cut off, and the very appearance of evil should be avoided.&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt; [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishops]] of the church are counseled to be careful to avoid creating circumstances in which those with homosexual problems are exposed to temptations.&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt;

In 1991, the church issued a statement that read:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sexual relations are proper only between husband and wife appropriately expressed within the bonds of marriage. Any other sexual contact, including fornication, adultery, and homosexual and lesbian behavior is sinful .... We plead with those involved in such behavior to forsake it.&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The church has also taught that homosexual behavior distorts loving relationships,&lt;ref name="SbT:Chastity" /&gt; undermines the divinely created institution of the family&lt;ref name="LDS Church 2004" /&gt; and can become an addiction.&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt; Church discipline for homosexual activity is similar to that for members involved in heterosexual activity. For example, pre-marital sex of either kind may permanently bar a person from serving as a church [[Mormon missionary|missionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher |first=Peggy |url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_2890646 |title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune |publisher=Sltrib.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church teaches that homosexual behavior has always been a grievous sin.&lt;ref name="Reverance" /&gt; In 1976, apostle [[Boyd K. Packer]] taught: &lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind, with nothing they can do about it. They are just "that way" and can only yield to those desires. It is a malicious and destructive lie. While it is a convincing idea to some, it is of the devil. No one is locked into that kind of life ... Boys are to become men—masculine, manly men—ultimately to become husbands and fathers.&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although church leaders condemn the sin of homosexual behavior, they teach love for the men and women who experience homosexual attraction, including for those who pursue some form of homosexual lifestyle: "We should reach out with kindness and comfort to the afflicted, ministering to their needs and assisting them with their problems."&lt;ref name="Reverance" /&gt;  Church leaders have spoken out against "[[gay-bashing]]" and other physical or verbal attacks on those involved in homosexual behavior.&lt;ref name="oaks95" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Responds to HRC Petition: Statement on Same-Sex Attraction|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-mormon-responds-to-human-rights-campaign-petition-same-sex-attraction|accessdate=January 23, 2015|date=October 12, 2010|publisher=LDS Church|quote=Sexual activity should only occur between a man and a woman who are married.

Church president [[Spencer W. Kimball]] stated that he finds it hard to believe that one would choose to be homosexual by a conscious decision; instead, he suggested that it might be a spiritual disorder—with its roots in selfishness—resulting in feelings that must be overcome or suppressed.&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt; Kimball emphasized that the behavior is changeable,&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt; and if not repented of, may result in church discipline including excommunication under the direction of the bishop.&lt;ref name="lds92" /&gt; Kimball maintained that the cure comes through following the basic rules for moral and spiritual health for a long period of time with undeviating determination.&lt;ref name="2the1" /&gt;

===Homosexuality after death===
On several occasions from 2006–2009 multiple top leaders taught that attractions to those of the same sex won't exist after death, stating "it must be true"&lt;ref name="Hafen Speaks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elder Bruce C. Hafen Speaks on Same-Sex Attraction|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/elder-bruce-c-hafen-speaks-on-same-sex-attraction|website=Mormon Newsroom|date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "gay or lesbian inclinations" will "not exist post-mortality",&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mormons: Jeffrey Holland Interview|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/interviews/holland.html|website=pbs.org|publisher=PBS|date=4 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only occur "right now in mortality."&lt;ref name="Oaks-Wickman 2007" /&gt; The 2007 official church publication "[[God Loveth His Children]] states that, "others may not be free of this challenge [of same-gender attraction] in this life" but that "our bodies, feelings, and desires will be perfected in the next life so that every one of God’s children may find joy in a family."&lt;ref name="Women"/&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name="God Loveth"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Universe Timeline" /&gt;

==Treatment and views of LGBT people==
The church has occasionally addressed the treatment and views of LGBT+ members. In 2000 the apostle Packer addressed gay and lesbian youth stating that church leaders don't reject, but rather them, and that they sometimes must extend tough love through teaching and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Packer |first= Boyd K. |author-link= Boyd K. Packer |title= Ye Are the Temple of God |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/11/ye-are-the-temple-of-god |journal= Ensign |date= November 2000 |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 2007 church pamphlet "[[God Loveth His Children]]" acknowledged that some gay members have felt rejection by other members. It criticized those who did not show love and challenged gay members to show love and kindness to help other members change their attitudes.&lt;ref name="God Loveth" /&gt;

There are many current and former members of the LDS church who are attracted to people of the same sex, and they have had a variety of positive and negative experiences with leaders and other members. For example, one gay Mormon man who dates men reported never having problems with his local leaders, while another who was a Church employee described how his stake president denied his temple recommend resulting in him getting fired simply because of his friendship with other gay men and his involvement in a charity bingo for [[Utah Pride Center|Utah Pride]] in a 2011 article.&lt;ref name="Living gay in the Mormon Church"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bracken|first1=Seth|title=Living gay in the Mormon Church|url=http://gaysaltlake.com/news/2011/04/14/living-gay-in-the-church/|agency=Q Salt Lake|date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former LDS bishop and temple sealer [[Antonio A.

According to current church policy, members who have undergone an “elective transsexual operation” are banned from temple rites or receiving priesthood authority. Additionally, a trangender individual who has undergone [[sex reassignment surgery|gender-confirming surgery]] may be baptized only with First Presidency approval, and those considering it are barred from baptism.&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt; The church has acknowledged differences between gender identity and sexual orientation stating that they have "unfinished business in teaching on [transgender situations]."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt; The official website on homosexuality states that "same-sex attraction and [[gender dysphoria]] are very different ... those who experience gender dysphoria may or may not also experience same-sex attraction, and the majority of those who experience same-sex attraction do not desire to change their gender.

===Among members===
A 2011 online survey of over 3,000 individuals who no longer believe church truth claims found that around ten percent would consider returning if (among several changes) LGBT persons were accepted and treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Mormon Disbelief|url=http://www.whymormonsquestion.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Survey-Results_Understanding-Mormon-Disbelief-Mar20121.pdf|website=whymormonsquestion.org|publisher=Open Stories Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among the public===
The controversial policies for LGBT persons has made an impression on the general public. A 2003 nationwide [[Pew Research Center]] survey of over 1,000 LGBT Americans found that 83% of them said the LDS church was "generally unfriendly towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people" surpassed only by "the Muslim religion" at 84%.&lt;ref name="A Survey of LGBT Americans"/&gt; Additionally, in May 2008 a [[Georgia Tech]] gay-rights manual referred to the LDS Church as "anti-gay."

===Teachings on homosexuality changeability and origins===
Past leaders' teachings on reparative therapy and the origins of homosexuality have been criticized. In the late 90s psychiatrist Jeffery R. Jensen, a University of Utah almnus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Jeffery Jensen MD|url=https://health.usnews.com/doctors/jeffery-jensen-465921|website=health.usnews.com|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized church reparative therapy modalities and etiological theories around homosexuality in multiple presentations as lacking scientific integrity as he believed they were dictated from top church leaders rather than drawn from actual empirical observation by trained professionals. He also stated that current church publications on the subject were condescending, dehumanizing pontifications using caricatures and stereotypes of gay men and lesbians to distort knowledge and facts in order to justify oppressive standards and norms. He continued asserting that "far too many of our lesbian and gay youths kill themselves because of what you say about them" since gay men and lesbians cannot be made heterosexual, and "those who believe your false promises and remain celibate in the hopes of eventual 'cure' are consigned to a misery."&lt;ref name="Heterosexualization"&gt;{{cite speech |last=Jensen |first=Jeffrey R. |title=We See What We Believe: The Heterosexualization of Gay Men and Lesbians in the LDS Church |event=Sunstone Symposium |date=1997 |location=Washington D.C. |publisher=Sunstone Education Foundation, Inc. |url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/we-see-what-we-believe-the-heterosexualization-of-gay-men-and-lesbians-in-the-lds-church/ }} Transcript available [https://web.archive.org/web/20071005211209/http://www.lds-mormon.com:80/wswwb.shtml here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychiatrist"&gt;{{cite speech |last=Jensen |first=Jeffrey R. |title=Homosexuality: A Psychiatrist's Response to LDS Social Services |event=Sunstone Symposium |date=1996 |publisher=Sunstone Education Foundation, Inc. |url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/homosexuality-a-psychiatrists-response-to-lds-social-services-and-the-biological-basis-of-sexual-orientation/ }} Transcript at [https://web.archive.org/web/20060109013306/http://www.affirmation.org:80/learning/homosexuality_a_psychiatrists_response.asp affirmation.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, The American Psychiatric Association disavowed therapy trying to change sexual orientation as ineffective and destructive.&lt;ref name="Rebukes"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psychiatric Association Rebukes Reparative Therapy|url=https://sciencesources.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/1998-12/APA-APAR-141298.php|website=sciencesources.eurekalert.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)|date=14 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed-orientation marriage==
{{further|Mixed-orientation marriage}}
[[File:Weddingring-JH.jpg|thumb|right|LDS leaders have stated that opposite-sex marriage should not be viewed as a therapeutic step for members physically attracted to those of the same sex.&lt;ref name="solution" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marriage" /&gt;]]
Many gay and lesbian members of the LDS Church have felt that they should get marry someone of the opposite sex because of the church's emphasis on [[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|marriage]]. [[Evergreen International|Evergreen]] director David Pruden was quoted as stating in 2002 that 40% of the approximately 150 callers requesting help each month on their hotline were Mormon men married to women, and distressed about their homosexual attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schow |first1=Ron |title=Homosexual Attraction and LDS Marriage Decision |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |date=Fall 2005 |volume=38 |issue=3 |page=133 |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V38N03_145.pdf |quote=The extent of the problem is seen in the fact that Evergreen receives over 150 requests for help each month from those with homosexual attractions; 40 percent of these requests come from men who are married. Only 10 percent of the calls come from women. The remaining 50 percent are from single men. This pattern indicates a great deal of social pressure on LDS men with homosexual attractions to marry heterosexually, with unfortunate outcomes for many of them and their spouses and children.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2004 publication quoted LDS Family Services statistics which showed that about half of the approximately 400 gay Mormon men they had seen as clients for over a year during the past 30 years were married, though only half of those were able to stay married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schow |first1=Ron |title=Homosexual Attraction and LDS Marriage Decision |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |date=Fall 2005 |volume=38 |issue=3 |page=135 |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V38N03_145.pdf |quote=An LDS Family Services therapist who spoke to us about his clinical experience likely has had the most extensive experience in working with single and married homosexual Latter-day Saint men—approximately eight hundred men in more than thirty years.

Among the two hundred single men, only 10 percent were able to marry. Almost all of them (nineteen of twenty) identified themselves as bisexual. Of the two hundred married males (a large portion of whom, it is probably safe to speculate, were likely bisexual), only half were able to stay in their marriages, although there is no information as to what kinds of accommodations they had to make to do so, nor how many of these marriages will ultimately endure.}} A copy of ''The Persistence of Same Sex Attraction in Latter-day Saints Who Undergo Counseling or Change Therapy'' (2004) can be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20111211020508/http://www.ldsresources.info:80/professionals/persistence.shtml here].&lt;/ref&gt;

The church teaches that heterosexual marriage is one of several requirements for afterlife entry into the "[[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|highest degree of glory]]" in the [[celestial kingdom]]. Church leaders previously encouraged this with one former church employee stating in 1986 that he had experienced pressure to marry at the age of 24 in the belief that it would change his homosexual feelings later resulting in a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsey|first1=Robert|title=Utah Now Facing Problem of AIDS: Disease Is Occurring Despite Strict Mormon Teachings About Sexual Conduct|work=The New York Times|date=30 October 1986|page=A19|quote='A lot of men are forced to marry, and they play around on the side,' said Davyd Daniels, a former Mormon ... William Blevins, 40, a former librarian at the Mormon Church's genealogical center, said the church put pressure on him to marry at 24 in belief 'it would cure me' of homosexual leanings.

The most recent statement by a general church leader as of 2015 was when the apostle Oaks stated that leaders "definitely do not recommend marriage as a solution for same-gender feelings.

In reference to church involvement with legislation around LGBT people and marriage the apostle [[M. Russell Ballard]] has said the church is "locked in" if anything interferes with the principle of marriage being between a man and a woman, and stated that a very careful evaluation is made to determine what action is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99175018&amp;ps=rs|title=New Mormon Temple: Sacred Or Secret?|first=Howard|last=Berkes|date=January 9, 2009|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the mid-1990s, the LDS Church began to focus its attention on the issue of same-sex marriages with one scholar citing the church's views of God's male-female union plan, their sense of responsibility in publicly protecting traditional morality, and a fear of government encroachment in church performed marriages as the motivations for this opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=Seth R.|title=Mormonism and Same-Sex Marriage: Theological Underpinnings and New Perspectives|journal=Journal of Catholic Legal Studies|date=February 2017|volume=51|issue=41|page=50|url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&amp;context=jcls}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that discrimination against same-sex couples in the granting of marriage licenses violated the Hawaiian constitution. In response, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued a statement on February 13, 1994 declaring their opposition to same-sex marriage, and urging members to support efforts to outlaw it. With the lobbying of the LDS Church and several other religious organizations, the Hawaii legislature enacted a bill in 1994 outlawing same-sex marriages.

In response to Hawaii's same-sex marriage passage, the LDS Church released the 1995 "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]" reaffirming its stance that marriage is between one man and one woman.&lt;ref name = HRC&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeppson|first=Buckley|title=Stances of Faiths on LGBT Issues: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/religion/4988.htm|work=HRC website|publisher=[[Human Rights Campaign]]|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this monogamous stance has been strongly criticized as hypocritical given the Church's historical disagreement with this legal definition which bars [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah R.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism: Mormonism in the American Political Domain|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199778361|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Es4fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA618&amp;lpg=PA618&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 June 2017|ref=Handbook of Mormonism}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|618}}

In 2004, the Church officially endorsed an [[Federal Marriage Amendment|federal amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] as well as [[Utah Constitutional Amendment 3]] banning any marriages not between one man and one woman and announced its opposition to political measures that "confer legal status on any other sexual relationship" than "a man and a woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife."&lt;ref name="LDS Church 2004" /&gt; This statement seemed to also oppose [[civil union]]s, [[common-law marriage]]s, [[plural marriage]]s, or other family arrangements. This political involvement elicited the criticism of California Senator [[Mark Leno]] who questioned whether the Church's tax-exempt status should be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700226242,00.html |title=LDS Church expresses disappointment in California gay marriage decision |date=May 15, 2008 |first=Carrie |last=Moore |publisher=''[[Deseret News]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601193325/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1%2C5143%2C700226242%2C00.html |archivedate=June 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past the LDS church (like Orthodox Judaism, evangelical Christianity, and Catholicism) encouraged its LGBTQ members to attempt to change their sexual orientation, and continued to communicate into 2015 that changing one's sexual orientation was possible through personal righteousness, prayer, faith in Christ, psychotherapy, and group therapy and retreats.&lt;ref name="SOCE3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galliher|first1=Renee|last2=Bradshaw|first2=William|last3=Hyde|first3=Daniel|last4=Dehlin|first4=John|last5=Crowell|first5=Katherine|title=Sexual orientation change efforts among current or former LDS church members|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|page=96|date=April 2015|volume=62|issue=2|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fcou0000011|doi=10.1037/cou0000011|quote=The LDS church claims the Holy Bible as scripture and, through traditional Biblical interpretations, has historically both condemned same-sex sexuality as sinful and explicitly encouraged its lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) members to attempt sexual orientation change.

Stances softened over the years, however.&lt;ref name="SOCE3" /&gt; In the 60s and 70s Church leaders taught that homosexuality was a curable disease and they encouraged self-help attempts by homosexual members to change their sexual orientation and cultivate heterosexual feelings.&lt;ref name="Paradigm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prince|first1=Gregory A.|title=Science vs. Dogma: Biology Challenges the LDS Paradigm of Homosexuality|url=https://thc.utah.edu/lectures-programs/mcmurrin-lecture/PRINCE-MCMURRIN%20LECTURE-protected.pdf|website=thc.utah.edu|publisher=University of Utah Tanner Humanities Center|date=27 September 2017}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gssnz1WZ3dU Video] of the presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–19}} To assist in this, leaders developed an aversion therapy program on BYU campus for gay adolescents and adults from '59&lt;ref name="Dynamics" /&gt;{{rp|379}} to '83&lt;ref name="Conservative Christian Identity" /&gt;{{rp|65}} since simply being attracted to people of the same sex was an excommunicable sin under church president [[Spencer W.

* '''1958''' – [[General authority]] [[Bruce R.

The text states that those with homosexual desires could correct and overcome them like the cure for alcoholism. In the speech he stated BYU will never knowingly enroll nor tolerate anyone with these tendencies who fails to repent, and that it is a damnable heresy for a homosexual person to say that God made them that way.

However, Oaks states they can't endorse the [[Aversion Therapy|aversive therapies]] recommended in the past to fix it, and they don’t accept responsibility for the abuses suffered by individuals who had experienced this now disavowed therapy method. He further stated that giving even same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships the same government rights given to opposite-sex marriage would not be appropriate. He added that a [[mixed-orientation marriage]] would be appropriate for a gay member who could put homosexual feelings in the background and felt a great attraction to someone of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name="Living gay in the Mormon Church"/&gt; He compared devout homosexual Mormons to those with physical or mental disabilities who will also not be able to marry, and added that same-sex attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and will not exist in the next life. On family acceptance he stated that parents of gay children in same-sex relationships might tell them they can't stay overnight or expect any public appearances with the couple that may imply an approval of their relationship.

'''Humphrey Dennis McQueen''' (born 26 June 1942) is an Australian [[socialist]] historian and cultural commentator. He is associated with the development of the Australian [[New Left]], as a [[political activist]] and [[public intellectual]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016).

==Early Life and Academic Career==

McQueen was born in [[Brisbane]] to a [[working-class]] family that were active in the [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref name=Gould2004&gt;Gould, Bob (2004) 'The Life and Work of Humphrey McQueen: Never Trust Tories Bearing Gifts', Ozleft, viewed 20 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Marist College Ashgrove]], and later edited the Queensland Young Labor newsletter.&lt;ref name=Gould2004/&gt; McQueen joined the ALP at the age of fifteen, and was instrumental in establishing the Queensland Young Labor organisation. In 1961, McQueen served as the ALP campaign organiser for the seat of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Marks, Russell Leask | title=Rejection, redemption, ambivalence : the New Left and Australian nationalism | publication-date=2011 | publisher=La Trobe University | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/166096626 | accessdate=28 February 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228025308/https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/166096626 | archivedate=28 February 2018 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with [[Honours degree|Honours]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="surplusvalue.org.au"/&gt; McQueen was an active participant in the anti-[[Vietnam War]] movement in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vietnam-war.commemoration.gov.au/conscription/moratoriums-and-opposition.php|title=Australia and the Vietnam War - Conscription - Moratoriums and Opposition|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221181038/http://vietnam-war.commemoration.gov.au/conscription/moratoriums-and-opposition.php|archivedate=21 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaigning against [[conscription]] as chairman of the [[Melbourne]]-based Revolutionary Socialist Group in 1968. His organisational engagement shaped his interest in [[Maoist]] and [[Gramscian]] theory, influencing his subsequent historical work.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, R 1979, The Manufacture of Australian History, Oxford University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; From 1966-1969 he was employed as a teacher at Glen Waverley High, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In 1970, he moved to [[Canberra]], where he taught [[Australian history]] as a senior tutor at the [[Australian National University]] from 1970-1974.&lt;ref name="surplusvalue.org.au"/&gt; It was there that he met and befriended the historian, [[Manning Clark]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; McQueen had been head-hunted by Henry Mayer after reading McQueen's articles 'Convicts and Rebels' and 'A Race Apart'.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, R.L., 2011, Rejection, Redemption, Ambivalence: the New Left and Australian Nationalism (Doctoral Dissertation), La Trobe University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major contributions==
===''Convicts and Rebels''===

McQueen’s early academic writing was intent on dispelling the approaches to labour history generated by the Australian Old Left,&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, B 1944, A Short History of the Australian Labor Movement, Macmillan, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, I 1965, Industrial Labour and Politics: The Labour Movement in Eastern Australia: 1900–1921, Australian National University, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[Russel Ward]]'s ''The Australian Legend''.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, R 1958, The Australian Legend, Oxford University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; His critique was first developed in ''Convicts and Rebels'',&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;McQueen, H 1968, “Convicts and Rebels”, Labour History, Vol. 15, pp. 3–30.&lt;/ref&gt; in which McQueen contested the Australian [[Whig history]] &lt;ref&gt;Martin, A W 1962/2007, The Whig View of Australian History: And Other Essays, Melbourne University Publishing, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R W 1974, “Images of Australia”, in D E Edgar (ed.) Social Change in Australia: Readings in Sociology, Cheshire Books, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the Old Left.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016). "Radical Theories of Capitalism in Australia", Honours Thesis, University of Sydney, viewed 20 April 2017, [http://hdl.handle.net/2123/16655]&lt;/ref&gt; As he argued:

{{quote
|text ="Ward uses class to mean nothing more than that group of people who came to the colony as convicts and ignores all social and national divisions within this category. It is misleading to clothe the convicts in the aura of class struggle since for its first fifty years Australia did not have a class structure, but only a deformed stratification which had itself been vomited up by the maelstrom which was delineating class in Britain. If a class formula must be given to the majority of the convicts it must be lumpen-proletariat or petit- bourgeoisie” McQueen, 1968&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;}}

In the article, McQueen doubted the authenticity of a [[democracy|democratic]] and [[egalitarian]] tradition emanating from Australia’s [[convict]] history. He challenged the egalitarian aspect of the tradition, highlighting the prominence of racism in convict society.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===''A New Britannia''===

{{Quote box

[[File:McQueen at Manning House 2018.jpg|thumb|McQueen giving a lecture at Manning House, 2018]]

In 1970, McQueen wrote ''A New Britannia'', an historical analysis of the emergence and development of the Australian labour movement. It influentially &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; argued that the history of the Australian labour movement, from colonisation to [[Australian federation]] (1788-1901), should be understood as an extension of [[Imperialism]] &lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V I 1899/1964, The Development of Capitalism in Russia, Progress Publishers, Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[British Empire]]. The argument challenged existing account of the labour movement emerging from the Australian Old Left, which had mythologised the nation-building and democratic nature of the movement. In seeking to challenge accounts of Australian history presented in the Old Left, McQueen established the grounds to contest the Whig tradition in Australian scholarship.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; He identified that British imperialism cannot be separated from the experience of capitalism in Australia, and that Australian identity should be reconsidered in light of the role that racism and [[Patriarchy]] had played in development of the Australian labour movement.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Together with an application of British New Left theorists, [[Perry Anderson]] &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, P 1964, “The Origins of the Present Crisis”, New Left Review, Vol. 23, viewed 16 September 2016, {{cite web |url=https://newleftreview.org/I/23/perry-anderson-origins-of-the-present-crisis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420151214/https://newleftreview.org/I/23/perry-anderson-origins-of-the-present-crisis |archivedate=20 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Nairn]],&lt;ref&gt;Nairn, T 1964, “The Nature of the Labour Party”, New Left Review, Vol. 27, No. 38, viewed 29 September 2016, {{cite web |url=https://newleftreview.org/I/27/tom-nairn-the-nature-of-the-labour-party-part-i |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420160707/https://newleftreview.org/I/27/tom-nairn-the-nature-of-the-labour-party-part-i |archivedate=20 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the approach redefined the nature of Australian historical enquiry, which would prove to be influential in the discipline of history.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Receptions of the book were mixed. Terry Irving in reviewing A New Britannia, highlighted the work’s theoretical legacy, but also the need to produce a more developed theoretical engagement. He stated that A New Britannia “Will provoke angry discussion, but I hope it will also provoke the new left to develop the methodology necessary to write a new history”.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, T 1970, “Head-Standing”, Bulletin, 12 Dec, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; This observation would influence the development of another hallmark of the Australian New Left, [[Class Structure in Australian History]].&lt;ref&gt;Irving, T &amp; Connell, R 1979, Class Structure in Australian History, Longman Cheshire, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">'''Hyperdescent''' is the practice of classifying a child of mixed [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] ancestry in the more socially dominant of the [[parent]]s' races.

Hyperdescent is the opposite of [[hypodescent]] (the practice of classifying a child of mixed race ancestry in the more socially subordinate parental race). Both hyperdescent and hypodescent vary from, and may not be mutually exclusive with, other methods of determining lineage, such as [[patrilineality]] and [[matrilineality]].

== Examples ==

=== Australia ===
Until well into the 20th century, Australian state and federal governments engaged in a program of forcibly separating Aboriginal children with white ancestry from their [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal]] families, and raising them in institutions that were intended to prepare them for [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|white]] foster homes, jobs under white employers and/or marriage to whites.

This occurred according to theories of hyperdescent that were popular among white people. These ideas were not usually shared by Aboriginal people.  White politicians and officials utilised [[pseudo-scientific]] theories that Aboriginal people were genetically and culturally inferior to whites, and were becoming extinct. These authorities believed that it was therefore improper for part-white children to live as Aboriginal people.

It was also widely believed that if Aboriginal people whose descendants had children with whites for several generations, successive generations of descendants would be less and less  distinguishable from whites.

In Australia, while there were many racist laws intended to keep Aboriginal people in a socially inferior position, there were no anti-[[miscegenation]] laws and hence no barriers to marriages between Aboriginal and white partners.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Pilkington &amp; Nugi Garimara, ''Follow the Rabbit-proof Fence'', University of Queensland Press, 1996 (republished as ''Rabbit-proof Fence'' in 2002 and 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Australian] Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's "[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/ Bringing Them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071017222211/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/ |date=2007-10-17 }}" (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2011|reason=It is entirely unclear which statements in this paragraph are verifiable with which source and where in those sources.}}

=== Latin America ===

==== Brazil ====
[[Brazil]] is an example of a country with a history of European [[slavery]] of black Africans somewhat analogous to that of the [[United States of America]]. However, in the United States, hypodescent was applied, gradually classifying anyone with [[African American]] ancestry as black, specifically in [[one-drop rule]] laws passed in Virginia and other states in the 20th century. In Brazil, by contrast, people of mixed race who were fair-skinned or were educated and of higher economic classes were accepted into the elite. Thomas E. Skidmore, in ''Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought'' explains that many of the Brazilian elite encouraged a national process of "whitening" through [[miscegenation]]. Skidmore writes (p.&amp;nbsp;55): "In fact, miscegenation did not arouse the instinctive opposition of the white elite in Brazil. On the contrary, it was a well-recognized (and tacitly condoned) process by which a few mixed bloods (almost invariably light [[mulattoes]]) had risen to the top of the social and political hierarchy."

==== Hispanic America ====
Hyperdescent is the rule in the rest of [[Latin America]] as well. The [[mestizo]] populations of Latin America usually consider themselves to be of European culture rather than [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]. This is also apparent in the [[United States]], where the practice of hypodescent is the rule among the non-Hispanic population contrasting with hyperdescent among Hispanics. Nearly half of U.S. Hispanics called themselves "white" in the 2000 Census, along with 80% of the population of Puerto Rico. Non-Hispanics, on the other hand, if they are of mixed race, will usually call themselves white only if they are a small fraction (1/8 or 1/16) American Indian, but otherwise will claim being of mixed race or even of the minority race. In the 2000 Census, of 35,305,818 Hispanics, only 407,073 (or just over 1%) called themselves American Indian, and only 2,224,082 (just over 6%) claimed to be of mixed race, even though these Hispanic groups (such as Mexicans) are majority mestizo in their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P008&amp;-format=&amp;-CONTEXT=dt|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 41.2% of U.S. Hispanics identify as "Some other race" as of 2006, but government agencies which do not recognize "Some other race" (such as the [[FBI]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and the [[National Center for Health Statistics|NCHS]]) include this group, and therefore over 90% of Hispanics, within the white population. In such cases, such as with the NCHS, separate statistics are often kept for "White" (which includes whites and over 90% of Hispanics) and "non-Hispanic white".

=== Iceland ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Another example of hyperdescent is in [[Iceland]], which was initially populated by [[Norsemen]], who took with them slaves from [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Ancient Britons]], including some women.

Modern [[Icelanders]] are considered to be a [[Scandinavia]]n people ethnically, although many of the founding generations were Irish, Scots, or English women.

The '''International Society for Justice Research''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] scholarly scientific organization dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of [[justice]] and the related phenomena of [[morality]] and [[ethics]].  ISJR fosters international and interdisciplinary collaboration and promotes the exchange of new ideas, research, and theories related to justice and these related phenomena. ISJR facilitates such collaboration and exchange and the dissemination of knowledge through the publication of an [[academic journal]] [http://www.springerlink.com/content/104973/ Social Justice Research], the conduct of biennial scientific conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isjr.org/conference/ | title=ISJR Conference 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; regular newsletters, and informal discussion by means of a listserv. Through these activities ISJR connects scholars in a wide variety of disciplines and geographic locations who are all focused on the study of justice.  Scholars from a host of fields, including [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[ethology]] and animal behavior, [[history]], [[law]] and others are represented among the society's membership.

==History==

Early steps towards the establishment of ISJR were taken when the social psychologist [[Melvin J. Lerner]] accepted the Cleveringa Chair at the University of Leiden in 1984. His visit and the exchanges it facilitated led to a First International Conference on Social Justice in Human Relations, organized by Riel Vermunt in Leiden in 1986.

A Second International Conference followed in 1988, again organized by Riel Vermunt in Leiden, at which the idea of a research center took shape, furthered in particular by Melvin Lerner, Herman Steensma, and Riel Vermunt. In 1989, a Center for Social Justice Research was formed cooperatively between the Universities of Leiden, Waterloo and Utrecht, with Melvin Lerner as director, and Piet Hermkens and Riel Vermunt as associate directors.

Further International Conferences were held in Utrecht, Netherlands (1991), Trier, Germany (1993), and Reno, NV, USA (1995), before at a sixth conference in Potsdam, Germany, in 1997, Leo Montada was charged with transforming the scientific network into an institutionalized association: the International Society for Justice Research. Founding members of ISJR were Ron Cohen, Karen Cook, Ron Dillehay, Russel Hardin, Melvin Lerner, Gerold Mikula, Leo Montada (founding president), Tom Tyler, and Riel Vermunt.

==Aims of the Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://isjr.org | title=International Society for Justice Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

Questions about justice, which have occupied many scholars across different scientific disciplines for centuries, are ubiquitous in interpersonal relations, within and between communities, social groups, organizations, and states. They are at the core of social conflicts and essential for sustainable conflict resolutions. Given the importance of justice issues in everyday life, ISJR was founded with the aim of advancing justice research in every way. Its mission is to further three main goals:

# To provide biennial scientific meetings and further opportunities for the scientific exchange of theoretical developments and recent research on justice-related issues 
# To foster productive discussions of new ideas, basic and applied research, and theories relevant to justice 
# To facilitate international and interdisciplinary cooperation in justice theory and research.

==Meetings==

The society meets biennially as a forum for the exchange and discussion of knowledge related to the multiple facets of justice and fairness. Information about upcoming and past meetings is available at http://www.isjr.org/conference/

==Journal==

The journal ''Social Justice Research''&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/journal/11211&lt;/ref&gt; (SJR) was founded in 1987 by Melvin Lerner to publish work related to the growing field. The journal is published quarterly.

''Social Justice Research'' is abstracted and indexed in the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 0.796.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2017 |chapter=Social Justice Research |title=2016 Journal Citation Reports |publisher=[[Clarivate Analytics]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]]|title-link=Journal Citation Reports }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is explicitly interdisciplinary, covering research from psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, social policy research, political science, law, management science, and other fields that relates to the origins, structures, and consequences of justice in human affairs.

==Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isjr.org/awards/ | title=ISJR Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

The ISJR Lifetime Achievement Award is presented bi-annually to honor distinguished lifetime contributions to the scientific study of justice and for efforts to advance justice as a field of study.

The ISJR Early Career Contribution Award is presented bi-annually to an accomplished young researcher in order to foster, encourage, and support excellence in justice-related scholarship.

The Morton Deutsch Award is presented annually for the best article published in the society’s journal, ''Social Justice Research'', every year, with preference given to contributions from investigators who are early in their research careers. The award is named after one of the society’s most prolific and influential contributors, [[Morton Deutsch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9548">{{About|a software system used for planning||Jade (disambiguation)}}

'''Joint Assistant for Development and Execution (JADE)''' is a [[U.S. military]] system used for planning the deployment of military forces in crisis situations.&lt;ref name="JADE-2001"/&gt;

The U.S. military developed this [[Automated planning and scheduling|automated planning]] software system in order to expedite the creation of the detailed planning needed to deploy military forces for a [[military operation]]. JADE uses [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) technology combining user input, a [[knowledge base]] of stored plans, and suggestions by the system to provide the ability to develop large-scale and complex plans in minimal time.

== History ==
In 1999, the operational tool used for managing force deployment planning in the U.S. military was the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). The JADE tool for rapid crisis action planning had been developed by [[BBN Technologies]] under a contract to [[DARPA]] within the ARPA-Rome Planning Initiative, but was available only in a prototype environment.&lt;ref name="JADE-1999"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alice M. Mulvehill |author2=Joseph A. Caroli |title=JADE: A Tool for Rapid Crisis Action Planning|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a458570.pdf|publisher=[[Defense Technical Information Center|Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, JADE was successfully demonstrated&lt;ref name="JADE-2001"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alice M. Mulvehill |author2=Clinton Hyde |author3=David Rager |title=Joint Assistant for Development and Execution (JADE)|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA398021|type=PDF download; [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235135366_Joint_Assistant_for_Development_and_Execution_(JADE) the abstract is available from [[ResearchGate]]]|publisher=[[Defense Technical Information Center|Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=24}} and then integrated into the [[Global Command and Control System]] (GCCS) and the Adaptive Course of Action (ACOA) environment while meeting the requirements of the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII-COE).

An official 2016 document approved for public release titled ''Human Systems Roadmap Review'' describes plans to create autonomous weapon systems that analyze social media and make decisions, including the use of lethal force, with minimal human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. John Tangney|title=Human Systems Roadmap Review|url=http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/NDIA_Human_Systems_Conference_2016_HSCOI_DistroA_FINAL.pdf|publisher=Defense Innovation Marketplace|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of system is referred to as a [[Lethal autonomous weapon|Lethal Autonomous Weapon System]] (LAWS).

The name "JADE" comes from the [[Jade (color)|jade green color]] seen on the island of [[Oahu, Hawaii|Oahu]] in [[Hawaii]] where the U.S. [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]] (PACOM) is headquartered.&lt;ref name="JADE-2001"/&gt;{{rp|page=1}}

JFRG II will be replaced with JADE.

* ForMAT (Force Management and Analysis Tool) – a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) force deployment planning tool that uses past experience (past planned Force modules (FMs)); the tool was developed initially by [[The MITRE Corporation]], and then developed further by [[BBN Technologies]]
* Prodigy-Analogy – a combined case-based reasoning and generative planner with a multi-strategy planning and learning architecture developed by [[Carnegie Mellon University]]
* PARKA – a highly indexed [[Knowledge-based systems|knowledge-based]] management system developed by the [[University of Maryland]]

== Features ==
JADE uses [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) technology with [[Case-based reasoning|case-based]] and generative planning methods to provide the ability to develop large-scale and complex [[Military operation plan|plans]] in minimal time. JADE is a [[Knowledge-based systems|knowledge-based]] system that uses highly structured information that takes advantage of data hierarchies. JADE uses dialog initiated both by the user and by the system. JADE is used to rapidly create [[Time Phased Force Deployment Data]] (TPFDD) to organize the deployment of combat-ready forces.&lt;ref name="JADE-2001"/&gt;{{rp|pages=1–2}}  Case-based planning methods (also known as the variant approach) use an existing plan for a similar mission and make the necessary modifications to the plan for the new mission. Generative planning methods build new plans from the mission goals and requirements by means of [[Automated planning and scheduling#Algorithms for planning|planning algorithms]] and the [[knowledge base]].

JADE supports the retrieval and reuse of previous plan elements for use in the development of new plans by using a map-oriented [[drag and drop]] interface. Force modules (FMs) from previous plans (cases) can be dragged from the case library and dropped onto a geographic destination. To support plan adaption of previous plans or modifications resulting from changing mission requirements, constraint checking against the knowledge base and mission goals causes automatic reminders from the system to notify the user of changes and improvements that need to be made. JADE is a mixed-initiative system, using dialog initiated by both the user (user-initiative) and by the system (system-initiative).

The knowledge base supports the development of deployment plans for war and situations other than war. JADE is designed to inter-operate with the Adaptive Course of Action (ACOA) program, which provides a near real-time distributed collaborative environment that supports end-to-end joint planning by multiple command centers.&lt;ref name="JADE-2001"/&gt;{{rp|pages=21–23}} The Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) produced by JADE included an Operational Plan (OPLAN) which describes the mission and specifies where and when the forces involved in a mission are to be deployed. The TPFDD also specifies the combat forces and the combat service support required in order to support the mission, which includes transportation phasing, mode, and geographical locations.

== Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) ==

"Time Phased Force Deployment Data" (TPFDD) is a U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) term. A TPFDD is the [[data base]] portion of an [[Military operation plan|operation plan]] in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES); this system is part of the [[Global Command and Control System]] (GCCS). The TPFDD contains data on [[military unit]]s and forces regarding force data as scheduled over time, data for cargo and personnel that are not part of the units, and movement data for the operation plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=time-phased force and deployment data|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/glossarytermst/g/t6400.htm|website=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of the United States Department of Defense military term "time-phased force and deployment data"|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5459|website=MilitaryFactory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data regarding military units in the TPFDD include:
* Units that are already in-place
* Units deploying to support the operation plan, including a priority for the desired sequencing
* Routing and movement data associated with forces that are being deployed
* Estimates of non-unit-related cargo and personnel movements that occur concurrently with the deployment of forces
* Estimates of transportation requirements using common-user resources and resources assigned or attached

'''Jacob Mchangama''' (born 1978) is a Danish lawyer, human-rights expert, and social commentator who is the founder and director of Justitia, a Copenhagen think tank focusing on human rights and the rule of law. For six years he served as chief legal counsel at [[CEPOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/profiles/jacob-mchangama|title=Jacob Mchangama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob Mchangama  Director of Legal Affairs, Center for Political Studies|url=https://www.fed-soc.org/experts/detail/jacob-mchangama|publisher=The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

In 2003, he received a cand.jur. degree from the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 2004, after studying in [[Venice]] and [[Strasbourg]], he received a degree in human rights and democratization from the [[European Inter-University Centre]].

==Career==

He was an assistant professor in International Human Rights at the University of Copenhagen from 2005 to 2007, and an adjunct professor there from 2007 to 2012.

From 2004 to 2007 he was a paralegal at Evershes. From 2007 to 2008 he was an attorney at Plesner. From 2008 to 2014 he was a chief legal counsel at CEPOS. He founded Justicia in 2014, and has been its director since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justitia-int.org/om-justitia/jacob-mchangama/|title=Jacob Mchangama|date=18 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hecklen|first1=Alexander|title=Tænketank: Bandeforbud er op ad bakke|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/taenketank-bandeforbud-er-op-ad-bakke|publisher=DR Forsiden|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reported in August 2011 that the European left was using the recent mass murder in Norway “to argue for limiting free speech” on the grounds that certain speech “can lead to murder.”  Mchangama strongly challenged this premise.

In a February 2012 article, he maintained that “the combination of a debt crisis, an aging population addicted to public welfare benefits, one and a half decades of low growth rates, and increasing competition...is revealing the dark underbelly of welfarism” in Denmark. “It is not an overstatement,” he claimed, “to say that the balance between the state and the individual has been shifted decisively in favor of the state.” Because of a growing need for higher tax income, the Danish government was now harassing citizens in ways that violated their rights, and was dangerously skewing “the balance between public welfare and the free market...in favour of the former,” thus revealing the tendency of the welfare state to eat away at “the capitalist foundation which sustains it” and the fact that welfare ultimately “comes not only at the expense of economic freedom but also individual freedom and choice.”&lt;ref name="nationalreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/290659/welfare-state-and-freedom-mismatch-jacob-mchangama|title=The Welfare State and Freedom: A Mismatch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 Mchangama dismissed the “putative consensus” around [[UN Human Rights Counsil Resolution 16/18]], which was seen as resolving divisions between free-speech advocates and those who would criminalize defamation of religion, as a “charade.” While the US saw the resolution as affrming First Amendment-style speech rights, Pakistan saw it as banning “advocacy of religious hatred.” In the middle were Europeans, who, Mchangama pointed out, were often eager to defend Islam from criticism. While praising the US for “standing firm on the need to counter intolerance and hatred through debate rather than censorship,” Mchangama called on the US to vigorously confront other interpretations of R 16/18.&lt;ref name="nationalreview.com"/&gt;

A February 2015 essay on the 26th anniversary of the fatwa against [[Salman Rushdie]] criticized the widespread notion that “free speech should not be 'abused' to insult the religious convictions of minorities,” and cited a recent speech by Barack Obama stating that when “we defend the legal right of a person to insult another’s religion, we’re equally obligated to use our free speech to condemn such insults.” Mchangama challenged this view, noting a recent London demo by Muslims who “were perfectly happy to exercise their right to free speech and association” but whose “core message was that those very rights should be denied to those with whom they disagree, and that insult to religious feelings is a kind of extremism not too dissimilar from that of the murder of cartoonists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/413802/we-need-defend-right-offend-jacob-mchangama|title=We Need to Defend the Right to Offend|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2, 2015, [[Wall Street Journal]] op-ed, Mchangama lamented the “long-running pattern” in Europe “of bending to Islamist 'outrage' instead of defending free speech for all.” He noted with dismay that Denmark's current prime minister, [[Helle Thorning Schmidt]], had demanded in 2006 that then-Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] distance himself from the Jyllands-Posten cartoons, that the Danish newspaper Politiken had agreed to a 2010 settlement in which it apologized for offending Muslims by reprinting Muhammed cartoons, and that Denmark’s former minister of foreign affairs, Uffe Ellemann Jensen, had expressed no sympathy for cartoonist Lars Vilks after an attempt on his life, saying that Vilks “had asked and begged to be attacked.” Mchangama warned against the rise of “offense creep,” whereby jihadists were being permitted to limit debate, and urged the democratic West to push back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jacob-mchangama-defending-denmark-against-offense-creep-1425327366|title=Defending Denmark Against ‘Offense Creep’|first=Jacob|last=Mchangama|date=2 March 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, writing for [[The Washington Post]], Mchangama called for Denmark to end its law of banning blasphemy. He noted that, while Denmark ranked first in the 2016 "Rule of Law Index," the country shares a ban on blasphemy similar to that of countries like Iran and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mchangama|first1=Jacob|title=It’s time to end Denmark’s blasphemy ban|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/04/24/its-time-to-end-denmarks-blasphemy-ban/|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, writing for [[Quillette]], Mchangama wrote about the decline of free speech in cyberspace, pointing to recent policies changes by Facebook and Twitter which had previously been strong advocates of free speech. He noted that these companies had previously adopted the American model 'viewpoint diversity' but then switched to the European model of "'balancing' free speech against competing interests". He noted the various inconsistencies in the application of such rules, such as the ban on [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] while denying [[Armenian Genocide|the American genocide]] remains tolerated. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quillette.com/2018/10/22/the-death-of-the-first-amendment-in-cyberspace/|title=The Death of the First Amendment in Cyberspace - Quillette|date=2018-10-22|work=Quillette|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==

Mchangama received the Venstre Party's Freedom Prize in 2013 for his involvement in the public debate about rights in Denmark and abroad. In his acceptance speech, Mchangama underscored that freedom and democracy do not come naturally – they need to be fought for as hard in a country like Denmark as in any other part of the world. “No one has won freedom by being silent.”

'''Kritarchy''', also called '''kritocracy''' or '''dikastocracy''', is a system of rule by [[Biblical judges|judges]] ({{lang-he-n|שופטים}}, ''shoftim'') in the tribal confederacy of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]] during the period of time described in the [[Book of Judges]], following [[Joshua]]'s conquest of [[Canaan]] and prior to the united monarchy under [[Saul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/kritarchy Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because it is a compound of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words [[:wikt:κριτής|κριτής]], ''krites'' ("judge") and [[:wikt:ἄρχω|ἄρχω]], ''árkhō'' ("to rule"), its use has expanded to cover rule by [[judge]]s in the modern sense as well, as in the case of [[Somalia]], ruled by judges with the [[polycentric law|polycentric  legal]] tradition of [[xeer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=126 A Peaceful Ferment in Somalia: Publications: The Independent Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably the [[Islamic Courts Union]]{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} and in the fictional regime of [[Mega-City One|Mega-city One]], the focus of setting for the [[Judge Dredd]] franchise.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3029, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Landsturm angetreten.jpg|thumb|White ''Landsturm'' in [[German East Africa]], [[World War I]]]]

In German-speaking countries, the term '''''Landsturm''''' was historically used to refer to [[militia]] or military units composed of troops of inferior quality. It is particularly associated with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]].

== Austria ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] ''Landsturm'' was a [[Military reserve force|reserve force]] that consisted of men aged 34 to 55. It was intended to provide replacements for the front line units and provide a militia for local defense. It was divided into the Austrian K.u.K. (''Kaiserlich und Königlich'', "Imperial and Royal") Landsturm and the Hungarian Kgl. (''Königlich'', "Royal") Landsturm.

During the [[First World War]], the Austrian Landsturm formed 40 regiments totaling 136 battalions in Austria and the Hungarian Landsturm formed 32 regiments totaling 97 battalions. They provided 20 Brigades who took to the field with the rest of the army.

== Germany ==

=== Prussia from 1813 ===
In Prussia after the {{ill|Prussian Army Reform|de|Preußische Heeresreform}} of 21 April 1813 all the male population from ages 15 to 60 who were capable of military service, who were not in the [[standing army]] or the ''[[Landwehr]]'', had to respond to the orders of the ''Landsturm''. It effectively formed the last national military reserve.

King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] established the [[Prussia]]n ''Landsturm'' as [[irregular military]] forces on 21 April 1813 by royal [[edict]] – the decree appeared in the ''{{ill|Preußische Gesetzessammlung||de}}'' (German: Prussian Code of Law) (pp.&amp;nbsp;79–89). The 1813 edict called for resistance "by any means" against the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] invasion. As a model and an explicit example, it took the Spanish ''[[Reglamento de Partidas y Cuadrillas]]'' of 28 December 1808 and the decree of 17 April 1809, known as ''[[Corso Terrestre]]'', during the [[Peninsula War]] against Napoleonic troops (ref. the introduction, §8, §52).

According to this edict, all Prussian citizens were obliged to oppose the invasion by the enemy using any weapons available, like [[axe]]s, [[pitchfork]]s, [[scythe]]s or [[shotgun]]s (§43). All Prussians were further encouraged to not obey orders by the enemy, but rather to make themselves a nuisance to the Napoleonic troops however possible. This was a clear departure from ordinary ''[[jus in bello]]'' ([[Latin Language|Latin]] for Law of War), which commanded the [[civilian]] population to obey the orders of the occupying power, and the police forces to assist the occupying power in crushing any uprising. It did not qualify as an [[insurgency]], but simply as [[criminal]] activity. The ''Landsturm'' edict explicitly stated that it was preferable to risk the danger brought about by the furies of an armed population rather than to let the enemy have control over the situation. ''[[Légitime défense]]'' "justified the use of all means" (§7), including chaos.

The edict was modified less than three months later on 17 July 1813 and was purified of its subversive content relative to the [[laws of war]]. The war then took place according to the standard rules of [[conventional warfare]]. [[Carl Schmitt]] qualified it as the "[[Magna Carta]] of the [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]". Despite its not being put to practice, [[Fascism|fascist]] jurists considered it in a 1962 lecture in [[Francoist Spain]] to be the "official document of the legitimation of the partisan of national defense" and as the "philosophical discovery of the partisan."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Schmitt]], 1963. ''Theorie des Partisanen. Zwischenbemerkung zum Begriff des Politischen'', Chapter I, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North German Confederation from 1867 ===
The [[North German Confederation]] Act of 9 November 1867 about the obligation for wartime military service and the Reich law about the ''Landsturm'' of 12 February 1875 restricted the obligation to the period from 17 to 42 years of age.

===Bavaria from 1868===
In the [[Bavarian Army]] the oldest ages for [[compulsory military service]] since the [[Bavarian Army Reform (1868)|army reform of 1868]] was referred to as the ''Landsturm''.
&lt;!--
===[[Lübeck]] seit 1814===
In Lübeck bezeichnete der Begriff ''Landsturm'' im Unterschied zum üblichen Gebrauch die [[Landwehr (Militär)|Landwehr]], einen Bestandteil der [[Lübecker Bürgergarde]], der das Wehraufgebot im Umland der Stadt darstellte.

=== Deutsches Reich 1875 ===
Im Deutschen Reich bestand der Landsturm aus allen Wehrpflichtigen vom vollendeten 17. bis zum vollendeten 42. Lebensjahr,&lt;ref&gt;Kaiserliches 'Gesetz über den Landsturm' vom 12. Februar 1875; Deutsches Reichsgesetzblatt Band 1875, Nr. 7, Seite 63 - 64 [[s:Gesetz über den Landsturm|Scan auf Commons]]&lt;/ref&gt; sofern sie nicht im Heer oder in der Marine dienten. Der Aufruf hatte durch kaiserliche Verordnung zu erfolgen.

Mit dem ''Gesetz, betreffend Änderungen der Wehrpflicht'' vom 11. Februar 1888&lt;ref&gt;Reichsgesetzblatt 1888, S. 11 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; gab es zwei Aufgebote: der Landsturm I umfasste alle Männer bis zum 39. Lebensjahr, der Landsturm II alle Älteren. § 24 des Gesetzes verlängerte die Landsturmpflicht bis zum 45. Lebensjahr. Die bereits in [[Deutsches Heer (Deutsches Kaiserreich)|Heer]] oder [[Kaiserliche Marine|Marine]] ausgebildeten Angehörigen des Landsturms wurden unmittelbar dem aktiven Dienst zugeführt, während alle unausgebildeten zunächst einer [[Musterung]] und [[Aushebung]] unterworfen wurden. Deshalb mussten sich alle Männer der entsprechenden Jahrgänge nach dem Aufruf in die heimatliche Landsturmrolle eintragen lassen.

Im Kriegsfall konnte der Landsturm zur Ergänzung des Heeres und der Marine herangezogen werden und auch außerhalb Deutschlands eingesetzt werden.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. allgemein: ''Landsturm'' in: Wörterbuch zur Deutschen Militärgeschichte, Militärverlag der DDR, Berlin (Ost) 1985, S. 463; § 20 der ''Deutschen Wehrordnung'' vom 22. November 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mit der [[Mobilmachung]] am 1. August 1914 wurden viele Landsturm-[[Verband (Militär)|Verbände]] aufgestellt und mobil gemacht, im Laufe des [[Erster Weltkrieg|Ersten Weltkriegs]] noch weitere&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Siehe z. B. [[Württembergisches Landsturm-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 13]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Im weiteren Kriegsverlauf kamen außerdem bereits ab 1915 viele im Frieden dem Landsturm zugeteilte Wehrpflichtige ([[Ungedienter Landsturm]]) vor allem jüngerer Jahrgänge als Personalersatz zu Front-Truppenteilen.

Durch die fehlende oder geringe militärische Ausbildung und körperliche Eignung gab die Bezeichnung 'Landsturm' in der zeitgenössischen Gesellschaft nicht selten Anlass zu Spott&lt;ref&gt;Bild aus der Illustrirten Zeitung von Dezember 1914[http://www.altearmee.de/hilfe/landsturm/landsturm3.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In February 1808, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] invaded [[Sweden–Finland|Swedish Finland]] and on March 14 [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark-Norway]] declared war on Sweden, starting the [[Finnish War]]. On the very same day of the Danish declaration of war, [[Gustav IV Adolf]], the Swedish king, issue a decree that ordered the formation of a new military unit, called ''Lantvärnet'', which is the Swedish name for ''landwehr''. The decree stated that all able unmarried men between 18 and 25 would become eligible to be conscripted for service in lantvärnet. The plan was that lantvärnet would consist of 60,000 men, almost at par with the standing army that numbered 66,000 men. However, in reality, lantvärnet consisted of only circa 30,000 men. The soldiers of lantvärnet were poorly equipped and they only received their pay on an irregular basis. This led to low morale amongst the men. After the war had ended the common people had a very negative view on lantvärnet and conscription. Lantvärnet was abolished in 1811. Some believe that the popular resistance against conscription caused by the neagtive experiences of lantvärnet lived on for many years and was one of the main causes that Sweden didn't reintroduce [[Conscription in Sweden|conscription]] until 1901.

In 1885, the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]] passed a law that formed ''Landstormen''. All able Swedish males between 27 and 32 would serve in landstormen as a territorial defence force in case of war. Landstormen however then only existed in theory and lacked any organization, only in the case of war were the [[Swedish Army]] to prepare plans and organizations for the landstorm. In 1892 the law was changed, and all men between 33 and 40 would serve in Landstormen in case of war. In 1901 Sweden introduced conscription, and became a proper second line unit, organizing the elder conscripted men (those between 33 and 40), and were tasked with territorial defence as well as securing the mobilization of the field army. In 1914 the law was changed and landstormen was to organize all men between 35 and 42. Also a mandatory 5 days refresher training was mandated for all those that belonged to landstormen. During [[World War I]], Landstormen was frequently mobilized to secure the [[Swedish neutrality]].

Landstormen was again mobilized during [[World War II]]. In 1942 the Swedish Army went through a major re-organization and landstormen was abolished and incorporated into the regular army.

== Switzerland ==
In the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]], the Landsturm was, until 1995, the third age class (men from 42 - 50) after the Elite (men from 18 - 32) and the Landwehr (men from 32 - 42).

'''Lesko uprising''' ({{lang-pl|Powstanie leskie}}), which took place in June and July 1932, was an uprising of peasantry in the [[Bieszczady Mountains]], against the local authorities of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The impoverished peasants mistook the government introduction of [[public works]] aimed at stemming the [[Great Crisis]] as an attempt to reintroduce [[serfdom]]. First clashes occurred on June 21, over the next weeks thousands of people became involved across the Bieszczady region (primarily around the town of [[Lesko]]), as Polish police and military put down the unrest. The uprising ended on 9 July, with about a dozen dead, many wounded and a few hundred peasants arrested. 

== Causes of the uprising ==
The uprising was directly connected with the idea of a local [[magnate]], Count Jan Potocki of [[Rymanow]], who suggested that local residents should take part in public works project. In the area of Rymanow the idea was widely accepted, as local [[Lemkos]] respected Potocki, and joined the project, whose purpose was to improve infrastructure - roads, bridges, schools. The situation was different in the Bieszczady Mountains, where the [[Starosta]] of [[Lesko]] tried to introduce Potocki’s idea. On June 19, 1932, a meeting of Potocki and local officials took place at [[Ustrzyki Dolne]], during which an Organizational Committee was created. 

Next meeting took place on June 21, at [[Brzegi Dolne]]. Among its participants was engineer Stefan Zieba, who urged peasants to join the public works. In response, Mykola Werebenec, the son of a local [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] parish priest claimed that Potocki’s idea was in fact an attempt to reintroduce serfdom. The meeting turned into a heated argument, and then into a riot, in which peasants, armed with sticks and pickaxes, surrounded the officials. Altogether, 39 people were arrested, including 4 women. Some other sources claim that the peasants were egged on by members of [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]], who spread rumour that serfdom would be brought back. 

The arrest of 39 peasants echoed in the area, and soon afterwards, residents of local villages, such as [[Telesnica Oszwarowa]], [[Lobozew Dolny]], [[Lobozew Gorny]], [[Bobrka, Lesko County|Bobrka]] joined the rebellion. Their struggle was supported by parish priests.

== The uprising ==
Among organizers of the uprising were such individuals, as Piotr Madej, Stanislaw Lenkiewicz, Wladyslaw Nowicki, Mikolaj Malecki, Stanislaw Drozd, Antoni Paclawski and Iwan Bucio. Peasants were armed with axes, pickaxes, rakes and scythes. They were faced by reinforced police units, as well as soldiers of the [[Polish Army]] garrison in [[Przemyśl]]. First clash took place at Brzegi Dolne on June 23, after which several arrests took place. 

In the following days clashes took place at several other villages. At Lobozew, some 2,000 peasants fought the police and the soldiers, with five casualties. Urged by the police to disperse, the peasants stated that they would go home only if police units were withdrawn from Lobozow. As the situation did not improve, the starosta of Lesko informed the [[Voivode]] of [[Lwow Voivodeship]], asking him for help. As a result, Polish Army sent the 2nd Regiment of [[Podhale]] Rifles from [[Sanok]], mounted and foot police units from Przemysl, [[Sambir|Sambor]], Sanok and [[Mosty Wielkie]], as well as a squadron of [[Polish Airforce]]. 

The uprising spread to villages from the counties of [[Dobromyl|Dobromil]], Sanok and [[Turka, Lviv Oblast|Turka]]. Armed peasants fought four skirmishes with the police and the soldiers, near the villages of Lobozew, Telesnica Oszwarowa and Bobrka. Since government forces were armed with machine guns, the insurgents withdrew southwards, in the sparsely populated hills. They were followed by the army units, which pacified the peasants.

== Outcome ==
Altogether, up to 800 people were arrested, out of some 5,000 participants from 19 villages. The exact number of casualties has not been established. In the historiography of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the Lesko uprising was regarded as a popular insurrection against oppressive capitalists. A monument commemorating the event was erected in the village of [[Bóbrka, Lesko County|Bóbrka]].

[[File:Per capita GDP of South Asian economies &amp; SKorea (1950-1995).png|350px|thumb|The stagnant "[[Hindu rate of growth]]" is often attributed to the Licence Raj policies.]]
The '''Licence Raj''' or '''Permit Raj''' (''rāj'', meaning "rule" in [[Hindi]])&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989: from [[Sanskrit|Skr.]]  ''rāj'': to reign, rule; cognate with [[Latin|L.]] ''rēx'', ''rēg-is'', [[Old Irish|OIr.]] ''rī'', ''rīg'' king (see RICH).&lt;/ref&gt; is the elaborate system of [[Industrial licensing in India|licences]], regulations and accompanying [[red tape]] that were required to set up and run businesses in [[India]] between 1947 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm Street Hawking Promise Jobs in Future] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329023451/http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm |date=March 29, 2008 }}, ''[[The Times of India]]'', 2001-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Licence Raj was a result of the [[First Nehru ministry|Nehru government]]'s decision to have a [[planned economy]] where all aspects of the economy are controlled by the state and licences are given to a select few.&lt;ref name="Nehru"/&gt; Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something and, if granted, the government would regulate production.&lt;ref name="bbcindia1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/55427.stm|title=India: the economy|year=1998|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic liberalisation in India|Reforms since the mid-1980s]] have significantly reduced regulation, but [[Indian labour laws]] still prevent manufacturers from reducing their workforce without prohibitive burdens.

==Term==
The term plays off "[[British Raj]]", the period of British rule in India. It was coined by Indian [[freedom fighters of India|freedom fighter]] and [[politician|statesman]] [[C. Rajagopalachari|Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]], who firmly opposed it for its potential for [[political corruption]] and economic stagnation and founded the [[Swatantra Party]] to oppose these practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Swatantra Party and Indian Conservatism|isbn=978-0-521-04980-1|page=131|year=2007|authorlink=H.L. Erdman|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his newspaper, Rajagopalachari wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want the corruptions of the Permit/Licence Raj to go. [...] I want the officials appointed to administer laws and policies to be free from pressures of the bosses of the ruling party, and gradually restored back to the standards of fearless honesty which they once maintained. [...] I want real equal opportunities for all and no private monopolies created by the Permit/Licence Raj.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The architect of the system of Licence Raj was [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="Nehru"&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/india.htm THE ECONOMIC HISTORY AND THE ECONOMY OF INDIA] Nehru chose the goal of economic self-sufficiency with economic development to be achieved by central planning modeled on that of the Soviet Union.&lt;/ref&gt; Private players could manufacture goods only with official licences.

The key characteristic of the Licence Raj is a [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] that centrally administers the economy of the country. Like a [[command economy]], India had [[Five-year plans of India|Five-Year Plans]] on the lines of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Arguing that the Planning Commission has outlived its utility, [[Modi government]] disbanded it in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choudhury|first1=Chandrahas|title=India’s central planning gets its eulogy|url=https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/RFFvvK2KIsZ8lzUdgLNP0K/Indias-central-planning-gets-its-eulogy.html|accessdate=11 April 2018|work=https://www.livemint.com/|date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the process of reforms began in 1991, the government attempted to close the Indian economy to the outside world. The Indian currency, the rupee, was inconvertible and high tariffs and import licensing prevented foreign goods reaching the market. India also operated a system of central planning for the economy, in which firms required licences to invest and develop. This bureaucracy often led to absurd restrictions: up to 80 agencies had to be satisfied before a firm could be granted a licence to produce, and, even then, the state would decide what was produced, how much, at what price and what sources of capital were used.

The government also prevented firms from laying off workers or closing factories. The central pillar of the policy was [[import substitution industrialisation]], the belief that countries like India needed to rely on internal markets for development, not international trade, a belief generated by a mixture of socialism and the experience during the colonial period.

==Current status==
{{see also|Economic liberalisation in India}}

The Licence Raj system was in place for four decades. The government of India initiated a liberalisation policy under [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ficci.com/media-room/speeches-presentations/2005/nov/nov17-saarc-somak.htm Address by Mr. Somak Ghosh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519124909/http://www.ficci.com/media-room/speeches-presentations/2005/nov/nov17-saarc-somak.htm |date=2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Narasimha Rao also had the responsibility of industries minister; he is directly responsible for dismantling the Licence Raj.

Liberalisation resulted in substantial growth in the Indian economy, which continues today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/business/25-years-of-liberalisation-a-glimpse-of-indias-growth-in-14-charts-2877654.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Licence Raj is considered to have been significantly reduced in 1991 when India had only two weeks of foreign reserves left. In return for an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] bailout, [[Gold bullion]] was transferred to London as collateral, the Rupee devalued and economic reforms were forced upon India.&lt;ref name="astaire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |title=India Report |publisher=Astaire Research |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824103426/http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government, with  [[Manmohan Singh]] as finance minister, reduced licensing regulations; lowered tariffs, duties and taxes; and opened up to international trade and investment.&lt;ref name="astaire"/&gt;

The reform policies introduced after 1991 removed many economic restrictions. Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all product categories, except for alcohol, tobacco, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. 

On 6 August 2014 the Indian Parliament raised the limit on [[foreign direct investment]] in the defence sector to 49%&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-08-07/news/52555932_1_defence-sector-cent-fdi-railways-sector&lt;/ref&gt; and removed the limit for certain classes of infrastructure projects: high speed railways, including construction, operation and maintenance of high-speed train projects;&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/govt-notifies-fdi-cap-relaxation-in-railways/&lt;/ref&gt; suburban corridor projects through PPP; dedicated freight lines; rolling stock including train sets; locomotives manufacturing and maintenance facilities; railway electrification and signalling systems; freight terminals and passenger terminals; infrastructure in industrial park pertaining to railway line, and mass rapid transport systems.

{{NSA surveillance|1}}

'''MAINWAY''' is a [[database]] maintained by the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) containing [[metadata]] for hundreds of billions of [[telephone call]]s made through the four largest [[telephone company|telephone carriers]] in the United States: [[AT&amp;T]], [[SBC Communications|SBC]], [[BellSouth]] (all three now called AT&amp;T), and [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning journalist [[James Risen]], MAINWAY was the most important of the four components that comprised the [[ThinThread]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szV9BAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pay+Any+Price:+Greed,+Power,+and+Endless+War&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhnIHRpeTWAhUN8YMKHaJwDs4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mainway&amp;f=false|title=Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War|last=Risen|first=James|date=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780544341418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of this database and the NSA program that compiled it was unknown to the general public until ''[[USA Today]]'' broke the story on May 10, 2006.&lt;ref name="USA" /&gt; It is estimated that the database contains over 1.9 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] [[call detail record|call-detail record]]s.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former NSA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], the NSA sought to deploy MAINWAY prior to 9/11 in response to the [[Millennium Plot]] but did not do so because it did not comply with US law. Hayden wrote: "The answer from [the Justice Department] was clear: '...you can't do this.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUz1DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=playing+to+the+edge+hayden&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2u22quTWAhVj1oMKHQO-DjkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22you%20can't%20do%20this%22&amp;f=false|title=Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror|last=Hayden|first=Michael V.|date=2017-02-21|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780143109983|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2013, the database stores metadata for at least five years.&lt;ref name="ab_week"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the NSA uses your telephone records| url=http://theweek.com/article/index/245285/how-the-nsa-uses-your-telephone-records|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records include detailed call information (caller, receiver, date/time of call, length of call, etc.) for use in [[traffic analysis]]&lt;ref name="traffic analysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/evidence_that_t.html|title=Evidence that the NSA Is Storing Voice Content, Not Just Metadata|work=Schneier on Security|first=Bruce|last=Schneier|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=July 18, 2013}} "And, by the way, I hate the term 'metadata.' What's wrong with 'traffic analysis,' which is what we've always called that sort of thing?"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[social network analysis]],&lt;ref name="social network analysis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls|work=USA Today|first=Leslie|last=Cauley|date=May 11, 2006|accessdate=July 18, 2013}} "The data are used for 'social network analysis,' the official said, meaning to study how terrorist networks contact each other and how they are tied together."&lt;/ref&gt; but do not include audio information or transcripts of the content of the phone calls.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The database's existence has prompted fierce objections. It is often viewed as an illegal warrantless search and a violation of the [[pen register]] provisions of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] and (in some cases) the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution]].

The [[George W. Bush administration]] neither confirmed nor denied the existence of the domestic call record database. This contrasts with a related NSA controversy concerning [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless surveillance of selected telephone calls]]; in that case they did confirm the existence of the program of debated legality. That program's code name was [[Stellar Wind (code name)|Stellar Wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174602|title=Now We Know What the Battle Was About|work=Newsweek|date=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar programs exist or are planned in other countries, including Sweden ([[Titan traffic database]]){{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and Great Britain ([[Interception Modernisation Programme]]).

The MAINWAY equivalent for Internet traffic is [[MARINA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/washington-post-provides-new-history-nsa-surveillance-programs|title=Washington Post Provides New History of NSA Surveillance Programs|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet monitoring==
On May 22, 2006, it was revealed by investigative reporter [[Seymour Hersh]] and [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] that the program involved the NSA setting up [[Beam splitter|splitters]] to the routing cores of many telecoms companies and to major Internet traffic hubs. These provided a direct connection via an alleged [[Cabinet noir|"black room"]] known as [[Room 641A]]. This room allows most U.S. telecoms communications and Internet traffic to be redirected to the NSA. The NSA used them to eavesdrop and order police investigations of tens of thousands of ordinary Americans without judicial warrants.

According to a security consultant who worked on the program, "What the companies are doing is worse than turning over records ... they're providing total access to all the data," and a former senior intelligence official said, "This is not about getting a cardboard box of monthly phone bills in alphabetical order ... the N.S.A. is getting real-time actionable intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hersh |first=Seymour |title=Listening In |date=May 22, 2006 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/05/29/060529ta_talk_hersh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whistle-Blower's Evidence, Uncut |date=May 22, 2006 |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70944-0.html?tw=wn_index_18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209171425/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70944-0.html?tw=wn_index_18 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2006 ''USA Today'' printed a partial retraction about its controversial article the prior month saying: "... USA TODAY also spoke again with the sources who had originally provided information about the scope and contents of the domestic calls database. All said the published report accurately reflected their knowledge and understanding of the NSA program, but none could document a contractual relationship between BellSouth or Verizon and the NSA, or that the companies turned over bulk calling records to the NSA. Based on its reporting after the May 11 article, USA TODAY has now concluded that while the NSA has built a massive domestic calls record database involving the domestic call records of telecommunications companies, the newspaper cannot confirm that BellSouth or Verizon contracted with the NSA to provide bulk calling records to that database ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A note to our readers |date=June 30, 2006 |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20060630/wherenote.art.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705095144/http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20060630/wherenote.art.htm |archive-date=July 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denials==
Five days after the story appeared, BellSouth officials said they could not find evidence of having handed over such records. "Based on our review to date, we have confirmed no such contract exists and we have not provided bulk customer calling records to the NSA," the officials said. ''USA Today'' replied that BellSouth officials had not denied the allegation when contacted the day before the story was published.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; Verizon has also asserted that it has not turned over such records.&lt;ref name="VerizonDenial"&gt;{{cite news

Companies are permitted by US securities law (15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(3)(A)) to refrain from properly accounting for their use of assets in matters involving national security, when properly authorized by an agency or department head acting under authorization by the [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; This [[legalese]] essentially means that companies can falsify their accounting reports and lie about their activities when the President decides that it is in the interests of national security to do so. [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] issued a [[presidential memorandum]] on May 5, 2006 delegating authority to make such a designation to [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Negroponte]], just as the NSA call database scandal appeared in the media.&lt;ref name="May5PresidentialMemo"&gt;{{cite journal|author=George W.

==Qwest Communications==
The ''USA Today'' report indicated that [[Qwest]]'s then CEO, [[Joseph Nacchio]], doubted the NSA's assertion that [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] were unnecessary. In negotiations, the NSA pressured the company to turn over the records. Qwest attorneys asked the NSA to obtain approval from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]. When the NSA indicated they would not seek this approval, Qwest's new CEO [[Richard Notebaert]] declined NSA's request for access. Later, [[T-Mobile_US|T-Mobile]] explicitly stated they do not participate in warrantless surveillance.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Callers Can't Hide |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/05/11/wireless-nsa-voip_cx_df_0511security.html |accessdate=May 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902071552/http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/05/11/wireless-nsa-voip_cx_df_0511security.html |archivedate=September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the database==

According to an anonymous source, the database is "the largest database ever assembled in the world,"&lt;ref name="USA" /&gt; and contains [[call-detail record]]s (CDRs) for all phone calls, domestic and international. A call-detail record consists of the phone numbers of the callers and recipients along with time, position and duration of the call. While the database does not contain specific names or addresses, that information is widely available from non-classified sources.&lt;ref name="USA" /&gt;

According to the research group [[TeleGeography]], AT&amp;T (including the former SBC), Verizon, and BellSouth connected nearly 500 billion telephone calls in 2005 and nearly two trillion calls since late 2001.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news

==Uses of the database==

Although such a database of phone records would not be useful on its own as a tool for [[national security]],{{dubious|date=July 2013}} it could be used as an element of broader national security analytical efforts and [[data mining]]. These efforts could involve analysts using the data to connect phone numbers with names and links to persons of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Ronczkowski, Michael R. (2003) ''Terrorism and Organized Hate Crime: Intelligence Gathering, Analysis, and Investigations'', CRC Press LLC, {{ISBN|0-8493-2012-7}}, pp. 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Clark (2003), ''Intelligence Analysis: A Target-Centric Approach'', CQ Press, {{ISBN|1-56802-830-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts have been the focus of the NSA's recent attempts to acquire key technologies from high tech firms in [[Silicon Valley]] and elsewhere. [[Network theory|Link analysis]] software, such as [[Link Explorer]] or the [[Analyst's Notebook]], is used by law enforcement to organize and view links that are demonstrated through such information as telephone and financial records, which are imported into the program from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/25/technology/25data.html?ei=5088&amp;en=d231d2f98b31262a&amp;ex=1298523600&amp;pagewanted=print|title=Taking Spying to Higher Level, Agencies Look for More Ways to Mine Data|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neural network software]] is used to detect patterns, classify and cluster data as well as forecast future events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/mdalink/pdf/42_sum02.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524232434/http://www.mda.mil/mdalink/pdf/42_sum02.pdf|archivedate=2006-05-24|title=Missile Defense Agency|work=mda.mil|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[relational mathematics]], it is possible to find out if someone changes their telephone number by analyzing and comparing calling patterns.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} &lt;!-- I heard this on NPR from a computer scientist they were interviewing ... looking for a source/link ... - I also heard that --&gt;

[[ThinThread]], a system designed largely by [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], which pre-dated this database, but was discarded for the [[Trailblazer Project]], introduced some of the technology which is used to analyze the data. Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA, admitted as much in an interview, saying: "But we judged fundamentally that as good as [ThinThread] was, and believe me, we pulled a whole bunch of elements out of it and used it for our final solution for these problems, as good as it was, it couldn't scale sufficiently to the volume of modern communications." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hughhewitt.com/former-cia-nsa-director-general-michael-hayden-uaf-ret-new-book-playing-edge/|title=Former CIA and NSA Director General Michael Hayden (UAF ret) On His New Book "Playing To The Edge" « The Hugh Hewitt Show|date=2016-02-23|work=The Hugh Hewitt Show|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where ThinThread encrypted privacy data, however, no such measures have been reported with respect to the current system.

Maine law requires the PUC to investigate complaints against a utility if a petition involves at least 10 of the utility's customers.&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{cite news|title=Complaint over phone records filed with PUC |work=Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2006/05/13/complaint_over_phone_records_filed_with_puc/ |accessdate=May 15, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Department response===

The Los Angeles Times reported on May 14, 2006, that the U.S. Justice Department called for an end to an eavesdropping lawsuit against AT&amp;T Corp., citing possible damage from the litigation to national security.&lt;ref name = "LA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="free"&gt;In 1970, when stolen [[COINTELPRO]] documents were released to members of Congress, journalists, and organizations who were named in the files, the administration's response to the disclosures was to warn that any further disclosures "could endanger the lives or cause other serious harm to persons engaged in investigation activities on behalf of the United States." Stone, Geoffrey R., Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

The US government indicated in an April 28 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614201619/http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/att/USA_statement_of_interest.pdf Statement of Interest] in the AT&amp;T case, that it intends to invoke the [[State Secrets Privilege]] in a bid to dismiss the action.

==Legal status==

The NSA call database was not approved by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) as required by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA). The FISC was established in 1978 to secretly authorize access to call-identifying information and interception of communications of suspected foreign agents on U.S. soil.&lt;ref name = "LA" /&gt; Stanford Law School's [[Chip Pitts]] provided an overview of the relevant legal concerns in The Washington Spectator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chip Pitts |title=The End of Illegal Domestic Spying?  Don't Count on It |url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5SwZyJc43?url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |journal=[[Washington Spectator|Wash. Spec.]] |date=March 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate from the question of whether the database is illegal under FISA, one may ask whether the call detail records are covered by the [[right to privacy|privacy protection]] of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] of the U.S. Constitution. This is unclear. As the U.S. has no explicit constitutional guarantee on the [[secrecy of correspondence]], any protection on communications is an extension by [[litigation]] of the privacy provided to "houses and papers."&lt;ref name = "JACKSON"&gt;{{cite web
| title = EX PARTE JACKSON, 96 U.S. 727 (1877)
| work =[[U.S. Supreme Court]]

| accessdate=May 17, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This again is dependent on the flexuous requirement of a ''[[reasonable expectation of privacy]]''.

The most relevant U.S. Supreme Court case is ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]''.&lt;ref name = "SMITH"&gt;{{cite web
| title = SMITH v. MARYLAND, 442 U.S. 735 (1979)
| work =[[U.S. Supreme Court]]
| url =http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=442&amp;invol=735
| accessdate=May 26, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In that case, the Court addressed [[pen register]]s, which are mechanical devices that record the numbers dialed on a telephone; a pen register does not record call contents. The Court ruled that pen registers are not covered by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]: "The installation and use of a pen register, [...] was not a 'search,' and no warrant was required." More generally, "This Court consistently has held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he [...] voluntarily turns over to third parties."

The data collecting activity may however be illegal under other [[telecommunications privacy laws]].

===The Stored Communications Act===

The 1986 [[Stored Communications Act]] (18 U.S.C. § 2701) forbids turnover of information to the government without a warrant or court order, the law gives consumers the right to sue for violations of the act.&lt;ref name="olymp"&gt;{{cite web

However, the Stored Communications Act also authorizes phone providers to conduct electronic surveillance if the Attorney General of the United States certifies that a court order or warrant is not required and that the surveillance is required:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Telephone providers] are authorized to...intercept...communications or to conduct electronic surveillance...if such provider...has been provided with a certification in writing by...the Attorney General of the United States that no warrant or court order is required by law, that all statutory requirements have been met, and that the specified assistance is required.&lt;ref name = "law2"&gt;{{cite web

The Act provides for special penalties for violators when "the offense is committed...in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State."&lt;ref name = "law" /&gt;

Finally, the act allows any customer whose telephone company provided this information to sue that company in civil court for (a) actual damages to the consumer, (b) any profits by the telephone company, (c) punitive damages, and (d) attorney fees. The minimum amount a successful customer will recover under (a) and (b) is $1,000:

{{quote|The court may assess as damages in a civil action under this section the sum of the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff and any profits made by the violator as a result of the violation, but in no case shall a person entitled to recover receive less than the sum of $1,000. If the violation is willful or intentional, the court may assess punitive damages. In the case of a successful action to enforce liability under this section, the court may assess the costs of the action, together with reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.|18 U.S.C. § 2707(c) damages&lt;ref name = "law" /&gt;}}

===Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act===
President Clinton signed into law the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, after it was passed in both the House and Senate by a voice vote. That law is an act "to make clear a telecommunications carrier's duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for law enforcement purposes, and for other purposes." The act states that a court order isn't the only lawful way of obtaining call information, saying, "A telecommunications carrier shall ensure that any interception of communications or access to call-identifying information effected within its switching premises can be activated only in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1971, the US media reported that COINTELPRO targeted thousands of Americans during the 1960s, after several stolen FBI dossiers were passed to news agencies.&lt;ref name="zmag"&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been collected. The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone "bugs," surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of American citizens. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous – and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations – have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite web

===Legality===
The legality of blanket wiretapping has never been sustained in court, but on July 10, 2008 the US Congress capitulated to the administration in granting blanket immunity to the administration and telecom industry for potentially illegal domestic surveillance.&lt;ref name="cbs_sum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57588335/nsa-data-gathering-deja-vu-for-privacy-hawks/?pageNum=2|title=NSA data-gathering deja vu for privacy hawks|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2013|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed during the crucible of the 2008 presidential campaign, and was supported by then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who was campaigning against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for the presidency.&lt;ref name="cbs_sum" /&gt;

Obama provided qualified support for the bill. He promised to "carefully monitor" the program for abuse, but said that, "Given the legitimate threats we face, providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay. So I support the compromise."&lt;ref name="cbs_sum" /&gt; It is difficult to argue that appropriate safeguards are in place, when CDRs from all the major telecommunications companies are provided to the NSA.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has released an opinion, dated August 29, 2013, written by U.S. District Judge [[Claire Eagan]] of the Northern District of Oklahoma, in which she said "metadata that includes phone numbers, time and duration of calls is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, since the content of the calls is not accessed."&lt;ref name="Metadata 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/surveillance_court_releases_new_opinion_upholding_nsa_collection_of_phone_d/ |title=Surveillance court releases new opinion upholding NSA collection of phone data |work=ABA Journal |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013 |author=Weiss, Debra Cassens}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the option, Judge Eagan said "data collection is authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act that allows the FBI to issue orders to produce tangible things if there are reasonable grounds to believe the records are relevant to a terrorism investigation."&lt;ref name="Metadata 2013"/&gt; The option authorized the FBI to "collect the information for probes of 'unknown' as well as known terrorists."&lt;ref name="Metadata 2013"/&gt; According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', "other judges had routinely reauthorized the data collection program every 90 days."&lt;ref name="Metadata 2013"/&gt;

The '''Ministry of the Army and Navy''' was responsible for defence of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] from 1918 to 1945, the '''Federal Secretariat of People's Defence''' for the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from 1945 to 1992 and the '''Ministry of Defence''' for [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (officially named the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2003) from 1992 to 2006.

Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the secession of four out of six constituent republic in the SFR Yugoslavia the remaining two ([[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Montenegro]]) established a federation in 1992 called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FR Yugoslavia). This lasted until 2003 when it was reconstituted as a state union called [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. In 2006 both countries declared independence and parted ways.

A '''navy shower''' (also known as a "combat shower", "military shower", "sea shower", "staggered shower", or "G.I. bath") is a method of [[bathing|showering]] that allows for significant [[water conservation|conservation]] of water and energy by turning off the flow of water in the middle portion of the shower while lathering. The total time of this kind of shower can last less than two minutes – using an initial thirty seconds or so to get wet, followed by shutting off the water, using soap and shampoo and lathering, then rinsing for a minute or less.

Navy showers originated on [[naval ship]]s, where supplies of fresh water were often scarce.  Using this method, crew members were able to stay clean, while conserving their limited water supply. The concept has also been adopted by some other people who wish to conserve water and the energy needed to heat the water, for both environmental and economic reasons.  According to the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], water heating is typically the second-largest energy expense in homes (after space heating).&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Saver: Tips on Saving Money &amp; Energy at Home |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/09/f18/61628_BK_EERE-EnergySavers_w150.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[US Department of Energy]] |date=September 2014|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cruising (maritime)|Maritime cruisers]] often take navy showers when they are not in a port with easy access to fresh water. A ten-minute shower takes as much as {{convert|230|l|USgal|-1|sp=us}} of water, while a navy shower usually takes as little as {{convert|11|l|USgal|0|sp=us}}; one person can save up to {{convert|56000|l|USgal|-3|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation Balancing Act: Part II, In the Bathroom |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/FY/FY13800.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[University of Florida]] Institute of Food and Agriculture Services Electronic Data Information Source |year=2001 |accessdate=2006-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316181310/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/FY/FY13800.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neosocialism''' was the name of a [[political faction]] that existed in [[French Third Republic|France during the 1930s]] and in [[History of Belgium|Belgium]] around the same time and which included several [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] tendencies in the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO). Step by step, the fraction distanced it self from [[revolution]]ary [[Marxism]] and [[reformist socialism]], instead advocating a "constructive revolution", or [[revolution from above]]. Neosocialists came to oppose the majority of the [[Socialism|socialists]] in [[National Assembly (France)|France National Assembly]] and the faction was expelled from SFIO. 

Originally linked to [[Fascism|fascist]] politics in France, neosocialists expressed admiration for [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascism]]. This ideological orientation later emerged in a newly formed party, the [[Neosocialist Party]], which advocated [[authoritarianism]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies as well as intimate cooperation with the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]].

== History ==
In the wake of the [[Great Depression (France)|Great Depression]], a group of [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] members, led by [[Henri de Man]] in Belgium (the founder of the ideology of ''[[planisme]]'', i.e. planism meaning [[economic planning]]) and in France by [[Marcel Déat]], [[Pierre Renaudel]], [[René Belin]], the "neo-Turks" of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] ([[Pierre Mendès-France]]), opposed themselves to both gradual [[reformism]] and the idea of a Marxist-inspired popular revolution. Instead, influenced by Henri de Man's planism, they promoted a "constructive revolution" headed by the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]] which would institute planification—the establishment of a technocratic [[planned economy]]. Such ideas also influenced the [[Non-conformists of the 1930s|non-conformist movement]] on the [[Political history of France#The Right|French right]].

Marcel Déat published in 1930 ''Perspectives socialistes'' (''Socialist Perspectives''), a revisionist work closely influenced by Henri de Man's planism. Along with over a hundred articles written in ''La vie socialiste'' (''The Socialist Life''), the review of the SFIO's right-wing, ''Perspective socialistes'' marked the shift of Déat from [[History of socialism|classical socialism]] to neosocialism. Déat replaced [[class struggle]] with [[class collaboration]] and [[Nationalism|national solidarity]], advocated [[Social corporatism|corporatism]] as a model of social organisation, replaced the notion of "[[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]" with "[[anti-capitalism]]" and supported a technocratic state which would plan the economy and in which [[parliamentarism]] would be replaced by political [[technocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Zeev Sternhell]]|chapter=Les convergences fascistes|pages=533&amp;ndash;564|title=Nouvelle histoire des idées politiques|editor=Pascal Ory|publisher=Pluriel Hachette|year=1987|language=French|isbn=2-01-010906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neosocialist faction inside of the SFIO, which included Marcel Déat and Pierre Renaudel, were expelled during the November 1933 Congress because of their revisionist stances and admiration for Italian fascism. The neosocialists advocated alliances with the middle classes and favoured making compromises with the "[[bourgeois]]" [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] to enact the SFIO's program one issue at a time. After having been expelled from the SFIO, Marcel Déat and his followers created the [[Socialist Party of France – Jean Jaurès Union]] (1933–1935) which was one of the main expression of neosocialism in France. Inside the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]]  trade union, neosocialism was represented by René Belin's ''Syndicats'' (then ''Redressements'')'s faction.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

On the other hand, Henri de Man's planism influenced the [[Politics of France#The Left|left-wing]] of the Radical Party, called "Young Turks" (among them Pierre Mendès-France). ''Planisme'' would later influence [[dirigisme|dirigism]] (''dirigisme''), the postwar [[Indicative planning|semi-planned economy]], [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]], [[spatial planning]] as well as [[Pierre Mendès France|Mendesism]], "left-wing [[Gaullism]]" ([[Louis Vallon]]) and socialist clubs in the 1960s (Club Jean Moulin).{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The neosocialists eventually evolved toward a form of participatory and [[national socialism]] which led them to join with the [[Reactionary|reactionary right]] and support the collaborationist [[Vichy Regime]] during the [[Second World War]] (René Belin and Marcel Déat became members of the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]). As a result, Déat's neosocialism was discredited in France after the war.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The '''Political Committee of National Liberation''' ({{lang-el|Πολιτική Επιτροπή Εθνικής Απελευθέρωσης}}, ''Politiki Epitropi Ethikis Apeleftherosis'', '''PEEA'''), commonly known as the "'''Mountain Government'''" ({{lang-el|Κυβέρνηση του Βουνού}}), was a [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]]-dominated government established in [[Greece]] in 1944 in opposition to both the [[collaborationist]] [[Nazi Germany|German]]-controlled government at [[Athens]] and to the [[Kingdom of Greece|royal]] government-in-exile in [[Cairo]]. It was integrated with the Greek government-in-exile in a [[national unity government]] at the [[Lebanon conference]] in May 1944.

== Background ==
{{See|Axis Occupation of Greece|Greek Resistance}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

== Establishment ==
The PEEA was established on 10 March 1944 by the leftist [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM)/[[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) movement, which was then in control of much of the country. Its aims, according to its founding charter, were, "to intensify the struggle against the conquerors ... for full national liberation, for the consolidation of the independence and integrity of our country (...) and for the annihilation of domestic fascism and armed traitor formations".

The PEEA's authority was significantly reinforced after the establishment of the [[National Council (Greece)|National Council]] ({{lang-el|Εθνικό Συμβούλιο}}) in 1944. The National Council was an assembly elected by secret elections organised by the PEEA in late April 1944 in both the liberated parts of Greece and the still-occupied cities, mainly Athens. Approximately one million people took part in these elections, which are notable for the fact that for the first time in Greece, women were [[Women's suffrage|allowed to vote]]. The Council first converged in [[Koryschades]], a mountain village of [[Evrytania]], from 14 to 27 May 1944. Its main act was voting a resolution, an extract of which is quoted:

{{cquote|
"General clauses

The National Council, composed of representatives of the whole of the Greek people, who converged to declare its inexpugnable will to fight to the bitter end for the liberation of the country, the destruction of [[fascism]] and the restoration of its national unity and popular sovereignty, willing to determine the way all authorities are exercised in [[Greek Resistance#The establishment of "Free Greece"|free Greece]], votes:
* Article 1: It ratifies the charter establishing Political Committee of National Liberation of March 10, 1944.
* Article 2: All powers derive from the people and are exercised by the people. Self-administration and popular judicature are fundamental institutions of the public life of the Greeks.
* Article 3: The National Council is the supreme instrument of [[popular sovereignty]]. The PEEA possesses all powers determined in this decree.
* Article 4: The People's liberties are sacred and inviolable. The struggling nation will protect them from any threats no matter where they are coming from.
* Article 5: All Greeks, men and women, have equal political and civil rights.
* Article 6: Employment is a fundamental social function and generates rights for the enjoyment of life’s goods.
* Article 7: [[Demotic Greek|The People's language]] is the formal language for all manifestations of public life and for all educational grades."}}

The PEEA's first president was [[Evripidis Bakirtzis]], the former leader of [[National and Social Liberation]] (EKKA). On April 18 [[Alexandros Svolos]], a prominent professor of constitutional law of the [[University of Athens]], took his position and Bakirtzis became vice-president. Not only communist leaders but also many progressive bourgeois, who had nothing to do with communist ideas, participated in the PEEA.

ELAS not only resisted German and Italian occupation forces but also re-organised life in [[Free Greece]], the mountainous areas (i.e. the biggest part of Greece) it controlled. EAM, with the co-ordination and organization of the PEEA, helped the local people organise schools, hospitalise refugees from the big cities and protect the crops from German looting. Amateur actors and musicians created travelling theatres and bands, something that most rural communities had never seen or heard before. Another achievement of ELAS (due partially to the progressive ideas and partially to the lack of men) was to promote women's rights. Young girls, who until then were working at home or the fields, had the opportunity to educate and express themselves. There were also improvised telecommunications either by telephone lines or by messengers and systems of re-distribution of food-resources, so that no village would starve.

The basic premise is to have demographics represented at all levels and aspects of the civilization according to national statistics.

A quota system is often part of any [[affirmative action]] policies, but in those cases it is mainly used as a "target", within a single entity. Quotaism applies to the whole country and is enforced by legislation on all public and private entities.

== Implementation ==

===Bangladesh===
* The [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] reserves 30% of its positions to the children and grandchildren of [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] veterans, 10% to women, 10% to residents of underdeveloped districts, 5% to the [[indigenous peoples in Bangladesh]], and 1% to disabled people. There have been demonstrations by university students calling for a drastic reduction in these quotas, or their complete abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote =Thousands of students launch a fresh movement as government fails to honour its promise to end quota in government jobs. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Brazil ===
* '''Higher Education''' – In 2012 the Brazilian government introduced legislation for federal universities, where spots are [[Vestibular exam#Racial quotas|reserved according to the racial make-up]] of each Brazilian state.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19188610|title=BBC News - Brazil approves affirmative action law for universities|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
*  '''[[Reservation in India|Reservation]]''' - a form of quota-based affirmative action directed by constitutional and statutory laws, half of all the vacancies in government is reserved based on caste, tribe or gender.
*  '''Higher Education''' - The [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission (UGC)]] provides financial assistance to universities/colleges which adopts a reservation policy for admissions and recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncst.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/UGC%20Guidlines_for%20SC_ST6052135002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''Sports Quota''' - Sport ability can be a criterion for being hired for none-sports positions.&lt;ref name="indiatimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Sports-merit-is-crucial-for-government-job-under-quota/articleshow/39378961.cms|title=Sports merit is crucial for government job under quota - The Times of India|publisher=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Local trade unions commonly use the term "Absolute representation" in this regard.&lt;ref name="stopkwotas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopkwotas.co.za/faq/absolute-representation/|title=Absolute representation &amp;#124; Stop Kwotas|publisher=stopkwotas.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment|BEE (Black Economic Empowerment)]]''' – Companies are scored based on the quota of black ownership, senior managers, training, as well as suppliers. These scores then translate into their ability to compete for government tenders.
* '''[[Affirmative action|Affirmative Action]]''' – The SAPS (South African Police Service) operates a quota system policy for hiring and promotion. Positions will be left unfilled if the appropriate demographic candidate cannot be recruited, even if another qualified person is available.&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/solidarity-to-fight-for-minorities-in-saps-1.1746787#.VBoAXaFwbiw|title=Solidarity to fight for minorities in SAPS - Crime &amp; Courts &amp;#124; IOL News &amp;#124; IOL.co.za|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solidariteit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://solidariteit.co.za/en/background-to-renate-barnard-case/|title=Background to Renate Barnard case|publisher=solidariteit.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''University Enrolment''' – First year students are registered on a racial quota basis. In some cases there are different admission requirements for different demographics. For example: to study medicine at the [[University of Cape Town|University of Cape Town (UCT)]], white and Indian students require at least a 78% average on their National Senior Certificate, whereas black students only requires 59%.&lt;ref name="iol2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/bar-still-raised-for-white-pupils-1.1111112#.VBoYcaFwbiw|title=Bar still raised for white pupils - Cape Times &amp;#124; IOL.co.za|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely as a result of the quota system requiring privelaged access for certain ethnic groups - In 2016 the University of Kwazulu Natal quota for medical students is 69% black African, 19% Indian, 9% coloured, 2% white and 1% other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/university-race-quotas-in-spotlight-1650992&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sport''' - Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula plans to impose quota systems in athletics, cricket, football, netball and rugby.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/south-africa-bring-back-racial-quotas-for-teams-8762467.html|title=South Africa bring back racial quotas for teams - International - Rugby Union - The Independent|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Quota distribution does not necessarily fit the real composition of the population;
* one demographic may have a higher degree of higher education than another,
* a region/town may have a higher percentage of a certain demographic than the national average for that group.&lt;ref name="iol3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/coloured-comments-haunt-manyi-1.1031904#.VBn_FqFwbiw|title=‘Coloured’ comments haunt Manyi - Politics &amp;#124; IOL News &amp;#124; IOL.co.za|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is complicated  to keep to a quota system in equilibrium since the demographics are continually changing. Most quota systems are based on national census data, which is tends to be collected once every 5-10 years.

Leaving positions unfilled in state departments can have a negative effect on service delivery. This is a very serious concern when applied in police forces of countries with high crime figures. This can also lead to slow economic growth and social mobility pigeonholing.

Quota systems can have a discriminative effect on minorities;
* Where fewer staff members are required, minorities may not be represented at all. For example; the South-African Indian population only make out 3% of the total population. If only 10 senior managers are required, Indian representation would be calculated as 0.3 of a staff member. This may be round down to the zero.&lt;ref name="solidariteit2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://solidariteit.co.za/en/solidarity-your-only-chance-against-the-sapss-unfair-implementation-of-affirmative-action/|title=Solidarity: Your only chance against the SAPS’s unfair implementation of affirmative action|publisher=solidariteit.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minorities may be forced out of their communities{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} as the local quota may already be oversubscribed.

Only elite members of the majority demographic benefits{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. The higher educated are artificially higher in demand due to under-subscription and can mandate higher than average salaries. The politically connected are given multiple directors’ position.&lt;ref name="financialmail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialmail.co.za/business/2012/12/06/directorships---serving-multiple-corporate-boards|title=Directorships - Serving multiple corporate boards &amp;#124; Business &amp;#124; financialmail|publisher=financialmail.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It interferes with a person’s basic human rights{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and freedom of choice{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

The '''Scottish Social Attitudes Survey''', started in 1999, is an annual [[survey of public opinion]] in [[Scotland]], funded by the [[public purse]]. 

Conducted by the Scottish branch of [http://www.natcen.ac.uk/ NatCen Social Research], in conjunction with the Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland at the [[University of Edinburgh]], it is largely funded by the [[Scottish Government]] and its agencies.

The 1999 survey also functioned as the '''Scottish Parliament Election Study'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esds.ac.uk/government/ssa/|title=Scottish Social Attitudes Survey|publisher=Economic and Social Data Service|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310001701/http://www.esds.ac.uk/government/ssa/|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==2010 Survey==
The 2010 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey core finding was that just 28% of respondents supported [[Scottish independence]],  a lower level than in two recent social attitude studies. A majority support "[[devo max]]" (maximum [[devolution]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Ian-Swanson-Nationalists-take-extra.6005369.jp|title=Nationalists take extra care choosing day to fit the bill|date=22 January 2010|publisher=Edinburgh Evening News|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 60% of respondents wanting the [[Scottish Parliament]] to control Scotland's £18 billion [[welfare]] bill (including power over [[public pensions]] and benefits), and a majority (59%) also supported [[taxation levels]] being decided in Edinburgh rather than London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/14/survery-tax-powers-holyrood|title=Scots want greater tax-raising powers for Holyrood, survey finds|date=14 January 2010|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 January 2010 | location=London | first=Severin | last=Carrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This goes further than the conclusions of the [[Commission on Scottish Devolution|Calman Report]].

The survey found that most Scots only supported powers over defence, foreign affairs and [[monetary policy]] remaining with the [[UK Government]].

A '''service voucher''' is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.

A voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the [[Market (economics)|market]] nor by the [[public sector]]. These might include for example [[home care]], household repairs, [[ironing]], or [[bicycle]] hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with [[trade union]]s and [[employer]]s' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of [[unfair competition]].

Potential providers of these services are identified, often from among the [[unemployment#Long-term unemployment|long-term unemployed]].

Vouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including [[social insurance]] cover, holiday pay etc.). An example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in [[Belgium]], where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with a National Register Number is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers with their own business who have just given birth are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers. This initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each service voucher, a domestic servant receives a salary of 22.69 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to the first 156 service vouchers purchased yearly, creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.

==Analysis of benefits==
Vouchers can be defined as subsidies granting limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of services. In the field of personal and household services, their use has been growing in recent years, following successful experiences in some European countries. Vouchers can be seen as tools that would lie between in kind provision of services and cash distribution of income to be used (or not) for these services. Very basically, vouchers are simple means of payment. The payment can be integrally made by the user, or by a public financer, and mixed forms of payment with other actors can be imagined (e.g. companies paying for part of the cost or insurance companies providing some services through this means).

In the field of care policies, the increasing use of vouchers has sometimes been analysed as an element of a current commodification trend that corresponds to an increase in what can be labelled a “social market” logic. Social markets mainly rely on demand-side measures, the aim being to ensure that users or consumers of services are offered more choice and are, financially speaking, able to purchase personal services. The market logic involves developing the demand side with the aim of transforming “latent” demand into effective demand. These social markets thus involve competition between different modes of provision, with the user receiving direct or indirect assistance from public authorities to make their choice.

In the field of “non-care” services, vouchers are being used mostly for the same reasons as those in the care sector, that is for a series of supposed advantages in particular regarding efficiency of public spending, expected impact on undeclared labour but also quality issues (quality of services and quality of jobs). 
# A first advantage is '''freedom of choice'''. Under the logic of social markets, vouchers are supposed to allow for user choice between different types of providers (sometimes including public providers) or simply between providers of one single type (e.g. domestic workers). 
# A second advantage is '''efficiency'''. Vouchers offer less freedom of choice than pure money but their efficiency is linked to the fact that the demand is “channelled”, i.e. that it is oriented towards certain types of services or activities; moreover there is an efficiency for public finances as if not used, the voucher does not represent a cost for authorities. As well it is possible to imagine public policies targeting people with special needs. 
# A third advantage is '''reduction of undeclared labour'''. Vouchers are meant to simplify the administrative procedures when employing someone to outsource housework tasks or care activities. In some cases, the purchase of a voucher does not entail the duty to sign a labour contract between the parties (as in France under specific conditions), which might have a negative impact on working conditions.
# Further, social security contributions are calculated automatically and directly paid. Because they considerably '''reduce administrative burden''', vouchers are supposed to be a significant incentive for the use of declared labour rather than undeclared labour. 
# Fifth, and finally, vouchers might foster '''quality of services'''. The partisans of the market-oriented and purchaser-provider model consider that it encourages innovation, flexibility and quality, as the market should eliminate the bad quality suppliers and encourage a user-oriented approach. As a Eurofound report notes: “The more actively involved service users are in determining the content of care, the more likely it is that care services will be greater suited to the individual’s values, culture, attitudes and circumstances. Empowerment of care recipients enables them to purchase their own care and have the security assurance of contractual rights. This can potentially influence the quality of care, as low standard care services would simply not be ‘bought’. At the same time, care recipients could tailor a care programme to their specific needs, again raising quality and improving delivery”. Voucher schemes could be steered in this direction, according to this report and to certain authors.&lt;ref&gt;Developing personal and household services in the EU - A focus on housework activities, European Commission, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Security Service''' of Georgia (SSSG) ({{lang-ka|სახელმწიფო უსაფრთხოების სამსახური}}) is a secretive militarized government agency of the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], which covers a broad spectrum of tasks to preserve national security in accordance to state legislature and relevant laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssg.gov.ge/uploads/ნორმატიული%20აქტები/სახელმწიფო%20უსაფრთხოების%20სამსახურის%20შესახებ%20კანონი/eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Its missions are to protect the constitutional order, sovereignty, territorial integrity and military potential of Georgia from illegal acts of special services and individuals of foreign countries; to prevent violent and unconstitutional change of order and state authority. Further it is to ensure economic security and fight terrorism on national and international level, transnational organized crime and international crime as well as carry out measures towards prevention, detection and suppression of corruption. It is also responsible for protecting state secrets. The newly established independent agency is a former subordinate branch of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia]] and has been re-activated in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/aboutus/info&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://jamestown.org/program/georgia-establishes-new-state-security-service/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Having its roots in the Soviet Union, in the 1940s the State Security Agency was originally the State Security Ministry and was repeatedly reformed and merged with the Ministry of Internal Affairs over the course of several decades before both ministries ultimately merged in 2003. Until 2015 the State Security Agency was an integral part of the MIA and its primary intelligence as well as counterintelligence component. In the fight against terrorism, however, Georgia lacked a uniform coordinated force as many law enforcement units and government agencies claimed counter terrorism as their area of responsibility, despite the fact a specialised and designated anti-terror unit had already existed for many years. In order to unify the efforts of all institutions, an interagency mechanism was established in 2014 that would operate as a joint task force subordinated to a crisis management council in the event of major terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2014/239406.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osce.org/fsc/233731?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, as a result of the rapidly increasing threat of international terrorism, the Georgian government decided to reinstate the State Security Service as a separate and independent agency and task it with priority counter terrorism related missions and activities. For this task the country's most elite counter terror unit has been transferred to the SSSG for all operative measures.

==Fields of activities==

===Counter terrorism===

The fight against terrorism is one of the main priorities of the SSSG notably due to recent developments in the Middle East. Georgia has been participating in the [[War on Terror]] from the beginning and has to some extent found itself increasingly becoming a transit country for combatants and potential Islamic terrorists as violence keeps continuously rising in the conflicted Arab nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://dfwatch.net/georgians-mentioned-in-leaked-islamic-state-documents-41956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2014/239406.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the likelihood of a terrorist attack may be minimal to the country itself, such activities undermine and endanger the political and military efforts of allied and partner nations thus why Georgias efforts in those areas are essential to not only regional security. If direct operational and surgical means are required to effectively deter and combat terrorist threats the agency deploys two special units - one of which is part of the Special Operations Division and operates primarily on domestic level to contain individuals or entire cells that conduct radical activities which endanger national security.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssg.gov.ge/en/news/73/Counterterrorism-Center-under-the-State-Security-Service-of-Georgia-detained-4-persons&lt;/ref&gt; The Counterterrorism Center is the primary division dominantly engaged in anti-terror warfare and fields the country's most experienced and designated force in that area. In accordance to their tasks and activities the members of its tactical intervention force regularly train and retrain on all forms of combat particularly in connection with counter terrorism including among other, special sniper courses, alpine warfare, special CQB training, the search and destruction of terrorist camps, specialization on explosive devices, their defusal and deploying means to prevent and counteract the use of weapons of mass destruction. The center operates in conjunction with the nations own and foreign intelligence services including [[Interpol]]. Each of its operator undergoes foreign courses in cooperation with a number of partner nations to constantly enhance his capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://police.ge/en/ministry/structure-and-offices/counterterrorist-center&lt;/ref&gt; Material and equipment as well as infrastructural needs have been steadily upgraded over the years.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/counter-terrorism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://police.ge/en/shinagan-saqmeta-ministrma-spetsialuri-operatsiebis-tsentris-bazaze-ganakhlebuli-satskhovrebeli-korpusebi-gakhsna/5693#!prettyPhoto&lt;/ref&gt; The unit is also the first to engage in high risk domestic or international operations, former starting in the mid-to late 1990s and latter from 2001 on losing an undisclosed number of servicemen. Georgia is an active member and advisor of the global anti-terrorist coalition and constantly participates in multinational operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/info/international-cooperation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention and proliferation of CBRN threats===

Georgia is the regional center for biological-and virological research and also hosts a number of soviet military- and research facilities as well as storage areas that contain radioactive and chemical substances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/georgia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ncdc.ge/en-US/LaboratoryNetworksAndBS&lt;/ref&gt; Those facilities are subjected to a permanent state of control and monitoring by the SSSG. However, on the [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupied territories]] international security measures have not been implemented thus maintaining transit routes and much greater vulnerability to smuggling of [[CBRN defense|CBRN]] material through the country than already present.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav030107a.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/georgia-draws-attention-nuclear-smuggling-abkhazia-and-south-osetia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=451&amp;nid=36522&amp;NewsCatID=324&amp;p=7&lt;/ref&gt; Such weaknesses have been exploited on multiple occasions throughout the years. Many attempts were made to smuggle depleted and enriched uranium in or out of the country, however most of those have been prevented by investigative and operative events. In the more recent period alone over 19 individuals have been detained on charges of illicit trafficking of nuclear material in four incidents.  
Georgia works closely with the US, UN, partner nations and the [[EU CBRN Risk Mitigation CoE Initiative|CBRN CoE]] and was the first nation to elaborate and adopt the Strategy and Action Plan of the EU thus becoming one of the primary members of the 28 nations initiative. One of the SSSGs prioirities is to also become member of the G7 [[Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ssg.gov.ge/en/page/cbrn-defense&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Georgia_US_ink_deal_to_fight_nuclear_smuggling_999.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1575">The '''Stewards''' also informally referred to as '''Blackshirts''' were the paramilitary wing of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF).&lt;ref name="Lewis1"&gt;David Stephen Lewis.

==Olympia, June 1934==
During a gathering of 12,000 BUF members at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]] on 7 June 1934, the Stewards counterattacked an anti-fascist attempt to disrupt a speech by Mosley. The continuous violent outbreaks between Communists and defending Stewards led to [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], the owner of the [[Daily Mail]], to withdraw the support of his paper, mainly out of pressure of government officials. The resulting poor publicity from left-wing led newspapers also led to a decline in BUF membership.

'''''The Price of Civilization: Reawakening American Virtue and Prosperity''''' ({{ISBN|978-1-4000-6841-8}}) is a book by [[economist]] [[Jeffrey Sachs]]. It was published by [[Random House]] on October 4, 2011 in the [[United States]] and by [[Bodley Head]] in the [[United Kingdom]] on October 6 of the same year. In the book, Sachs criticizes excessive [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying]], as well as a poor response by American government to [[globalization]], and describes American politics as a [[corporatocracy]] in which "powerful corporate interest groups dominate the policy agenda."&lt;ref name=twsM18ppouy&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey|title=The Price of Civilization|publisher=Random House|year=2011|location=New York|pages=105|isbn=978-1-4000-6841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs suggests that both political parties are right-of-center, and identifies four powerful lobbies: the [[military–industrial complex]], the Wall Street–Washington complex, the [[Big Oil]]–transport–military complex and the health care industry.&lt;ref name=twsM18jkhhy&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey|title=The Price of Civilization|publisher=Random House|year=2011|location=New York|pages=117-118|isbn=978-1-4000-6841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is 336 pages long. As described by Random House: the book is an "incisive diagnosis of our country’s economic ills but also an urgent call for [[Americans]] to restore the virtues of fairness, honesty, and foresight as the foundations of national prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.randomhouse.com/book/159570/the-price-of-civilization-by-jeffrey-d-sachs&lt;/ref&gt;  The title comes from the quote from [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr]]: "Taxes are the price we pay for civilization."  In the review in the [[Wall Street Journal]], American politician [[Paul Ryan]] states: "Yet at its core ''The Price of Civilization'' is not about taxes or economics. It is about the 'pursuit of happiness' as one academic understands it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903703604576589090204327736 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Paul | last=Ryan | title=America's Enduring Ideal | date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses on the changes going on in the world, the effects of these changes on the economic conditions and the necessary actions that will be required to deal with these changes in this new world if America is going to succeed.

Sachs criticizes excessive lobbying for interfering with democracy, and sees America's [[two-party system]] as stifling lesser parties.&lt;ref name=twsM18xxuy/&gt; He blames the [[first past the post]] voting arrangement for being one of the factors leading to a two-party system:

{{Quote|The main reason for America's majoritarian character is the electoral system for Congress. Members of Congress are elected in single-member districts according to the "first-past-the-post" (FPTP) principle, meaning that the candidate with the plurality of votes is the winner of the congressional seat. The losing party or parties win no representation at all. The first-past-the-post election tends to produce a small number of major parties, perhaps just two, a principle known in political science as [[Duverger's Law]]. Smaller parties are trampled in first-past-the-post elections.|Economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, in ''The Price of Civilization'', page 107, 2011&lt;ref name=twsM18xxuy&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey|title=The Price of Civilization|publisher=Random House|year=2011|location=New York|pages=107|isbn=978-1-4000-6841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:On ne passe pas-1915.jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|Halte la! On ne passe pas !}}&lt;br/&gt;French card, 1915]]
[[File:On Ne Passe Pas 1918.jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|On ne passe pas !}}&lt;br/&gt;Propaganda poster by {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurice Neumont|fr}}]]
"'''They shall not pass'''" ({{lang-fr|On ne passe pas !}}; {{lang-es|¡No pasarán!}}; {{lang-ro|Pe aici nu se trece!}}) is a [[slogan]] used to express determination to defend a position against an enemy. "{{lang|fr|On ne passe pas}}" literally means "one does not pass"; this being a common French idiom to express interdiction.

It was most famously used during the [[Battle of Verdun]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] by [[French Army|French]] General [[Robert Nivelle]]. It appears on propaganda posters, such as that by Maurice Neumont after the [[Second Battle of the Marne]], which was later adopted on uniform badges by units manning the [[Maginot Line]]. Later during the war, it also was used by [[Romanians|Romanian]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Mărășești]] (the Romanian translation of the phrase is "{{lang|ro|Pe aici nu se trece}}", literally meaning "One does not pass through here").

It was also used during the [[Spanish Civil War]], this time at the [[Siege of Madrid]] by [[Dolores Ibárruri|Dolores Ibárruri Gómez]], a member of the [[Communist Party of Spain]], in her famous "{{lang|es|No pasarán}}" speech on 18 July 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{https://books.google.it/books?id=j983FGkF1jEC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=no+pasaran+july+Ib%C3%A1rruri+radio&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQjfimuLLdAhUk_CoKHcmBAc8Q6AEITDAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The leader of the fascist forces, [[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]] [[Francisco Franco]], upon gaining [[Madrid]], responded to this slogan by declaring "{{lang|es|Hemos pasado}}" ("We have passed").

"{{lang|es|¡No pasarán!}}" was used by British anti-fascists during the October 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]], and is still used in this context in some political circles. It was often accompanied by the words {{lang|es|nosotros pasaremos}} (we will pass) to indicate that communists rather than fascists will be the ones to seize [[power (social and political)|state power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Audrey Gillan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/30/thefarright.past |title=Day the East End said ''No pasaran'' to Blackshirts |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-10-02 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was brought to the public consciousness again following action in December 1943 by [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] officer [[Paul Triquet]] of the [[Royal 22nd Regiment|Royal 22&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Regiment]]; his action included his use of Nivelle's phrase "to win a key objective at [[Ortona]], Italy, in the face of overwhelming German opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French Canadian Wins Victoria Cross |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=March 6, 1944 |accessdate=September 15, 2014 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19440304&amp;id=lvouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ENwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4474,785365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the phrase {{lang|es|¡No pasarán!}} was a theme in the [[Central American crisis|civil wars in Central America]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|particularly in Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunzle |first=David |title=The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979–1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSDgTC6JXI0C&amp;pg=PA168 |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520081925 |page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|es|Nicaragua no pasarán}} is also the title of a 1984 documentary by [[David Bradbury (film maker)|David Bradbury]] about the events in Nicaragua that led to the overthrow of Somoza's dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kallen |first=Stuart A. |title=The Aftermath of the Sandinista Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUX22oowNIAC&amp;pg=PA152 |year=2009 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |isbn=9780822590910 |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlinefilms.com.au/videos/nicaragua.htm |title=Nicaragua: ''No Pasaran'' |publisher=Frontline Films |accessdate=30 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=FitzSimons |first1=Trish |last2=Laughren |first2=Pat |last3=Williamson |first3=Dugald |title=Australian Documentary: History, Practices and Genres |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1_p2BdHjLUC&amp;pg=PA267 |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521167994 |page=267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tcas EU-Flysafe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|Combined TCAS and [[Horizontal situation indicator|EHSI]] cockpit display (color)]]
A '''traffic collision avoidance system''' or '''traffic alert and collision avoidance system''' (both abbreviated as '''TCAS''', and pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|i:|k|æ|s}} ("tee-kas") is an [[aircraft collision avoidance systems|aircraft collision avoidance system]] designed to reduce the incidence of [[mid-air collision]]s between aircraft. It monitors the airspace around an aircraft for other aircraft equipped with a corresponding active [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]], independent of [[air traffic control]], and warns pilots of the presence of other transponder-equipped aircraft which may present a threat of [[mid-air collision]] (MAC). It is a type of [[airborne collision avoidance system]] mandated by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] to be fitted to all aircraft with a maximum take-off mass (MTOM) of over {{convert|5700|kg|abbr=on}} or authorized to carry more than 19 passengers. CFR 14, Ch I, part 135 requires that TCAS I be installed for aircraft with 10-30 passengers and TCAS II for aircraft with more than 30 passengers.

[[Airborne collision avoidance system|ACAS]] / TCAS is based on [[secondary surveillance radar]] (SSR) [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]] signals, but operates independently of ground-based equipment to provide advice to the pilot on potential conflicting aircraft.

In modern [[glass cockpit]] aircraft, the TCAS display may be integrated in the Navigation Display (ND) or [[Horizontal situation indicator|Electronic Horizontal Situation]] Indicator (EHSI); in older glass cockpit aircraft and those with mechanical instrumentation, such an integrated TCAS display may replace the mechanical Vertical Speed Indicator (which indicates the rate with which the aircraft is descending or climbing).

==Impetus for a system and history==
{{for|more examples|Category:Mid-air collisions}}
Research into collision avoidance systems has been ongoing since at least the 1950s. [[ICAO]] and aviation authorities such as the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] were spurred into action by the [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision|Grand Canyon mid-air collision]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=TCAS70&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/nextgen/research_tech_dev/eng_dev_serv/tcas/media/pdf/tcas.pdf Introduction to TCAS II Version 7]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TCAS71&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/TCAS%20II%20V7.1%20Intro%20booklet.pdf Introduction to TCAS II Version 7.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of TCAS added a safety barrier to help prevent mid-air collisions. However, further study, refinements, training and regulatory measures were still required, because the limitations and misuse of the system still resulted in other incidents and fatal accidents, which include:
* The [[Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision]] accident over New Delhi in 1996.
* The [[2001 Japan Airlines mid-air incident|Japan Airlines near-miss incident]] in 2001;
* The [[Überlingen mid-air collision]], between a [[Boeing 757]] and a [[Tupolev Tu-154]] in 2002, where the Tupolev pilots declined to follow their TCAS resolution advisory (RA), instead following the directions of the air traffic controller, while the Boeing pilots followed their TCAS RA, having no ATC instruction.  By the time the crews of the two planes actually saw each other, it was too late, and the planes collided, killing 71; 
* The [[Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907|Gol Flight 1907]] collision with an [[Embraer Legacy 600]] in 2006.

The airline industry has been working with the [[Air Transport Association of America]] (ATA) since 1955 toward a collision avoidance system. It was not until the mid-1970s, however, that research centered on using signals from ATCRBS airborne transponders as the cooperative element of a collision avoidance system. This technical approach allows a collision avoidance capability on the flight deck, which is independent of the ground system. In 1981, the FAA announced a decision to implement an aircraft collision avoidance concept called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The concept is based upon agency and industry development efforts in the areas of beacon based collision avoidance systems and air-to-air discrete address communications techniques utilizing Mode S airborne transponder message formats.&lt;ref name=20-151B&gt;{{citation |title=20-151B - Airworthiness Approval of Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS II), Versions 7.0 &amp; 7.1 and Associated Mode S Transponders |url= https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ac_20-151b.pdf|publisher=faa.gov |date=March 18, 2014 |accessdate= October 13, 2018|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short time later, prototypes of TCAS II were installed on two [[Piedmont Airlines]] [[Boeing 727]] aircraft, and were flown on regularly scheduled flights. Although the displays were located outside the view of the flight crew and seen only by trained observers, these tests did provide valuable information on the frequency and circumstances of alerts and their potential for interaction with the [[Air traffic control|ATC]] system. On a follow-on phase II program, a later version of TCAS II was installed on a single Piedmont Airlines Boeing 727, and the system was [[Airworthiness certificate|certified]] in April 1986, then subsequently approved for operational evaluation in early 1987. Since the equipment was not developed to full standards, the system was only operated in [[visual meteorological conditions]] (VMC). Although the flight crew operated the system, the evaluation was primarily for the purpose of data collection and its correlation with flight crew and observer observation and response.&lt;ref name=20-151B/&gt;

Later versions of TCAS II manufactured by [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]]/[[King Air]] Transport Avionics Division were installed and approved on [[United Airlines]] airplanes in early 1988. Similar units manufactured by Honeywell were installed and approved on [[Northwest Airlines]] airplanes in late 1988. This limited installation program operated TCAS II units approved for operation as a full-time system in both visual and [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC) on three different aircraft types. The operational evaluation programs continued through 1988 to validate the operational suitability of the systems&lt;ref name=20-151B/&gt;

==Overview==

===System description===
TCAS involves communication between all aircraft equipped with an appropriate [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]] (provided the transponder is enabled and set up properly). Each TCAS-equipped aircraft interrogates all other aircraft in a determined range about their position (via the 1.03&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]] [[radio]] [[frequency]]), and all other aircraft reply to other interrogations (via 1.09&amp;nbsp;GHz). This interrogation-and-response cycle may occur several times per second.&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

The TCAS system builds a three dimensional map of aircraft in the airspace, incorporating their range (garnered from the interrogation and response round trip time), altitude (as reported by the interrogated aircraft), and bearing (by the directional antenna from the response). Then, by [[extrapolating]] current range and altitude difference to anticipated future values, it determines if a potential collision threat exists.

TCAS and its variants are only able to interact with aircraft that have a correctly operating mode C or mode S transponder.  A unique 24-bit identifier is assigned to each aircraft that has a [[Identification friend or foe#Modes|mode S]] transponder.

The next step beyond identifying potential collisions is automatically negotiating a mutual avoidance manoeuver (currently, manoeuvers are restricted to changes in altitude and modification of climb/sink rates) between the two (or more) conflicting aircraft. These avoidance manoeuvers are communicated to the flight crew by a cockpit display and by synthesized voice instructions.&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

A protected volume of airspace surrounds each TCAS equipped aircraft. The size of the protected volume depends on the altitude, speed, and heading of the aircraft involved in the encounter. The illustration below gives an example of a typical TCAS protection volume.

[[File:TCAS Volume.jpg|TCAS Volume|center]]

===System components===
A TCAS installation consists of the following components:&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

;TCAS computer unit: Performs airspace surveillance, intruder tracking, its own aircraft altitude tracking, threat detection, resolution advisory (RA) manoeuvre determination and selection, and generation of advisories. The TCAS Processor uses pressure altitude, radar altitude, and discrete aircraft status inputs from its own aircraft to control the collision avoidance logic parameters that determine the protection volume around the TCAS aircraft.
;Antennas: The antennas used by TCAS II include a directional antenna that is mounted on the top of the aircraft and either an omnidirectional or a directional antenna mounted on the bottom of the aircraft. Most installations use the optional directional antenna on the bottom of the aircraft. In addition to the two TCAS antennas, two antennas are also required for the Mode S transponder. One antenna is mounted on the top of the aircraft while the other is mounted on the bottom. These antennas enable the Mode S transponder to receive interrogations at 1030&amp;nbsp;MHz and reply to the received interrogations at 1090&amp;nbsp;MHz.
;Cockpit presentation: The TCAS interface with the pilots is provided by two displays: the traffic display and the RA display. These two displays can be implemented in a number of ways, including displays that incorporate both displays into a single, physical unit. Regardless of the implementation, the information displayed is identical. The standards for both the traffic display and the RA display are defined in DO-185A.&lt;ref name=DO-185&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/SC-147.htm FAA DO-185 Materials and RTCA SC-147 Activities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507002355/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/SC-147.htm |date=2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

The following section describes the TCAS operation based on TCAS II, since this is the version that has been adopted as an international standard (ACAS II) by ICAO and aviation authorities worldwide.&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

===Operation modes===
TCAS II can be currently operated in the following modes:&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

;Stand-by: Power is applied to the TCAS Processor and the mode S transponder, but TCAS does not issue any interrogations and the transponder will reply to only discrete interrogations.
;Transponder: The mode S transponder is fully operational and will reply to all appropriate ground and TCAS interrogations. TCAS remains in stand-by.
;Traffic advisories only: The mode S transponder is fully operational. TCAS will operate normally and issue the appropriate interrogations and perform all tracking functions. However, TCAS will only issue traffic advisories (TA), and the resolution advisories (RA) will be inhibited.
;Automatic (traffic/resolution advisories): The mode S transponder is fully operational. TCAS will operate normally and issue the appropriate interrogations and perform all tracking functions. TCAS will issue traffic advisories (TA) and resolution advisories (RA), when appropriate.

TCAS works in a coordinated manner, so when an RA is issued to conflicting aircraft, a required action (i.e., ''Climb. Climb.'') has to be immediately performed by one of the aircraft, while the other one receives a similar RA in the opposite direction (i.e., ''Descend. Descend.'').

===Alerts===
[[File:TCAS Envelope.JPG|thumb|TCAS II typical envelope]]
TCAS II issues the following types of aural annunciations:

* Traffic advisory (TA)
* Resolution advisory (RA)
* Clear of conflict

When a TA is issued, pilots are instructed to initiate a visual search for the traffic causing the TA. If the traffic is visually acquired, pilots are instructed to maintain visual separation from the traffic. Training programs also indicate that no horizontal maneuvers are to be made based solely on information shown on the traffic display. Slight adjustments in vertical speed while climbing or descending, or slight adjustments in airspeed while still complying with the ATC clearance are acceptable.&lt;ref name=DOC9863-6&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/Doc9863_ACAS_Controller_Training_chp6_1.pdf ICAO Document 9863 - Chapter 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182903/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/Doc9863_ACAS_Controller_Training_chp6_1.pdf |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an RA is issued, pilots are expected to respond immediately to the RA unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the flight. This means that aircraft will at times have to manoeuver contrary to ATC instructions or disregard ATC instructions. In these cases, the controller is no longer responsible for separation of the aircraft involved in the RA until the conflict is terminated.

On the other hand, ATC can potentially interfere with a pilot's response to RAs. If a conflicting ATC instruction coincides with an RA, a pilot may assume that ATC is fully aware of the situation and is providing the better resolution. But in reality, ATC is not aware of the RA until the RA is reported by the pilot. Once the RA is reported by the pilot, ATC is required not to attempt to modify the flight path of the aircraft involved in the encounter. Hence, the pilot is expected to "follow the RA" but in practice this does not always happen.

Some countries have implemented "RA downlink" which provides air traffic controllers with information about RAs posted in the cockpit. Currently, there are no ICAO provisions concerning the use of RA downlink by air traffic controllers.

The following points receive emphasis during pilot training:

* Do not manoeuver in a direction opposite to that indicated by the RA because this may result in a collision.
* Inform the controller of the RA as soon as permitted by flight crew workload after responding to the RA. There is no requirement to make this notification prior to initiating the RA response.
* Be alert for the removal of RAs or the weakening of RAs so that deviations from a cleared altitude are minimized.
* If possible, comply with the controller's clearance, e.g. turn to intercept an airway or localizer, at the same time as responding to an RA.
* When the RA event is completed, promptly return to the previous ATC clearance or instruction or comply with a revised ATC clearance or instruction.&lt;ref name="DOC9863-6"/&gt;

An RA occurs on average every 1,000 flight hours on short/[[medium-haul]] aircraft and every 3,000 hours for [[long-haul]] aircraft.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek13sep2018/&gt;--&gt;
In its December 2017 [[airborne collision avoidance system|ACAS]] guide, [[Eurocontrol]] found in about 25% of the cases, the pilots follow the RA inaccurately.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek13sep2018/&gt;--&gt;

Safety studies on TCAS estimate that the system improves safety in the airspace by a factor of between 3 and 5.&lt;ref name=ACASA&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/Safety/WP1.pdf ACAS Programme Work Package 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722013223/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/Safety/WP1.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is well understood that part of the remaining risk is that TCAS may induce midair collisions: "In particular, it is dependent on the accuracy of the threat aircraft’s reported altitude and on the expectation that the threat aircraft will not make an abrupt maneuver that defeats the TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA).  The safety study also shows that TCAS II will induce some critical near midair collisions..." (See page 7 of Introduction to TCAS II Version 7 and 7.1 (PDF) in external links below).&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

One potential problem with TCAS II is the possibility that a recommended avoidance maneuver might direct the flight crew to descend toward terrain below a safe altitude. Recent requirements for incorporation of ground proximity mitigate this risk.  Ground proximity warning alerts have priority in the cockpit over TCAS alerts.

Some pilots have been unsure how to act when their aircraft was requested to climb whilst flying at their maximum altitude.  The accepted procedure is to follow the climb RA as best as possible, [[Zoom climb|temporarily trading speed for height]].  The climb RA should quickly finish.  In the event of a stall warning, the stall warning would take priority.

Both cases have been already addressed by Version 7.0 of TCAS II and are currently handled by a corrective RA together with a visual indication of a green arc in the IVSI display to indicate the safe range for the climb or descent rate. However, it has been found that in some cases these indications could lead to a dangerous situation for the involved aircraft. For example, if a TCAS event occurs when two aircraft are descending one over the other for landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude will first receive a ''"Descend, descend"'' RA, and when reaching an extreme low altitude, this will change to a ''"Adjust Vertical Speed, Adjust"'' RA, together with a green arc indication directing the pilot to level off the aircraft. This could place the aircraft dangerously into the path of the intruder above, who is descending to land. A change proposal has been issued to correct this problem.&lt;ref name=CP116&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP116.pdf Change proposal CP116] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717003622/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP116.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B)==
[[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast]] (ADS-B) messages are transmitted from aircraft equipped with suitable transponders, containing information such as identity, location, and velocity. The signals are broadcast on the 1090&amp;nbsp;MHz radio frequency.  ADS-B messages are also carried on a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) in the 978&amp;nbsp;MHz band.&lt;ref name=ADS-B_UAT&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/WG5_Meetings/Meeting1/UAT-WP-1-09.pdf ADS-B System Description for the UAT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062831/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/WG5_Meetings/Meeting1/UAT-WP-1-09.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TCAS equipment which is capable of processing ADS-B messages may use this information to enhance the performance of TCAS, using techniques known as "hybrid surveillance". As currently implemented, hybrid surveillance uses reception of ADS-B messages from an aircraft to reduce the rate at which the TCAS equipment interrogates that aircraft. This reduction in interrogations reduces the use of the 1030/1090&amp;nbsp;MHz radio channel, and will over time extend the operationally useful life of TCAS technology.  The ADS-B messages will also allow low cost (for aircraft) technology to provide real time traffic in the cockpit for small aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duncanaviation.aero/straighttalk/adsb/tcas.php |title=TCAS 7.1 &amp;#124; ADSB Straight Talk |publisher=Duncanaviation.aero |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2013-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516094932/http://www.duncanaviation.aero/straighttalk/adsb/tcas.php |archivedate=2013-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently UAT based traffic uplinks are provided in Alaska and in regions of the East coast of the USA.

Hybrid surveillance does not make use of ADS-B's aircraft flight information in the TCAS conflict detection algorithms; ADS-B is used only to identify aircraft that can safely be interrogated at a lower rate.

In the future, prediction capabilities may be improved by using the state vector information present in ADS-B messages. Also, since ADS-B messages can be received at greater range than TCAS normally operates, aircraft can be acquired earlier by the TCAS tracking algorithms.

The identity information present in ADS-B messages can be used to label other aircraft on the cockpit display (where present), painting a picture similar to what an air traffic controller would see and improving situational awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narcap.org/articles/hci_aero.pdf Potential cooperation between TCAS and ASAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717192103/http://www.narcap.org/articles/hci_aero.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TOR_ADS-B&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtca.org/CMS_DOC/TOR%20-%20Initial%20-%20ADS-B%20-%20TCAS%20Relationship.pdf |title=Terms of Reference - Future ADS-B / TCAS Relationships |access-date=2011-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929020441/http://www.rtca.org/CMS_DOC/TOR%20-%20Initial%20-%20ADS-B%20-%20TCAS%20Relationship.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks to TCAS and ADS-B==
The major demonstrated problem of the [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast|ADS-B]] protocol integration is this added verbosity of the extra information transmitted, which is considered unnecessary for collision avoidance purposes.  The more data transmitted from one aircraft in accordance with the system design, the lesser the number of aircraft that can participate in the system, due to the fixed and limited channel data bandwidth (1 megabit/second with the 26/64 data bits to packet length bit capacity of the Mode S downlink data format packet).  For every Mode S message of 64 bits, the overhead demands 8 for clock sync at the receiver and Mode S packet discovery, 6 for type of Mode S packet, 24 for who it came from.  Since that leaves only 26 for information, multiple packets must be used to convey a single message.  The [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast|ADS-B]] "fix" proposal is to go to a 128 bit packet, which is not an accepted international standard.&lt;ref name="ADS-B_UAT"/&gt;  Either approach increases channel traffic above the level sustainable for environments such as the Los Angeles Basin.

===Passive===
{{see also|Portable Collision Avoidance System}}
Collision Avoidance systems which rely on [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]] replies triggered by ground and airborne systems are considered passive.  Ground and airborne interrogators query nearby transponders for mode C altitude information, which can be monitored by third-party systems for traffic information. Passive systems display traffic similar to TCAS, however generally have a range of less than {{convert|7|nmi|km}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===TCAS I===
TCAS I is a cheaper but less capable system than the modern TCAS II system introduced for [[general aviation]] use after the FAA mandate for TCAS II in air transport aircraft. TCAS I systems are able to monitor the traffic situation around a plane (to a range of about 40 miles) and offer information on the approximate bearing and altitude of other aircraft. It can also generate collision warnings in the form of a "Traffic Advisory" (TA). The TA warns the pilot that another aircraft is in near vicinity, announcing ''"Traffic, traffic"'', but does not offer any suggested remedy; it is up to the pilot to decide what to do, usually with the assistance of Air Traffic Control. When a threat has passed, the system announces ''"Clear of conflict"''.&lt;ref name=FAA-TCAS&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS.htm FAA TCAS Home Page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721040203/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TCAS II===
TCAS II is the first system that was introduced in 1989 and is the current generation of instrument warning TCAS, used in the majority of [[commercial aviation]] aircraft (see table below). A US Airways 737 was the first aircraft certified with the AlliedBendix (now Honeywell) TCAS II system.  It offers all the benefits of TCAS I, but will also offer the pilot direct, vocalized instructions to avoid danger, known as a "Resolution Advisory" (RA). The suggestive action may be "corrective", suggesting the pilot change vertical speed by announcing, ''"Descend, descend"'', ''"Climb, climb"'' or ''"Adjust Vertical Speed Adjust"'' (meaning reduce vertical speed). By contrast a "preventive" RA may be issued which simply warns the pilots not to deviate from their present vertical speed, announcing, ''"Monitor vertical speed"'' or ''"Maintain vertical speed, Maintain"''. TCAS II systems coordinate their resolution advisories before issuing commands to the pilots, so that if one aircraft is instructed to descend, the other will typically be told to climb &amp;mdash; maximising the separation between the two aircraft.&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;

As of 2006, the only implementation that meets the ACAS II standards set by [[ICAO]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_ICAO_Provisions.html ACAS II ICAO Provisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421004027/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_ICAO_Provisions.html |date=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was Version 7.0 of TCAS II,&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt; produced by three avionics manufacturers: [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Honeywell]], and ACSS (Aviation Communication &amp; Surveillance Systems; an [[L3 Technologies]] and [[Thales Group|Thales Avionics]] joint venture company).

After the [[Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937|Überlingen mid-air collision]] (July 1, 2002), studies have been made to improve TCAS II capabilities. Following extensive [[Eurocontrol]] input and pressure, a revised TCAS II Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) document has been jointly developed by RTCA (Special Committee SC-147&lt;ref name=SC-147&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtca.org/CMS_DOC/SC-147%20TOR%20Rev9%20-%20PMC%20Approved%20-%2006-10-2010.pdf |title=SC-147 Terms of Reference - Revision 9 |access-date=2011-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929020450/http://www.rtca.org/CMS_DOC/SC-147%20TOR%20Rev9%20-%20PMC%20Approved%20-%2006-10-2010.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and EUROCAE. As a result, by 2008 the standards for Version 7.1 of TCAS II have been issued&lt;ref name=SIRE&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/SIRE+_WP7_69D_v1.2.pdf Decision criteria for regulatory measures on TCAS II version 7.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612131435/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/SIRE+_WP7_69D_v1.2.pdf |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published as RTCA DO-185B&lt;ref name="DO-185"/&gt; (June 2008) and EUROCAE ED-143 (September 2008).

TCAS II Version 7.1&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt; will be able to issue RA reversals in coordinated encounters, in case one of the aircraft doesn't follow the original RA instructions (Change proposal CP112E).&lt;ref name=CP112E&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP112E.pdf Change proposal CP112E] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109091211/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP112E.pdf |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes in this version are the replacement of the ambiguous ''"Adjust Vertical Speed, Adjust"'' RA with the ''"Level off, Level off"'' RA, to prevent improper response by the pilots (Change proposal CP115).;&lt;ref name=CP115&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP115.pdf Change proposal CP115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109091245/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP115.pdf |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the improved handling of corrective/preventive annunciation and removal of green arc display when a positive RA weakens solely due to an extreme low or high altitude condition (1000 feet AGL or below, or near the aircraft top ceiling) to prevent incorrect and possibly dangerous guidance to the pilot (Change proposal CP116).&lt;ref name="CP116"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EUROTCAS71&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_Upcoming_Changes.html EUROCONTROL - TCAS II Version 7.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421004001/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_Upcoming_Changes.html |date=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies conducted for [[Eurocontrol]], using recently recorded operational data, indicate that currently{{when|date=July 2012}} the probability of a [[mid-air collision]] for each flight hour in European airspace is 2.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; which equates to one in every 3 years. When TCAS II Version 7.1 is implemented, that probability will be reduced by a factor of 4.&lt;ref name="EUROTCAS71"/&gt;

Although ACAS III is mentioned as a future system in ICAO Annex 10, ACAS III is unlikely to materialize due to difficulties the current surveillance systems have with horizontal tracking. Currently, research is being conducted to develop a future collision avoidance system (under the working name of ACAS X).&lt;ref name="EuroControl on ACAS III"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_Overview_Principles.html#typesacas |title=EUROCONTROL - ACAS II Overview and Principles |publisher=Eurocontrol.int |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927195004/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_Overview_Principles.html#typesacas |archive-date=2013-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TCAS III===
Originally designated TCAS II Enhanced, TCAS III was envisioned as an expansion of the TCAS II concept to include horizontal resolution advisory capability. TCAS III was the "next generation" of collision avoidance technology which underwent development by aviation companies such as [[Honeywell]]. TCAS III incorporated technical upgrades to the TCAS II system, and had the capability to offer traffic advisories and resolve traffic conflicts using ''horizontal'' as well as vertical manouevring directives to pilots. For instance, in a head-on situation, one aircraft might be directed, "turn right, climb" while the other would be directed "turn right, descend." This would act to further increase the total separation between aircraft, in both horizontal and vertical aspects.  Horizontal directives would be useful in a conflict between two aircraft close to the ground where there may be little if any vertical maneuvering space.&lt;ref name=TCASIII&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/publications/publication-files/atc-reports/Burgess_1995_ATC-231_WW-15318.pdf |title=Project Report ATC-231 |access-date=2011-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613065823/http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/publications/publication-files/atc-reports/Burgess_1995_ATC-231_WW-15318.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TCAS III attempts to use the TCAS directional antenna to assign a bearing to other aircraft, and thus be able to generate a horizontal maneuver (e.g. turn left or right). However, it was judged by the industry to be unfeasible due to limitations in the accuracy of the TCAS directional antennas.  The directional antennas were judged not to be accurate enough to generate an accurate horizontal-plane position, and thus an accurate horizontal resolution. By 1995, years of testing and analysis determined that the concept was unworkable using available surveillance technology (due to the inadequacy of horizontal position information), and that horizontal RAs were unlikely to be invoked in most encounter geometries. Hence, all work on TCAS III was suspended and there are no plans for its implementation. The concept has later evolved and been replaced by TCAS IV.&lt;ref name=skybrary&gt;[http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/ACAS Skybrary ACAS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sci_aeronautics&gt;[http://yarchive.net/air/airliners/tcas.html TCAS and Transponders]&lt;/ref&gt;

===TCAS IV===
TCAS IV uses additional information encoded by the target aircraft in the Mode S [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] reply (i.e. target encodes its own position into the transponder signal) to generate a horizontal resolution to an RA. In addition, some reliable source of position (such as [[Inertial navigation system|Inertial Navigation System]] or [[GPS]]) is needed on the target aircraft in order for it to be encoded.

TCAS IV has replaced the TCAS III concept by the mid 1990s. One of the results of TCAS III experience has been that the directional antenna used by the TCAS processor to assign a bearing to a received [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] reply is not accurate enough to generate an accurate horizontal position, and thus a safe horizontal resolution. TCAS IV uses additional position information encoded on an air-to-air data link to generate the bearing information, so the accuracy of the directional antenna would not be a factor.

TCAS IV development continued for some years, but the appearance of new trends in data link such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast ([[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast|ADS-B]]) have pointed out a need to re-evaluate whether a data link system dedicated to collision avoidance such as TCAS IV should be incorporated into a more generic system of air-to-air data link for additional applications.  As a result of these issues, the TCAS IV concept was abandoned as [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast|ADS-B]] development started.&lt;ref name="sci_aeronautics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAA_TCAS&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/nextgen/research_tech_dev/eng_dev_serv/tcas/ FAA Engineering Development Services Group - TCAS Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426234440/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/nextgen/research_tech_dev/eng_dev_serv/tcas/ |date=2011-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current implementation==
Although the system occasionally suffers from false alarms, pilots are now under strict instructions to regard all TCAS messages as genuine alerts demanding an immediate, high-priority response.  Only Windshear Detection and [[Ground Proximity Warning System|GPWS]] alerts and warnings have higher priority than the TCAS.  The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], EASA and most other countries' authorities' rules state that in the case of a conflict between TCAS RA and [[air traffic control]] (ATC) instructions, the TCAS RA always takes precedence (this is mainly because of the TCAS-RA inherently possessing a more current and comprehensive picture of the situation than air traffic controllers, whose [[radar]]/[[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] updates usually happen at a much slower rate than the TCAS interrogations).&lt;ref name="TCAS70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAS71"/&gt;
If one aircraft follows a TCAS RA and the other follows conflicting ATC instructions, a collision can occur, such as the July 1, 2002 [[Überlingen mid-air collision|Überlingen disaster]]. In this mid-air collision, both airplanes were fitted with TCAS II Version 7.0 systems which functioned properly, but one obeyed the TCAS advisory while the other ignored the TCAS and obeyed the controller; both aircraft descended into a fatal collision.&lt;ref name=BFUAX001&gt;[http://www.bfu-web.de/cln_003/nn_53140/EN/Publications/Investigation_20Report/2002/Report__02__AX001-1-2___C3_9Cberlingen__Report,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Report_02_AX001-1-2_%C3%9Cberlingen_Report.pdf BFU Investigation Report AX001-1-2/02] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123052035/http://www.bfu-web.de/cln_003/nn_53140/EN/Publications/Investigation_20Report/2002/Report__02__AX001-1-2___C3_9Cberlingen__Report%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf/Report_02_AX001-1-2_%C3%9Cberlingen_Report.pdf |date=2007-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This accident could have been prevented if TCAS was able to reverse the original RA for one of the aircraft when it detects that the crew of the other one is not following their original TCAS RA, but conflicting ATC instructions instead. This is one of the features that will be implemented within Version 7.1 of TCAS II.&lt;ref name="SIRE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/acas/TCAS-SAF-T2-D07_v1.2.pdf TCAS Safety Study - Collision risk due to TCAS safety issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182717/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/acas/TCAS-SAF-T2-D07_v1.2.pdf |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/acas/TCAS-SAF-T2-D08_v2.0.pdf TCAS Safety Study - Collision risk due to TCAS safety issues (Presentation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182809/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/gallery/content/public/documents/acas/TCAS-SAF-T2-D08_v2.0.pdf |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of TCAS II Version 7.1 has been originally planned to start between 2009 and 2011 by retrofitting and forward fitting all the TCAS II equipped aircraft, with the goal that by 2014 the version 7.0 will be completely phased out and replaced by version 7.1. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] have already published the TCAS II Version 7.1 Technical Standard Order (TSO-C119c&lt;ref name=TSO-C119c&gt;[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgtso.nsf/0/95b393711426c9c78625759b006481ea/$FILE/TSO-C119c.pdf FAA Technical Standard Order TSO-C119c]&lt;/ref&gt; and ETSO-C119c,&lt;ref name=ETSO-C119c&gt;[http://easa.europa.eu/ws_prod/g/doc/Agency_Mesures/Agency_Decisions/2009/cs_etso_5/Annex%20II%20-%20ETSO.pdf European Technical Standard Order ETSO-C119c]&lt;/ref&gt; respectively) effective since 2009, based on the RTCA DO-185B&lt;ref name="DO-185"/&gt; and EUROCAE ED-143 standards. On 25 September 2009 [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued Advisory Circular AC 20-151A&lt;ref name=AC-20-151A&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2020-151A.pdf FAA Advisory Circular AC 20-151A - Airworthiness Approval of Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS II), Versions 7.0 &amp; 7.1 and Associated Mode S Transponders]&lt;/ref&gt; providing guidance for obtaining airworthiness approval for TCAS II systems, including the new version 7.1. On 5 October 2009 the [[Association of European Airlines|Association of European Airlines (AEA)]] published a Position Paper&lt;ref name=AEA-PP&gt;[http://hub.easa.europa.eu/crt/docs/viewcrdattachment/cid_41072/aid_460/fmd_3f25c67f0cd4b56f59cb31e18ad71a35 AEA Position Paper on TCAS Version 7.1 implementation]&lt;/ref&gt; showing the need to mandate TCAS II Version 7.1 on all aircraft as a matter of priority.

[[ICAO]] has circulated an amendment for formal member state agreement which recommends TCAS II Change 7.1 adoption by 1 January 2014 for forward fit and 1 January 2017 for retrofit. Following the feedback and comments from airline operators, [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] has proposed the following dates for the TCAS II Version 7.1 mandate in European airspace: forward fit (for new aircraft) 1 March 2012, retrofit (for existing aircraft) 1 December 2015. These dates are proposed dates, subject to further regulatory processes, and are not final until the Implementing Rule has been published.&lt;ref name="EUROTCAS71"/&gt;

===Current limitations===
&lt;!--
there are tons of sources listing tcas issues collected at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Traffic_collision_avoidance_system#TCAS_Issues
--&gt;
While the safety benefits of current TCAS implementations are self-evident, the full technical and operational potential of TCAS is not fully exploited due to limitations in current implementations (most of which will need to be addressed in order to further facilitate the design and implementation of [[Free flight (air traffic control)|Free flight]]) and [[Next Generation Air Transportation System|NextGen]]:

* Most TCAS II issues reported to the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) encompass anomalous or erroneous operation of TCAS II equipment, TCAS-induced distraction, airborne conflicts provoked by TCAS, and non-standard use of TCAS.&lt;ref name="asrs.arc.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/directline/dl4_tcas.htm |title=TCASII-Genie Out of the Bottle? |publisher=Asrs.arc.nasa.gov |date=1992-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Like a controller, TCAS II uses Mode C information to determine vertical separation on other traffic. Should Mode C even temporarily provide erroneous altitude information, an erroneous Resolution Advisory command to climb or descend may result. Unlike a controller, TCAS II cannot query the flight crew to determine if the problem lies with malfunctioning equipment.&lt;ref name="asrs.arc.nasa.gov"/&gt;
* Pilots frequently cite TCAS II related auditory and workload interference with normal cockpit duties.&lt;ref name="asrs.arc.nasa.gov"/&gt;
* Many TCAS incident reports received at the ASRS allege that pilot response to erroneous TCAS commands has promoted a conflict where, initially, none existed. Consider the following near mid-air collision (NMAC) where the TCAS II RA may well have been triggered by the high climb rate of air carrier (Y).&lt;ref name="asrs.arc.nasa.gov"/&gt;
* TCAS is limited to supporting only vertical separation advisories, more complex traffic conflict scenarios may however be more easily and efficiently remedied by also making use of lateral resolution maneuvers; this applies in particular to traffic conflicts with marginal terrain clearance, or conflict scenarios that are similarly restricted by vertical constraints (e.g. in busy [[RVSM]] airspace)
* ATC can be automatically informed about resolution advisories issued by TCAS only when the aircraft is within an area covered by a Mode S, or an [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast|ADS-B]] monitoring network. In other cases controllers may be unaware of TCAS-based resolution advisories or even issue conflicting instructions (unless ATC is explicitly informed by cockpit crew members about an issued RA during a high-workload situation), which may be a source of confusion for the affected crews while additionally also increasing pilot work load. In May 2009, Luxembourg, Hungary and the Czech Republic show downlinked RAs to controllers.
* In the above context, TCAS lacks automated facilities to enable pilots to easily report and acknowledge reception of a (mandatory) RA to ATC (and intention to comply with it), so that voice radio is currently the only option to do so, which however additionally increases pilot and ATC workload, as well as frequency congestion during critical situations.
* In the same context, situational awareness of ATC depends on exact information about aircraft maneuvering, especially during conflict scenarios that may possibly cause or contribute to new conflicts by deviating from planned routing, so automatically visualizing issued resolution advisories and recalculating the traffic situation within the affected sector would obviously help ATC in updating and maintaining situational awareness even during unplanned, ad hoc routing changes induced by separation conflicts.
* Today's TCAS displays do not provide information about resolution advisories issued to other (conflicting) aircraft, while resolution advisories issued to other aircraft may seem irrelevant to another aircraft, this information would enable and help crews to assess whether other aircraft (conflicting traffic) actually comply with RAs by comparing the actual rate of (altitude) change with the requested rate of change (which could be done automatically and visualized accordingly by modern avionics), thereby providing crucial realtime information for situational awareness during highly critical situations.
* TCAS displays today are often primarily range-based, as such they only show the traffic situation within a configurable range of miles/feet, however under certain circumstances a "time-based" representation (i.e. within the next xx minutes) might be more intuitive.
* Lack of terrain/ground and obstacle awareness (e.g. connection to [[Terrain awareness and warning system|TAWS]], including [[Minimum Safety Altitude|MSA]] sector awareness), which might be critical for creating feasible (non-dangerous, in the context of terrain clearance) and useful resolution advisories (i.e. prevent extreme descent instructions if close to terrain), to ensure that TCAS RAs never facilitate [[Controlled flight into terrain|CFIT]] (Controlled Flight into Terrain) scenarios.
* Aircraft performance in general and current performance capabilities in particular (due to active aircraft configuration) are not taken into account during the negotiation and creation of resolution advisories (as it is the case for differences between different types of aircraft, e.g. turboprop/jet vs. helicopters), so that it is theoretically possible that resolution advisories are issued that demand climb or sink rates outside the normal/safe flight envelope of an aircraft during a certain phase of flight (i.e. due to the aircraft's current configuration). Furthermore, as all traffic is being dealt with equally, there's no distinction taking place between different types of aircraft, neglecting the option of exploiting aircraft-specific (performance) information to issue customized and optimized instructions for any given traffic conflict (i.e. by issuing climb instructions to those aircraft that can provide the best climb rates, while issuing descend instructions to aircraft providing comparatively better sink rates, thereby hopefully maximizing altitude change per time unit, that is separation).  As an example, TCAS can order an aircraft to climb when it is already at its service ceiling for its current configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/361350 |title=New Zealand B747 Close Midair Encounter Civil Aviation Forum |publisher=Airliners.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* TCAS is primarily extrapolation-oriented, as such it is using algorithms trying to approximate 4D trajectory prediction using the "flight path history", in order to assess and evaluate the current traffic situation within an aircraft's proximity, however the degree of data- reliability and usefulness could be significantly improved by enhancing said information with limited access to relevant flight plan information, as well as to relevant ATC instructions to get a more comprehensive picture of other traffic's (route) plans and intentions, so that flight path predictions would no longer be merely based on estimations but rather ''actual'' aircraft routing ([[Flight management system|FMS]] [[flight plan]]) and ATC instructions. If TCAS is modified to use data that are used by other systems, care will be required to ensure that the risks of common failure modes are sufficiently small.
* TCAS is not fitted to many smaller aircraft mainly due to the high costs involved (between $25,000 and $150,000). Many smaller personal business jets for example, are currently not legally required to have TCAS installed, even though they fly in the same airspace as larger aircraft that are required to have proper TCAS equipment on board. The TCAS system can only perform at its true operational potential once all aircraft in any given airspace have a properly working TCAS unit on board.
* TCAS requires that both conflicting aircraft have transponders. If one aircraft doesn't have a transponder, then it will not alert TCAS as there is no information being transmitted.

To overcome some of these limitations, the FAA is developing a new collision avoidance logic based on dynamic programming.

In response to a series of midair collisions involving commercial airliners, [[Lincoln Laboratory]] was directed by the Federal Aviation Administration in the 1970s to participate in the development of an onboard collision avoidance system. In its current manifestation, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System is mandated worldwide on all large aircraft and has significantly improved the safety of air travel, but major changes to the airspace planned over the coming years will require substantial modification to the system.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol19_no1/19_1_1_Kochenderfer.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210134046/https://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol19_no1/19_1_1_Kochenderfer.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of new systems called ACAS X&lt;ref name="ACAS X"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=2f662f1bf8e4d2131dabefb5eac1813c&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 |title=99-Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS X) - 12302 (Archived) - Federal Business Opportunities: Opportunities |publisher=Fbo.gov |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; will use this new logic:

* ACAS Xa will be a direct replacement for TCAS II, using active surveillance
* ACAS Xo will be collision avoidance tuned to work in some currently difficult operational situations, notably closely spaced parallel approaches.
* ACAS Xu will allow multiple sensor inputs and be optimised for unmanned airborne systems.
* ACAS Xp will be designed for aircraft with only passive surveillance (ADS-B).

The first FAA-scheduled industry meeting was held in October 2011 in Washington DC, to brief avionics manufacturers on the development plans for "ACAS X" – including flight demonstrations scheduled for fiscal 2013. The FAA says its work "will be foundational to the development of minimum operational performance standards" for ACAS X by standards developer RTCA.&lt;ref name="AviationWeek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:7a78f54e-b3dd-4fa6-ae6e-dff2ffd7bdbb&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A7a78f54e-b3dd-4fa6-ae6e-dff2ffd7bdbbPost%3Ac92e0354-322d-49ef-91a5-f705b309324b |title=FAA Developing Next-Generation TCAS |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2013-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927025918/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:7a78f54e-b3dd-4fa6-ae6e-dff2ffd7bdbb&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A7a78f54e-b3dd-4fa6-ae6e-dff2ffd7bdbbPost%3Ac92e0354-322d-49ef-91a5-f705b309324b |archive-date=2013-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that, if ACAS X will be further developed and certified, ACAS X will not be commercially available before mid 2020s. And it is said to be unclear at this stage whether ACAS X would provide any horizontal resolutions.&lt;ref name="EuroControl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/faq/ACAS_FAQ.html#qa62 |title=EUROCONTROL - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=Eurocontrol.int |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512232702/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/faq/ACAS_FAQ.html#qa62 |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UNCF''', the '''United Negro College Fund''', also known as the '''United Fund''', is an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 37 private [[historically black colleges and universities]]. UNCF was incorporated on April 25, 1944 by [[Frederick D. Patterson]] (then president of what is now [[Tuskegee University]]), [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and others. UNCF is headquartered at 1805 7th Street, NW in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="uncf-contact"&gt;"[http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/contact_us.asp Contact Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142807/http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/contact_us.asp |date=2013-10-02 }}". United Negro College Fund. Accessed October 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Look up the address 1805 7th Street, NW--&gt;  In 2005, UNCF supported approximately 65,000 students at over 900 colleges and universities with approximately $113 million in grants and scholarships. About 60% of these students are the first in their families to attend college, and 62% have annual family incomes of less than $25,000. UNCF also administers over 450 named scholarships.

UNCF's president and chief executive officer is [[Michael Lomax]]. Past presidents of the UNCF included [[William H. Gray (Pennsylvania politician)|William H. Gray]] and [[Vernon Jordan]].

==Scholarships==
Though founded to address funding inequities in education resources for [[African Americans]], UNCF-administered scholarships are open to all ethnicities; the great majority of recipients are still African-American. It provides scholarships to students attending its member colleges as well as to those going elsewhere.&lt;ref name="uncf-faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/faqs.asp |title=UNCF Faq |publisher=UNCF |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2013-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142851/http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/faqs.asp |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of UNCF member institutions and scholarships have included many blacks in the fields of business, politics, health care and the arts. Some prominent UNCF alumni include Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and leader in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]; [[Alexis Herman]], former [[U.S. Secretary of Labor]]; noted [[movie director]] [[Spike Lee]]; actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]]; [[General]] [[Chappie James]], the [[U.S. Air Force]]’s first black four-star general; and Dr. [[David Satcher]], a former [[U.S. Surgeon General]] and director of the [[Centers for Disease Control]].&lt;ref name="uncf-aboutus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/aboutus.asp |title=UNCF |publisher=UNCF |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2013-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142108/http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/aboutus.asp |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1944 [[William J. Trent]], a long time activist for education for blacks, joined with Tuskegee Institute President Frederick D. Patterson and Mary McLeod Bethune to found the UNCF, a nonprofit that united college presidents to raise money collectively through an "appeal to the national conscience". As the first executive director from the organization's start in 1944 until 1964, Trent raised $78 million for historically black colleges so they could become "strong citadels of learning, carriers of the American dream, seedbeds of social evolution and revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''Wharton Alumni Magazine'', Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the UNCF shifted from using its full name to using its initials, releasing a new logo with the initials alone and featuring their slogan more prominently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/business/media/17adco.html |title=Revising a Name, but Not a Familiar Slogan |last=Quenqua |first=Douglas |date=January 17, 2008 |website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/United-Negro-College-Fund/40274 |title=United Negro College Fund Decides Its Great Tag Line Is a Terrible Thing to Waste |last=Schmidt |first=Peter |date=January 17, 2008 |website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising and the Lou Rawls Parade of Stars ==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
[[File:United Negro College Fund DC.JPG|thumb|United Negro College Fund headquarters in Washington, D.C.]]
The UNCF has received charitable donations for its scholarship programs.  One of the more high-profile donations made was by then-senator and future [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] who donated the money from the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his book ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'' to the Fund. The largest ever single donation was made in 1990 by [[Walter Annenberg]], who donated $50 million to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/african/2000/1990.htm B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211134655/http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/african/2000/1990.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1980, singer [[Lou Rawls]] began the "Lou Rawls Parade of Stars" [[telethon]] to benefit the UNCF. The annual event, now known as "An Evening of Stars", consists of stories of successful African-American students who have graduated or benefited from one of the many historically black colleges and universities and who received support from the UNCF.  The telethon featured comedy and musical performances from various artists in support of the UNCF's and Rawls' efforts. The event has raised over $200 million in 27 shows for the fund through 2006.&lt;ref name="prnewstoday.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313124917/http://www.prnewstoday.com/release.htm?cat=music&amp;dat=20060106&amp;rl=DCF04006012006-1] &lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, Rawls was honored by the United Negro College Fund for his more than 25 years of charity work with the organization. Instead of Rawls' hosting and performing, he was given the seat of honor and celebrated by his performing colleagues, including [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Gerald Levert]], [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]], and several others. Before his death in January 2006, Rawls' last performance was a taping for the 2006 telethon that honored Wonder, months before entering the hospital after being diagnosed with cancer earlier in the year.&lt;ref name="prnewstoday.com"/&gt;

In addition to the telethon, there are a number of other fundraising activities, including the "Walk for Education" held annually in [[Los Angeles, California]], which includes a five kilometer walk/run. In [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], the [[Cypresswood Golf Club]] hosts an annual golf tournament in April.&lt;ref name="uncf-events"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncf.org/sections/Events/Events.asp |title=UNCF Events |publisher=UNCF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142226/http://www.uncf.org/sections/Events/Events.asp |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Koch Industries Inc.]] and the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] made a $25 million grant to UNCF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Koch brothers donate $25 million to United Negro College Fund|author=Sullivan, Sean|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/06/koch-brothers-donate-25-million-to-united-negro-college-fund/|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest of the Kochs, the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]], a major labor union, ended its yearly $50,000–60,000 support for UNCF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/10/koch-brother-grant-halts-union-support-for-united-negro-college-fund/ |title=Union halts support for United Negro College Fund over Koch brothers’ grant |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2014-07-11|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The UNCF motto==
In 1972, the UNCF adopted as its [[motto]] the maxim "A mind is a terrible thing to waste." This maxim has become one of the most widely recognized slogans in [[advertising]] history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verdant-systems.com/Mind.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183340/http://www.verdant-systems.com/Mind.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto was notably mangled in a 1989 address to the organization by then–Vice President of the United States [[Dan Quayle]], who stated: "And you take the U.N.C.F. model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is."&lt;ref&gt;Dowd, Maureen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/25/magazine/the-education-of-dan-quayle.html?pagewanted=all "The Education of Dan Quayle"]. ''The New York Times''. June 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
The motto, which has been used in numerous award-winning UNCF ad campaigns, was created by Forest Long, of the advertising agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]], in partnership with the [[Ad Council]].&lt;ref&gt;See the UNCF website.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesser-known slogan the UNCF also uses, in reference to its intended beneficiaries, points out about them, "[They're] not asking for a handout, just a hand."&lt;ref&gt;Gasman, Marybeth (2007). ''Envisioning Black Colleges: A History of the United Negro College Fund'' (page 192). Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|The video game|Unity of Command (video game)}}

'''Unity of command''' is ensuring unity of effort under one responsible person (or commander) for completing a task.

==American Military Principles==
This unity of command is one of the twelve principles of joint operations, and is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff |title= Joint Operations (Joint Publication 3-0) |url= http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf |date= 11 August 2011 |location= Washington, DC |page= A-2 |accessdate= 23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |text=Unity of command means that all forces operate under a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common purpose.  During multinational operations and interagency coordination, unity of command may not be possible, but the requirement for unity of effort becomes paramount. Unity of effort—the coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants are not necessarily part of the same command or organization—is the product of successful unified action.}}

==Military Problems==
When this unity of command principle is violated problems quickly develop.  A recent example involves the unprecedented departure of this principle in [[Afghanistan]] in 2006 when [[Combined Joint Task Force 180|Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan]] passed control of the ground fight to the [[International Security Assistance Force]].  This caused the operations to split between several unified commanders in charge of [[U.S. Central Command]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], and the [[U.S. Special Operations Command]], which caused significant operational problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Hope, Ian|title= Unity of Command in Afghanistan: A Forsaken Principle of War |url=https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=889 |publisher= Strategic Studies Institute |location= Carlisle Barracks, PA|date= November 2008|accessdate= 23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Voice for Children and Families''' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''Glas za otroke in družine'', short name ZA OTROKE!&lt;!-- http://mrrsp.gov.si/rdruobjave/ps/index.faces --&gt;) is a [[List of political parties in Slovenia|political party in Slovenia]]. The party was founded on 25 March 2017 by Aleš Primc and Metka Zevnik as an electoral arm of a movement of which they are also leaders of, the '''Movement for Children and Families''',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/zevnikova-in-primc-ustanavljata-stranko-glas-za-otroke-in-druzine/412446|title=Zevnikova in Primc ustanavljata stranko Glas za otroke in družine|newspaper=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initial purpose of which was to overturn a law passed by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]] which would recognize same sex marriage in the [[Slovenia|Republic of Slovenia]].

==Background==

The Movement, first called "'''Coalition For the Children!'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/foto-koalicija-za-otroke-gre-je-postala-gibanje-morda-nekoc-tudi-stranka/394040|title=Foto: Koalicija Za otroke gre je postala gibanje, morda nekoč tudi stranka|newspaper=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; collected a sufficient number of signatures to declare a referendum challenging the new Marriage and Family Relations Act, as per article 90 of the [[Constitution of Slovenia|Slovenian Constitution]]. The law was subsequently rejected when the [[Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum, 2015|referendum]] was held on 20 December 2015. Primc had since proposed an alternative law, which would grant more legal rights to same-sex couples, but would not recognize same-sex marriage or put same-sex couples them on an equal footing with opposite-sex couples regarding adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/primc-uvajamo-neregistrirano-istospolno-partnersko-skupnost/383768|title=Primc: Uvajamo neregistrirano istospolno partnersko skupnost|newspaper=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zurnal24.si/primc-pripravil-zakon-istospolnim-clanek-263651|title=Primc pripravil zakon istospolnim|last=zurnal24.si|newspaper=zurnal24|access-date=2017-02-12|language=sl_SI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/koalicija-za-otroke-gre-napoveduje-nov-zakon-primc-vstopa-v-politiko/381630|title=Koalicija Za otroke gre napoveduje nov zakon, Primc vstopa v politiko|newspaper=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Movement has also proposed a law aimed mainly at prioritizing grandparents regarding adoption of children whose biological parents are deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/gibanje-za-otroke-in-druzine-predstavilo-predlog-zakona-ki-ima-srce-ki-bije-in-je-zivo/401993|title=Gibanje za otroke in družine predstavilo predlog zakona, ki "ima srce, ki bije in je živo"|newspaper=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention to derive an electoral arm of the movement was hinted at subsequent to the referendum victory and officially announced on 14 January 2017.

The political party held its founding convention on 25 March 2017 in [[Škofja Loka]]. Aleš Primc was unanimously elected as party leader. Multiple prominent party officials stated that they expect divine assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042766884/slovenija/ustanovni-kongres-stranke-glas-v-politiko-zelijo-prinesti-pristne-tradicionalne-vrednote-ki-narod-ohranjajo-pri-zivljenju|title=Primčev glas za 30 tisoč novorojenčkov in višje plače {{!}} Dnevnik|website=www.dnevnik.si|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/primc-s-svojo-stranko-racuna-na-bozjo-pomoc.html|title=Primc s svojo stranko računa na božjo pomoč|work=www.delo.si|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/primceva-stranka-god-racuna-tudi-na-bozjo-pomoc.html|title=Primčeva stranka GOD računa tudi na božjo pomoč|work=24ur.com|access-date=2017-04-14|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://24kul.si/cestitke-ustanovljena-stranka-glas-za-otroke-in-druzine|title=Čestitke: Ustanovljena stranka Glas za otroke in družine!|last=življenja|first=KUL.si - Zavod za družino in kulturo|work=24KUL.si|access-date=2017-04-14|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/ustanovljena-stranka-za-otroke-visje-place-in-pokojnine-vec-spostovanja-mam-ocetov-otrok/418168|title=Ustanovljena stranka Za otroke: "Višje plače in pokojnine, več spoštovanja mam, očetov, otrok"|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, it was revealed that the party would be joining forces with former [[Maribor]] mayor [[Franc Kangler]]'s [[New People's Party of Slovenia]] to form '''United Right''', an [[electoral alliance]], to jointly contest the upcoming [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2018|2018 Slovenian parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.delo.si/novice/politika/primc-in-kangler-v-zdruzeni-desnici.html|title=Primc in Kangler v Združeni desnici|work=www.delo.si|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nova24tv.si/slovenija/politika/kangler-in-primc-zdruzujeta-moci-ustanavljata-zdruzeno-desnico/|title=Kangler in Primc združujeta moči – ustanavljata Združeno desnico! {{!}} Nova24TV|date=2018-02-20|work=Nova24TV|access-date=2018-03-04|language=sl-SI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political alignment and ties==

Primc has stated that he is willing to work with all parties where there is common ground, but that he sees himself closer to the two conservative parliamentary parties; [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] and [[New Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reporter.si/clanek/slovenija/ales-primc-na-celu-gibanja-za-otroke-in-druzine-danes-je-dan-veselja-in-upanja-475145|title=Aleš Primc na čelu Gibanja za otroke in družine: Danes je dan veselja in upanja  {{!}} Revija Reporter|website=Revija Reporter|language=sl-SI|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primc also serves as president of "Committee 2014" (Slovene: "''Odbor 2014''"), an organization which mainly organized protests in front of the [[Judiciary of Slovenia|Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia]], the central demand being the pardon of former prime minister and leader of the Slovenian Democratic Party [[Janez Janša]] and others (allegedly wrongly) convicted of corruption in the [[Patria case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odbor2014.si/o-nas/|title=O nas -  Odbor 2014|last=info@odbor2014.si|first=Odbor 2014, www.odbor2014.si,|website=odbor2014.si|language=sl|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primc is also a founding member, has a seat on the board of, and is a frequent guest and contributor on [[Nova24TV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042732876|title=Informativna televizija Nova24TV odslej nepridobitna {{!}} Dnevnik|website=www.dnevnik.si|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media company which has deep ties to SDS.

There has been speculation that the party will serve as a "satellite" of the largest parliamentary conservative party, the Slovenian Democratic Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/nedelo/vrhunci-leta-od-pol-milijona-jih-ni-ostalo-niti-400.html|title=Vrhunci leta: Od pol milijona jih ni ostalo niti 400|newspaper=www.delo.si|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/58779bfd8d24e/tretji-steber-med-murglami-in-trstenjakovo|title=Nova zavezništva na desnici|newspaper=Svet24.si|access-date=2017-02-12|language=sl-SI}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of its effort to politically and electorally undermine the other parliamentary conservative party, New Slovenia, for its perceived disloyalty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnevnik.si/1042727100|title=Ustanavlja Primc satelit SDS, da bi uničil NSi?  {{!}} Dnevnik|website=dnevnik.si|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the parties had previously partnered in coalition governments and shared political ties, but have since seen a schism and a cooling of relations with NSi leadership stating that the two parties cannot work together as long as Janez Janša remains as leader of SDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/obracun-sds-z-nsi-zaradi-izlocanja-janeza-janse.html|title=Obračun SDS z NSi zaradi izločanja Janeza Janše|newspaper=www.delo.si|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and Platform==

The 38 point party platform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zaotrokeindruzine.si/programska-deklaracija/|title=Programska deklaracija|date=2016-05-24|newspaper=Za Otroke In Družine|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally advocates a return to [[Social conservativism|traditional]] and [[Christian values]] (the first point of the summary states a need to a return to "the respect of life, [[family values|motherhood and fatherhood]], [[Culture of Slovenia|Slovenian culture]], work, [[Sabbath|Sunday's rest]], and [[Christianity]]"), [[Gender binary|binary gender identity]] and a [[Christian views on marriage|traditional marriage]]{{dn|date=September 2017}} and [[family|family structure]]. It states that any infraction into the life of unborn children, the old and the sick is unacceptable and rejects [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], advocating for free [[palliative care]] instead. It states that the Slovenian pension system and culture can survive only with a higher [[birth rate]], which should be pursued. All workers deserve a fair wage that is adequate for a decent living. A favorable economic environment should be created to battle emigration of young people who lack job opportunities in the country and also as a more favorable alternative to a [[welfare state]]. More attention should be given to the agricultural periphery. A fairer judiciary should be pursued to better grapple crime. The platform also states that there should be "self-defense" training mandatory for boys (with an option of [[community service]] for [[conscientious objector]]s) and optional for girls, and that a military and police reserve should be established.

The platform also states that the greatest danger to society are people who have political and social power and think and act as to be God, but there is only one God, that the phrase "unborn child" should be used instead of [[embryo]] and [[foetus]], that Sunday should be a work-free day for everyone whose work responsibility isn't essential, and that all [[state-owned enterprise]]s that are structurally and economically important should remain state-owned and run responsibly and profitably, with an amendment added to the constitution that anyone found guilty of corruption or damaging the assets of state-owned companies should be forbidden from doing business with the state or managing state property for life. It is also stated that the party respects the traditional left and their advocacy of worker rights, but that it has been supplanted by [[antitheism|militant atheism]] and hatred of the different-minded. It states that everyone has a right to refuse service on the basis of one's beliefs. Private medical practice should more readily be accommodated into the public healthcare system. Measures to curb all types of addictions, including to pornography and computer games, should be introduced. Asylum for Christian refugees should be prioritized.

During the founding convention (though this was reported only by a single source), it was also stated that the party would, among other measures, seek to bestow voting rights to children aged 14 and older (though only if under supervision of their parents), and multiple votes to parents; one vote for every child under the aforementioned age (though it was not specified how the votes would be divided among the children's parents). The purpose of this measure would ostensibly be to encourage higher birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mladina.si/179411/do-boga-prijazna-slovenija/|title=Do Boga prijazna Slovenija  {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelca Likovič, who has represented the Movement in various TV appearances, has stated that "We are fighting so that our descendants have Slovenian roots, and that is why we encourage all mothers to give birth, [[pregnancy from rape|even the ones who were raped]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mladina.si/176876/zivljenje-po-tarci/|title=Življenje po Tarči / MLADINA.si|newspaper=Mladina.si|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mladina.si/176821/jutranja-demagogija/|title=Jutranja demagogija {{!}} MLADINA.si|newspaper=Mladina.si|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement subsequently awarded Likovič a "[[White Rose]]" award for her "untiring fight for the rights of unborn children".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://24kul.si/angelci-likovic-bela-vrtnica|title=Angelca Likovič prejemnica priznanja BELA VRTNICA|last=življenja|first=KUL.si - Zavod za družino in kulturo|newspaper=24KUL.si|access-date=2017-02-11|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3351">'''Water diplomacy''' focuses on establishing novel solutions founded on a scientific basis and sensitive to societal constraints to a wide range of water problems.&lt;ref name="wdtufts" /&gt; Tools of water diplomats include [[environmental policy]], [[Natural resource management|water management strategy]], and [[Environmental engineering|engineering solutions]] and are applied within the context of the individual water problem at the appropriate scale.&lt;ref name="wdtufts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldwaterforum2009" /&gt;

== Emerging Approaches to Water Diplomacy ==
Water problems involve stakeholders such as agriculture and industry, [[Urban planning|urban developers]] and [[Conservation (ethic)|environmental conservationists]] competing for the limited and common resource of available water.&lt;ref name="wdtufts" /&gt; These problems also cross physical, disciplinary, and jurisdictional boundaries.&lt;ref name="wdtufts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="islam2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susskind|first=Lawrence|author2=Shafiqul Islam |title=Water Diplomacy: Creating Value and Building Trust in Transboundary Water Negotiations|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2012-08-22|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2012/water-diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these competing needs and objectives, it is difficult to find acceptable solutions to water problems.&lt;ref name="islam2010" /&gt;

The “Water 2100” approach, differing from other tools used in water politics and traditional diplomacy, is to examine problems as an interconnected grouping of natural and societal domains in which competition and feedbacks occur between variables. The natural constraints of quantity, quality, and ecosystem needs interact with societal domain variables including social values/norms, economy, and governance. This “Water 2100” approach seeks to synthesize scientific and contextual water knowledge into actionable solutions through formulating/framing water problems as questions that can be used to negotiate solutions appropriate to the context and stakeholders for each water dispute.&lt;ref name="islam2010" /&gt;

The '''Westminster Foundation for Democracy''' ('''WFD''') is a [[United Kingdom]] [[non-departmental public body]] set up to promote [[democracy|democratic institutions]] overseas. It was established in March 1992 and registered as a [[company limited by guarantee]]. It receives funding from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and the [[Department for International Development]]. The current chair of the organisation is [[Henry Bellingham (Norfolk MP)|Henry Bellingham]] MP and the current chief executive is Anthony Smith CMG.

WFD works to achieve sustainable political change in emerging democracies. Working with and through partner organisations, the Foundation seeks to strengthen the institutions of democracy, principally political parties (through the work of the UK political parties), parliaments and the range of institutions that make up civil society – [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs), trade unions and free media, among others.

As of 2016 WFD had a budget of about £7 million, of which about £2.5 million was spent through the major [[UK political parties]]. The WFD accounts are presented to the UK parliament annually.&lt;ref name=economist-20070111&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8522438 |title=It depends who's counting |newspaper=The Economist |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wfd-20170719&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.wfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/6.3439_WFD_SB_Annual-Report-1617_v14web.pdf |title=Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017 |publisher=Westminster Foundation for Democracy |date=19 July 2017 |accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">The term '''white savior''', sometimes combined with [[savior complex]] to write '''white savior complex''', refers to a [[white people|white person]] who acts to help non-white people, with the help in some contexts perceived to be self-serving. The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]" (1899) by [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="zane"&gt;{{cite news | last=Zane | first=Damian | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36132482 | title=Barbie challenges the 'white saviour complex' | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=May 1, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures. Writer [[Teju Cole]] combined the term and "industrial complex" (derived from [[military-industrial complex]] and similarly applied elsewhere) to coin "White Savior Industrial Complex".

==Association with Africa==
{{see also|Aid}}
Africa has a [[slavery in Africa|history of slavery]] and [[Colonisation of Africa|of colonization]]. Damian Zane of [[BBC News]] said due to the history, Africans find the "white savior" attitude to help them "deeply patronising and offensive". Zane said, "Some argue that aid can be counter-productive, as it means African countries will continue to rely on outside help."&lt;ref name="zane" /&gt; Bhakti Shringarpure, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said, "Westerners trying to help poor, suffering countries have often been accused of having a 'white saviour complex': a term tied up in colonial history where Europeans descended to 'civilise' the African continent."&lt;ref name="shringarpure"&gt;{{cite news | last=Shringarpure | first=Bhakti | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/digital-saviour-saving-lives-internet-age-save-darfur | title=The rise of the digital saviour: can Facebook likes change the world? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 18, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Karen Attiah]] said the white savior framework in Africa "follows the venerable tradition" of the novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) by [[Joseph Conrad]] and that the tradition included the film ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]'' (2011), the public relations campaign related to the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' (2012), and the writings of journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]].&lt;ref name="attiah"&gt;{{cite news | last=Attiah | first=Karen | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/06/louise-linton-just-wrote-the-perfect-white-savior-in-africa-story/ | title=Louise Linton just wrote the perfect White-Savior-in-Africa story | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awad said the interest in volunteering encouraged a business model that leverages a country's existing social issues and charges tourists for volunteering to be a "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Awad | first=Amal | url=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2016/04/28/when-saviour-becomes-story | title=When the saviour becomes the story | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] | date=April 28, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baaz, Gondola, Marijnen, and Verweijen, writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', were critical of the "white savior complex" in the 2014 documentary ''[[Virunga (film)|Virunga]]'', which features the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Virunga National Park]] and the conservation work of its [[park ranger]]s. They said, "The movie features endless footage of a park guard hugging and playing with the gorillas, evoking the notion of the 'noble savage' who is close to nature, honest and naive, and dependent on the white man for his salvation. Rarely do we see the Congolese exercising political agency, even though there are numerous civil society activists in the region, often working at great personal risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baaz | first1=Maria Eriksson | last2=Gondola | first2=Didier | last3=Marijnen | first3=Esther | last4=Verweijen | first4=Judith | url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2015-03-05/virungas-white-savior-complex | title=Virunga's White Savior Complex | work=[[Foreign Affairs]] | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in film==
{{main|White savior narrative in film}}
In film, the white savior is a [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] in which a [[white people|white]] character rescues [[person of color|people of color]] from their plight. The white savior is portrayed as messianic and often learns something about themselves in the process of rescuing.&lt;ref name="temple1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2263_reg.html | title=Matthew W. Hughey: The White Savior Film | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trope reflects how media represents [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] by racializing concepts like morality as identifiable with white people over nonwhite people.&lt;ref name="temple2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/authors/2263_qa.html | title=Interview with Matthew W. Hughey | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White saviors are often male and are sometimes out of place in their own society until they lead minorities or foreigners. ''Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness'' labels the stories as fantasies that "are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic". Types of stories include white travels to "exotic" Asian locations, white defense against racism in the [[Southern United States|American South]], or white protagonists having "racially diverse" helpers.&lt;ref name="vera"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Vera | first1=Hernán | last2=Gordon | first2=Andrew M. | year=2003 | chapter=The Beautiful White American: Sincere Fictions of the Savior | title=Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | isbn=978-1-4616-4286-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in television==

Stephanie Greco Larson, writing in ''Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment'', said ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1978–1986) and ''[[Webster (TV series)|Webster]]'' (1983–1987) were "shows in which white families adopt black children" and represented versions of "the white man's burden theme on television".&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite book | last=Larson | first=Stephanie Greco | year=2006 | chapter=African Americans in Film and Television Entertainment | title=Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment | series=Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics | publisher=Rowmn &amp; Littlefield | isbn=978-0-8476-9453-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin R. Means Coleman said, "In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=Robin R. Means | year=2003 | chapter=Black Sitcom Portrayals | editor1-last=Dines | editor1-first=Gail | editor2-last=Humez | editor2-first=Jean M. | title=Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader | edition=2nd | publisher=SAGE | isbn=978-0-7619-2261-2 | page=83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''Diff'rent Strokes'' featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian [[Donald Bogle]] said, "The millionaire Drummond becomes a ''great white father figure'', able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match." Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a "white savior" type who uses "his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties" including the indigenous representative Longwalker in the episode "Burial Ground". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of ''[[Punky Brewster]]'' featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping "ancient Indians [who] suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their ''Last of the Dogmen''-like secret existence intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tahmahkera | first=Dustin | year=2014 | chapter=Settler Self-Determination | title=Tribal Television: Viewing Native People in Sitcoms | publisher=UNC Press Books | isbn=978-1-4696-1869-2 | pages=96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson said, "Inner-city schools have been the site of white man's burden dramas on television for decades" with TV series featuring white savior teachers. Larson identified the following series with such teachers: ''[[Room 222]]'' (1969–1974), ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' (1975–1979), ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'' (1978–1981), and ''[[Boston Public]]'' (2000–2004). Larson said while ''Room 222'' and ''Boston Public'' also had black teachers that "challenge the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior... these shows continue to avoid laying blame on social institutions for the status of blacks by showing the success of the individual black teachers."&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;

The TV series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' (2017–) features [[Finn Jones]] as the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Both the originating comic book character and the TV series actor are white. Prior to the series airing ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the casting had received criticism for not changing the character to be Asian-American. The newspaper quoted arguments put forward by Keith Chow, editor-in-chief of ''The Nerds of Color'' pop culture blog, "If you’re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?" Jones denied that Iron Fist would be a white savior figure and said that the series would address critics' concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Victor | first=Daniel | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/television/iron-fist-actor-at-center-of-whitewashing-debate-asks-fans-to-wait-and-see.html | title='Iron Fist' Actor, at Center of Whitewashing Debate, Asks Fans to Wait and See | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 8, 2017 | accessdate=March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="White Savior Industrial Complex"==
[[File:Teju Cole.jpg|right|thumbnail|Writer Teju Cole, who coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex"]]
Writer [[Teju Cole]] coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex" following the release of the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' in March 2012, extrapolating the term in a seven-part response on [[Twitter]]. He later wrote an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cole | first=Teju | authorlink=Teju Cole | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/the-white-savior-industrial-complex/254843/ | title=The White-Savior Industrial Complex | journal=[[The Atlantic]] | date=March 21, 2012 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote frame|
# From Sachs to Kristof to Invisible Children to TED, the fastest growth industry in the US is the White Savior Industrial Complex.
# The white savior supports brutal policies in the morning, founds charities in the afternoon, and receives awards in the evening.
# The banality of evil transmutes into the banality of sentimentality. The world is nothing but a problem to be solved by enthusiasm.
# This world exists simply to satisfy the needs--including, importantly, the sentimental needs--of white people and Oprah.
# The White Savior Industrial Complex is not about justice. It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.
# Feverish worry over that awful African warlord. But close to 1.5 million Iraqis died from an American war of choice. Worry about that.
# I deeply respect American sentimentality, the way one respects a wounded hippo. You must keep an eye on it, for you know it is deadly.

Cole's response became a [[viral phenomenon]], and ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Bhakti Shringarpure reflected on the supportive Internet response to the ''Kony 2012'' political campaign, "With the prevalence of campaigns, apps and games calling on us to help without really putting ourselves out, it seems that the white saviour idea is still alive and well – but now, the mode is digital."&lt;ref name="shringarpure" /&gt; Heather Laine Talley, writing in ''Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance'', said of the response to Cole coining the term, "The very idea of the white savior industrial complex was met with both celebration and rage. Cole was alternately described as a truth teller and as a racist." Talley summarized Cole's response to his critics, "Ultimately, Cole implores Western (white) do-gooders to rethink doing good in two ways. First, own up to the motives that drive philanthropic interventions, so that personal catharsis does not subsume the real need of others. Second, consider the structural underpinnings and historical legacies that together sustain the very infrastructure of the problems that captivate our activist hearts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Talley | first=Heather Laine | year=2014 | title=Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-8411-2 | pages=128–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Engles, writing in ''Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education'', concurred with Cole's assessment, "The lack of real-world efficacy of their efforts, and the apparent unwillingness of most to go any further than such limited and self-aggrandizing steps, suggests that mere validation of white racial privilege was indeed the most significant outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Engles | first=Tim | year=2016 | chapter=Racialized Slacktivism | editor1-last=Kennedy | editor1-first=Tammie M. | editor2-last=Middleton | editor2-first=Irene Joyce | editor3-last=Ratcliffe | editor3-first=Krista | title=Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education | publisher=SIU Press | isbn=978-0-8093-3546-6 | page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan and her medical treatment in the West has been described as an example of the "white savior complex". The arguments behind this were the Western media and politicians quick reaction to the incident, portraying it as their rescue of a woman from her own savage culture and people. This also allegedly was the West's justification for invading and bombing the region to save savage people from their own kind, while killing more innocent people like Malala than the Taliban has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/assed-baig/malala-yousafzai-white-saviour_b_3592165.html|title=Malala Yousafzai and the White Saviour Complex|date=15 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bennorton.com/malala-yousafzai-spivak-abu-lughod-and-the-white-savior-complex/|title=Malala Yousafzai, Spivak, Abu-Lughod, &amp; the White Savior Complex|date=12 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1796">'''World Day for International Justice''', also referred to as '''Day of International Criminal Justice''' or '''International Justice Day''', is an [[international observances|international day]] celebrated throughout the world on July 17 as part of an effort to recognize the emerging system of [[international criminal law|international criminal justice]]. July 17 was chosen because it is the anniversary of the adoption of the [[Rome Statute]], the treaty that created the [[International Criminal Court]]. On 1 June 2010, at the [[Review Conference of the Rome Statute]] held in Kampala (Uganda), the Assembly of State Parties decided to celebrate 17 July as the Day of International Criminal Justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Decl.1-ENG.pdf Kampala Declaration, ICC-ASP/RC/Decl.1 (1 June 2010), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, people around the world use this day to host events to promote international criminal justice, especially support for the International Criminal Court. The day has been successful enough to attract international news attention, and for groups to use the day to focus attention on particular issues such as [[genocide]] in [[Darfur]], [[Falun Dafa]], and serious crimes of [[violence against women]].
