The '''Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre''' (also '''Acco Fringe Theatre Festival''', '''Israel Fringe Theatre Festival''') is  a four-day [[performing arts]] [[Fringe theatre|festival]] held annually in the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Israel]] during the Intermediate Days of the [[Sukkot]] holiday in early autumn.

==History==

Founded in 1980, the festival features a competition for original plays that premier during the festival, along with local and foreign theatre productions, street theatre and open-air performances. There are also concerts, arts and crafts workshops, and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26011389_ITM|title=We Recommend|last=Davis|first=Barry|date=23 August 2002|work=Jerusalem Post via Asia Africa Intelligence Wire |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Festival's plays come from outside the mainstream of establishment Israeli theatre, some having avantgarde characteristics and subjects giving outlet to their creators' personal statements. Some combine media and genres such as pantomime, clowning, video, dance, and performance art rarely seen in the conventional theatre. Many are staged in historic venues within the [[Acre, Israel#Conservation projects|Old City of Acre]], such as its Crusader-era citadel and knights' halls that have undergone conservation.

The Festival has been produced by the Municipality of Akko since the year 2000. It is supported by the Israel [[Ministry of Culture]], the Old Acre Development Company and overseas [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|philanthropic foundations]].

The Acre Festival has become a symbol of coexistence between the city's Jewish and Arab inhabitants. Each year's program features works by Arab playwrights and troupes along with performances by music ensembles. Performance projects led by theatre professionals provide training for local Arab and Jewish teens, including immigrant youth.

The Festival has been postponed and scaled down twice due to interethnic disturbances: during the [[October 2000 events]] of the [[Second Intifada]], and in 2008 due to the [[Yom Kippur]] riots, after which the Festival was held during the [[Hanukkah]] holiday week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=3024 |title=Curtain not to be raised on the 29th Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre |work=All About Jewish Theatre |accessdate=13 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017161658/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=3024 |archivedate=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Advanced Genius Theory:  Are They Out of Their Minds or Ahead of Their Time?''''' is a 2010 U.S. nonfiction book by journalist Jason Hartley. It posits an explanation as to why well-established musicians are now perceived as terrible or having "lost it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia |first=Catherine |url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/06/11/the-author-of-the-advanced-genius-theory-explains-which-artists-are-on-a-whole-different-level |title='The Advanced Genius Theory': Author Jason Hartley explains which artists are on a whole different level &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Shelf-life.ew.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725194540/http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/06/11/the-author-of-the-advanced-genius-theory-explains-which-artists-are-on-a-whole-different-level| archivedate= 25 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New |first=The |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/living-with-music-jason-hartley |title=Living With Music: Jason Hartley - Paper Cuts Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2010-06-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100605072702/http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/living-with-music-jason-hartley| archivedate= 5 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.simonandschuster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Advanced-Genius-Theory/Jason-Hartley/9781439102367 |title=The Advanced Genius Theory &amp;#124; Book by Jason Hartley, Chuck Klosterman - Simon &amp; Schuster |publisher=Books.simonandschuster.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merely, these artists or celebrities have "Advanced" past our understanding, because they are true [[genius]]es. The book also mentions athletes, actors, writers and even sportscasters as possibly being Advanced.

==Background==
The Theory, developed by Jason Hartley and Britt Bergman, maintains that seemingly bad and confusing artists are actually still producing excellent works today, despite critic and fan belief. The hypothesis is based around a few key musicians (only individuals), namely [[Bob Dylan]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[David Bowie]], and (most-critically) [[Lou Reed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuck |first=Tammy |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2007/07/18/schmadvancement |title=Schmadvancement - Arts Desk |publisher=Washington City Paper |date=2007-07-18 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At one time, these musicians wore [[sunglasses]], [[leather jacket]]s and [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]s when it was un-ironic to do so. Musical artists must at least have a self-portrait on one of their [[album cover]]s, displaying their [[sunglasses]] or [[hairstyle]] (e.g. ''[[Street Hassle]]'', ''[[Infidels (Bob Dylan album)|Infidels]]'', ''[[Aladdin Sane]]''). The basic tenets are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Advanced Genius Theory: Are They Out of Their Minds or Ahead of Their Time? |isbn=978-1-4391-0236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#You must have done great work for more than 15 years.
#You must have alienated your original fans.
#You must be completely unironic.
#You must be unpredictable.
#You must "lose it". Spectacularly.

Many other rules exist, but constantly evolve. For instance, there is a correlation between the Advanced and comic book superhero [[Batman]] (e.g. "[[Batdance]]", [[Val Kilmer]], [[Orson Welles]]' [[cape]]), but it has not been fully proven.

The term "Overt" is used to describe those quasi-Advanced (or approaching Advancement), but those too outlandish or ironic to be considered Advanced. Examples including [[Brian Wilson]]'s "beached whale" era, [[Bono]]'s [[MacPhisto]] character, and [[Kurt Cobain]]'s collaboration with [[William S. Burroughs]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If a band is overt, they appear Advanced. However, they are actually the opposite of Advanced, because their seemingly inexplicable decisions are driven by guile."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chuck Klosterman IV: A Decade of Curious People and Dangerous Ideas]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critical reception==
Response to the Theory has been mixed. Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' states the debate is "...just a way for Advancement proponents to appreciate shitty music by people they consider to be nonshitty. It allows you to engage with Lou Reed's music from the 1980s, but not [[the Hooters]] or [[the Outfield]]. This entire theory is shackled by a [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]ian principle of self-consciousness."&lt;ref name="books.simonandschuster" /&gt; However, Sheffield himself participated in a Brooklyn Panel discussing the book, where it was evident that his position was not so clear-cut. And, as Chuck Klosterman states in the book's intro: "Part of what makes Advancement Theory so entertaining (at least to me) is the way it outrages so many uncreative music critics, almost all of whom (a) begin by dismissing it completely before (b) spending the next twenty minutes manically fixating on why no one should ever talk about it, even in jest." The book's review in ''Publisher's Weekly'' states that, "though it [the theory] should ignite many debates over whether your current favorite is Overt or Advanced, it also shows that in either case, there's more pleasure to be found when one keeps an open mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/43352-web-exclusive-reviews-week-of-5-24-10.html%20 |title=Web-Exclusive Reviews |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2016-10-17 |publisher=Publishersweekly.com |work=PWxyz, LLC.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100619044802/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/43352-web-exclusive-reviews-week-of-5-24-10.html| archivedate= 19 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''''' (or, in more recent editions, '''''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''''') is a novel by [[Mark Twain]], first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the [[Great American Novel]]s, the work is among the first in major [[American literature]] to be written throughout in [[vernacular]] English, characterized by [[American literary regionalism|local color regionalism]]. It is told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] by [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huckleberry "Huck" Finn]], the narrator of two other Twain novels (''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'') and a friend of [[Tom Sawyer]]. It is a direct sequel to ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''.

The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the [[Mississippi River]]. Set in a [[southern United States|Southern]] [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] society that had ceased to exist about 20 years before the work was published, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' is an often scathing [[satire]] on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.

Perennially popular with readers, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3cz3334b|title=Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's comrade).... ... - Full View – HathiTrust Digital Library – HathiTrust Digital Library|author=Twain, Mark |work=HathiTrust|date=October 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 Jacob O'Leary, "Critical Annotation of "Minstrel Shackles and Nineteenth Century 'Liberality' in Huckleberry Finn" (Fredrick Woodard and Donnarae MacCann)," Wiki Service, University of Iowa, last modified February 11, 2012, accessed April 12, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312113444/http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 |date=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur "[[nigger]]".

== Characters ==
{{main|List of Tom Sawyer characters}}

In order of appearance:
* '''[[Huckleberry Finn]]''' ("Huck" to his friends) is a boy about "thirteen or fourteen or along there" years old. (Chapter 17)  He has been brought up by his father, the town drunk, and has a difficult time fitting into society.
* '''Widow Douglas''' is the kind woman who has taken Huck in after he helped save her from a violent home invasion. She tries her best to civilize Huck, believing it is her [[Christian]] duty.
* '''Miss Watson''' is the widow's sister, a tough old spinster who also lives with them. She is fairly hard on Huck, causing him to resent her a good deal. [[Mark Twain]] may have drawn inspiration for this character from several people he knew in his life.&lt;ref name="Richard Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Richard|title=Mark Twain Among The Scholars: Reconsidering Contemporary Twain Criticism|publisher=SJK Publishing Industries, Inc.|year=2002|pages=67–90|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=150a0acc-8b8f-4f78-80f4-a856a5a22df4%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=10&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLGN1c3R1aWQmY3VzdGlkPXM4NDU1ODYxJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=lkh&amp;AN=43261625|isbn=978-0-87875-527-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]''' is Miss Watson's physically large but mild-mannered slave. Huck becomes very close to Jim when they reunite after Jim flees Miss Watson's household to seek refuge from slavery, and Huck and Jim become fellow travelers on the Mississippi River.
* '''[[Tom Sawyer]]''' is Huck's best friend and peer, the main character of other Twain novels and the leader of the town boys in adventures. He is "the best fighter and the smartest kid in town".&lt;ref name="Richard Hill" /&gt;
* '''"Pap" Finn''', Huck's father, a brutal alcoholic drifter. He resents Huck getting any kind of education. His only genuine interest in his son involves begging or extorting money to feed his alcohol addiction.
* '''Judith Loftus''' plays a small part in the novel&amp;nbsp;— being the kind and perceptive woman whom Huck talks to in order to find out about the search for Jim&amp;nbsp;— but many critics believe her to be the best drawn female character in the novel.&lt;ref name="Richard Hill" /&gt;
* '''The Grangerfords''', an aristocratic [[Kentuckian]] family headed by the [[wiktionary:sexagenarian|sexagenarian]] '''Colonel Saul Grangerford''', take Huck in after he is separated from Jim on the Mississippi. Huck becomes close friends with the youngest male of the family, '''Buck Grangerford''', who is Huck's age. By the time Huck meets them, the Grangerfords have been engaged in an age-old [[blood feud]] with another local family, the Shepherdsons.
* '''The Duke''' and '''the King''' are two otherwise unnamed [[con artist]]s whom Huck and Jim take aboard their raft just before the start of their Arkansas adventures. They pose as the long-lost [[Duke of Bridgewater]] and the long-dead [[Louis XVII of France]] in an attempt to over-awe Huck and Jim, who quickly come to recognize them for what they are, but cynically pretend to accept their claims to avoid conflict.
* '''Doctor Robinson''' is the only man who recognizes that the King and Duke are phonies when they pretend to be British. He warns the town but they ignore him.
* '''Mary Jane, Joanna, and Susan Wilks''' are the three young nieces of their wealthy guardian, Peter Wilks, who has recently died. The duke and the king try to steal the inheritance left by Peter Wilks, by posing as Peter's estranged brothers from England.
* '''Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas Phelps''' buy Jim from the "Duke" and the "King". She is a loving, high-strung "farmer's wife", and he a plodding old man, both farmer and preacher. Huck poses as their nephew, after he parts from the con men.

== Plot summary ==
[[File:Huckleberry-finn-with-rabbit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Huckleberry Finn, as depicted by [[E. W. Kemble]] in the original 1884 edition of the book]]

=== In Missouri ===
The story begins in fictional St. Petersburg, Missouri (based on the actual town of [[Hannibal, Missouri]]), on the shore of the [[Mississippi River]] "forty to fifty years ago" (the novel having been published in 1884).  Huckleberry "Huck" Finn (the [[protagonist]] and [[first-person narrator]]) and his friend, Thomas "Tom" Sawyer, have each come into a considerable sum of money as a result of their earlier adventures (detailed in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''). Huck explains how he is placed under the [[guardianship]] of the Widow Douglas, who, together with her stringent sister, Miss Watson, are attempting to "sivilize" him and teach him religion. Finding civilized life confining, his spirits are raised somewhat when Tom Sawyer helps him to escape one night past Miss Watson's slave [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]], to meet up with Tom's gang of self-proclaimed "robbers." Just as the gang's activities begin to bore Huck, he is suddenly interrupted by the reappearance of his shiftless father, "Pap", an abusive [[alcoholic]]. Knowing that Pap would only spend the money on alcohol, Huck is successful in preventing Pap from acquiring his fortune; however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.

=== In Illinois and on Jackson's Island ===
Pap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the [[Illinois]] shoreline. Because of Pap's drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father's absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off downriver. He settles comfortably, on Jackson's Island. Here, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him "down the river" to presumably more brutal owners. Jim plans to make his way to the town of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] in Illinois, a [[slave states and free states|free state]], so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family's freedom. At first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck's close friend and guardian. After heavy flooding on the river, the two find a [[Timber rafting|raft]] (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river (Chapter 9: "The House of Death Floats By"). Entering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back. He prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Fistell ''Ira Fistell’S Mark Twain:: Three Encounters'' 1469178729
 2012  Page 94 "..Huck and Jim's first adventure together—the House of Death incident which occupies Chapter 9. This sequence seems to me to be quite important both to the technical functioning of the plot and to the larger meaning of the novel. The House of Death is a two—story frame building which comes floating downstream, one paragraph after Huck and jim catch their soon—to—be famous raft. While Twain never explicitly says so, his description of the house and its contents ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

To find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area. Huck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt. Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests. Huck develops another story on the fly and explains his disguise as the only way to escape from an abusive foster family. Once he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing. Huck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night. The two hastily load up the raft and depart.

After a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded [[steamship]]. Searching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed. They are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident. Jim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly. Huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.

=== In Kentucky: the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons ===
Traveling onward, Huck and Jim's raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two. Huck is given shelter on the [[Kentucky]] side of the river by the Grangerfords, an "aristocratic" family. He befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year [[blood feud]] against another family, the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love. The vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister [[elope]]s with a member of the Shepherdson clan. In the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses. He is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.

=== In Arkansas: the Duke and the King ===
Near the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run [[Confidence trick|grifters]] aboard the raft. The younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English [[duke]] (the [[Duke of Bridgewater]]). The older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the [[Louis XVII of France#Lost Dauphin claimants|Lost Dauphin]], the son of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and rightful King of France. The "duke" and "king" soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of [[confidence tricks|confidence schemes]] upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey. To divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the "Sick Arab" so that he can move about the raft without bindings.

On one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called "The Royal Nonesuch". The play turns out to be only a couple of minutes' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham. On the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done. By the third night of "The Royal Nonesuch", the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.

In the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an [[British English|English accent]] and the duke pretends to be a [[deaf-mute]] while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.

=== On the Phelps' farm ===
Huck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Sally and Silas Phelps|Silas and Sally Phelps]]. The family's nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck's arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home. He plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising [[plot twist]], it is revealed that the expected nephew is, in fact, Tom Sawyer. When Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Sid Sawyer|Sid]], while Huck continues pretending to be Tom. In the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for "The Royal Nonesuch", and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] and [[Riding a rail|ridden out of town on a rail]].

Rather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read,&lt;ref name="Doyno"&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing Huck Finn: Mark Twain's creative process|author=Victor A. Doyno|year=1991|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=191|url= https://books.google.com/?id=b-DTQwA4lDEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=benvenuto+chelleeny|isbn=9780812214482}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Aunt Polly|Aunt Polly]] arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Mrs. Watson|Miss Watson]] died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father ([[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Pap Finn|Pap Finn]]) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to [[Indian Territory]].

== Major themes ==
''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' explores themes of race and identity. A complexity exists concerning Jim's character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted, moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word "[[nigger]]" and emphasizing the stereotypically "comic" treatment of Jim's lack of education, superstition and ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 2.

James S. Leonard, Thomas A. Tenney, and Thadious M. Davis (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives, and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts, he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and Jim's human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Mark Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that "a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience" and goes on to describe the novel as "...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain (1895). ''Notebook No. 35''. Typescript, P. 35. Mark Twain Papers. Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

To highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes, he then immediately encounters Jim "illegally" doing the same thing. The treatments both of them receive are radically different, especially with an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 438790|last1 = Foley|first1 = Barbara|title = Reviewed work: Satire or Evasion?

Some scholars discuss Huck's own character, and the novel itself, in the context of its relation to African-American culture as a whole. John Alberti quotes [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]], who writes in her 1990s book ''Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices'', "by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery," white scholars "have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain's creative imagination at its core." It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and black culture in the United States.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 378621|title = The Nigger Huck: Race, Identity, and the Teaching of Huckleberry Finn|journal = College English|volume = 57|issue = 8|pages = 919–937|last1 = Alberti|first1 = John|year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illustrations ==
The original illustrations were done by [[E.W. Kemble]], at the time a young artist working for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Kemble was hand-picked by Twain, who admired his work. Hearn suggests that Twain and Kemble had a similar skill, writing that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever he may have lacked in technical grace ... Kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in a text his own distinct visual personality; just as Twain so deftly defined a full-rounded character in a few phrases, so too did Kemble depict with a few strokes of his pen that same entire personage.&lt;ref name=annothuck&gt;{{cite book|last=Twain|first=Mark (Samuel L.

As Kemble could afford only one model, most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork. When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper's and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.&lt;ref name=cope_uvlib&gt;{{cite web|last=Cope |first=Virginia H. |title=Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn: Text, Illustrations, and Early Reviews |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/huckfinn.html |publisher=University of Virginia Library |accessdate=17 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117125823/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/huckfinn.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication's effect on literary climate ==
[[File:Mark twain2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mark Twain]]]]

Twain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled ''Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography.'' Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the [[Hudson River]], Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade)''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain and Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Huckleberry Finn: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' (New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for [[Sotheby's]] books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, "What you see is [Clemens'] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing". For example, Twain revised the opening line of ''Huck Finn'' three times. He initially wrote, "You will not know about me", which he changed to, "You do not know about me", before settling on the final version, "You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Young, ''Ernest Hemingway: A Reconsideration'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State UP, 1966), 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 4613362|last1 = Baker|first1 = William|title = Reviewed work: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain|journal = The Antioch Review|volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 363–364|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/books/first-half-of-huck-finn-in-twain-s-hand-is-found.html Rita Reif, "First Half of 'Huck Finn,' in Twain's Hand, Is Found," ''The New York Times'', last modified February 17, 1991, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.&lt;ref&gt;William Baker, "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain"&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for the book spread outside of the United States. ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was eventually published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baumanrarebooks.com/rare-books/twain-mark/adventures-of-huckleberry-finn/63515.aspx|title=Mark Twain – Adventures of Huckleberry Finn [sheep] First Edition – Bauman Rare Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble's picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps' groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Blair, ''Mark Twain &amp; Huck Finn'' (Berkeley: University of California, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All Modern Literature Comes from One Book by Mark Twain"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, the [[Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library|Buffalo Public Library's]] curator, James Fraser Gluck, approached Twain to donate the manuscript to the library. Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck's. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/books/antiques-how-huck-finn-was-rescued.html Rita Reif, "ANTIQUES; How 'Huck Finn' Was Rescued," ''The New York Times'', last modified March 17, 1991, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the literary climate at the time of the book's publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain's already established reputation as a "professional humorist", having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the "dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation," ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' illustrated "previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3823856|title = The Publication of "Huckleberry Finn": A Centennial Retrospect|journal = Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume = 37|issue = 5|pages = 18–40|last1 = Smith|first1 = Henry Nash|last2 = Finn|first2 = Huckleberry|year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical Reception and Banning ==
[[File:Jim and ghost huck finn.jpg|thumb|In this scene illustrated by [[E. W. Kemble]], Jim has given Huck up for dead and when he reappears thinks he must be a [[ghost]].]]

While it was clear that the publication of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was controversial from the outset, [[Norman Mailer]], writing in ''The New York Times'' in 1984, concluded that Twain's novel was not initially "too unpleasantly regarded." In fact, Mailer writes: "the critical climate could hardly anticipate [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[encomium]]s 50 years later," reviews that would remain longstanding in the American consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/09/books/mailer-huck.html Norman Mailer, "Huckleberry Finn, Alive at 100," ''The New York Times'', last modified December 9, 1984, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book's challenges both dismissively and with confusion. During Twain's time, and today, defenders of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' "lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and ‘censors' thus equating the complaints about the book's ‘coarseness' from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord Public Library]] in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights."&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt;

Upon issue of the American edition in 1885 several libraries banned it from their shelves.&lt;ref name="leonard-concord"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=James S.|author2=Thomas A. Tenney |author3=Thadious M. Davis|title=Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|date=December 1992|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22|isbn=978-0-8223-1174-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early criticism focused on what was perceived as the book's crudeness. One incident was recounted in the newspaper the ''Boston Transcript'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Concord (Mass.) Public Library committee has decided to exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One member of the committee says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Fisher Fishkin, "Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices" (New York: Oxford UP, 1993) 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writer [[Louisa May Alcott]] criticized the book's publication as well, saying that if Twain "[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1984/4/1984_4_81.shtml|title=One Hundred Years of Huck Finn|accessdate=November 8, 2010|last=Brown|first=Robert|work=American Heritage Magazine|publisher=AmericanHeritage.com|quote=If Mr. Clemens cannot think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119084212/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1984/4/1984_4_81.shtml|archivedate=January 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/one-hundred-years-huck-finn|title=One Hundred Years Of Huck Finn – AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twain later remarked to his editor, "Apparently, the Concord library has condemned Huck as 'trash and only suitable for the slums.' This will sell us another twenty-five thousand copies for sure!"

In 1905, New York's [[Brooklyn Public Library]] also banned the book due to "bad word choice" and Huck's having "not only itched but scratched" within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: &lt;blockquote&gt;I am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' &amp; 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, &amp; it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, &amp; to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0105/The-n-word-gone-from-Huck-Finn-what-would-Mark-Twain-say Marjorie Kehe, "The 'n'-word Gone from Huck Finn – What Would Mark Twain Say?

Many subsequent critics, [[Ernest Hemingway]] among them, have deprecated the final chapters, claiming the book "devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy" after Jim is detained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2006/02/01/mark-twain-vs-tom-sawyer Nick Gillespie, "Mark Twain vs. Tom Sawyer: The Bold Deconstruction of a National Icon," ''Reason'', last modified February 2006, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hemingway declared, "All modern American literature comes from" ''Huck Finn'', and hailed it as "the best book we've had", he cautioned, "If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys {{sic}}.

The rest is just cheating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Hemingway |title=Green Hills of Africa|publisher= New York: Scribner, |year=1935|page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Mailer, "Huckleberry Finn, Alive at 100"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Ron Powers]] states in his Twain biography (''Mark Twain: A Life'') that "Huckleberry Finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters", in which Tom Sawyer leads Huck through elaborate machinations to rescue Jim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Powers|title= Mark Twain: A Life |publisher=New York: FreePress|year= 2005|pages= 476–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In his introduction to ''The Annotated Huckleberry Finn'', [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] writes that Twain "could be uninhibitedly vulgar", and quotes critic [[William Dean Howells]], a Twain contemporary, who wrote that the author's "humor was not for most women". However, Hearn continues by explaining that "the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain and Michael Patrick Hearn, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of modern scholarship of ''Huckleberry Finn'' has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Shelley Fisher Fishin, ''Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim.&lt;ref name="leonard-concord" /&gt; According to Professor Stephen Railton of the [[University of Virginia]], Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to [[minstrel show]]-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1987/summer/railton-jim-mark/ Stephen Railton, "Jim and Mark Twain: What Do Dey Stan' For?," ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', last modified 1987, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, [[CBS]] tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Sharp, "Student Edition of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer Is Censored by Editor"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this controversy over whether ''Huckleberry Finn'' is racist or anti-racist, and because the word "[[nigger]]"  is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time which has since become vulgar and [[taboo]]), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school system—this questioning of the word "nigger" is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the "most grotesque example of racism I've ever seen in my life".&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Brown, "One Hundred Years of Huck Finn"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Library Association]], ''Huckleberry Finn'' was the fifth most frequently [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] book in the United States during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_1999|title=100 most frequently challenged books: 1990–1999|publisher=|date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]], Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word "nigger". Clark filed a request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book, asking for the novel to be removed from the English curriculum. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Huck-Finn-a-masterpiece-or-an-insult-1130707.php Gregory Roberts, "'Huck Finn' a Masterpiece -- or an Insult," ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', last modified November 25, 2003, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a Washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from a school curriculum. The teacher, John Foley, called for replacing ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' with a more modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/19/Wash-teacher-calls-for-Huck-Finn-ban/UPI-39901232395760/|title=Wash. teacher calls for 'Huck Finn' ban|date=January 19, 2009|work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion column that Foley wrote in the ''[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]]'', he states that all "novels that use the ‘N-word' repeatedly need to go." He states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary, but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at "just hear[ing] the N-word." He views this change as "common sense," with Obama's election into office as a sign that Americans "are ready for a change," and that by removing these books from the reading lists, they would be following this change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Guest-Columnist-Time-to-update-schools-reading-1296681.php John Foley, "Guest Columnist: Time to Update Schools' Reading Lists," ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', last modified January 5, 2009, accessed April 13, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was removed from a public school district in [[Virginia]], along with the novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', due to their use of racial slurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Nick|title=To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn banned from schools in Virginia for racism|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/05/kill-mockingbird-huckleberry-finn-banned-schools-virginia-racism/|accessdate=29 December 2016|publisher=Telegraph|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books suspended by Va. school for racial slurs|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/to-kill-a-mockingbird-huckleberry-finn-suspended-by-virginia-school-for-racial-slurs/|accessdate=29 December 2016|publisher=CBS News|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expurged Editions ===

Publishers have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of releasing editions of the book with the word "nigger" [[Expurgation|replaced]] by less controversial words. A 2011 edition of the book, published by [[NewSouth Books]], employed the word "slave" (although being incorrectly addressed to a freed man), and did not use the term "Injun." Mark Twain scholar [[Alan Gribben]] said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms, rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/04/132652272/new-edition-of-huckleberry-finn-will-eliminate-offensive-words?ft=1|title=New Edition Of 'Huckleberry Finn' Will Eliminate Offensive Words|date=January 4, 2011|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to publisher Suzanne La Rosa "At NewSouth, we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers. If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain's works will be more emphatically fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsouthbooks.com/pages/2011/01/04/a-word-about-the-newsouth-edition-of-mark-twains-tom-sawyer-and-huckleberry-finn/|title=A word about the NewSouth edition of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn – NewSouth Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition "doesn't challenge children to ask, 'Why would a child like Huck use such reprehensible language?'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/new-editions-of-mark-twain-novels-to-remove-racial-slurs/story-e6frf96f-1225981589323 "New Editions of Mark Twain Novels to Remove Racial Slurs," ''Herald Sun'', last modified January 4, 2011, accessed April 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two similarly expurged editions of the book where published in 2011. [[The Hipster Huckleberry Finn]] employed the word "hipster". [http://www.dianianddevine.com/huck/ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Robotic Edition] employed the word "robot" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Robotic Edition | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-9847256-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and included modified illustrations in which Jim was replaced with a robot character.

[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|right|Banner of Peace sign]]

The '''banner of peace''' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact is the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== Description ==
Roerich described the sign thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[the] proposed banner is the symbol of whole world, not a country, but the whole civilized world. The Banner proposed has on the white background three united amaranth spheres as a symbol of Eternity and Unity. Although we don't know when this Banner will fly over all cultural monuments but undoubtedly the seed has been sprouted. Already it attracts the attention of great intellects and is directed from one heart to another, awaking the idea of Peace and Benevolence among peoples."&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;"Banner of Peace." ''Collected articles''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, 1995. P. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are asked to collect where the signs of our Banner of Peace are. The sign of trinity is found scattered around the whole world. Now anybody can explain it by various ways. One says that it is the past, present and future united by the circle of eternity. Others explain it as a religion, knowledge and art in the circle of culture."&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The following description of the sign appears in the official text of the pact:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/325-480004?OpenDocument Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments (Roerich Pact). Washington, 15 April 1935. Art. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In order to identify the monuments and institutions mentioned in article I, use may be made of a distinctive flag (red circle with a triple red sphere in the circle on a white background) in accordance with the model attached to this treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==
In the text of the pact, Roerich wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Banner of Peace, as is now well-known, is the symbol of the Roerich Pact. This great humanitarian ideal provides in the field of mankind's cultural achievements the same guardianship as the Red Cross provides in alleviating the physical sufferings of man."&lt;ref&gt;"Aims and History." ''The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origin of Roerich's idea for the creation of the Banner of Peace sign was an ancient [[Russian icon]] by [[Andrei Rublev]]. Roerich wrote about this in his letter to Baron M.A. Taube: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At last I can send you a home photo of my last picture dedicated to meaning sense of the banner sign. You can show this photo to some committee members and also to anybody whom, as you believe, it may be useful. Say to all ignoramuses which try to substitute their self-interested and ill-intentioned explanations of the sense of this picture. What may be more ancient and more genuine than Byzantine conception which stretches in the depth of centuries to the origin united Christianity and so beautifully implemented in Rublev's icon "Saint life-giving Trinity" from the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra? Just this symbol – the symbol of ancient Christianity, consecrated for us by name of St. Sergius, gives me a hint to our sign. Its sense is expressed on the proposed photo with conservation of all elements and their positions according to the Rublev's icon. Let this photo will be with You at Paris in the case of any new attempts to destroy already existing. In addition, I send You a photo of St. Queen of the Banner – Madonna Oriflamma." (Letter from N.K. Roerich to Baron M. Taube, 13.02.1932.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

N.K. Roerich has adduced the following illustrations of presence of the Banner of Peace components in the pictures and icons of great spiritual devotees from various religions:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our post from various countries today brings us much news about the propagation of our Pact for protection of cultural values. We have received a copy of an ancient icon of St Nicholas the Miracle-Worker &lt;…&gt;, which is confirmed to printing by metropolitan Antony. From other regions we have received a photo of an edition of Kiev-Pecherskaya Laura press from 1860 of the service to Venerable Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracle-Worker. From Spain we have received a picture of St. Domingo from "Silos" (archaeological museum, Madrid). Also from Spain we have received a picture of St. Michael made by Bartolommeo Vermekho (1440). At all these pictures the sign of Banner of Peace can be seen. It is useful to remember this for many."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "Half century."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sign of the banner was also found at the Temple of Heaven.  "Tamga" of Tamerlane consists of the same sign. The sign of Three Treasures is well known for many countries of the East. On the chest of Tibetan women one can see a large fibula which is the sign. The same fibulas we see also in Caucasian findings and in Scandinavia. Madonna of Strasbourg has the same sign as well as the Spanish Saints. The same sign is on the icons of St. Sergius and St. Nicholas Miracle-Worker. The sign as a large breast fibula is depicted on Christ's breast on the well-known H. Memling's picture. When we go over sacramental pictures of Byzantine, Roma, the same symbol ties the sacramental pictures on over the world."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "The signs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conditions of using the banner of peace sign ==
The monuments and institutions, on which the banner of peace sign is proposed to establish, must be included by National governments in the special list. 

'''ARTICLE IV'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The signatory Governments and those which accede to this treaty, shall send to the Pan American Union, at the time of signature or accession, or at any time thereafter, a list of the monuments and institutions for which they desire the protection agreed to in this treaty. The Pan American Union, when notifying the Governments of signatures or accessions, shall also send the list of monuments and institutions mentioned in this article, and shall inform the other Governments of any changes in said list.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''ARTICLE V'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The monuments and institutions mentioned in article I shall cease to enjoy the privileges recognized in the present treaty in case they are made use of for military purposes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Roerich wrote about these conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Institutions, collections and missions, registered under [[Roerich Pact]], exhibit a distinctive flag which gives them the right to special protection and respect from belligerent countries and peoples of all countries participating in the treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It is seen from above words that in order to get the right for exhibition of the distinctive banner one must be registered by Pact bodies. The same standing exists concerning a distinctive banner of [[Red Cross]] (which also created on the basis of ancient symbol – cross).

== Important cultural events with the Banner of Peace ==
In 1990, Russian cosmonauts [[Aleksandr Nikolayevich Balandin|Aleksandr Balandin]] and [[Anatoly Solovyev]] performed a space flight on orbital station [[Mir]] with the banner of peace on board. [[Mir EO-6|This flight]] lasted from February to August, including nine days with the banner outside the craft, completing 144 orbits of the Earth.&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{cite web| title= Banner of Peace hall |url= http://en.icr.su/museum/layout/banner/03.php |publisher= International Centre of the Roerichs |accessdate= 3 November 2017 |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international scientific "banner of peace" project was conducted in 1997, with the banner of peace again delivered into the orbiting Mir. The aim of this action was to call for protecting life and beauty on Earth. Many international crews worked in Mir with the banner aboard. Cosmonaut Paul Vinogradov, a participant of the project, said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have raised the banner of peace over the Earth in order that a space of culture excludes the space of war and animosity forever. We call all the peoples and nations to building of new spiritual, scientific and artistic cooperation."&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After completing the project and returning from orbit, the banner of peace was passed to the International Centre of the Roerichs. It is now exhibited there. 

On January 5, 1999, the banner of peace was presented to President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. Space pilot A.A. Leonov and professor S.P. Kapitsa participated in the ceremony, which was conducted in the Presidential Palace in [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Museum named after N.K. Roerich." ''Museum guide''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. P. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] have lifted the banner of peace over many mountain peaks. Among these are the following:
: - [[Elbrus]];&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Presentation of Banner of Peace to President of Kazakh Republic N.A.Nazarbayev. (shorthand record). / Journal “New Epoch. Problems. Searches. Studies” N 2(21), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
: - [[Belukha]], Roerich peak, Urusvati peak, Svetoslav Roerich peak (Altai);&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt;
: - [[Khan Tengri|Khan-Tengri]] (Middle Asia) ;
: - [[Everest]] ([[Himalayas]])

The banner of peace was first raised at the [[North Pole]] by the famous traveler [[Fyodor Konyukhov]] in 1988.  In 1999, participants of the first international complex Antarctic expedition "Towards to XXI" raised the banner of peace at the [[South Pole]]. The banners from these expeditions are now exhibited in the International Centre of the Roerichs.&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt;

In October, 2004 during the celebration of Roerich's 100th anniversary, the banner of peace which had been to the space station was presented to the Indian Parliament. Taking the banner, Speaker S. Chatterji said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will be kept in the library of Indian Parliament as most precious treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Martovitskaya, M. "Banner of Peace on the earth, in mountains and at the orbit". ''Culture'', No. 14, April 14–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:BluesFellThisMorning.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Blues Fell This Morning''''' is a notable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Notebook for night owls |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=May 9, 1963 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960 book published by [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] and written by [[Paul Oliver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Britain got the blues: the transmission and reception of American blues style in the United Kingdom |last=Schwartz |first=Roberta Freund |pages=110–115 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7546-5580-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It Jes Catch Hold |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/11/12/archives/it-jes-catch-hold-blues-fell-this-morning-the-meaning-of-the-blues.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 12, 1961 |accessdate=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows Olivers' educational insight into [[Blues|the blues]], as well as American folk music between the 1920s and the 1950s. The book provides insights into problematic periods during this time; such as relationships, the depression years etc. 

In his The Rolling Stones:  How, Why and Where It All Began, Alan Clayson sources the 1st edition of Oliver's Blues Fell This Morning as a work popular with a young Mick Jagger and his classmates as they learned the language and the lore of the blues.  "Changing hands for weeks among them had been someone's copy of Paul Oliver's Blues Fell This Morning, hot off the press and to be recognized later as a standard work."  Clayson notes the popularity of Oliver's 1960 book in the year just prior to the historic encounter between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards at Dartford's train station bringing the two former schoolmates together in their shared love of the blues and of rock and roll.  "The Dartford blues disciples turned to [Blues Fell This Morning] as monks to the Bible, working their way through as much of its bibliography as could be ordered from the public library, and fanning out to erudite tomes concerning, say, plantation field hollers and the African roots of blues," Clayson writes in his 2007 work.

A paperback edition was published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New in Paperback |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72611272.html?dids=72611272:72611272&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+26%2C+1990&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=NEW+IN+PAPERBACK&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 26, 1990 |accessdate=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Choripán''''' (plural: ''choripanes'') is a type of [[sandwich|sanguche]] with ''[[chorizo]]'', popular in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. The name comes from the combination of the names of its ingredients: a grilled ''[[chorizo]]'' (sausage) and a ''pan'' ([[Bread|crusty bread]]) such as a ''[[marraqueta]]'', [[baguette]] or francés.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Real Academia Española]]''. [[drae:choripán|Choripán]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=El papel del traductor en una sociedad diglósica |url=http://heb.proz.com/translation-articles/articles/2816/1/El-papel-del-traductor-en-una-sociedad-digl%C3%B3sica | work=Norah Marcela Azúa |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In various countries==

[[File:Preparations for an argentinian asado 15.JPG|thumbnail|right|170px|Homemade ''choripán'' with [[chorizo]] sausage recently hot off from an ''[[asado]]'' grill.]]

===Argentina===
The Argentine ''choripán'' consists of a sausage made out of beef and pork, hot off the grill, split down the middle, and served on a roll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://argentinastravel.com/916/choripan-and-superpanchos-argentine-fast-food-is-slow-grilled/ “Choripan and Superpanchos - Argentine Fast Food is Slow Grilled”]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chorizo'' may be used whole or cut in half lengthwise, in which case it is called a ''mariposa'' (butterfly).  It is customary to add sauces on the bread, most likely ''[[chimichurri]]''.

''Choripanes'' are commonly served as an [[appetizer]] during the preparation of an ''[[asado]]'', but they are also very commonly sold at sport venues  (particularly [[association football|football]] games) and on the sides of roads and streets in major cities in Argentina. Taxi cab drivers in Buenos Aires are avid consumers and some street sellers can gather a long line of cabs during lunch time and afternoons when drivers get their lunch break.

===Brazil===
There are several Brazilian versions of ''choripán'', the one most resembling the Argentinian version is called ''salsipão'', and made, in southern Brazil, with "French bread" (a Brazilian-style baguette-like small roll) and pork sausage. It is often served as an [[appetizer]] during the preparation of a ''[[churrasco]]'', or even as a substitute for barbecues, because ''salsipães'' are much cheaper, easier and quicker to make - so, they can be prepared on a short notice. Elsewhere in the country, there are many variations on the popular ''sanduíche de linguiça'' (literally "sausage sandwich"), most also made with ''[[Pão francês]]'' (lit. "French bread", a Brazilian baguette-like small roll) and pork sausage, but other breads and sausages can also be found. Possible additions to the basic recipe include melted cheese, ''[[requeijão]]'', sautéed onions, [[vinaigrette]] sauce, [[shoestring potatoes]], [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], hot sauce and many others. It is usually served as a casual meal, perhaps with a cold [[beer]], very popularly on road-side dinners.

===Chile===
In Chile,  ''choripanes'' are very popular, particularly consumed as a classic appetizer during ''[[asado]]''s.  Traditionally served in [[marraqueta]] and topped with aji and [[pebre]], also mayonnaise is commonly used. Chilean ''choripanes'' are also made with [[longaniza]]s instead of ''chorizos''.

===Puerto Rico===
Usually sold in bakeries ("''panaderías''"), they consist of a Spanish-style ''chorizo'' such as ''[[chistorra]]'' or ''[[cantimpalo]]'', [[pickled cucumber|pickles]] and [[mayonnaise]] inside a typical home made Puerto Rican bread called "pan de agua". Other ingredients may be added, [[Manchego cheese]] and [[ketchup]] being popular ones.

===Uruguay===
The chorizo is sausage made of pork, may be used whole or cut in half lengthwise. Usually the sauce ''[[chimichurri]]'' is used as well as mayonnaise, sometimes Uruguayans tend to add tomatoes and lettuce. It's served in baguette or in "pan catalán" (sliced soft bread roll), except in football matches where is served in simple bread roll or bun (like hamburguers). Unlike in [[Argentina]], chorizo is not only used as an appetizer but also as a garnish for the asado.

===U.S.===
In the U.S., they are commonly available at lunch counters in [[Miami]]'s [[Cubans in Miami|Cuban]] diners and cafes, where the sandwich is customarily served on Cuban bread and topped with raw or fried onion and popularly eaten with a tropical fruit shake.

Made of glass, it is one of the oldest earliest Islamic dated objects in an American museum. In the collection of the [[Walters Art Museum]]]]
'''Coin weights''' are weights which were designed to weigh [[coins]] in order to assure their quality.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GpQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA195 ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936'' by T.W. Arnold p.195]&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of coin weights, especially glass ones, goes back to [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Byzantine]] times.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Coin weights were also known in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aTdN3PWIvs0C&amp;pg=PT144 ''Rome and China: Comparative Perspectives on Ancient World Empires'' by [[Walter Scheidel]] p.144]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]], where they are called ''Sanadjāt'', coin weights are said to have been introduced by a Jew named Sumair in 694.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Up to that point coins were only compared to coins of good quality.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Islamic coin weights were made of bronze, iron, and later glass (considered to be unalterable).&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; They bear inscriptions related to Islamic rulers and moneyers and are therefore valuable [[epigraphical]] objects.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt;

Coins weights were also known in the [[Carolingian Empire]], where they were stamped with regular coin dyes to clarify their attribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xwviQtdCUhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Carolingian coinage and the Vikings'' by Simon Coupland p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic coin weights were introduced to [[Great Britain]] in the 9-10th century CE through the Vikings.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37754">'''Communicative ecology''' is a conceptual model used in the field of media and communications research. 

The model is used to analyse and represent the relationships between [[social interaction]]s, [[discourse]], and communication [[Media (communication)|media]] and technology of individuals, collectives and networks in physical and digital environments. Broadly, the term communicative ecology refers to "the context in which [[communication]] processes occur" [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007, p. 9)]]. These processes are seen to involve people communicating with others in their [[social network]]s, both face-to-face and using a mix of media and communication technologies [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi, Slater &amp; Hearn, 2003)]] [[#Tacchi2007|(Tacchi, et al. 2007)]]. 

== Rationale ==
The communicative ecology model enables researchers to take a holistic approach to understanding the dynamic interrelationships between social dimensions, discourse and communications technology in both physical and digital environments. The use of an ecological metaphor markedly expands the potential sphere of inquiry for communications and media research. It shifts the focus away from studies focusing on single communications devices or applications, for example the mobile telephone or email, towards whole system interactions. Consequently, it extends the possibility of research into population change and lifecycles, spatiotemporal dynamics, networks and clusters, and power relations within the frame of a communicative ecology. Also, as ecologies are not isolated entities, further questions regarding the similarities, differences, interrelationships and transactions between ecologies can be examined. A richer understanding can then be derived from micro and macro level analysis of the social and cultural context of communication [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

The concept of communicative ecology has emerged amidst concerns that studies attempting to identify causal relationships between discrete technologies and social impacts neglect variables that are salient to the successful implementation and uptake of technologies ''in situ'' [[#Dourish2004|(Dourish, 2004)]]. This mirrors the way in which the biological field of [[ecology]] emerged from the perceived inadequacies of studies of single species of flora and fauna. In a similar way, researchers who use the communicative ecology framework argue that media technologies should not be examined independent of their context of use. They assert that [[new media]] must be both studied and designed with reference to the users' wider set of social relationships, the nature of the communication itself and other media in use. Through use of [[ethnography|ethnographic approaches]] a richer, more nuanced understanding of the communicative system of a given setting is able to be developed.

New media are usually introduced into existing communication structures and must compete for attention in relation to the users' existing portfolio of communication tools. Consequently, if a new communication technology does not complement or enhance the existing toolset it risks rejection. The communicative ecology model allows researchers to examine how a new form of media or technology may or may not be integrated into existing communication patterns [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]].

However, the potential utility of the communicative ecology model is far broader than this. Any new form of social intervention, content or technology must be locally appropriate for it to succeed [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]]. Hence, the communicative ecology framework is useful for [[human-computer interaction]] designers, content creators, and in [[urban informatics]], [[urban planning]], [[community development]] and [[education]] when seeking opportunities to enhance or augment local, social, and communication practices.

==History and usage==
The concept of communicative ecology is derived from Altheide's "ecology of communication" [[#Altheide1994|(1994;]][[#Altheide1995|1995)]]. Altheide developed this concept to examine the mutually influential relationships between information technology, communication formats and social activities, within the context of people's social and physical environments, as they define and experience them. The concept is influenced by [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan's]] [[#McLuhan1962|(1962)]] research on [[media ecology]], which demonstrates that new media and technology can influence communicative content, and also the [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] perspective of communication as embedded in context [[#Barnlund1979|(Barnlund, 1979]]). Altheide considers ecology of communication to be a fluid construct that can be used as a frame to investigate the ways in which social activities are being created and modified through the use of technologies that, in turn, give rise to new communication formats. He is particularly interested in the relationship between social activities and technologies for surveillance and control.

The communicative ecology concept has been further developed for use in studies of information and communication technologies (ICT) initiatives in developing nations [[#Slater2002|(Slater, Tacchi &amp; Lewis, 2002)]]. A guide to the study of communicative ecologies using the ethnographic action research method, developed with the support of UNESCO, has spawned a proliferation of empirical research [[#Tacchi2007|(Tacchi et al., 2007)]] [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi, Slater &amp; Hearn, 2003)]]. Many of these investigations have focused on ICT for development projects associated with community technology centres and local information networks in South Asian and African nations [[#Slater2002|(Slater et al., 2002;]][[#Slater2004|Slater &amp; Tacchi, 2004;]][[#Pringle2004|Pringle, Bajracharya, &amp; Bajracharya, 2004;]][[#Sharma2005|Sharma, 2005;]][[#Nair2006|Nair, Jennaway &amp; Skuse, 2006;]][[#Rangaswamy2007|Rangaswamy, 2007)]]. In these studies, local community members are often engaged as active participants in a research and project development process that provides opportunities for them to gain the ICT literacy skills necessary to create locally meaningful content [[#Subramanian2004|(Subramanian, Nair &amp; Sharma, 2004;]][[#Tacchi2005a|Tacchi, 2005a]], [[#Tacchi2007|2007;]][[#TacchiWatkins2007|Tacchi &amp; Watkins, 2007)]]. Many of these research activities investigate and support interventions that aim to alleviate poverty [[#Slater2005|(Slater &amp; Kwami, 2005)]], educate [[#Subramanian2005|(Subramanian, 2005)]] and promote the [[digital inclusion]] necessary for citizens to actively participate in civic life and have their voices heard [[#Tacchi2005b|(Tacchi, 2005b;]][[#Skuse2007|Skuse &amp; Cousins, 2007]], [[#Skuse2008|2008;]][[#SkuseFildes2007|Skuse, Fildes, Tacchi, Martin &amp; Baulch, 2007;]]. Some studies have reported on the use of a particular ICT, for example [[community radio]] [[#Tacchi2005c|(Tacchi, 2005c)]] or [[mobile phone]]s [[#Horst2006|(Horst &amp; Miller, 2006;]][[#Miller2007|Miller, 2007)]], in relation to broader communication patterns.

More recently, the communicative ecology framework has been extended in studies of the nature of media use to support social networks in [[urban village]]s and inner-city apartment buildings [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. This paper introduced the concept of dimensions to the communicative ecology model. [[#Button2007|Button and Partridge (2007)]] used the model to examine the online communicative ecology of neighbourhood websites. The model has also been used to investigate how students communicate and reflect on their learning [[#Berry2006|(Berry &amp; Hamilton, 2006)]].

A special issue of the Electronic Journal of Communication showcased the versatility of the communicative ecology approach [[#HearnFoth2007|(Hearn &amp; Foth, 2007)]]. In this issue, [[#Allison2007|Allison (2007)]] looked at the communicative ecology from the perspective of the individual, whereas [[#Wilkin2007|Wilkin, Ball-Rokeach, Matsaganis and Cheong (2007)]] used a panoptic perspective to compare the ecologies of geo-ethnic communities. [[#Peeples2007|Peeples and Mitchell (2007)]] used the model to explore the social activity of protest. [[#Powell2007|Powell (2007)]] focused on a particular medium, public internet access, in an urban context. [[#Shepherd2007|Shepherd, Arnold, Bellamy and Gibbs (2007)]] extended the concept to attend to the material and spatial aspects of the communicative ecology of the domestic sphere.

The term "communicative ecology" has also been used in other studies with various interpretations. [[interactional sociolinguistics|Interactional sociolinguists]] use the term to describe the local communicative environment of a particular setting in which discourse is contextualised. Using methods drawn from [[linguistic anthropology]], their research begins with a period of ethnography in which a rich understanding of the local communicative ecology is formed. Discourse is then analysed in relation to this ecological context [[#Gumperz1999|(Gumperz, 1999)]]. [[#Roberts2005|Roberts (2005)]] describes a communicative ecology as comprising the identity of participants, the topics of communication and the ways in which things are communicated, including tone of voice, directness, etc. [[#Beier2001|Beier (2001)]] draws on [[Dell Hymes|Hymes']] [[#Hymes1974|(1974)]] work in [[ethnography of communication]] and uses the concept to understand the range of communicative practices of the Nanti people as a system of interaction.

From an [[applied linguistics]] perspective, [[#McArthur2005|McArthur (2005)]] describes a communicative ecology as embracing the nature and evolution of language, media and communication technologies. He uses the term to discuss the interactions between the world's languages and communication technologies. [[#Wagner2004|Wagner (2004)]] uses the term to refer to the deep structures of meaning and communicative action that human language shares with other species, particularly the [[bonobo]]. In cultural studies of terrorism, [[#White2003|White (2003)]] uses the term to describe the interchange of signs within interacting networks of individuals and collectives.

In their study of [[computer-mediated communication]] in the workplace, [[#Yates2003|Yates, Orlikowski and Woerner (2003)]] draw upon [[#Erickson2000|Erickson's (2000)]] work on genre ecologies to suggest a communicative ecology can be identified by the types and frequencies of communicative practices, such as email threading activities. Their version of communicative ecology is influenced by members of a workplace engaging in common activities, the length of time over which interaction takes place, whether communication media is synchronous or asynchronous and members' linguistic or cultural background.

There is not a single, agreed upon communicative ecology model, rather, this section highlights that there are various approaches to understanding and applying the model in various contexts. Furthermore, concepts that bear some similarity to communicative ecology include [[actor-network theory]] [[#Latour2005|(Latour, 2005)]], [[Scandinavian activity theory|activity theory]] [[#Nardi1996|(Nardi, 1996)]] the communication infrastructure model [[#Ball-Rokeach2001|(Ball-Rokeach, Kim &amp; Matei, 2001)]] and the personal communication system [[#Boase2008|(Boase, 2008)]].

==Characteristics==
Often in sociological literature, an ecology is seen to be anchored in a geographical area of human settlement. In the case of a communicative ecology, while the majority of studies have been conducted in physical environments, it is also possible to use the framework to examine ecologies grounded in an online environment. In many cases, communicative ecologies move seamlessly across both kinds of settings. For example, settings may include both public and private spaces, transport infrastructure and websites, in any combination.

Different settings have distinct affordances that may facilitate or hinder communication within an ecology. In a physical setting this might mean a neighbourhood has several coffee shops and parks where residents can interact. In an online setting, certain design features may enable certain types of communication and constrain others. For example, discussion boards facilitate one-to-many or many-to-many collective forms of communication but not one-to-one or peer-to-peer style networked communication that would be better served by [[short message service|SMS]] or [[Instant messaging &amp; messengers|instant messaging]] [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

Similar to biological ecologies, communicative ecologies have lifecycles. They can be described as new or well-established, active or dormant, or in a period of growth or decline. For example, residents of a new master-planned housing estate will have a young communicative ecology that is in a period of growth but may need cultivation in order to become active. In this case, sociocultural animation of the ecology may be required for it to become socially sustainable [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi et al., 2003)]].

Communicative ecologies can be conceived as having three layers and differing across several spectral dimensions. The nature of a communicative ecology changes as its members engage in and transition between different types of activities.

===Layers===
A communicative ecology has three layers: social, discursive and technological [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. These layers are seen to be intricately entwined and mutually constitutive, rather than discrete, hierarchical or as having unidirectional causal relationships. While it is challenging to consider each layer in isolation, analysing each layer independently can be a beneficial preliminary step prior to the examination of the complex, mutual shaping relationships that form part of the holistic view of a communicative ecology.

The social layer refers to people and the various social structures with which they identify themselves, ranging from informal personal networks to formal institutions. For example, this may include groups of friends, formal community organisations and companies. The discursive layer refers to the themes or content of both mediated and unmediated communication. The technological layer comprises communication media and technologies. This includes both traditional media, such as newspapers and television, and new media including mobile phones and social networking sites. The devices and applications within this layer are differentiated according to the communication model they facilitate. For example, collective communication is made possible through one-to-many or many-to-many forms of media, such as television or online discussion boards, whereas networked communication can be enabled through one-to-one or peer-to-peer media, including instant messaging or SMS [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

The layered nature of the communicative ecology framework enables the investigation of research questions surrounding the media preferences of diverse individuals and groups and how these choices influence their relationships. It also allows researchers to explore the nature of discourse between individuals and within groups, and how communication changes according to the nature of people's relationships with one another. The communicative ecology model is also useful for considering how different topics of communication affect choice of media and how different media shape communicative content.

===Dimensions===
Communicative ecologies vary across several spectral dimensions. The dimensions identified to date, include networked/collective, global/local and online/offline [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. The dimensional properties of communicative ecologies allow researchers to consider both the relative strength of each characteristic, and also how individuals and the ecology itself transitions fluidly between dimensions.

For example, researchers can question how an individual or group's choice of media changes as they transition between networked and collective forms of interaction. They may also consider how different media may facilitate or constrain either networked or collective interaction. If interested in the global or local characteristics of an ecology, researchers may examine how communication with proximate others may be mediated differently from communication with others in distant locales. They could also explore which communication topics are more likely to occur at the local level rather than within globally distributed social networks. As users of new technologies now move seamlessly between what was formerly constituted as online and offline domains, researchers may use the communicative ecology model to address questions of how and why people choose certain assemblages of online and offline media to achieve particular communicative goals. Investigation of how the nature of discourse may affect the choice of online or offline modes of interaction is also possible.

Communicative ecologies can also be characterised across several other dimensions. One example is the private/public dimension. People may choose to interact and communicate with each other in private settings, such as their home or via email, or in more public settings, such as a restaurant or chat room.

===Types of activity===
The nature of an individual's communicative ecology changes as they transition between types of activity. For example, they may choose to use different media when communicating with colleagues as compared to planning an evening out with friends. Similarly, a workplace's communicative ecology may differ from that of a tennis club or a loosely joined network of environmental activists.

The activities of everyday life can be grouped into various types. Five example categories are as follows. The first three are derived from [[#Stebbins2007|Stebbins's (2007)]] typology of leisure activities.

# Casual leisure (e.g. dinner with friends, seeing a movie)
# Serious leisure (e.g. volunteering, amateur car racing)
# Project-based leisure (e.g. short hobby-based education courses, one-off participation in a fun run)
# Domestic/personal work (e.g. housework, grocery shopping, personal grooming)
# Work/formal education (e.g. job, school attendance)

These groupings enable exploration of the patterns of social interactions, topics of communication and media applications that may be specific to an activity type.

==Scope, resolution and granularity==
The study of a communicative ecology requires decisions to be made concerning the scope of both data collection and analysis. Prior to data collection, a decision must be made as to the investigative frame of the study, whereas decisions regarding the analytical scope of a study may be made after a rich picture of the ecology has emerged.

While an ecological study aims to be holistic, an appropriate frame for the study must be decided upon at the outset. The scope of communicative ecology research settings is generally restricted to a bounded geographical space. It has been proposed that the communicative ecology framework is suited to studies at the level of the dwelling, neighbourhood, suburb or city [[#HearnFoth2007|(Hearn &amp; Foth, 2007)]]. However, it is also suitable for studies of communicative ecologies that are grounded in online environments. In this case, the setting could be limited to one or several websites [[#Button2007|(Button &amp; Partridge, 2007)]].

Temporal considerations may also shape data collection procedures. For example, an ecology could be examined at a single point of time or longitudinally. It is possible that the nature of a communicative ecology may also vary according to time of day, week or season.

The analysis of a communicative ecology can occur at both macro and micro levels within this spatiotemporal frame. It can help to think of a communicative ecology as a map and its edges as the frame. We can increase the resolution of certain features by using a magnifying glass. By stepping away from the map, we can increase the granularity of our view and see how features interrelate with the ecology as a whole. In this way, the interrelationships between agents are not ignored, as they may be in studies that focus on single communication devices or applications, but may be temporarily set aside while other features are examined more closely. By viewing the map as a whole first, the researcher may be able to make better analytical choices than was possible prior to data collection.

Some possible methods for delimiting the analytical scope of a communicative ecology study include using features of a layer or another characteristic. For example, the analysis could be delimited to examining the ecology of an individual, a small social network or group, or by certain demographic characteristics. It could focus on the ecology of a specific theme of communication, form of media or technology, setting or activity. Alternatively, it could investigate a single dimension of a communicative ecology, for example, only local or public forms of communication.

==Perspective==
Communicative ecology researchers speak in terms of "mapping" the ecology. This term may be misleading as it could appear to indicate the creation of cartographic renderings of the communicative ecology as it relates to its locality. Mapping the ecology, in the main, refers to drawing conceptual maps and creating or collecting oral or written descriptions of the phenomena that constitute the communicative ecology.

There are two primary perspectives taken to communicative ecology research that are loosely correlative with the [[emic and etic]] positions taken in classic ethnographic studies. A researcher can work from the outside of the ecology looking in with the aim of creating a holistic overview. Alternatively, they can position themselves within the communicative ecology with the aim of looking at it from the participants' points of view. The external view is useful if a comparison between local systems is desired. A centric view is better suited to understanding how people construct and make sense of their communicative ecology.

The choice of perspective may enhance or limit the utility of the data. For example, a birds-eye view may fail to capture significant individual differences in the experience of a communicative ecology, such as those brought about by differing wealth or literacy levels. Ideally, communicative ecology research should use a variety of perspectives in order to obtain a more complete representation and deeper understanding.

==Associated research approaches and methods==
The study of communicative ecologies is commonly associated with a research approach known as ethnographic action research. This approach combines ethnographic methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews, with participatory methods and action research. The ethnographic methods enable researchers to develop a rich understanding of the meanings derived from media and communication technologies. The action research methods allow the study to be located in not only communication theory, but also grassroots communication practice. In this approach, participants can act as co-investigators in cycles of inquiry, action and reflection and researchers are able to give back in a way that will develop the communicative ecology. In this way, ethnographic action research is suited to both research and project development agendas [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]].

'''Musical tributes''' or '''homages''' from one composer to another can take many forms. Following are examples of the major types of tributes occurring in [[classical music]]. A particular work may fit into more than one of these types.

==Variations==
{{main|Variation (music)|List of variations on a theme by another composer}}
'''[[Variation (music)|Variations]]''' on a theme by another composer. These are usually written as discrete sets of variations. There are hundreds of examples, including:
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Diabelli Variations]]''{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--Citation needed confirming that Beethoven actually meant this as a tribute to Diabelli.--&gt;
* [[Johannes Brahms]]'s ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'' (which theme was probably not written by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] at all){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--Citation needed confirming that Brahms actually meant this as a tribute to Haydn.--&gt;

==Works with other titles==
Many works are based on a theme or themes by another composer (sometimes anonymous or traditional). They range from short pieces to extended major compositions. Sometimes these works are no more than sets of variations under another name, but sometimes they go beyond that. They appear under many titles, including: 
{{main|-ana}}
* Works ending in '''[[-ana]]''', such as:

** [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s tribute to [[Gioachino Rossini]], titled ''[[Rossiniana]]''
** [[Robert Gerhard]]'s hommage to [[Felip Pedrell]], titled ''Pedrelliana'' 
** [[Manuel de Falla]]'s ''Pedrelliana'', to Pedrell too, fourth part of his ''Hommages'' suite
** [[Joaquín Rodrigo]]'s ''Soleriana'' (1953), on eight pieces by [[Antoni Soler]]

His setting was called ''[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]''

* [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' [[Symphony No. 5 (Vaughan Williams)|Symphony No. 5]] is dedicated to [[Jean Sibelius]].

==Cryptogram==
{{main|Musical cryptogram}}
'''[[Musical cryptogram]]s''', where the composer’s name is encoded in musical letters. The most famous example of this is the [[BACH motif]], which has been used by over 400 composers&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, Ulrich; Dorfmüller, Joachim; and Küster, Konrad. 1985. "Die Tonfolge B–A–C–H in Kompositionen des 17. bis 20. Jahrhunderts: ein Verzeichnis", in: ''300 Jahre Sebastian Bach'', pp. 389–419 (exhibition catalogue){{Full|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--Editor(s), place, and publisher needed, as well as the particular page on which the verification is to be found. ISBN would be nice, if one can be found.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; in tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach (Bach himself used it more than once in his own works). Other examples include:
* [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Menuet sur le nom d'Haydn]]''
* [[Arnold Bax]]'s ''Variations on the name [[Gabriel Fauré]]'' for harp and strings
* the [[DSCH motif]], depicting [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]; it has been used by various other composers in tribute to him.{{Vague|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--Which composers, and were they all tributes, or were some satirical?--&gt;

'''Fanspeak''' is the [[slang]] or [[jargon]] current in [[science fiction fandom|science fiction and fantasy fandom]], especially those terms in use among readers and writers of [[science fiction fanzine]]s.

Fanspeak is made up of [[acronym]]s, blended words, obscure in-jokes, [[pun]]s, coinages from science fiction novels or films, and archaic or standard English words used in specific ways relevant or amusing to the science fiction community.

==Evolution==

Many terms used in fanspeak have spread to members of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[Renaissance Fair]] participants, and [[internet]] [[Personal computer game|gaming]] and [[online chat|chat]] [[fan (aficionado)|fan]]s, due to the social and contextual intersection between the communities.

Common examples of widespread usages are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
* ''fen'' as the plural of ''fan''
* ''fannish'' "of or relating to fans and fandom"
* ''gafiate'' (verb), an acronym for "getting away from it all" (i.e., leaving fandom, temporarily or permanently)
* ''fafiate'' (verb), an acronym for "forced away from it all" (i.e., being forced to leave fandom for personal or professional reasons)

A few fannish terms have become standard English, such as [[fanzine]], short for "'''fan''' maga'''zine'''", coined by [[Russ Chauvenet]] in 1940, which swiftly replaced the older term ''fanmag''.

Conversely, some fannish terms have been made obsolete by changes in technology (the decline of the [[mimeograph]] has doomed ''corflu'' for "[[correction fluid]]"), cultural changes (a ''femmefan''' [female fan] is no longer unusual) or the mere passage of time (''[[slan shack]]'' for "a house where a bunch of fans live together" has faded, since fewer young fans have read ''[[Slan]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]]). ''Slan'' also produced one of the most common fan idioms: "Fans are [[slan]]s". 
Fanspeak is so interwoven into the fabric of fandom that it is difficult to discuss fandom without resorting to fannish terms such as ''fanac'' "fannish activity" or ''[[filk|filk music]]'' (originally a typo for "folk music").

==Sociology==
Like other forms of jargon, fanspeak serves as a means of inclusion and exclusion within the fannish community. In the 1970s, the use of traditional fanspeak separated the [[fanzine]] and [[science fiction convention|convention]]-attending subcommunity (sometimes distinguished as ''trufen'' or "true fans") from fans of science fiction movies and television shows (''mediafen'').  The division of the community into trufen and others is rejected by many fans as inherently unfannish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stilyagi.org/content/fanspeak-dictionary Fanspeak Dictionary]: see entry ''trufan''&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, subsets of fanspeak define subcommunities within fandom.  
For example, ''ringers'' for "fans of [[The Lord of the Rings]]" is used primarily by fans of the [[Peter Jackson]] films (see also [[Tolkien fandom]]).

The '''flag of Georgia''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: საქართველოს სახელმწიფო დროშა; ''sakartvelos sakhelmtsʼipo drosha''), also known as the '''Five Cross Flag''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ხუთჯვრიანი დროშა; ''khutjvriani drosha''), is one of the [[national symbol]]s of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Originally a [[banner]] of the [[medieval]] [[Kingdom of Georgia]], it was brought back to popular use in the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|21st centuries]] during periods of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Georgian national revival]]. Prior to obtaining its official status in 2004, the flag was popularized by the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] and served as one of the most recognizable symbols of the [[Rose Revolution]]. 

== History==
The current flag was used by the Georgian patriotic movement following the country's independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. By the late 1990s, the design had become widely known as the Georgian historical national flag as [[Vexillology|vexillologist]]s had pointed out the red-on-white [[Jerusalem cross]] shown as the flag of [[Tbilisi]] in a 14th-century map by [[Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano]].&lt;ref&gt;"The new flag of Georgia does not seem to be related with this historical banner. The flag of the National Movement was unknown ten years ago [1993] and was called 'the Georgian historical national flag' by the opposition leaders only after publications by the Georgian vexillologist I.L. Bichikashvili." Mikhail Revnivtsev, 25 November 2003 [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ge.html crwflags.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of Georgians, including the influential [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Catholicos-Patriarch]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], supported the restoration of the flag and in 1999 the [[Parliament of Georgia]] passed a bill to change the flag. However, it was not endorsed by the [[President of Georgia|President]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. It was adopted in the early 2000s by the main opposition party, the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], as a symbol of popular resistance to Shevardnadze's rule.&lt;ref&gt;"A majority of Georgians, including the patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, have long favored adopting the five-cross banner as the nation's official flag.  But the outgoing president stymied all efforts to make the change. In 1999, the Georgian Parliament voted to change the flag, and all Shevardnadze had to do was issue a supportive Decree. Inexplicably, he refused to do so, instead setting up a powerless Heraldic Commission to study the matter. When Saakashvili founded the National Movement in 2001, therefore, the five-cross flag was the natural choice to illustrate his party's populist bent." Brendan Koerner, "[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2003/11/whats_with_georgias_flags.html What's With Georgia's Flags?]", ''Slate'', 25 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag was adopted by Parliament on 14 January 2004.&lt;ref name='agenda' /&gt; Saakashvili formally endorsed it via Presidential Decree No. 31 signed on 25 January,&lt;ref&gt;[https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/34906 Presidential Decree 31]{{link language|ka}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his election as President. 14 January is annually marked as a [[Flag Day]] in Georgia.&lt;ref name='agenda'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/73182/eng|title=Georgia celebrates National Flag Day today|publisher=Agenda.ge|date=14 Jan 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The national flag of Georgia, as described in the decree:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Georgian national flag is a white rectangle, with in its central portion a large red cross touching all four sides of the flag. In the four corners there are four ''[[Bolnisi cross|bolnur-katskhuri]]'' crosses (Also refer as Georgian Crosses aside with [[Grapevine cross]]) of the same colour (as the large cross).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Georgian States===
The first Georgian flag design came about during the era of the early Georgian state, the [[Principality of Iberia]] which had a red cross against a white background, similar to the [[flag of England]]).
The subsequent [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti]], shared this same flag. The flag of the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] had 4 green strips in a dextral position on the right side, while the left side contained the cross seen on the current Georgian flag.

===Medieval Georgian flags===

According to D. Kldiashvili (1997), the  Jerusalem cross might have been adopted during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|King George V]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kldiashvili, ქართული ჰერალდიკის ისტორია ("History of Georgian heraldry"), Parlamentis utskebani, 1997; pp. 30–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse of Kingdom of Georgia===
After the collapse of the Kingdom of Georgia, its successor states adopted their own flags, with most of them using animals as their representative symbols.

===Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (1762–1801)===
The kingdom was formed through the unification of Kartli and Kakheti. The flag had a white cross against a black background. The country lost its independence in 1801 to annexation by the [[Russian Empire]].

===Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (1918)===
While not technically a Georgian flag, this flag is of importance as Georgia was one of the founding countries of the federation. The [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]'s flag was a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] design, with a top band of dark yellow, a middle band of black, and a bottom band of red.

===Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–1921)===
During Georgia's brief existence as an independent state as the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] from 1918 to 1921, a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] was adopted. The design resulted from a national flag-designing contest won by the painter [[Iakob Nikoladze]]. It was abolished by the [[Soviet Union]] following the 1921 incorporation of Georgia into the USSR.

=== Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (1921–1991) ===
{{Main|Flag of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic}}
During the Soviet period, Georgia adopted several variants of the [[flag of the Soviet Union|red Soviet flag]] incorporating either the [[Georgian SSR|Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic's]] name, or a red [[hammer and sickle]] with a [[red star|star]] in a blue sun in the [[flag terminology|canton]] and a blue bar in the upper part of flag. The flag of the [[Flag of Georgian SSR|Georgian SSR]] was abolished by the Georgian government in November 1990 shortly before it declared independence from the Soviet Union.

===Georgia (1991–2004)===
The previous flag used by the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 was revived on 8 December 1991, by the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia]]. However, it lost popularity thereafter as it became associated with the chaotic and violent period around the collapse of the Soviet Union. The wine-red colour symbolises the good times in the past and the future, while the black represents Russian rule, and the white represents hope for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Luck, ed.|year=1997|title=Oxford Family Encyclopedia (first ed.).

The '''Grass Mud Horse''' or '''Cǎonímǎ''' ({{lang|zh-Hans|草泥马}}) is a [[Internet memes in China|Chinese Internet meme]] widely used as a form of symbolic defiance of the widespread [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet censorship in China]]. It is a [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese|play on]] the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] words ''[[Mandarin Chinese profanity#Mother|cào nǐ mā]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|肏你妈}}), literally, "fuck your mother", and is one of the so-called [[Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures|10 mythical creatures]] created in a hoax article on [[Baidu Baike]] in early 2009 whose names form obscene puns.  It has become an Internet chat forum cult phenomenon in China and has garnered worldwide press attention, with videos, cartoons and merchandise of the animal (which is said to resemble the [[alpaca]]), having appeared.

==Etymology and species==
[[File:Caonima word-150x150.jpg|thumb|150px|Chinese character invented by Netizens to depict the "Grass Mud Horse"]]
The ''Caonima'', literally "Grass Mud Horse", is supposedly a species of [[alpaca]]. The name is similar to a profanity ({{zh|c={{linktext|肏|你|妈}}/{{linktext|操|你|媽}}|p={{linktext|cào| nǐ| mā}}}}), which translates as "[[Mandarin Chinese profanity#Mother|fuck your mother]]". The comparison with the "animal" name is not an actual [[homophone]]: the two terms have the same consonants and vowels with different [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], and are represented by different [[Chinese characters|characters]].&lt;ref&gt;''China Digital Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the original, anonymous article from Baidu Baike, Grass Mud Horses originate from an area known as the "Mahler Gobi" Desert ({{lang|zh|马勒戈壁}}, ''Mǎlè Gēbì'', which resembles the Chinese characters {{lang|zh|妈了个屄}}, ''māle ge bī'', meaning "your mother's fucking cunt"). Some variants of the animal are known as "Fertile Grass Mud Horses" ({{lang|zh|沃草泥马}}, ''Wò Cǎonímǎ'', which resembles {{lang|zh|我肏你妈}}, ''Wǒ cào nǐ mā'', meaning "I fuck your mother"). The Grass Mud Horse can only eat fertile grass ({{lang|zh|沃草}}, ''wò cǎo'', which resembles {{lang|zh|我肏}}, ''Wǒ cào'', meaning "I fuck!" or simply "Fuck!"). Other subspecies are known as "Crazy/Violent/Insane Grass Mud Horses" ({{lang|zh|狂草泥马}}, ''Kuáng Cǎonímǎ''), which are considered the "kings" of the Caonima. The initial image found in the original Baidu Baike article was a zebra, but was replaced with an alpaca in subsequent revisions.&lt;ref&gt;''Baidu Baike''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|right|240px|This is a Chinese seal carving work. The character is a combination of three characters, made by Chinese [[netizen]]s as a satire of Chinese Internet Censorship.]]

Because the Grass Mud Horse is said to be the dominant species which lives within the Mahler [[Gobi Desert]], the region is also called the "Grass Mud Horse Gobi" ({{lang|zh-cn|草泥马戈壁}}, ''Cǎonímǎ Gēbì'', which is close in pronunciation to {{lang|zh-cn|肏你妈个屄}}, ''cào nǐ mā ge bī'', meaning "fuck your mother's cunt"). The animal is characterised as "lively, intelligent and tenacious".&lt;ref&gt;Wen Yunchao&lt;/ref&gt; However, their existence is said to be threatened by "[[River crab (Internet slang)|river crabs]]" which are invading their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;''AsiaNews.it''&lt;/ref&gt;

The river crab ({{lang|zh-cn|河蟹}}, ''héxiè'') symbolises internet censorship in China. Its pronunciation resembles the word for "harmony" ({{lang|zh-cn|和谐}}, ''héxié''), in reference to the "[[harmonious society]]", to which the Chinese leadership professes to aspire, and which Chinese internet censors use to justify internet censorship.&lt;ref name=pun&gt;Wines. 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130701-the-internets-undercover-code|title=The internet's new secret social codes|author=Tom Chatfield|date=2013-07-01|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en|website=BBC|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004190821/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130701-the-internets-undercover-code|archive-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when a post on [[microblog]] is deleted, the censorship notice says that the post has been "harmonized" ({{lang|zh-cn|和谐}}, ''héxié''), which is pronounced similar to "river crab" ({{lang|zh-cn|河蟹}}, ''héxiè'') in [[Mandarin Chinese]], so the netizens say that the post has been eaten by the "river crab".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html|title=A Dirty Pun Tweaks China’s Online Censors|language=en|website=The New York Times|date=2009-03-11|access-date=2018-10-04|dead-url=no|author=Michael Wines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004190906/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html|archive-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "crab" itself is rural slang, meaning "a bully who uses power through force", and the "river crab" has become a symbol of crude censorship backed with the threat of force.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The river crab is often depicted wearing three wristwatches, since 帶3個錶 (''dài sān ge biǎo'', "wears three watches") sounds similar to {{lang|zh-cn|三个代表}} (''Sāngè Dàibiǎo''), the ideology of the "[[Three Represents]]", an interpretation of communism promoted by former Chinese leader [[Jiang Zemin]].&lt;ref&gt;''University of Pompeau Fabria, Barcelona''. p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music videos,&lt;ref&gt;Skippybently&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feifei2226&lt;/ref&gt; "documentaries",&lt;ref&gt;''PowerApple.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xh1120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Awflasher&lt;/ref&gt; and cartoons about the Grass Mud Horse started appearing on the internet in 2009. The original Grass Mud Horse music video's musical arrangement of a children's choir has been compared to ''[[It's a Small World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nguyen&lt;/ref&gt; and it scored 1.4&amp;nbsp;million hits in its first three months. A cartoon about the Grass Mud Horse attracted a quarter million views, and a nature documentary on its habits received 180,000 more hits in the same amount of time.&lt;ref name=pun/&gt; Even though some Grass Mud Horse videos were not technically blocked by Chinese censors, some had their sound blocked, with a message saying "This video contains an audio track that has not been authorized by [[Warner Music Group|WMG]]."&lt;ref&gt;Xiaohe1120xu&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Naked ai weiwei.jpg|thumb|left|"草泥马挡中央": [[Ai Weiwei]]'s self-portrait holding the stuffed animal has a double meaning. It can be interpreted as: "Fuck your mother, [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party Central Committee]]"&lt;ref&gt;Estes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian.com.au"/&gt;]] --&gt;
''[[Yazhou Zhoukan]]'' ({{lang|zh|亞洲周刊}}) reported that [[Zhan Bin]], a teacher at the [[Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology]],&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Parker&lt;/ref&gt; created a new [[Chinese character]] by fusing the three Chinese character [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] for "grass", "mud", and "horse". The word has no official pronunciation. Official "cleanup" of the internet, which threatens the Caonima, has led Chinese internet users to create other "Mud Horse" variants, such as the {{lang|zh|"滾泥马"}} (''Gǔnnímǎ'', "Rolling Mud Horse") and the {{lang|zh|"幹泥马"}} (''Gànnímǎ'', "Working Mud Horse"). "Gunnima" and "Gannima" are puns for "fuck off" and "fuck your mother" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Li&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Grass Mud Horse" became widely known on the English-language web following the publication of a ''New York Times'' article on the phenomenon on 11 March 2009,&lt;ref name=pun/&gt; which sparked widespread discussion on blogs. In March 2011, "Grass Mud Horse" themed merchandise, such as plush dolls, began being sold over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Daddytypes.com''&lt;/ref&gt; One Guangzhou toy manufacturer reportedly produced its first batch of 150 Grass Mud Horse cuddly toys with official birth certificates issued by Mahler Gebi Mystical Creatures Bureau. The animals come in brown and white, named "Male" ({{lang|zh|马勒}}) and "Gebi" ({{lang|zh|歌碧}}) respectively, and sell for 40 yuan each. To accompany these, a user's and feeding manual have been created.&lt;ref&gt;''Nandu Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas they were called 'Caonima' before the crackdown, Internet sellers now list them using the correct Chinese term, '{{lang|zh|羊驼}}' (Alpaca).

In 2009, renowned artist [[Ai Weiwei]] published an image of himself nude with only a 'Caonima' hiding his genitals, with a caption "草泥马挡中央" ("cǎonímǎ dǎng zhōngyāng", literally "a Grass Mud Horse covering the center". One interpretation of the caption is: "fuck your mother, [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party Central Committee]]". Political observers speculated that the photo may have contributed to Ai's arrest in 2011 by angering Communist Party hardliners.

== Grass Mud Horse Day ==

In 2012, Chinese netizens started to designate the date 1 July as the "Grass Mud Horse Day". The date coincides with the "Party Day" in China which is to celebrate the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/sy1-07022012091402.html |script-title=zh:中共七一建党节 网民反讽战当局|publisher=RFA|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political discourse ==
The [[China Digital Times]] sees Caonima as the "de facto mascot of netizens in China fighting for free expression, inspiring poetry, photos and videos, artwork, lines of clothing, and more." It is an illustration of the "resistance discourse" of Chinese internet users with "increasingly dynamic and sometimes surprising presence of an alternative political discourse: images, frames, metaphors and narratives that have been generated from Internet memes [that] undermine the values and ideology that reproduce compliance with the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian regime, and, as such, force an opening for free expression and civil society in China."

Caonima is an expression of a broader Chinese internet culture of spoofing, mockery, punning, and parody known as [[e'gao]], which includes video mash-ups and other types of bricolage.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, “Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.” In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
The [[Beijing Television Cultural Center fire]] led to Chinese internet users creating a number of [[Photoshopping|photoshopped]] parodies, including one with a Caonima's outline in the smoke.

On 20 March 2009, ''[[the New York Times]]'' reported that a Chinese contributor to [[Global Voices Online]] posted a message from an Internet administrator to managers of online bulletin boards warning that "any content related with Grass-Mud Horse should not be promoted and hyped" because "the issue has been elevated to a political level ... The overseas media has exaggerated the incident as a confrontation between netizens and the government."&lt;ref&gt;Wines. 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Global Voices''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference on 25 March, the Foreign Ministry confirmed that China's access to YouTube had been officially blocked since two days earlier. According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], the block was an attempt to stem videos showing Chinese repression of the Tibetan population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising|Tibetan uprising of 10 March 1959]], and to block access to the popular Grass Mud Horse video posted in early March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/china-government-blocks-access-to-25-03-2009,30667.html Government blocks access to YouTube], Reporters Without Borders, 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] issued a directive on 30 March 2009 to highlight 31 categories of content prohibited online, including violence, pornography, and content which may "incite ethnic discrimination or undermine social stability". Many netizens believe the instruction follows the official embarrassment over the rise of the "Grass Mud Horse" phenomenon. Industry observers believe that the move was designed to stop the spread of parodies or other comments on politically sensitive issues in the runup to the 20th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|4 June Tiananmen Square protests]].&lt;ref name=parody&gt;{{cite news|author=Vivian Wu|title=Censors strike at internet content after parody hit |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the government's directive, most Chinese essays and blog postings made about the Grass Mud Horse have been removed from the Internet after being discovered by government censors.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt;  Some of these citizen efforts to keep the Grass Mud Horse alive have moved offshore to the U.S. and elsewhere, including for example the creation of an independent Canadian publishing house (see [[Mudgrass Press]]) referencing the meme.

The Caonima reappeared as a subject of online cartoon satire following the announcement of the [[Green Dam Youth Escort]] pornography blocking software project.&lt;ref name="zdnet090618"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=4988 |title=China's not backing down but Green Dam Girl fights back |first=Richard |last=Koman |date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music publishing''' is the business of creating, producing and distributing printed musical scores, parts, and books in various types of [[music notation]], while ensuring that the [[composer]], [[songwriter]] and other creators receive credit and [[royalties]] or other payment (where applicable). This article outlines the early history of the industry.

==Printing==
Music publishing did not begin on a large scale until the mid-15th century, when mechanical techniques for printing music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of [[liturgical chant]]s, dates from about 1465, shortly after the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. This was a very [[labor-intensive]] and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve [[sacred music]] for the church. The few collections of [[secular music]] that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy noblemen. Examples include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] of Italian [[Trecento]] music and the [[Chantilly Codex]] of French [[Ars subtilior]] music.

[[File:Adieu mes amours tenor.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A page from the [[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton|''Odhecaton'']]'']]

===Petrucci===
The father of modern music printing was [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year [[monopoly]] on printed music in [[Venice]] during the 16th century. His first collection was entitled ''[[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton]]'' and contained 96 [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions, mostly by [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Heinrich Isaac]]. He flourished by focusing on [[Flemish]] works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the Renaissance. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean results, though it was time-consuming and expensive.

===Rastell===
Around 1520 in England, [[John Rastell]] developed a single-impression method for printing music.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Bernstein, ''Music Printing in Renaissance Venice: The Scotto Press, 1539-1572'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; With his method, the staff lines, words and notes were all part of a single piece of type, making it much easier to produce. However, this method produced messier results, as the staff lines were often inexactly aligned and looked wavy on the page. The single-impression method eventually triumphed over Petrucci's, however, and became the dominant mode of printing until [[copper-plate engraving]] took over in the 17th century. This method was adopted and used widely by a Frenchman, [[Pierre Attaingnant]].

==Copyright==
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|150px|First page from the "Statute of Anne"]]

The concept of musical copyright had its beginnings in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] of England who required copies of all printed matter to be sent to him and offered protection to printers in the form of licenses, primarily to produce a new source of revenue. In 1575 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted [[Thomas Tallis]] and his pupil [[William Byrd]] a 21-year patent monopoly on the printing and publishing of polyphonic music.&lt;ref name="Wainright2006"&gt;J. P. Wainright, 'England ii, 1603-1642' in J. Haar, ed., ''European Music, 1520-1640'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), pp. 509-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern copyright law was the [[Statute of Anne]] (1709), which protected all published works for a period of fourteen years, later extended to twenty-eight years. The earliest attempt at a printed musical [[copyright notice]] appears in the [[Song of Songs|"Shir Hashirim"]] of [[Salomone Rossi]] (Venice, 1623) which includes a [[rabbinical]] curse on those [[Copyright infringement|infringing]] the text, written by [[Leon of Modena]].

===1886 Berne Convention===
The first international agreement involving copyright was the [[Berne Convention]] of 1886. The core principle of the Convention is its provision that each of the contracting countries shall provide automatic protection for works in all other countries of the union and for unpublished works whose authors are citizens of or residents in those countries. Performance rights are included in these provisions.  As of March 2012, 165 countries had become parties to the convention.

===United States===
The first U.S. [[Copyright Act of 1790|federal copyright law]] gave protections to "maps, charts, and books." Contrary to some scholarly accounts, the 1790 Act's protection of "books" did encompass musical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;''Clayton v. Stone'', 5 F. Cas. 999, 1000 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1829) (“A book [within the Copyright Act of 1790 can be] a volume made up of several sheets bound together; it may be printed only on one sheet, as the words of a song or the music accompanying it”)&lt;/ref&gt; The first registration in the U.S. for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794 by [[Raynor Taylor]] for the original song "[[The Kentucky Volunteer]]."&lt;ref&gt;William F. Patry, Copyright Law and Practice 30 n.91 (2000) (“The first registration for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794, for The Kentucky Volunteer: A New Song, written by ‘a lady of Philadelphia.’ The composer is believed to have been Raynor Taylor.”) (citing Federal Copyright Records 1790-1800 at 15 (1987)).&lt;/ref&gt; However, musical compositions were not ''explicitly'' protected until the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], and then protection remained limited to reproduction rights. The copyright term was twenty-eight years plus a fourteen-year renewal period.

==Performing rights==
[[File:Rue Chaptal, 10.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Façade of 10 Rue Chaptal, first home of SACEM]]
While England was a leader in the development of copyright, the French led the way in performing rights. In 1777, [[Pierre de Beaumarchais]] founded the ''"Bureau de Legislation Dramatique"'' which became the present [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] (SACD) in 1829. Many years later, in 1847, this inspired the composer and [[librettist]] [[Ernest Bourget]]  to claim payment for each performance of his works at [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Les Ambassadeurs]], a leading Café-concert venue of that time. A [[lawsuit]] won by Bourget and others in 1851 led to the formation of the [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique]] (SACEM) – the first performing rights society in the world.

Other countries followed suit: The Italian [[Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori]] (SIAE) was founded in 1882 and the Spanish ''"Sociedad de Autores"'', predecessor of the current [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores]] (SGAE), in 1899. The predecessor to the [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|Gesellschaft für Musikalische Aufführungs und Mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte]] (GEMA) was formed in Germany by composer [[Richard Strauss]] in 1903. It became GEMA in 1915 when it merged with another small society. So, by the end of the 19th century, the foundation had been laid for the modern music publishing industry.

==Early modern era: 18th century==

===German publishers===
As England was a leader in developing copyright systems and France was ahead in developing performing rights, Germany was the pioneering country in modern music publishing. The first German music publishing enterprises date from the 18th century. [[Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf]] of [[Leipzig]], a printer and general publisher, decided to specialize in music printing as of 1754.  He became successful by developing improvements in the setting of music type. [[Gottfried Christoph Härtel]] joined the firm in 1795, which soon became the partnership of '''[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]]'''. They were the original publishers for a who's-who of great German composers, including [[Beethoven]], [[Haydn]], [[Mozart]], [[Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Wagner]].

'''[[Schott Music]]''' of [[Mainz]] was founded in 1770 by [[Bernhard Schott]] and still exists today.  They specialized in French and Italian operas and, more recently, have published works by [[Hindemith]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Carl Orff|Orff]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Hans Werner Henze|Henze]]. '''[[N. Simrock]]''' of [[Bonn]], and later Berlin, was established in 1790 by [[Nikolaus Simrock]].  Their original publications included works by Beethoven, Haydn, [[Meyerbeer]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], Schumann and [[Brahms]].

===United States of America===
In 1764, [[Josiah Flagg]] compiled the first collection of popular and religious music, printed on paper made in the colonies.  The post-revolutionary period was notable for the arrival of the first professional music publishers from Europe in the 1770s. They opened shops in [[Philadelphia]], New York, [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]], bringing with them European technology. [[Benjamin Carr]] and [[James Hewitt (musician)|James Hewitt]] were two important early American music publishers. The first song published under US copyright was [[The Kentucky Volunteer]], by Carr's own house.

In the first quarter of the 19th century alone, 10,000 pieces of popular music were printed by U.S. publishers. The industry, however, did nothing to promote music or develop writers. Songs became popular by word-of-mouth. Most [[Minstrel show|minstrel troupe]]s and professional singers wrote their own music or had songs written to order. [[Stephen Foster]] was the first composer who tried to make a living as an independent professional songwriter but, in the 1850s, copyright protection was so lax and royalties so small (or non-existent) that he found himself living in poverty. This changed only gradually as young men involved in other business enterprises began to perceive the possibilities for enrichment in song publishing.
[[File:AftertheBallSheet.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music for "After the Ball"]]
Prior to the 1880s, popular music publishing was a secondary function of music stores or "serious" ([[Classical music|Classical]]) music publishers. After 1880, publishers in New York developed a promotional technique called [[Song-plugger|plugging]].  By 1900, most music publishers had clustered their businesses along 28th St. (between [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Ave.]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]) in order to be closer to New York's thriving entertainment center. This area came to be known as [[Tin Pan Alley]]. The first decade of the 20th century saw the production of more popular music than had ever been written up to that time: about 25,000 songs annually. In 1893, sheet music for the song [[After the Ball (song)|"After the Ball"]] sold one million copies and, over the next ten years, went on to sell a total of ten million.

Despite the enactment of new U.S. copyright legislation, including the 1891 [[Chace Act]], which allowed for the international protection of copyrights, the provisions of the [[1909 Copyright Act]] were generally ignored. To correct this situation, operetta composer [[Victor Herbert]] established the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), in 1914. It quickly attracted prominent composers such as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[John Philip Sousa]], and was able to ensure that everyone was properly paid and credited for their work.

== Licensing ==

There are many aspects to music publishing. Chief among them is the licensing of music for use in advertising, television, films and other purposes. Music publishing started out by just being the publishing of the actual sheet music, and not even the score. Song sheets were made which just had the lyrics of a popular song. In the 19th century, sheet music for songs began including a simple piano [[accompaniment]] and notation for the song's melody. In the 2010s, music publishing is the exploitation of compositions (songs, instrumental pieces, and other music) for various performance uses, including newer uses such as licensing for video games, for use by recording artists looking for their next hit single and for use in a range of licensing purposes.

===Licenses===

Within music publishing there are many different types of licenses. For instance:

• Blanket license

• Mechanical license

• Performing Rights License (PRO)

• [[Synchronization rights|Synchronization License or Sync Rights]]

A blanket license is a big annual fee to one of the key performing rights organizations (PRO) ([[SESAC]], [[ASCAP]], or [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]]). The blanket license paid to the PRO, covers every work that is in the PRO's catalog. Blanket licenses are mostly used by television networks and radio stations so that they have the right to play any song or piece from one catalog instead of paying license fees for every single song.&lt;ref name="Mark Halloran 2007"&gt;Mark Halloran, ''Musician's Business &amp; Legal Guide (4th Edition)'' (Prentice Hall, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A mechanical license is issued when a recording artist wishes to sell their recording of a written composition.  It serves as a notice to the composition owners that sales are forthcoming and that royalties dictated by a statutory rate will be owed and paid to them.

[[Performing Rights]] License (PRO) is the license that gives the licensee the right to publicly perform the song/work that they get the license to anywhere.&lt;ref name="Mark Halloran 2007"/&gt;

Lastly, a sync license grants the right to use the composition in the synchronization of a recording over a moving picture in a film, advertisement, television show or any other audiovisual work.  For the same synchronization use, one must also obtain a master use license, which grants rights to use the sound recording, which is a separately owned asset from the composition.

A [[music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]] does a lot to negotiate the uses and fees for the songwriters and composers on their roster. In the 2010s, the publishing companies are a main source of revenue besides live touring, because sync licensing has persisted as a substantial income source while the music industry underwent wrenching changes that saw their previously dominant income source, record sales, steadily decline.

==Technologies==

===Sound recording===
The invention and development of [[sound recording]] resulted in a redefinition of the concept of publishing, much the same as [[online music store]]s in the 2000s would later revolutionize how recordings are purchased. Initially, popular music was slow to take advantage of the new technology. In 1910, when sales of the new disc format exceeded those of the old cylinder, more than 75% of the records sold were classical music. One factor in this may have been the expense, which would have concentrated sales among the more upscale purchasers. Until 1925, sheet music sales continued to surpass discs and were the primary source of revenue for publishers and composers. At that point, sheet music sales began to decline while records were still providing inadequate income to compensate. This led to short lived but serious economic problems for some publishers.

===Film music===
[[Samuel Fox (1884-1971)]] who founded the [[Sam Fox Publishing Company]] in 1906, was the first to publish original film scores.&lt;ref name = "film scores"&gt;"Music Publisher Sam Fox Dies at 89"; Associated Press, ''Daily Mail'', Hagerstown, Maryland; Dec. 4, 1971; pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, after the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (the first [[talkie]]), the need for music led movie studios to buy music publishing companies, gaining both catalogues of music and experienced composers at the same time. For example, in 1929, [[Warner Brothers]] paid 10 million dollars for [[T.B. Harms &amp; Francis, Day &amp; Hunter, Inc.|Harms]], [[M. Witmark &amp; Sons|Witmark]] and [[Jerome H. Remick|Remick]]; [[MGM]] bought [[Leo Feist Inc.]] and some smaller companies; [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] started its own publishing division, [[Famous Music]].

'''Hospitality Club''' operates a [[hospitality service]] and [[social networking service]]. Its website is a platform for members to arrange [[homestay]]s, offer [[hospitality]], join events, and meet other members. The platform is a [[gift economy]]; hosts are not allowed to charge for [[lodging]].

==History==

The '''ikurrina''' flag (in [[Basque language|Basque]])&lt;ref name=EuskaltzaindiaIkurrina&gt;Euskaltzaindia: [http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/dok/eaeb/hiztegibatua/hiztegibatua.pdf Dictionary of the Standard Basque], retrieved 2010-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''ikurriña''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] spelling of the Basque term)&lt;ref&gt;Real Academia Española (2001): [http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=ikurri%C3%B1a «ikurriña»], ''Diccionario de la Lengua Española'', 22nd edition, available online. Retrieved 2014-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Basque people|Basque]] symbol and the official flag of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] [[Autonomous Community]] of Spain. This flag consists of a white cross over a green [[saltire]] on a red field.

==Terminology==
The name is a [[neologism]] by [[Luis Arana|Luis]] and [[Sabino Arana]], from ''ikur'' "mark, sign" (itself a neologism extracted from ''irakurri'' "to read"), compare to Catalan ''[[Senyera]]'' and Faroese ''[[Merkið]]''. In Basque, it has the generic meaning of "flag," but specially the one of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], as defined by the [[Euskaltzaindia]] (Royal Academy of the Basque Language).&lt;ref name=EuskaltzaindiaIkurrina /&gt;
The original [[Bizkaiera|Biscayne]] spelling of the Aranas was ''ikuŕiñ'' (the final ''-a'' is the Basque [[definite article]]).
The modern standard Basque spelling is ''ikurrin''.

==Design==
[[File:Ikurrina Urgullen.jpg|thumb|The Ikurriña at the hill Urgull in [[San Sebastián]] (Gipuzkoa)]]
Similar in pattern to the [[Union Jack]], the flag was designed by the founders of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] EAJ-PNV, [[Luis Arana|Luis]] and [[Sabino Arana]], and is commonly regarded as the national but unofficial symbol of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] (''Euskal Herria''). It is widely seen in the [[French Basque Country]] and forms part of the unofficial flag of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], the French [[Collectivité d'outre-mer|overseas community]] in [[North America]] that was settled by French Basque and also many Spanish Basque sailors. The Ikurriña is also the flag of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (EAJ-PNV). A controversy exists because at first it was only the symbol of a section of the party (the section of Biscay) and many persons thought that another flag must represent the territory.

The red ground symbolizes the Biscayan people (the race); the green saltire might represent the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Guernica]], a symbol of the old laws of Biscay, or [[Fueros]]; and over them, the white cross, God's symbol of Basque Catholic devotion. Thus, red, white and green have become the national Basque colors.

==History==
The flag was designed in 1894 to represent the province of [[Biscay]] in a set of one flag for each of the seven Basque provinces and one for the whole country; however, since PNV activity was scarce outside of Biscay, only the Biscayne flag was publicly recognized. It was hoisted for the first time in the "Euzkeldun Batzokija", the club that preceded EAJ-PNV. The party adopted it in 1895 and, in 1933, proposed it as the flag of the whole [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]].

Since the Basque people had accepted the "ikurriña", at the suggestion of the socialist counselor Aznar, the Basque Government adopted it as the flag of the Basque Autonomous Region in 1936. This flag was used as the [[Naval jack]] of the [[Basque Auxiliary Navy]], a section of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] operating in the [[Bay of Biscay]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinavasca.eu/es/ La Marina de Guerra Auxiliar de Euzkadi 1936-1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, after the military defeat of the Basque Government, the regime of General Franco prohibited this flag —although it continued to be used in [[Northern Basque Country|the Basque departements of France]]. In the following decades it became a symbol of defiance – the first actions of the clandestine group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] involved placing flags in public places.

The Basque flag was legalised again in 1977 during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. Two years later, the Basque Government adopted it as the flag of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque autonomous community]]. It is also used as an unofficial flag for some sectors of Basque society in other provinces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3807">'''''Karakia''''' are [[Māori people|Māori]] [[incantations]] and [[prayer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzealand.com/travel/about-nz/features/powhiri/the-ceremony/karakia-prayers.cfm Newzealand.com]
&lt;/ref&gt; used to invoke spiritual guidance and protection.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Karakia'' are generally used to increase the spiritual goodwill of a gathering, so as to increase the likelihood of a favourable outcome. They are also considered a formal greeting when beginning a [[ceremony]]. According to legend, there was a curse on the [[Waiapu River]] which was lifted when [[George Gage (Ringatū minister)|George Gage]] (Hori Keeti) performed ''karakia''. In the [[Māori religion]], ''karakia'' are used to [[ritual|ritually cleanse]] the homes of the deceased after a burial. 

The missionary [[Richard Taylor (missionary) | Richard Taylor]] gives a 19th-century view of the traditional role and scope of ''karakia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word ''karakia'', which we use for prayer, formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation [...] [Maori] have spells suited for all circumstances - to conquer enemies, catch fish, trap rats, and snare birds, to make their kumara grow, and even to bind the obstinate will of woman; to find anything lost; to discover a stray dog; a concealed enemy; in fact, for all their wants. These karakias are extremely numerous [...]&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the nineteenth-century introduction of Christianity to New Zealand, Māori adopted (or wrote new)  karakia to acknowledge the new faith. Modern karakia tend to contain a blend of Christian and traditional influence, and their poetic language may make literal translations into English not always possible.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Māori society, performances of ''karakia'' frequently open important meetings and ceremonies, both within a Māori context (such as tribal [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]], [[tangihanga|tangi]], or the inauguration of new [[marae]]), and in a wider New Zealand setting in which both Māori and [[Pākehā]] participate (such as the beginning of public meetings or at the departure of official delegations for overseas).

== Background ==

=== Concept and development ===

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=What I hope people get from [the show] is that by losing everything, it's possible to become something better. At least in real life, I have a much more reasonably paced life than I ever had when I was slightly banana head. In losing some of my ambition, it made it so I can have relationships and a better life. That has been learned throughout the ages: You mean money and prestige doesn't make people happy? Nope.|source= --Bamford explaining the series for ''[[Vulture.com]]''&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt;}}

The show came to be when Mitch Hurwitz approached Maria Bamford and asked her if she had an idea for a series, reportedly in 2013.&lt;ref name="Fox 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fox | first=Jesse David | title=Maria Bamford Walks You Through Lady Dynamite, Her Mitch Hurwitz-Produced New Show | website=Vulture | date=May 20, 2016 | url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/first-look-at-maria-bamfords-lady-dynamite.html | accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the pitch was telling a story about a [[mental breakdown]]. The project was no more than talks for years. Later, Hurwitz attached Pam Brady to the project to write and direct. Bamford described this process as "extremely slow".&lt;ref name="Fox 2016"/&gt;

The use of [[nonlinear narrative]] in the show was part of Bamford's pitch. It is used to portray the different mental states people can go through, and also how they overcome it. In that way, the show's [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s serve as "a reminder of that journey."&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt; Bamford describes the show's narrative structure as "''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]'', with me."

Bamford, who is a stand-up comedian, decided not to use stand-up comedy as a device in her show. When asked about her decision, she explained: "Even though that is a reasonable way of telling the story, I do have a self-conscious feeling of "I don't want to see the same thing over and over"".&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt; This decision is depicted in the pilot episode of the series.

===Writing===
Maria Bamford was involved in the writing process, but she did not write any episode herself. In spite of the show being based on Bamford's real life, the writers had freedom to modify her experiences for creative purposes. For example, in the pilot episode, Maria puts a bench in front of her house in an effort to promote a sense of community in her neighborhood. This idea came from Bamford's real life.

Even though she did not take a hands-on approach in the writing of the series, she was in the writers' room often, to discuss ideas and "hang out" with the writers.&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt; Writing credits include [[Kyle McCulloch]], former ''[[South Park]]'' writer, and [[Jen Statsky]], former ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' writer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/jen-statsky-jimmy-fallon-twitter-broad-city-lady-dynamite/|title=Jen Statsky on the art of the one-liner, writing for late night, and comedy with 'heart'|last=Peyser|first=Eve|date=31 August 2015|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing===
Former ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' collaborators [[Max Winkler (director)|Max Winkler]] and [[Andrew Fleming]] directed episodes for ''Lady Dynamite''. [[Rob Cohen]] (''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''), [[Academy Awards|Academy award]]-winner [[Jessica Yu]] and [[Ryan McFaul]] also directed episodes.

She goes into some of her past including her time at a mental health institution and when she was a teenager. She befriends popular talent agent Karen Grisham, who wants to be [[best friends forever|besties]] with her but does not take her on as a client. Although reluctant to do stand-up work, Maria is convinced by her manager Bruce Ben-Bacharach to join a benefit event called Open Arms with [[Sugar Ray]]'s [[Mark McGrath]], but then learns it is more about [[open carry|carrying firearms in the open]] rather than embracing people. [[Patton Oswalt]] plays a cop who disapproves of Maria's park bench, but he breaks character to advise her not to do the cliche stand-up motif in sitcoms.

The site's critical consensus reads, "Maria Bamford's ''Lady Dynamite'' is a vibrant, subversive, sweet, meta-fictional ride - but also a courageous, boundary-busting and ultimately deep portrayal of a troubled psyche."&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes s1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/lady-dynamite/s01/|title=Lady Dynamite: Season 1 (2016)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the season has a score of 85 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="Metacritic s1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/lady-dynamite|title=Lady Dynamite: Season 1 reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has garnered attention because of its depiction of mental illness.&lt;ref name="The Frisky 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Biphobia In 'Lady Dynamite' Is The Only Thing Holding It Back From Perfection | website=The Frisky | date=July 11, 2016 | url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-07-11/the-biphobia-in-lady-dynamite-is-the-only-thing-holding-it-back-from-perfection/ | accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clausen 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Clausen | first=Evelyn Anne | title=We've Never Had a TV Depiction of Mental Illness Quite Like Lady Dynamite | website=Slate Magazine | date=June 23, 2016 | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/06/23/we_ve_never_had_a_tv_depiction_of_mental_illness_quite_like_maria_bamford.html | accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Syme 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Syme | first=Rachel | title=Maria Bamford Mines Mental Illness for Her Sitcom, 'Lady Dynamite' | website=The New York Times | date=2016-05-31 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/arts/television/maria-bamford-mines-mental-illness-for-her-sitcom-lady-dynamite.html | accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=How 'Lady Dynamite' Helps Fans Cope With Mental Illness | website=Vocativ | date=2016-07-02 | url=http://www.vocativ.com/332988/how-lady-dynamite-helps-fans-cope-with-mental-illness/ | accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kang 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kang | first=Inkoo | title=Lady Dynamite: Maria Bamford Tries To Blow Up the Sitcom For Netflix | website=MTV News | date=2016-05-24 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2884780/lady-dynamite-maria-bamford-tries-to-blow-up-the-sitcom-for-netflix/ | accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the show as "[having] its own bizarre-sincere voice and its own dream logic" and "something else, in a good way: a journey to the center of Ms. Bamford's mind that dives through fantasy after loopy fantasy and emerges with something real."&lt;ref name="Poniewozik 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Poniewozik | first=James | title=Review: 'Lady Dynamite' Finds Surreal Humor in Mental Illness | website=The New York Times | date=May 18, 2016 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/arts/television/review-lady-dynamite-netflix.html | accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the show's style, ''The New York Times'' noted that "The show's creators, [[Pam Brady]] (''[[South Park]]'') and [[Mitch Hurwitz]] (''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''), have constructed a multipurpose fun house; we jump about in time and flit from meta-show to memoir to hallucination."&lt;ref name="Poniewozik 2016"/&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described Bamford's performance saying that "the actress and comedian, whose presence has rarely been used as well as it is here, manages the neat trick of being both believably guileless and winningly sharp."&lt;ref name="Ryan 2016" /&gt; ''Variety'' also praised the show's guest stars, stating: "the entire show gains a great deal of energy from a varied array of game guest actors, including [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], [[Brandon Routh]], and [[Bridget Everett]], all of whom appear delighted to be in Bamford's playfully serious orbit."

Critics have compared the series to ''[[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]]'', ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', ''[[Review (TV series)|Review]]'' and ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' because of the way it uses [[meta-humor]], [[absurdist humor]] and how it deals with [[mental health]].&lt;ref name="Ryan 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ryan | first=Maureen | title=TV Review: 'Lady Dynamite' | website=Variety | date=May 17, 2016 | url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/lady-dynamite-review-maria-bamford-1201770459/ | accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Saunders | first=Tristram Fane | title=Lady Dynamite, Netflix, review: 'the world is finally ready for Maria Bamford' | website=The Telegraph | date=May 25, 2016 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2016/05/25/lady-dynamite-the-world-is-finally-ready-for-maria-bamford---rev/ | accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of Australian [[floral emblem]]s'''. It encompasses the national flower and the official flowers of the constituent states.

After the [[Federation of Australia]] that took place in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. [[Archibald James Campbell's|Archibald Campbell]] had founded the Wattle Club in Victoria in 1899 to promote interest in and profile of the wattle as a unique Australian flower. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle ''[[Acacia pycnantha]]'', although lost out to the latter in 1912. The economist and botanist [[Richard Thomas Baker|R. T. Baker]] proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence of its flowers. The South Australian ''Evening News'' also supported the bid, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=Nixon85&gt;{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=The Waratah|publisher=Kangaroo Press|location=East Roseville, NSW|year=1997|origyear=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-86417-878-6|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites para --&gt;

In New South Wales, the New South Wales waratah was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of the state in 1962 by the then governor Sir [[Eric Woodward]], after being used informally for many years.&lt;ref name=Nixon86&gt;Nixon, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cooktown Orchid (''[[Vappodes phalaenopsis]]''), has been the official floral emblem of [[Queensland]] since 19 November 1959.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web

In November 1960, ''Anigozanthos manglesii'' was adopted as the floral [[National emblem|emblem]] of Western Australia in a proclamation made by then Premier of Western Australia [[David Brand]], to promote tourist interest in the State's wildflowers. He had been advised by the State's Tourist Development Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/SymbolsofWA/Pages/FloralEmblem-RedandGreenKangarooPaw.aspx|title=The Floral Emblem of Western Australia|date=8 July 2008|work=Department of the Premier and Cabinet|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=Perth, WA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914151332/http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/SymbolsofWA/Pages/FloralEmblem-RedandGreenKangarooPaw.aspx|archivedate=14 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian Government adopted Sturt's Desert Pea (''[[Swainsona Formosa]]'') as the Floral Emblem of South Australia on 23 November 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premcab.sa.gov.au/emblems/sturtpe1.htm |title=Sturt's Desert Pea |publisher=Insignia and Emblems of South Australia |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516050127/http://www.premcab.sa.gov.au/emblems/sturtpe1.htm |archivedate=16 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tasmanian Government proclaimed ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'' as their State floral emblem on 5 December 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/InfoSheets/StateEmblems.htm|title=Tasmanian state emblems|date=29 January 2003|work=Tasmanian Parliamentary Library|publisher=Computer Services, Parliament of Tasmania|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is rarely seen as an official or popular emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/tas.emblem.html|title=Tasmanian Blue Gum|last=Boden|first=Anne|date=11 October 2006|work=Australian National Botanic Gardens website|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=Canberra, ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the Tasmanian Branch of the then [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|SGAP]] promoting the attractive flower ''[[Eucryphia lucida]]'' as an alternative in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gray, AM | year = 1966 | title =  Leatherwood: Wildflowers of Tasmania - Part 2 | journal = Australian Plants | volume = 3 | issue = 26 | pages = 253–4 | publisher = [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|ASGAP]] | issn= 0005-0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Wattle (''[[Acacia pycnantha]]'') was officially proclaimed the Floral Emblem of Australia on 1 September 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/aust.emblem.html|title=Australia's Floral Emblem|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's state flowers have been featured on series of postage stamps twice—a set of six stamps in July 1968, each showing the flowers of one state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://colnect.com/en/stamps/list/country/8147-Australia/series/41401-State_Flowers/year/1968 Colnect Stamp Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of seven stamps, showing the six state flowers and the golden wattle, in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auspost.com.au/about-us/floral-emblems-bloom-on-stamps.html Auspost]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sturt's Desert Pea and Golden Wattle were also featured on a series of [[coil stamp|coil]] [[definitive stamp|definitives]] in 1970.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6310">Many '''sporting mascots''' used as [[mascots]] and characters by clubs and teams in Australia and New Zealand are similar to those used around the world. There are, however, quite a number that are unique to these two nations.

The following is a list of notable mascots and characters created specifically for [[advertising]] purposes in Australia and New Zealand, listed alphabetically by the club or team they represent.

'''MACROCK''', formerly known as The Mid-Atlantic College Radio Conference (or MACRoCk), is an annual music conference held in the downtown area of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] the first weekend of April annually since 1997. It features local, regional, national, and occasionally international musical acts as well as a music label exposition and panels addressing issues of the media, music, DIY projects, and the independent music scene. MACROCK gives [[underground music|underground]], [[Indie (music)|indie]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands a chance to gain exposure and publicity by showcasing them during two days of performances around the city of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]]. The event gives bands a much wider audience than would occur during a normal show.

The festival was originally organized by 88.7FM WXJM, the James Madison University student-run radio station, but became independent from the university in 2006 and dropped the acronym.&lt;ref&gt;http://rvamag.com/articles/full/23090/macrock-is-still-awesome-and-its-happening-in-harrisonburg-in-three-weeks&lt;/ref&gt; Now, an annually changing committee of around 10 volunteers organizes MACROCK, with the festival day help of many volunteers, most of which are still found at WXJM.

MACROCK XXI will be held April 6 and 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/MACROCKVA/&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable bands to perform at MACROCK have included [[Animal Collective]], [[Archers of Loaf]], [[Dismemberment Plan]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Mates of State]], [[Converge (band)|Converge]], [[Give Up the Ghost (band)|Give up the ghost]], [[Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra]], [[Of Montreal]], [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]], [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], [[Bane (band)|Bane]], [[Superchunk]], [[Elliott Smith]] (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lambert |first=Jeff |title=MACrock 'n' roll |publisher=[[American University]] |date=2006-04-10 |url=http://media.www.theeagleonline.com/media/storage/paper666/news/2006/04/10/TheScene/Macrock.n.Roll-1803106.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-25 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[An Albatross]], [[Coheed and Cambria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bredimus |first=Kate |title=The MACRoCk Diaries |publisher=[[Richmond.com]] |date=2002-04-09 |url=http://www.thebreeze.org/2006/12-07/news1.html |accessdate=2008-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705145640/http://www.thebreeze.org/2006/12-07/news1.html |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fugazi]] (2002), [[Best Coast]], [[The War on Drugs (band)]],&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/blog/macrock_2010?cm_re=Blog_Content-_-B-_-macrock_2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Screaming Females]], [[S.

'''Mahseer''' ({{lang-hi|महाशीर}} or महासीर; {{lang-ur|مہاشیر}}) is the [[common name]] used for the [[genera]] ''[[Tor (genus)|Tor]]'', ''[[Neolissochilus]]'', and ''[[Naziritor]]'' in the family [[Cyprinidae]] (carps).&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase genus | genus = Tor | year = 2008 | month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase genus | genus = Neolissochilus | year = 2008 | month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase genus | genus = Naziritor | year = 2008 | month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is, however, more often restricted to members of the genus ''Tor''.&lt;ref name="sen"&gt;Sen TK, Jayaram KC, 1982.

Occasional Paper 39, 38p.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of these fish is from [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and across [[southern Asia]] including the [[Indian Peninsula]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="menon"&gt;Menon AGK, 1992.

Pap. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the larger species have suffered severe declines, and are now considered [[threatened]] due to [[pollution]], [[habitat loss]], and [[overfishing]].

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the mahseers is confusing due to the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] variations they exhibit. In developing strategies for aquaculture and propagation assisted rehabilitation of mahseer species, resolution of taxonomic ambiguities is needed.&lt;ref name=mohindra&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mohindra, V.|author2=Khare, Praveen|author3=Lal, K.

Mahseers inhabit both rivers and lakes, ascending to rapid streams with rocky bottoms for breeding. Like other types of [[carp]]s, they are [[omnivorous]], eating not only [[algae]], [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, [[frog]]s, and other fish, but also fruits that fall from trees overhead.

The first species from this group were [[Binomial nomenclature|scientifically described]] by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] in 1822, and first mentioned as an [[angling]] challenge by the ''[[Oriental Sporting Magazine]]'' in 1833, soon becoming a favorite quarry of [[United Kingdom|British]] anglers living in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Cordington, K. De. B. 1939. ''Notes on Indian Mahseer''. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. 46: 336–334&lt;/ref&gt; The [[golden mahseer]] is the largest member of the group and one of the largest cyprinids; it has been known to reach {{convert|2.75|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|54|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, although specimens of this size are rarely seen nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species |genus= Tor |species= putitora| month = March | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being caught for [[Recreational fishing|sport]], mahseer are also part of [[commercial fishing]] and ornamental or aquarium fish.

==Etymology==
The [[Hindi]] name of ''mahāsir, mahāser'', or ''mahāsaulā ''is used for a number of fishes of the group. Several sources of the [[common name]] ''mahseer'' have been suggested: It has been said to be derived from [[Sanskrit]], while others claim it is derived from [[Indo-Persian culture|Indo-Persian]], ''mahi''- fish and ''sher''- tiger or "tiger among fish" in [[Persian language|Persian]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Alternatively, ''mahā-śalka'', meaning large-scaled, is suggested, as the scales are so large that [[Francis Buchanan]] mentions that playing cards were made from them at [[Dacca]]. Another theory by [[Henry Sullivan Thomas]] suggests ''mahā-āsya'': ''great mouth.''&lt;ref&gt;Yule, Henry, Sir. Hobson-Jobson: ''A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive''. New ed. edited by William Crooke, B.A. London: J. Murray, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; The name'' mahasher ''is commonly used in [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] languages in [[Pakistan]] for this fish and is said to be made up of two local words: ''maha'' = big and ''sher'' = [[lion]], as it ascends in the hilly rivers and streams of [[Himalaya]] courageously. It is also found in Nepal, where it is called ''sahar''. (British anglers in India called them the Indian salmon.)

==Species==
[[File:MahseerTackleAd.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Mahseer fishing tackle 1897]]

Sen and Jayaram restrict the term mahseer to members of the genus ''Tor''. However, the few species of genus ''Neolissochilus'' and single species of genus ''Naziritor'' are also called as mahseer due to their big size scales and some similarities.&lt;ref name=sen/&gt;

==In heraldry==
[[File:Kurwai State CoA.png|thumb|160px|[[Kurwai State]] coat of arms with a Mahseer as [[supporter]].]]
Mahseer was an important symbol in the heraldry of certain Muslim-ruled former [[princely states]] of the [[Subcontinent]] such as [[Baoni State|Baoni]], [[Bhopal State|Bhopal]], [[Kurwai State|Kurwai]] and [[Rampur State|Rampur]]. [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s son Yar Mohammad received from [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul-Mulk]] the insignia of the ''Maha Muratib'' (the dignity of the Fish).&lt;ref name="William_Hough_1845"&gt;{{cite book | title = A brief history of the Bhopal principality in Central India | author = Hough, William | publisher = Baptist Mission Press | location = Calcutta | year = 1845 | oclc = 16902742 | pages = 1–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The insignia became part of the Bhopal State's [[coat of arms]].

The Mahseer fish as an emblem of the highest honour in royalty is allegedly from [[Persian culture|Persian]] origin and was adopted by the courts of [[Oudh]] and the [[Paigah family|Paigah]] nobles of [[Hyderabad State]], being later passed down to other states of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Saad Bin Jung, ''Subhan and I: My Adventures with the Angling Legend of India''. Roli Books, New Delhi 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
It also represents the National Fish of Pakistan (unofficial).

==Current problems in Himachal Pradesh==
In [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Tor putitora|golden mahseer]] is depleting at a fast rate from the state even though it was categorised as an endangered species by the National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources as early as 1992.

The factors leading to this situation are mainly distortion of rivers due to the construction of river valley projects, multipurpose dams, shrinking habitat, poaching, and exploitation.

The '''Mansi language'''  (previously, ''Vogul'' and also ''Maansi'') is spoken by the [[Mansi people]] in [[Russia]] along the [[Ob River]] and its [[tributary|tributaries]], in the [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]], and [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]]. It is one of the [[Uralic languages]], often considered particularly closely related to its neighbor [[Khanty language|Khanty]] as well as to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. According to the 1989 census, there were 3,184 Mansi-speaking people in Russia.

The base dialect of the Mansi [[literary]] language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern dialect. The discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed [[word order]] is typical in Mansi. [[Adverbial]]s and [[participle]]s play an important role in [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] construction. The [[written language]] was first published in 1868 and was revised using a form of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] in 1937.

Mansi is subdivided into four main [[dialect]] groups which are to a large degree [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]], and therefore best considered four languages. A primary split can be set up between the Southern variety and the remainder. A number of features are also shared between the Western and Eastern varieties, while certain later sound changes have diffused between Eastern and Northern (and are also found in some neighboring dialects of [[Khanty language|Northern Khanty]] to the east).

Individual dialects are known according to the rivers their speakers live(d) on:{{sfn|Honti|1998|pp=327–328}}

Northern Mansi has strong [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Nenets language|Nenets]], and [[Khanty language|Northern Khanty]] influence, and it forms the base of the literary Mansi language. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. {{IPA|*/æ/}} and {{IPA|*/æː/}} have been backed to {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[aː]}}.

Western Mansi went [[extinct language|extinct]] ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences; dialect differences were also considerable.{{sfn|Kálmán|1965|pp=4–5}} Long vowels were diphthongized.

Eastern Mansi is spoken by 100–200 people. It has Khanty and [[Tatar language|Tatar]] influence. There is [[vowel harmony]], and for {{IPA|*/æː/}} it has {{IPAblink|œː}}, frequently diphthongized.

Southern Mansi was recorded from area isolated from the other Mansi varieties. Around 1900 a couple hundred speakers existed; in the 1960s it was spoken only by a few elderly speakers,{{sfn|Kálmán|1965|pp=4–5}} and it has since then gone extinct. It had strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as [[vowel harmony]], retention of {{IPA|/y/}} (elsewhere merged with {{IPA|*/æ/}}), {{IPA|/tsʲ/}} (elsewhere deaffricated to {{IPA|/sʲ/}}), {{IPA|/æː/}} (elsewhere fronted to {{IPA|/aː/}} or diphthongized) and {{IPA|/ɑː/}} (elsewhere raised to {{IPA|/oː/}}).

The inventory presented here is a maximal collection of segments found across the Mansi varieties. Some remarks:
# /tsʲ/ was only found in Southern Mansi and corresponds to /sʲ/ in the other varieties.
# /ʃ/ is absent in most dialects of the Northern and Eastern groups, having merged into /s/.
# The voiceless velar fricatives /x/, /xʷ/ are only found in the Northern group and the Lower Konda dialect of the Eastern group, resulting from spirantization of *k, *kʷ adjacent to original back vowels.
# According to Honti, a contrast between *w and *ɣʷ can be reconstructed, but this does not surface in any of the attested varieties.
# The labialization contrast among the velars dates back to Proto-Mansi, but was in several varieties strengthened by labialization of velars adjacent to rounded vowels. In particular, Proto-Mansi *yK → Core Mansi *æKʷ (a form of [[transphonologization]]).

The vowel systems across Mansi show great variety. As typical across the Uralic languages, many more vowel distinctions were possible in the initial, stressed syllable than in unstressed ones. Up to 18–19 stressed vowel contrasts may be found in the Western and Eastern dialects, while Northern Mansi has a much reduced, largely symmetric system of 8 vowels, though lacking short **{{IPA|/e/}} and long **{{IPA|/iː/}}:

==Alphabet==
The first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] published in [[London]] in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet:

&lt;center&gt;'''A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, Ꜧ, I, J, K, L, Ļ, M, N, Ņ, Ŋ, O, P, R, S, &lt;s&gt;S&lt;/s&gt;, T, Ţ, U, V, Z, Ь'''&lt;/center&gt;

In 1937, [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] replaced the Latin.

==Grammar==
Mansi is an [[agglutinating]], [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaSdffgD9t4C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Komi+word+order&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uH3Jv3XzcU&amp;sig=kBI-1a4U27h0srXd5DxdAfT6jVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PBsMT-HrOoforQf8xOG0BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Komi%20word%20order&amp;f=false |title=Language Policy in the Soviet Union |first=Lenore A |last=Grenoble |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-4020-1298-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article===
There are two articles in Mansi: definite '''ань''' (aɲ), which also means "now" when placed before verbs, and indefinite '''акв''' (akʷ), literally "one".&lt;ref&gt;''Мансийский (вогульский) язык'', р. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
There is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, [[Dual grammatical number|dual]] and [[plural]] number. Six [[grammatical case]]s exist. Possession is expressed using [[possessive suffix]]es, for example '''-зм''', which means "my".

====Grammatical cases, declining====
Example with: '''пут''' /put/ (cauldron)

{| cellspacing="2" border="0" class=wikitable
|case||sing.||dual||plural
|---
|[[Nominative case|nom.]]||'''пут'''&lt;br /&gt;put||'''путыг'''&lt;br /&gt;putɪɣ||'''путэт'''&lt;br /&gt;putət
|---
|[[Locative case|loc.]]||'''путт'''&lt;br /&gt;putt||'''путыгт'''&lt;br /&gt;putɪɣt||'''путэтт'''&lt;br /&gt;putətt
|---
|[[Lative case|lat.]]||'''путн'''&lt;br /&gt;putn||'''путыгн'''&lt;br /&gt;putɪɣn||'''путэтн'''&lt;br /&gt;putətn
|---
|[[Ablative case|abl.]]||'''путнэл'''&lt;br /&gt;putnəl||'''путыгнэл'''&lt;br /&gt;putɪɣnəl||'''путэтнэл'''&lt;br /&gt;putətnəl
|---
|[[Translative case|trans.]]||'''путыг'''&lt;br /&gt;putɪɣ||-||-
|---
|[[Instrumental case|instr.]]||'''путэл'''&lt;br /&gt;putəl||'''путыгтэл'''&lt;br /&gt;putɪɣtəl||'''путэтэл'''&lt;br /&gt;putətəl
|}

Missing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as '''халнэл''' (χalnəl, 'of, out of'), '''саит''' (sait, 'after, behind'), etc.

===Verbs===
Mansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist.

Intransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is ''nothing'' or something like ''something, anything''). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other [[Ugric languages]].

====Tenses====
Mansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix.
{|border=0 width=400 class=wikitable
|Tense
|Suffix
|Example
|-
|Present
| -'''г''' (lat.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;*lat.: With Latin script.&lt;/ref&gt; ''-g'')
|мина'''г'''ум (lat. ''mina'''g'''um'' – ''I am going'')
|-
|Past
| -'''с''' (lat. ''-s'')
|мина'''с'''ум (''mina'''s'''um'' – ''I went'')
|-
|}

The language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways.

====Moods====
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
There are four [[Grammatical mood|mood]]s: [[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[Precative mood|precative]].

Indicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person.

====Personal suffixes====
The suffixes are the following:

====Active/Passive voice====
Verbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is '''-ве-'''.
&lt;!-- please wait for translation 
Az igeragozás három személyt, három számot, két igeidőt (jelen: , múlt: ), 4 igemódot (kijelentő, feltételes, felszólító, kedveskedő), alanyi és tárgyas ragozást különböztet meg és van cselekvő / szenvedő (utóbbi: -ве-) aspektus különbség. Felszólító mód csak második személyben létezik.

Példák: минасум (mentem), минасэн (mentél), (ment), минасумен (mi ketten mentünk), минасэн (ti ketten mentetek), минасыг (ők ketten mentek), минасув (mi mentünk), минасэн (ti mentetek), минасэт (ők mentek); тотыкен (hozzál, kedves), тоторисюм (nehezemre esik, de én hozok). --&gt;

====Verbal prefixes====
Verbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix '''эл-''' (el-) (away, off)  the verb '''мина''' (mina) (go) becomes '''элмина''' (elmina), which means ''to go away''. This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: ''el-'' (away) and ''menni'' (to go), where ''elmenni'' is ''to go away''

ēl(a) – 'forwards, onwards, away'
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| jōm- 'to go, to stride' || ēl-jōm- 'to go away/on'
|-
| tinal- 'to sell' || ēl-tinal- 'to sell off'
|}

χot – 'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity'
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| min- 'to go' || χot-min- 'to go away, to stop'
|-
| roχt- 'to be frightened' || χot-roχt- 'to take fright suddenly'

Numbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms: акв (1) and кит (2); compare with [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''két'', and Old Hungarian "kit").

==Example==

ам хул алысьлаӈкве минасум. – I went fishing (literally ''"I fish catch went"'').

===Comparison with Hungarian===

Here are some invented sentences in Northern Mansi (IPA transcription) and Hungarian. They demonstrate well the relationship between [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and Mansi.

'''Landsbókasafn Íslands – Háskólabókasafn''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The National and University Library of Iceland'') is the [[national library]] of [[Iceland]] which also functions as the [[university library]] of the [[University of Iceland]]. The library was established on December 1, 1994 in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], with the merger of the former national library, Landsbókasafn Íslands (est. 1818), and the university library (formally est. 1940). It is by far the largest library in Iceland with about one million items in various collections. The library's largest collection is the national collection containing almost all written works published in Iceland and items related to Iceland published elsewhere. The library is the main [[legal deposit]] library in Iceland. The library also has a large [[manuscript]] collection with mostly early modern and modern manuscripts, and a collection of published Icelandic music and other audio (legal deposit since 1977). The library houses the largest [[academic library|academic collection]] in Iceland, most of which can be [[lending library|borrowed]] for off-site use by holders of library cards. University students get library cards for free, but anyone can acquire a card for a small fee. The library is open for public access.

The library main building is called '''Þjóðarbókhlaðan'''. It is a prominent {{convert|13000|m2|adj=on}} red and white building near the main campus of the University of Iceland and the [[National Museum of Iceland]]. The building took 16 years to complete, finally opening in 1994, the year of the Icelandic republic's 50th anniversary.

==History==
[[Image:Iceland-Reykjavik-Thjodmenningarhus-1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Safnahúsið]]'', where the National Library of Iceland was from 1908 to 1994]]

The first national library of Iceland, ''Íslands stiftisbókasafn'', was established at the instigation of Danish antiquarian [[Carl Christian Rafn]] and the [[Icelandic Literary Society]] in 1818, and the first books of the library were gifts from Icelanders and Danes. From 1825 the library was housed in the loft of the newly renovated [[Reykjavík Cathedral]] and in 1848 the first national librarian, folklorist [[Jón Árnason (author)|Jón Árnason]], was hired to manage it. In 1847 the manuscript collection was started with the purchase of a large collection of manuscripts from the estate of bishop [[Steingrímur Jónsson]]. On the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the [[settlement of Iceland]] in 1874 the library received many gifts and in 1883 Jón Árnason estimated the total number of volumes in the library at 20,000.

In 1881 the library moved into the new house of parliament, [[Alþingishús]], and in 1886 the first Icelandic print law establishing the library as a legal deposit library was passed by the [[Alþingi]]. After this the library grew fast and on its 100th anniversary in 1918 it counted 100,000 volumes. In 1906-1908 a special building, ''[[Safnahúsið]]'', was erected to house the National Library, the National Museum, the [[Icelandic National Archives]] and the [[Icelandic Natural History Museum]].

The library of the University of Iceland was formally established in 1940 when the university moved into the [[University of Iceland Aðalbygging|Main Building]]. Before that time the individual departments had their own libraries. At the time it was debated whether it was practical to develop two academic state libraries in Iceland and so in 1947 a committee was established to decide on a division of tasks between them. Soon, a merger of the two libraries was proposed and in 1956 a new committee was set up to prepare for this eventuality. It seemed clear that a new specially designed building close to the university would be required. The idea was that this new library building, ''Þjóðarbókhlaðan'', would be opened in 1974, on the 1100th anniversary of the settlement of Iceland. The two libraries began working towards this end and through [[UNESCO]] library experts were consulted as to the requirements of the new building.

As the year 1974 drew near it became increasingly clear, however, that the Icelandic state would not be able to construct the building in time. The [[1973 Oil Crisis]], among other things, resulted in a worsening of the state's finances meaning that most of the ideas for the anniversary year had to be significantly reduced or scrapped. A [[groundbreaking]] ceremony for the new library was planned, instead of an inauguration, but even this was postponed until 1978 when construction finally began. Initially the building project proceeded well and in 1983 the building was complete on the outside. However, significant funds were needed to complete the interior and for the next ten years the large building stood empty. Attempts were made to finance its completion with a special supplement on property tax, but most of that income was used for other expenses. Finally in 1991 the new government of [[Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn]] and [[Alþýðuflokkurinn]] made it a priority to complete the building and on December 1, 1994, it finally opened.

While a lot of debate surrounded the building of ''Þjóðarbókhlaðan'' at the time, it resulted in vastly improved consultation, study and research facilities for researchers, university students and the general public in Iceland. The combination of the two libraries in one building resulted in an accessible library where users have direct access to the academic collection and reference works on the shelves while the national and manuscript collections are available for on-site consultation in a separate reading hall. While the study facilities of the University of Iceland have improved a lot since 1994, the library main building remains very popular with students.

From 1888 to 1979 the National Library published a list of new books acquired each year. In 1979 this was replaced by the [[Icelandic National Bibliography]], containing an overview of Icelandic published books each year. In 1991 the two libraries implemented a joint [[online public access catalog]] system, Gegnir, gradually replacing the [[library catalog|card catalogs]]. Since 2001 this system has been implemented nationwide for all public libraries in Iceland and is managed by a consortium. As of 2008 Gegnir can also be consulted via the [[European Library]].

Since 1996 the library has engaged in several large digitisation projects providing open access to antique maps of Iceland (1998), [[Timarit.is]] — journals and newspapers (2002 in collaboration with the [[National Library of the Faroe Islands]] and the [[National Library of Greenland]]), [[Handrit.is]] - a catalog and digital library of manuscripts (in collaboration with the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] and the [[Arnamagnæan Institute]]) and the online Icelandic National Bibliography (2008) among others.

The library signed the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://openaccess.mpg.de/319790/Signatories |work=Openaccess.mpg.de |title=Berlin Declaration: Signatories |publisher=[[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] |location=Munich |accessdate= 17 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.openaire.eu/oa-in-iceland |title=OA in Iceland |work=Open Access in Practice: EU Member States |publisher=[[OpenAIRE]] |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and roles==
The roles of the National and University Library are defined with a special law dating from 2011 and related regulations. The library is defined as an independent higher education institution under the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Icelandic Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]] which commissions the library board, consisting of seven members, and the National Librarian.

Administratively the library is divided into five sections; conservation, services, communication, acquisitions and administration. The section heads form the library executive board, along with the National Librarian.

The library has the duty to collect and catalog all published Icelandic print, electronic and audio material for preservation and continued access. It is to manage its extensive manuscript collection and ensure the continued conservation of all the materials it collects. The library collects materials partly through receiving the legal deposit from publishers and partly through acquisitions and gifts.

The legal deposit is defined in a special law dating from 2001 where the collection of electronic material published on the [[World Wide Web]] is defined as being one of the tasks of the library. Currently, the library collects snapshots of all web pages within the Icelandic [[top-level domain]] [[.is]] using the [[Heritrix]] web crawler.

The library is the [[ISBN]] and [[ISSN]] national center in Iceland. It is also the national center for [[interlibrary loans]]. It has the role of coordinator for the national OPAC, Gegnir.

The library has the duty to provide information and library service to the general public. It has a special duty to support the needs of teaching and research at the University of Iceland. The library manages subscriptions to scientific databases and [[electronic journal]]s for the university and administers the office for national access to [[bibliographic database]]s and electronic journals, [[hvar.is]], jointly financed by the Icelandic state and a consortium of Icelandic libraries, schools and research institutions and companies.

==Collections==

===Reference section===
The reference section of the library contains reference works, manuals, encyclopedias, dictionaries and bibliographic registries etc. for on-site consultation. Within the reference section there are also computers for consulting the OPAC and for general use by guests. As these are part of the [[Internet]] of the University of Iceland, they have access to all electronic reference works that the university subscribes to in addition to the library subscriptions. The same applies to the wireless Internet [[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]] available in the whole building. Part of the collection of reference works is available in the reading hall of the national and manuscript collections.

===National collection===
The national collection comprises all Icelandic published material in print, electronic or audiographic form collected through the legal deposit or acquired by other means. The library actively collects materials relating to Iceland published elsewhere and not subject to the Icelandic law on legal deposit. This equally applies to materials published online. This way, the library has created the most complete collection of Icelandic materials available anywhere in the world which it conserves, stores and makes available for on-site use in a special reading hall it shares with the manuscript collections. Access to highly valuable and rare items is restricted, but the library usually tries to make these available through its [[digital imaging]] production line. Within the national collection there are some private collections of individuals that are stored separately.

===Manuscript collections===
The library manuscript collections contain some 15,000 items, the oldest vellum manuscripts dating from around 1100 and are among the earliest examples of written Icelandic. Most of the collections are paper manuscripts, the oldest ones dating from the end of the 16th century. The youngest items are collections of manuscripts and letters, including electronic materials, from contemporary people which include some of Iceland's most prominent literary figures such as [[Halldór Laxness]]. The manuscript collections of the library can be consulted in a separate reading hall where the items are provided by request for on-site use. Some of the manuscripts are cataloged in registers which are available in digital form on the library website. The library is currently working on creating an online catalog for manuscripts jointly with the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] in Reykjavík and the [[Arnamagnæan Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]].

===Audiovisual collection===
The audiovisual collection of the library is available for on-site use using special facilities, screens and headphones, provided by the library. The collection includes materials that are part of the national collection as well as a large collection of international materials, records, films, television programs etc. The main emphasis of the collection, however, is to collect all Icelandic material and make it available to library guests.

===Academic collection===
The bulk of the academic collection consists of materials from the original library of the University of Iceland. It contains international scientific works and textbooks along with literary works in many languages, including a large collection of translations of Icelandic literature. By request, the library reserves textbooks used in courses taught at the University of Iceland to ensure that they are available for on-site study. Most of the academic collection, however, can be borrowed for off-site use by holders of library cards issued by the library. Students at the University of Iceland get such cards for free. Parts of the collection are available in two library branches on campus.

'''Orphism''' or '''Orphic Cubism''', a term coined by the French [[poetry|poet]] [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in 1912, was an offshoot of [[Cubism]] that focused on pure [[abstraction]] and bright colors, influenced by [[Fauvism]], the theoretical writings of [[Paul Signac]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] and the dye chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul|Eugène Chevreul]]. This movement, perceived as key in the transition from Cubism to [[Abstract art]], was pioneered by [[František Kupka]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]], who relaunched the use of color during the monochromatic phase of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/orphism Tate Glossary] retrieved 31 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term Orphism was elusive when it first appeared and remains to some extent vague.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Museum of Modern Art, New York, Hajo Düchting, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:František Kupka - Katedrála - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|[[František Kupka]], ''[[The Cathedral (Katedrála)|Katedrála (The Cathedral)]]'', 1912-13, oil on canvas, 180 x 150 cm, [[Museum Kampa]], [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
The Orphists were rooted in [[Cubism]] but moved toward a pure [[lyrical abstraction]], seeing painting as the bringing together of a sensation of pure colors. More concerned with the expression and significance of sensation, this movement began with recognizable subjects but was rapidly absorbed by increasingly abstract structures. Orphism aimed to dispense with recognizable subject matter and to rely on ''form'' and ''color'' to communicate meaning. The movement also aimed to express the ideals of Simultanism: the existence of an infinitude of interrelated states of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/simultanism Tate glossary] Retrieved December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of spectral light expressed in [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] played an important role in the formulation of Orphism. [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Albert Gleizes]], and [[Gino Severini]], all knew Henry personally.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Henry, a mathematician, inventor, esthetician, and intimate friend of the Symbolist writers [[Félix Fénéon]] and [[Gustave Kahn]], met [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], Signac and [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] during the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Henry would take the final step in bringing ''emotional associational theory'' into the world of artistic sensation: something that would influence greatly the Neo-Impressionists. Henry and Seurat were in agreement that the basic elements of art—the line, particle of color, like words—could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. "Seurat knows well" wrote Fénéton in 1889, "that the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value" in addition, of course, to the particles of color, and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by the likes of Robert Delaunay.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt; Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis for their painting in the domain of color. The Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics, and the Orphists would do so with color too.

The Symbolists had used the word ''orphique'' in relation to the Greek myth of [[Orpheus]], who they perceived as the ideal artist. Apollinaire had written a collection of quatrains in 1907 entitled ''Bestiaire ou cortège d’Orphée'' (Paris, 1911), within which Orpheus was symbolized as a poet and artist. For both Apollinaire and the Symbolists who preceded him, Orpheus was associated with [[mysticism]], something that would inspire artistic endeavors. ''The voice of light'' that Apollinaire mentioned in his poems was a metaphor for ''inner experiences''. Though not fully articulated in his poems, ''the voice of light'' is identified as a line that could be colored and become a painting. The Orphic metaphor thus represented the artist’s power to create new structures and color harmonies, in an innovative creative process that combined to form a sensuous experience.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==Guillaume Apollinaire==
[[File:Sonia Delaunay, 1914, Prismes électriques, oil on canvas, 250 x 250 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Sonia Delaunay]], 1914, ''Prismes électriques'', oil on canvas, 250 x 250 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]
The term Orphism was coined by poet and art critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, referring to the works of [[František Kupka]]. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of ''pure painting'', as anti-figurative as music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cubist_Painters.html?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Cubist Painters (Les Peintres Cubistes: Méditations esthétiques)'', Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, translation by Peter Read, University of California Press, 25 oct. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as "the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an ''untroubled [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure'', but at the same time a ''meaningful structure and sublime significance''. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature. Orphic painters cited analogies with music in their titles; for example, Kupka’s ''Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colors'' (1912) and [[Francis Picabia]]’s abstract composition ''Dance at the Source'' (1912) and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]’s ''Über das Geistige in der Kunst'' (1912). Kandinsky's detailed theoretical essays described the correlations between color and sound. Robert Delaunay, also preoccupied with relations between color and music, highlighted the purity and independence of color, and successfully exhibited with the [[Blaue Reiter]] at the invitation of Kandinsky. [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], as they tended towards abstraction, were also included as Orphists in the writings of Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Apollinaire stayed with the Delaunays during the winter of 1912, becoming close friends and elaborating on many ideas. Apollinaire wrote several texts discussing their work to promote the concept of Orphism. In March 1913 Orphism was exhibited to the public at the Salon des Indépendants. In his review of the Salon published in ''L’Intransigeant'' (25 March 1913), Apollinaire wrote that ‘it combines painters of totally different characters, all of whom have nonetheless achieved a more internalized, more popular and more poetic vision of the universe and of life’. And in ''Montjoie'' (29 March 1913) Apollinaire argued for the abolition of Cubism in favour of Orphism: ‘If Cubism is dead, long live Cubism. The kingdom of Orpheus is at hand!’

The Herbst salon (Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin) of 1913, organized by [[Herwarth Walden]] of [[Der Sturm]], exhibited many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Jean Metzinger]]’s ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' (1913, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), [[Albert Gleizes]]' ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]'' (1912-13, National Gallery of Art), paintings by Picabia, and Léger, along with several Futurist paintings. This exhibition marked a turning-point in Apollinaire’s relation with R. Delaunay (which would cool markedly), following some remarks in an argument with [[Umberto Boccioni]] about the ambiguity of the term ‘simultaneity’.  This would be the last time Apollinaire used the term Orphism in his critical analyses of art; as he turned his attention increasingly towards Picabia and [[Alexander Archipenko]], but most of all towards the Futurists.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==The Delaunays==
[[Sonia Terk Delaunay]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], a husband and wife duo, were to become the main protagonists of the Orphic movement, Robert Delaunay also studied different styles of painting, such as Abstract Art. In their earlier works, their styles focused on Fauvist colors with various degrees of abstraction; particularly evident in Sonia's ''Finnish Girl'' (1907) and Robert's ''Paysage au disque'' (1906). The former painting relies heavily on bright colors and smooth transitions between forms, while the latter relies on color and mosaic-like brushstrokes painted under the influence of Jean Metzinger, also a Neo-Impressionist (with highly [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] and [[Fauvism|Fauve]] components) at the time.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Their works became increasingly identifiable by the 'simultaneous' contrasting of colors and the tendency towards non-representation. In Robert's ''Eiffel Tower Series'', the subject is portrayed as if seen from several viewpoints at once; employing the concept of 'mobile perspective' developed by his close friend Metzinger. Soon, instead of using muted tones as the Cubists, he would paint with bold, bright colors juxtaposed one next to the other (a concept derived from [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory). He often portrayed the tower with reds and pinks with cooler colors throughout. The more Robert painted the tower, the more abstract, fragmented and colorful it became.

In 1913 the Delaunays showed their works in the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the Herbst Salon, the latter being the first Orphist Salon, which also hosted works by [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]], and [[Futurism|Futurist]] painters. Unlike others associated with Orphism, the Delaunays would return to this style throughout their lives.

==Eugène Chevreul==
[[Image:Transsiberien.jpg|thumb|right|The last section of ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'', 1913, a collaborative [[Artist's book|artists' book]] by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]].]]
One of Robert's biggest influences, besides his wife, was the chemist [[Eugène Chevreul]]. Most famous for discovering [[margarine]], Chevreul delved in dye chemistry as well as the aesthetics of [[contrast effect|simultaneous contrast]] of colors. He had three main ideas to his color theories: "when complementary colors are juxtaposed, each appears to be more intense than when seen in isolation" and "if there is a perceptible difference in dark-light value between the two colors, then the darker will appear to be even darker" as well as that "all colors present in the field of vision at the same time mutually modify one another in specific ways". Chevreul influenced many artists because he understood scientifically what many artists expressed instinctively.

==After 1913==
Even after Apollinaire had separated from the Delaunays and Orphism had lost its novelty as a new art form, the Delaunays continued painting in their personal shared style. They may not have always called their work Orphic, but the aesthetics and theories were the same. Robert continued painting while Sonia delved into other media, including fashion, interior and textile design, all within the realm of Orphism.

==Legacy==
Orphism as a movement was short-lived, essentially coming to an end before [[World War I]]. In spite of the use of the term the works categorized as Orphism were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Artists intermittently referred to as Orphists by Apollinaire, such as Léger, Picabia, Duchamp and Picasso, independently created new categories that could hardly be classified as Orphic. The term Orphism most obviously embraced paintings by František Kupka, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, if limited to implications imposed by color, light, and the expression of non-representational compositions. Even Robert Delaunay thought this description misrepresented his intentions, though his temporary classification as Orphic had proved successful. The American painters [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]], two of Delaunay’s pupils, strove to create a similar art-form circa 1912. The [[Synchromism|Synchromists]] [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] wrote their own manifestos in an attempt to distance themselves from the Orphism of Robert Delaunay, but their art at times inevitably appeared Orphic. Essentially a stylistic sub-category of [[Abstract art]] created by Apollinaire, Orphism was an elusive term from which artists included within its scope persistently attempted to detach themselves.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Ninja supporters hold the position that a ninja would win over a pirate because of their superior mental and physical capabilities, as well as usage of gadgets such as [[nunchaku]] and [[shuriken]]. Those who support pirates argue that a pirate's use of both sword and gun would ensure their victory in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Silver, [http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2009/09/great-geek-debates-pirates-vs-ninja/ "Great Geek Debates: Pirates vs Ninja (GeekDad Wayback Machine)"], "Wired.com", September 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The debate has accumulated a wide following in cyberculture. A wide array of YouTube videos, websites, and online debate forums can be linked to the pirate vs. ninja conflict.

Perhaps coincidentally, around the time this meme was being circulated{{when|date=August 2018}}, the ninja manga/anime [[Naruto]] and the pirate manga/anime [[One Piece]] grew in popularity.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Novels deemed to be potboilers may also be called [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]], and potboiler films may be called "popcorn movies."

==Usage==
===High culture===
"In the more elevated arenas of artistry such a motive...was considered deeply demeaning."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pot1.htm "Potboiler" at World Wide Words&lt;/ref&gt; If a serious playwright or novelist's creation is deemed a potboiler, this has a negative connotation that suggests that it is a mediocre or inferior-quality work.

===Historical usages===
*In 1854 ''[[Putnam’s Magazine]]'' used the term in the following sentence: “He has not carelessly dashed off his picture, with the remark that ‘it will do for a pot-boiler’”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
*[[Jane Scovell]]'s ''Oona:'' ''Living in the Shadows'' states that "...the play was a mixed blessing. Through it O'Neill latched on to a perennial source of income, but the promise of his youth was essentially squandered on a potboiler."
*[[Lewis Carroll]], in a letter to illustrator [[A.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Frost]] in 1880, remarks that Frost should spend his advance pay from his work on ''Rhyme? &amp; Reason?'' lest he be forced to "do a 'pot-boiler' for some magazine" to make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Letters of Lewis Carroll |page=397 |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-first=Morton |editor2-last=Green |editor2-first=Roger |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |isbn=0-19-520090-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an early-1980s ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' review of a book by [[Andrew Greeley]], the author called his novel ''Thy Brother's Wife'' a "...putrid, puerile, prurient, pulpy potboiler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohs|first=Mayo|title=Books: The Luck of Andrew Greeley|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925567,00.html|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=Time|date=12 July 1982|author2=J. Madeleine Nash}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the late 1990s, American author and newspaper reporter [[Stephen Kinzer]] referred to potboilers in this derogatory sense: "If reading and travel are two of life's most rewarding experiences, to combine them is heavenly. I don't mean sitting on a beach reading the latest potboiler, a fine form of relaxation but not exactly mind-expanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Traveling Companions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/bookend/bookend.html|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an interview with ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', writer [[David Schow]] described potboilers as fiction that "...stacks bricks of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] into a nice, neat line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dziemianowicz|first=Stefan|title=From Splatterpunk to Bullets: PW Talks with David Schow|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/23165-from-splatterpunk-to-bullets.html|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=6 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40799">The '''Proto-Tibeto-Burman language''' is the [[proto-language|reconstructed ancestor]] of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] except for [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese]]. An initial reconstruction was produced by [[Paul K. Benedict]] and since refined by [[James Matisoff]]. Several other researchers argue that Tibeto-Burman does not constitute a [[monophyletic group]] within Sino-Tibetan.

Reconstruction is complicated by the immense diversity of the languages, many of which are poorly described, the lack of [[inflection]] in most of the languages, and millennia of intense contact with other Sino-Tibetan languages and languages of other families.  Only a few subgroups, such as [[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo-Burmese]], have been securely reconstructed.  Benedict's method, which he dubbed "teleo-reconstruction", was to compare widely separated languages, with a particular emphasis on [[Classical Tibetan]], [[Jingpho language|Jingpho]], [[Written Burmese]], [[Garo language|Garo]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]].{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=434}} Although the initial consonants of cognates tend to have the same [[place of articulation|place]] and [[manner of articulation]], [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] is often unpredictable.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=425–426}}  Matisoff attributes this to the effects of prefixes that have been lost and are often unrecoverable.{{sfnp|Matisoff|2003|p=16}}  The reconstruction also features "allofams", variant forms of a root postulated to explain inconsistent reflexes in daughter languages.{{sfnp|Matisoff|2003|pp=3, 16}}

==Phonology==
The phonology of Proto-Tibeto-Burman here is from Matisoff's 2003 reconstruction, much of which is based on Benedict's earlier reconstructions.

===Consonants===
Proto-Tibetan–Burman has at least 23 consonants (Matisoff 2003:15). Some descendants of Proto-Tibetan–Burman, especially the [[Qiangic languages]], have developed dozens of sibilant fricatives and affricates.

Proto-Tibeto-Burman in Matisoff's opinion also has many final nasals, stops, and liquids.

===Vowels===
In Matisoff's reconstruction Proto-Tibeto-Burman vowels can be split into primary and secondary sets. Modern-day Tibeto-Burman languages have anywhere from five vowels (Written Tibetan and Jingpho) to dozens of monophthongs and diphthongs ([[Loloish languages|Loloish]] and [[Qiangic languages]]) (Matisoff 2003:157). Matisoff (2003) also notes that languages which have greatly simplified or eliminated final consonants tend to have more vowels. The [[open front unrounded vowel]] *a is by far the most common and stable vowel in Tibeto-Burman languages.

Matisoff (2003) reinterprets [[diphthong]]s from Paul Benedict's reconstruction as long vowels.

===Preservation of stops===
According to Matisoff Sino-Tibetan languages go through a series of four stages in which final stops and nasals gradually decay (Matisoff 2003:238-239).
#The six final stops and nasals, '''*-p, *-t, *-k, *-m, *-n, *-ŋ''', are all intact. Written Tibetan, Lepcha, Kanauri, Garo, and Cantonese are currently in this stage.
#One or more final consonants have been reduced or dropped. In Jingpho and Nung, the velars ('''*-k''') are replaced by glottal stops ('''-ʔ'''), while in other languages they are completely dropped. In [[Mandarin Chinese]], all final stops are dropped, and '''*-m''' has merged with '''*-n'''.
#All finals stops become glottal stops or constrictions (such as creaky voices), and final nasals may be replaced by nasality in the preceding consonant. Languages currently in this stage include modern Burmese and [[Lahu language|Lahu]].
#There are no glottal or nasal traces of former final consonants left in the syllables.

==Syntax==
Proto-Tibeto-Burman was a verb-final ([[subject–object–verb]] or SOV) language.

Most modern-day Tibeto-Burman branches also display SOV word order. However, due to syntactic convergence within the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], two Tibeto-Burman branches, [[Karenic languages|Karenic]] and [[Bai languages|Bai]], display SVO (verb-medial) word order. This syntactic realignment has also occurred in [[Varieties of Chinese|Sinitic]], which [[Scott DeLancey]] (2011) argues to be a result of [[creolization]] through intensive language contact and multilingualism during the [[Zhou Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey, Scott. 2011. "[https://naccl.osu.edu/sites/naccl.osu.edu/files/NACCL-23_1_04.pdf On the Origins of Sinitic]." Proceedings of the 23rd North American Conference on Chinese Lingusitics (NACCL-23), 2011. Volume 1, edited by Zhuo Jing-Schmidt, University of Oregon, Eugene. Pages 51-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
===Syllable structure===
According to [[James Matisoff]], Proto-Tibeto-Burman syllables typically consist of the following structure (Matisoff 2003:11-13).

{{quote|(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;mdash; (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;mdash; C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;mdash; (G) &amp;mdash; V(:) &amp;mdash; C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;mdash; (s) }}

*P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: first prefix - optional
*P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: second prefix - optional
*C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: initial consonant
*G: glide - optional
*V: vowel (optionally lengthened)
*C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;: final consonant
*s: suffix - optional

The following types of changes in syllable structure have been attested in Tibeto-Burman languages (Matisoff 2003:155). (''Note'': ''[[Sesquisyllable]]'', otherwise known as a ''minor syllable'', is a word coined by [[James Matisoff]] meaning "one-and-a-half syllables.")
*'''disyllable'''
**disyllable → sesquisyllable
**disyllable → complex monosyllable
**disyllable → simple monosyllable
*'''sesquisyllable'''
**sesquisyllable → disyllable
**sesquisyllable → complex monosyllable
**sesquisyllable → simple monosyllable
*'''complex monosyllable'''
**complex monosyllable → sesquisyllable
**complex monosyllable → simple monosyllable
*'''simple monosyllable'''
**simple monosyllable → disyllable

Below are the ''sources'' of the syllable changes (i.e., reversal of the list above).

===Verbs===
According to many authors such as James Bauman, [[George van Driem]] and [[Scott DeLancey]], a system of verbal agreement should be reconstructed for proto-Tibeto-Burman. Verbal agreement has disappeared in Chinese, Tibetan, Lolo-Burmese and most other branches, but was preserved in [[Kiranti languages]] in particular. This is a topic of scholarly debate, however, and the existence of a PTB verbal agreement system is disputed by such authors as [[Randy LaPolla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | given = Randy J. | surname = LaPolla | author-link = Randy LaPolla | title = On the Dating and Nature of Verb Agreement in Tibeto-Burman | journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | year = 1992 | pages = 298–315 | jstor = 619625 | url = http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/randylapolla/papers/LaPolla_1992_On_the_Dating_and_Nature_of_Verb_Agreement_in_Tibeto_Burman.pdf | doi=10.1017/s0041977x00004638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefixes===
Matisoff postulates the following derivational prefixes.
* '''*s-''' &amp;mdash; This prefix is used for the '''''directive, causative, or intensive'''''. It also appears in words for animals and body parts.
* '''*ʔa- / *(ʔ)ə / *ʔə̃ / *ʔaŋ / *ʔak''' &amp;mdash; This glottal prefix is used for '''''kinship functions''''' and the '''''third person possessive'''''.
* '''*m-''' &amp;mdash; Before verb roots, this prefix signifies '''''inner-directed states or actions''''', such as stativity, intrasitivity, durativity, and reflexivity. Before noun roots, it is used as a third person possessive prefix.
* '''*r-''' &amp;mdash; Before verbs, this prefix is used as a "'''''directive'''''." It is also used before a wide variety of semantically unrelated noun roots.
* '''*b-''' &amp;mdash; This prefix is often used before '''''transitive verbs''''', and usually marks the past (with suffix *-s, creating a *b- -s [[circumfix]]) and future (with a null suffix).
* '''*g-''' &amp;mdash; This velar prefix has a '''''third person pronominal function''''' before noun roots. It is also used before a wide variety of semantically unrelated noun roots. Before verb roots, it is used for the '''''present and future tenses'''''. In Proto-Lolo–Burmese, the unvoiced velar prefix '''*k-''' is used commonly used before '''''animal names'''''.

Other constructed prefixes include '''*l-''' and '''*d-'''.

===Circumfixes===
Circumfixes have also been reconstructed for Proto-Tibeto-Burman.

In Written Tibetan, s- -n and s- -d are collective circumfixes used in kinship terms (Matisoff 2003:453).

===Suffixes===
According to Matisoff three Proto-Tibeto-Burman dental suffixes, '''*-n''', '''*-t''', and '''*-s''', are highly widespread, but their semantics are difficult to reconstruct (Matisoff 2003:439). The suffixes '''*-s''', '''*-h''', and '''*-ʔ''' are often developed into tones in many Tibeto-Burman languages, and are thus highly "tonogenetically potent" (Matisoff 2003:474).

* '''*-n''' &amp;ndash; This suffix has a variety of functions, including '''''nominalizing''''', '''''transitivizing''''', and '''''collectivizing''''' (or pluralizing). The nominalizing function is attested in [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] as -m or -n and in Written Tibetan as -n. The transitivizing form is rare, and has only been attested in [[Kanauri language|Kanauri]]. Finally, the collectivizing/pluralizing function is found not only in many modern-day Tibeto-Burman languages, but also in [[Old Chinese]] as well.
* '''*-t''' &amp;ndash; This suffix is used as a '''''nominalizer'''''. It occurs in [[Jingpho language|Jingpho]] as -t and Written Tibetan as -d. Other functions include '''''verbalizing noun roots''''' and making intransitive or stative verbs into '''''transitive''''' or '''''causative''''' ones (Matisoff 2003:457). In other cases, *-t appears to have no obvious function. The *-t suffix also occurs in [[Old Chinese]], but its semantic function is unclear.
* '''*-s''' &amp;ndash; Not easily distinguishable from *-t, this proto-suffix is preserved in written Tibetan, West [[Himalayish languages]], [[Chepang language|Chepang]], [[Kukish languages]] (as -ʔ) and some [[Qiangic languages]]. It can serve as a nominalizer (Qiang and Tibetan), [[locative]], '''''subordinator''''' (Kukish languages), a '''''stative, inner-directed, or "middle" meaning''''' (Himalayish languages such as [[Kanauri language|Kanauri]]), and [[causative]] ([[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] and [[Kukish languages]]).
* '''*-k''' &amp;ndash; This velar suffix occurs in the [[Kukish languages]] and also in [[Old Chinese]]. Its semantic function is still unknown. However, Pulleyblank assigns a '''''distributive''''' sense to the *-k suffix, but only in relation to ''pronominal'' forms (LaPolla 2003:26).
* '''*ʔay''' &amp;ndash; This proto-morpheme means "to go", and can be attached to various roots as a palatal suffix to signify '''''motion away from the [[deictic]] center'''''. This fully syllabic proto-morpheme has now been grammaticalized and reduced to palatal offglides in modern-day Tibeto-Burman languages.
* '''*ya / *za / *tsa / *dza''' &amp;ndash; Meaning "child" or "little one", this proto-morpheme appears in Tibeto-Burman languages as a palatal suffix ('''-j'''), and has also been reconstructed in several ways. Its purpose is mainly [[diminutive]]. Matisoff (2003) also notes that high front vowels tend to be used for diminutive functions.
* '''*-way / *-ray''' &amp;ndash; This proto-copula can also appear as a palatal suffix ('''-j''') and occurs in '''''roots carrying abstract grammatical meanings''''', such as articles, pronouns, and deictics (Matisoff 2003:487).

==Vocabulary==
Among other researchers, [[Paul K. Benedict]] and [[James Matisoff]] have proposed reconstructed vocabulary items for Proto-Tibeto-Burman. Matisoff's Proto-Tibeto-Burman reconstruction is by far the most cited, and with his last version published in the final release of the ''Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus'' (2015).&lt;ref name="Matisoff2015"&gt;Matisoff, James A. 2015.

Primary topics of focus includes [[patient]]-[[physician]] communication, [[health literacy]], language that constructs [[disease]] knowledge, and [[Pharmaceutical marketing|pharmaceutical advertising]] (including both [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|direct-to-consumer]] and direct-to-physician advertising). The general research areas are described below. Medical rhetoric is a more focused subfield of the [[rhetoric of science]].

Practitioners from the medical rhetoric field hail from a variety of disciplines, including [[English studies]], [[communication studies]], and [[health humanities]]. Through methods such as [[content analysis]], [[survey methodology]], and [[usability testing]], researchers in this sphere recognize the importance of [[communication]] to successful [[Health care|healthcare]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirel, Barbara, Ellen Barton, and Mark Ackerman.

== History of the field ==

The rhetoric of health and medicine is tied to the emergence of [[rhetoric of science]] in the early 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Judy Z. "Interdisciplinarity and Bibliography in Rhetoric of Health and Medicine." ''Technical Communication Quarterly'' 14.3 (2005): 311-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary theorists such as [[Kenneth Burke]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Steve Woolgar]] laid the theoretical groundwork for this early interest in the persuasive dimensions of scientific language. In the 1980s the field shifted when rhetorical critics like Martha Solomon and Charles Anderson began analyzing texts on [[biomedicine]]. Solomon analyzed the rhetoric used in medical reports during the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee Syphilis Project]], while Anderson examined the writings of surgeon Richard Selzer to comment on the rhetoric of [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The rhetoric of dehumanization: An analysis of medical reports of the Tuskegee syphilis project|last = Solomon|first = Martha|date = February 1985|journal = Western Journal of Speech Communication|doi = 10.1080/10570318509374200|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Richard Selzer and the Rhetoric of Surgery|last = Anderson|first = Charles|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1989|isbn = 978-0-8093-8045-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the rhetoric of health and medicine emerged more clearly as a field distinct from [[rhetoric of science]]. Rhetorical scholar Celeste Condit raised questions about the historical and rhetorical dimensions of issues like [[abortion]] and [[genetics]] in works such as 1990's ''Decoding Abortion Rhetoric: Communicating Social Change''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Decoding Abortion Rhetoric: Communicating Social Change|last = Condit|first = Celeste|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1990|isbn = 978-0252016479|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1999's ''The Meanings of the Gene: Public Debates about Heredity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Meanings of the Gene: Public Debates about Human Heredity|last = Condit|first = Celeste|publisher = University of Wisconsin Press|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0299163648|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these seminal works, Condit focused on what she called "rhetorical formations," or the multiple simultaneous [[discourse]]s that surrounded each rhetorical object.

The field also saw the rise of discussion on [[disability studies]] and illness narratives during the 1990s, which initiated the beginning of a Special Interest Group on disability studies at the annual [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] (CCCC), headed by Brenda Jo Brueggemann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://medicalrhetoric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HISTORY-OF-MEDICAL-RHETORIC-IN-TECHNICAL-COMMUNICATION.docx|title = History of Medical Rhetoric in Technical Communication|date = |accessdate = |website = Rhetoricians of Health and Medicine|publisher = |last = Heifferon|first = Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiation of this group then inspired a Medical Rhetoric Special Interest Group, headed by Barbara Heifferon, which has continued to meet annually to present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://medicalrhetoric.com/?page_id=19|title = CCCC Medical Rhetoric Standing Group|date = |accessdate = |website = Rhetoricians of Health and Medicine|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, scholars began to pay increasing attention to various topics in the rhetoric of health and medicine. J. Blake Scott's 2003 book ''Risky Rhetoric: AIDS and the Cultural Practices of HIV Testing'' used [[Michel Foucault]]'s theory of examination, which defines rhetoric as a form of disciplinary power, to examine the cultural condition that influence [[HIV testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Risky Rhetoric: AIDS and the Cultural Practices of HIV Testing|last = Scott|first = J. Blake|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 2003|isbn = 978-0809324958|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that the rhetoric used in [[public policy]] and various [[propaganda]] led to the [[Social stigma|stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] of people with [[HIV/AIDS]].

In 2005, Judy Segal's ''Health and the Rhetoric of Medicine'' gained recognition for highlighting the persuasive elements in [[diagnoses]], [[Health policy|health policies]], illness experiences, and [[illness narrative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Health and the Rhetoric of Medicine|last = Segal|first = Judy|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also addressed [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] of prescription drugs, the role of [[health information]] in creating the "worried well," and problems of trust and expertise in [[Doctor–patient relationship|doctor-patient relationships]].

In 2010, Lisa Keränen's ''Scientific Characters: Rhetoric, Politics, and Trust in Breast Cancer Research'' addressed issues of research viability and relationships among scientists, patients, and advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scientific Characters: Rhetoric, Politics, and Trust in Breast Cancer Research|last = Keranen|first = Lisa|publisher = The University of Alabama Press|year = 2010|isbn = 9780817384913|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Emmons’ work on the rhetoric surrounding [[depression (mood)|depression]], ''Black Dogs and Blue Words: Depression and Gender in the Age of Self-Care'', was published the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Black Dogs and Blue Words: Depression and Gender in the Age of Self-Care|last = Emmons|first = Kimberly|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0813571423|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research areas ==

=== Rhetoric of pharmaceutical and science commercialization  ===

The '''rhetoric of pharmaceutical and science commercialization''' is the study of the persuasive language and symbols that the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and biotechnology companies use to communicate and influence [[consumer]]s, [[physician]]s, [[Regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]], and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in the commercialization of biotechnology. Scholars have found that the language used to define, describe, and regulate [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] influences the understanding and perception of the drugs among both the general public&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Judy Z. “What, in Addition to Drugs, Do Pharmaceutical Ads Sell? The Rhetoric of Pleasure in Direct-to-Consumer Advertising for Prescription Pharmaceuticals.” ''Rhetorical Questions of Health and Medicine.'' Ed. Joan Leach and Deborah Dysart-Gale. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and experts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Information about pharmaceutical products is highly regulated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|date=2008|title=Chronology of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising Regulation in the United States|url=https://www.academia.edu/278465/Chronology_of_Direct-to-Consumer_Advertising_Regulation_in_the_United_States|journal=AMWA Journal|volume=23|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and filtered through many channels as it moves from scientist to consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Bernick, Philip, Stephen Bernhardt, and Gregory Cuppan. “The Genre of the Clinical Study Report in Drug Development.” ''Rhetoric of Healthcare: Essays toward a New Disciplinary Inquiry.'' Ed. Barbara Heifferon and Stuart C. Brown. New York: Hampton Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the regulations on [[Pharmaceutical marketing|pharmaceutical advertising]], pharmaceutical companies use carefully crafted [[direct-to-consumer]] advertising to rhetorically influence the patient-physician dialogue to drive consumption of specific pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|last2=Balzhiser|first2=Deborah|date=September 2015|title=Pharmaceutical Companies Are Writing the Script for Health Consumerism|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2826972.2826976|journal=Commun.

(2017). Science vs. science commercialization in neoliberalism (extreme capitalism): Examining the conflicts and ethics of information sharing in opposing social systems. In H. Yu &amp; K. M. Northcut (Eds.), ''[https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-Communication-Practices-Theories-and-Pedagogies/Yu-Northcut/p/book/9781138064782 Scientific Communication: Practices, Theories, and Pedagogies]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This study shows that scientific data and knowledge is secondary to rhetorical messages supporting commercialization, and that human health is secondary to company profit. Notably, technical information is subject to obfuscation and distortion so that the message communicated outside of a commercial organization aligns with the primary goal of selling a product. Studying and trying to improve the rhetorical processes involved in pharmaceutical information as it moves through the chain of dissemination is a key concern of rhetorical scholarship on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardt, Stephen A. “Improving Document Review Practices in Pharmaceutical Companies.” ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication'' 17.4 (2003): 439-473.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomlin, Rita C. “Online FDA Regulations: Implications for Medical Writers.” ''Technical Communication Quarterly'' 17.3 (2008): 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhetoric of mental health ===

The '''rhetoric of mental health''' considers how language functions in the production of [[knowledge]] on topics such as [[Mental disorder|mental and psychological disorders]], chemical imbalances in the [[brain]], and variations on what are considered normal mental faculties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Lucille Parkinson, and Joan Page Gerring. “Revising Psychiatry’s Charter Document: DSM-IV.” ''Written Communication'' 11.2 (1994): 147-92.&lt;/ref&gt; The $100 million [[Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies]] (BRAIN) Initiative, introduced by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] in 2013, is testament to the emerging importance of [[Cognitive science|brain science]] and [[mental health]] in medical science and [[public policy]] debate. Neurorhetoric, the study of how language is used in the creation, distribution, and reception of science about the brain, has recently become an important topic in medical rhetoric and composition studies, as well as in [[popular science]] publications targeted at non-scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Jordynn. “What are Neurorhetorics?” ''Rhetoric Society Quarterly'' 40.5 (2010): 405-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Information and texts relevant to the rhetoric of mental health include [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic]] pharmaceutical regulations, their production, [[Prescription drug|prescription]], [[advertising]], and consumption, and scientific and popular discussions about [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and other mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Berkenkotter, Carol. ''Patient Tales: Case Histories and the Uses of Narrative in Psychiatry.'' Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Jenell. “The Skeleton on the Couch: The Eagleton Affair, Rhetorical Disability, and the Stigma of Mental Illness.” ''Rhetoric Society Quarterly'' 40.5 (2010): 459-478.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM, now in its 5th edition) is a central text for the study of the mental health profession.

=== Patient narrative ===

'''Patient narrative''' is the clinical story of a person's past and present [[medical history]] documented by a [[Clinician|medical clinician]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Johanna. “The Use of Narrative in the Doctor-Patient Encounter.” ''Family Systems Medicine'' 11.1 (1993): 47-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The patient narrative can also be referred to as the [[medical history]], the History and Physical (H &amp; P), or the clinical narrative. The H&amp;P includes a Subject, Objective, Assessment, and Plan ([[SOAP note]]), which summarizes the patient's narrative or history of medical illness, objectively reports the patient's clinical data and lab results, assesses diagnoses and prognoses, and often recommends how to address the patient's clinical situation. As part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] of 2009, the government enacted the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health]] (HITECH) Act, which mandates that health providers transition from handwritten (typed) patient narratives to electronic patient narratives in forms such as the [[electronic medical record]] (EMR) or the [[electronic health record]] (EHR).&lt;ref&gt;Park, Seung L., Anvil V. Parwani, and Liron Pantanowitz. “Electronic Medical Records.” ''Practical informatics for Cytopathology'' 14 (2014): 121-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The EMR and EHR are of interest to communication scholars because they economize the words and space of the traditional patient narrative into a structured system of navigation screens and checkboxes.

=== Rhetorics of alternative medicine ===

The '''Rhetoric of [[alternative medicine]]''' differs from traditional medical rhetoric in its emphasis on the persuasive aspects of language related to [[Holistic health|holistic]] or other nonstandard approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Derkatch, Colleen. “Demarcating Medicine’s Boundaries: Constituting and Categorizing in the Journals of the American Medical Association.” ''Technical Communication Quarterly''  21.3 (2012): 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these alternative medical practices include [[acupuncture]], [[massage therapy]], and [[chiropractic]] care. Scholars further explore alternative medical practitioners’ claims that they take a holistic approach to medical treatment, assessing a person's body, [[mind]], and [[spirit]], rather than just treating a disease.&lt;ref&gt;"FAQs." FAQs. American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA), n.d. Web. 31 Jan. 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holisticmedicine.org/content.asp?pl=2&amp;sl=23&amp;contentid=23 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209085945/http://holisticmedicine.org/content.asp?pl=2&amp;sl=23&amp;contentid=23 |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patient-physician communication ===

Starting with references to medical care in [[ancient Greece]], [[Dialogues of Plato|Plato's “Dialogues”]], expressed that physician-patient communication should not include any “lively interactions” between the physician and patient.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jay. ''The Silent World of Doctor and Patient.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Dr. John Gregory began to emphasize patient-physician communication by introducing the idea of preventative care for “gentleman of a [[liberal education]].”&lt;ref&gt;Katz, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Few found his suggestive style of care useful, and the view that “physicians must assume sole responsibility for protecting the ignorant public from its folly” lived on for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, 14&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1980s, the [[American Medical Association]] still had not incorporated regulations into their Code of Ethics that required physicians to incorporate patient opinion into the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;American medical association: health literacy. (2013). Retrieved from http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-foundation/our-programs/public-health/health-literacy-program.page&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1996 when the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) was created to protect patient rights and privacy. This law was intended to assure patients that their wishes would be considered in treatment decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (2013). Health information 
privacy. Retrieved from website: https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on contemporary efforts to rethink the physician-patient relationship, see Sharf, Barbara F., and Richard L. Street. “The Patient as a Central Construct: Shifting the Emphasis.” ''Health Communication'' 9.1 (1997): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional opportunities ==

For students who take a more applied approach to health and medical rhetoric, there are an increasing number of employment opportunities in industry, government, and [[nonprofit organization]]s. Such opportunities fall into two broadly defined categories: service and advocacy.

=== Service ===

'''Service''' is a situation in which a communication expert helps a [[Health professional|healthcare professional]] be more effective in his or her communication efforts. This might mean the communicator is paid to assist with a task like [[grant writing]], editing, or authoring a medical document. [[Medical transcription]]ists, represented by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), provide another form of professional communication in medical discourse. The AHDI is the world's largest nonprofit organization representing individuals and organizations in healthcare documentation. By ensuring documentation's accuracy, privacy, and security, the organization aims to protect [[public health]], increase patient safety, and improve quality of care for healthcare consumers.&lt;ref&gt;"AHDI: Capturing America's Healthcare Story." AHDI Home. AHDI, n.d. Web. 25 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   Other professional medical writing associations include the [[American Medical Writers Association]] (AMWA) and the International Academy of Nursing Editors (INANE).

Sometimes these medical authors are considered “[[ghostwriters]],” or paid writers who write a communicative piece but are not formally acknowledged as a text's author. Karen L. Wooley says that [[Professional writing|professional writers]] must adhere to ethical guidelines that ghostwriters may not be expected to follow. While authors control their content when working with a professional medical writer, Wooley says that ghostwriters may try to take control of the content away from the author and hide certain facts, such as where a project's funding comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde Matthews A. Ghost story: at medical journals, writers paid by industry play big role. ''The Wall Street Journal'', 13 Dec 2005: A1xs&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers such as Elliott Moffatt are concerned that medical ghostwriting, especially in the context of pharmaceutical research, is dangerous to public health.&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt B, Elliott C (2007) Ghost marketing: pharmaceutical companies and ghostwritten journal articles. ''Perspect Biol Med'' 50: 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Possible dangers can include misrepresenting the data and subtly influencing the way clinicians and patients perceive the data.

=== Advocacy ===

'''[[Advocacy]]''' in medical rhetoric is a situation in which the communicator addresses a health-related topic, empowering the [[Citizenship|citizens]] of a community to understand how that issue impacts them. This type of health communication enables the public to understand a health issue more thoroughly, providing them with the tools necessary to challenge or change existing [[power structure]]s within their own communities. Advocacy is often associated with [[risk communication]], the process of explaining [[natural disaster]]s, human-made hazards, and behavioral practices to the public in a way they can understand. Theorists such as Don Nutbeam propose a need for advocacy and say that [[health literacy]], or people's ability to access and make decisions with health information, is an important part of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Nutbeam, Don. “Health Literacy as a Public Health Goal: A Challenge for Contemporary Health Education and Communication Strategies into the 21st Century.” ''Health Promotion International'' 15.3 (2000): 259-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Pidgeon and Baruch Fischhoff say that communicating complex medical or health information to the public is difficult because past scientists failed to base their communication on solid principles and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgeon, Nick, and Baruch Fischhoff. "The Role of Social and Decision Sciences in Communicating Uncertain Climate Risks." ''Nature Climate Change'' 1.1 (2011): 35-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these past failures, Pidgeon and Fischhoff argue for a simpler and trustworthier model of [[science communication]]. In response to this issue, Jeffrey T. Grabill and W. Michele Simmons propose that technical communicators can provide advocacy because they have both good writing skills and an ability to understand and convey information to patients.&lt;ref&gt;Grabill, Jeffrey T., and W. Michele Simmons. "Toward a Critical Rhetoric of Risk Communication: Producing Citizens and the Role of Technical Communicators." ''Technical Communication Quarterly'' 7.4 (1998): 415-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhetorical concepts ==

[[Rhetoric]], like any field of study, is made up of constituent parts. These parts are often referred to as either rhetorical concepts or rhetorical principles. Rhetorical concepts can be seen as tools of the trade that allow rhetoricians to effectively communicate in a way that is most likely to persuade readers and audiences of the messages and meanings intended by the rhetorician. Rhetorical concepts are an important part of what makes an argument persuasive, and all effective arguments inherently contain them. Rhetorical concepts help rhetoricians convey information that would otherwise be unascertainable by the audience, which is especially important for topics that carry heavy implications, such as the complications that often follow complex medical and health needs.&lt;ref&gt;Gronnvoll, M. &amp; Landau, J. (2010). From viruses to Russian roulette to dance: A Rhetorical critique and creation of genetic metaphors. Rhetoric Society Quarterly 40(1), 46-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figures of Speech ===

[[Figures of speech]] are a type of figurative language that often convey specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words that make up the figure. Often providing emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity, they can be used to explain complex, unknown topics to readers and audiences in a way that makes them easier for the reader to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, Emanuel. A Grammar of the English Language. London: Cradock, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Metaphor and analogy ====

'''[[Metaphor]] and [[analogy]]''' are important in scientific communication because they make new ideas understandable to both expert and nonexpert audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Baake, Ken. ''Metaphor and Knowledge: The Challenges of Writing Science.'' Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Disease, for example, which is difficult to comprehend on both large and [[Microbiology|microbiological]] scales, is often communicated through metaphor and analogy. When a public health campaign “wages war” on [[cancer]], or a microbiologist describes a [[virus]] as “attacking” a cell, these forceful words create a war-like metaphor for understanding the way disease works. Notable work in this area has been done by Judy Segal, who chronicled the impact of five biomedical metaphors in her book ''Health and the Rhetoric of Medicine'', including ‘‘medicine is war,’’ ‘‘the body is a machine,’’ ‘‘diagnosis is health,’’ ‘‘medicine is a business,’’ and ‘‘the person is genes, ’’ all of which have had academic, cultural, and social impacts on the way medicine is practiced and understood.&lt;ref&gt;See biomedical metaphors in Segal, Judy Z. ''Health and the Rhetoric of Medicine.'' Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Monika Cwiarka has also questioned the use of [[Laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]] in behavior-based studies, asking whether certain behaviors observed in mice can be considered analogous to those observed in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Cwiarka, M. "How do Mice Mean? The Rhetoric of Measurement in the Medical Laboratory. In J. Leach and D. Dysart-Gale, (Eds.), ''Rhetorical Questions of Health and Medicine.'' (pp. 33-58).Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important recent study is Gronnvoll and Landau's research to determine how the public uses metaphor to understand genetic science.&lt;ref&gt;Gronnvoll, Marita, and Jamie Landau. "From Viruses to Russian Roulette to Dance: A Rhetorical Critique and Creation of Genetic Metaphors." ''Rhetoric Society Quarterly'' 40 (2010): 46-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hyperbole ====

[[Hyperbole]] is a figure of speech more often used by a patient when speaking with a doctor than by doctors communicating with their patients. Where some figures of speech can help to lend meaning or understanding to medical and scientific communication, hyperbole often obscures the truth by exaggerating it, which can have detrimental and even deadly results. Headaches, for example, can occasionally be described by patients as feeling as if their “head’s going to explode.” This type of communication can make it difficult for doctors to understand the true gravity of a symptom, which may lead to misdiagnosis. Furthermore, doctors and scientists need to be especially aware of the negative implications that hyperbole can have in medical discourses. As Joseph Loscalzo points out in his article Clinical Trials in Cardiovascular Medicine in an Era of Marginal Benefit, Bias, and Hyperbole, the use of hyperbole by investigators during medical trials can “often prejudice the trialist in favor of a positive result.”&lt;ref&gt;Loscalzo, J. "Clinical Trials in Cardiovascular Medicine in an Era of Marginal Benefit, Bias, and Hyperbole." Circulation (2005): 3026-029.&lt;/ref&gt; When investigators provide trialists with bias, whether intentionally or unintentionally, the data that is collected may be skewed in the direction of the bias provided by the investigator.

=== Stasis ===

Consider a hypothetical conversation between two parties about [[health care reform]].  One party may wish to argue the moral necessity of health care reform while the other party wishes to argue that health care reform is economically infeasible.  Until both parties agree on the issue at hand (whether it be the economic or moral considerations of health care reform), resolution of the argument cannot take place.  Once the parties have agreed on the issue at hand, they have achieved rhetorical [[stasis (rhetoric)|stasis]]. The idea of first agreeing to the issue at hand is central to any discussion between rational people. One example of how stasis can apply to health and medical rhetoric is provided in a recent article by Christa Teston and Scott Graham. These researchers applied the rhetorical concept of stasis to medical discourse by reviewing the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] discussion on [[Avastin]] as a treatment for [[metastatic]] [[breast cancer]].  They concluded that the absence of stasis resulted in miscommunication between the interested parties.

=== Rhetorical Appeals ===

The [[rhetorical appeals]], often referred to as modes of persuasion or ethical strategies, are a set of rhetorical concepts used to persuade audiences. Initially introduced by Aristotle in On Rhetoric, the appeals focus on three ways to persuade your audience: by appealing to the character of the speaker (ethos), the emotions of the audience (pathos), or the logic/truth of the argument itself (logos).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Lane. The Rhetoric of Aristotle: An Expanded Translation with Supplementary Examples for Students of Composition and Public Speaking. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1960. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethos ====

[[Ethos]] is an appeal to the authority or credibility of the presenter and is especially important in health and medicine communication. As Sarah Bigi explains in her article The Persuasive Role of Ethos in doctor-patient Interactions, “physicians are expected to inform, advise and persuade patients regarding their health problems.”&lt;ref&gt;Bigi, Sarah S (2011). "The persuasive role of ethos in doctor-patient interactions". Communication &amp; medicine (1612-1783), 8 (1), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to successfully persuade their patients, doctors need to rely on the rhetorical appeals, and the appeal that patients seem to care about the most, is the ethos of the doctor. If a doctor does not seem credible than a patient is unlikely to follow their instructions or diagnosis, which can lead to further health complications down the line.

==== Pathos ====

[[Pathos]] is an appeal to the audience's emotions. The speaker may use pathos in a multitude of ways; however, in terms of the rhetoric of health and medicine, two particular emotions stand out: fear and hope.

When doctors appeal to fear it is not done so lightly. Doctors have to decide if instilling fear in their patient is the right tactic for persuading their patients to agree with the physician's treatment plan. For instance, if a patient has diabetes and is likely to lose a toe or foot if they do not change the way they treat their condition, it is up to the doctor to decide when to stop telling their patient that “changing your habits will give you a better life” and to start telling their patient that “if you don’t stop your current habits, you’re going to lose a foot.”

When doctors appeal to hope, the doctor tries to persuade the patient through describing a scenario of a positive future that's only possible by the patient following the doctor's orders. In some cases, [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], the act of presenting this positive emotional state can actually create a positive result in itself.
 
==== Logos ====

[[Logos]] is logical appeal or the simulation of it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's claims or thesis. It is important to health and medicine communications because patients want to know which treatments work best, and they want the scientific data to prove it. Having an appeal to logic also enhances ethos because information makes the speaker look knowledgeable and prepared to his or her audience. However, the data can be confusing and thus confuse the audience. So, the doctor has to make sure to leverage the appeals to best persuade their patients. Doctors must decide how many facts and figures are appropriate to persuade an audience of the factual basis of the argument while portraying themselves as a credible speaker and playing to the right emotional state of their patient---all to get the patient to follow the doctor's orders.

== Research methodology ==
Rhetoricians of health and medicine conduct research primarily through [[Qualitative research|qualitative methods]], although [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]] are also occasionally employed. Scholars in the field apply these techniques to understand how and for what reasons health and medical communication is accomplished.

=== Content analysis ===
Through [[content analysis]], scholars strive to answer the questions first formulated by [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Harold Lasswell]] as they apply to health and medicine texts: “Who says what, to whom, why, to what extent and with what effect?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power and Personality|last = Lasswell|first = Harold|publisher = |year = 1948|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researchers might study the content of pharmaceutical advertisements on television to determine their appeals to potential consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Creating Demand for Prescription Drugs: A Content Analysis of Television Direct-to-Consumer Advertising|journal = Annals of Family Medicine|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1544-1709|pmc = 1783924|pmid = 17261859|pages = 6–13|volume = 5|issue = 1|doi = 10.1370/afm.611|first = Dominick L.|last = Frosch|first2 = Patrick M.|last2 = Krueger|first3 = Robert C.|last3 = Hornik|first4 = Peter F.|last4 = Cronholm|first5 = Frances K.|last5 = Barg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others might examine the communication of health information via [[new media]] such as [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Are Health-Related Users Tweeting? A Qualitative Content Analysis of Health-Related Users and Their Messages on Twitter|url = http://www.jmir.org/2014/10/e237|journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research|date = 2014-10-15|pmc = 4296104|pmid = 25591063|volume = 16|issue = 10|doi = 10.2196/jmir.3765|first = Joy L|last = Lee|first2 = Matthew|last2 = DeCamp|first3 = Mark|last3 = Dredze|first4 = Margaret S|last4 = Chisolm|first5 = Zackary D|last5 = Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facebook as a platform for health information and communication: a case study of a diabetes group|journal = Journal of Medical Systems|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 1573-689X|pmid = 23588823|pages = 9942|volume = 37|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s10916-013-9942-7|first = Yan|last = Zhang|first2 = Dan|last2 = He|first3 = Yoonmo|last3 = Sang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoricians have increasingly turned to computers to facilitate quantitative content analysis as they gather massive data collections from [[Internet]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Seniors’ Online Communities: A Quantitative Content Analysis|url = http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/3/382|journal = The Gerontologist|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 0016-9013|pmid = 19917645|pages = 382–392|volume = 50|issue = 3|doi = 10.1093/geront/gnp141|first = Galit|last = Nimrod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survey research ===
Researchers in the field are also concerned with the effectiveness of health and medical communications. [[Survey methodology|Audience surveys]] are often used to determine if a target audience understands a given set of health or medical instructions. The results help researchers adjust these instructions and assist audiences in achieving functional [[health literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = INadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1995.03530210031026|journal = JAMA|date = 1995-12-06|issn = 0098-7484|pages = 1677–1682|volume = 274|issue = 21|doi = 10.1001/jama.1995.03530210031026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other surveys gauge the public's attitudes and knowledge regarding important medical topics such as mental health. This sort of research identifies gaps for public health agencies to address in their communications.

=== Usability testing ===
Creators of health and medical communications often [[Usability testing|test their work]] with a subset of their target audience before its wider release. This practice is particularly important when content creators are not themselves part of their target audience, as is often the case for communications that address vulnerable communities such as [[Old age|senior citizens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Usability Testing by Older Adults of a Computer-Mediated Health Communication Program|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10810730802659095|journal = Journal of Health Communication|date = 2009-03-16|issn = 1081-0730|pmc = 2964868|pmid = 19283536|pages = 102–118|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10810730802659095|first = Carolyn A.|last = Lin|first2 = Patricia J.|last2 = Neafsey|first3 = Zoe|last3 = Strickler}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Immigration|immigrants]] with [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Web usability testing with a Hispanic medically underserved population|journal = Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA|date = 2009-04-01|issn = 1536-5050|pmc = 2670225|pmid = 19404502|pages = 114–121|volume = 97|issue = 2|doi = 10.3163/1536-5050.97.2.008|first = Mary|last = Moore|first2 = Randolph G.|last2 = Bias|first3 = Katherine|last3 = Prentice|first4 = Robin|last4 = Fletcher|first5 = Terry|last5 = Vaughn}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Usability]] research can include techniques such as “[[Think aloud protocol|think aloud]]” testing, in which potential users talk the researcher through their navigation of a given computer program or text. Evaluations by experts in other fields, such as [[design]] or [[user experience]], are also employed.

It is uncertain if there is a link between [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) and [[sex]]. Males are more likely than females to be [[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] with autism, but there is some debate about whether [[Sex differences in autism#Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis|females are just underdiagnosed]], of if there really is a gender difference in autism [[Incidence (epidemiology)#Incidence rate|incidence rates]].

Several theories exist to explain the male-female sex based discrepancy, such as a [[Sex differences in autism#Female protective effect hypothesis|genetic protective effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Gockley, J., Willsey, a J., Dong, S., Dougherty, J.

==Summary==
Autism spectrum disorders are currently more commonly diagnosed in males, with a ratio of about 1 female for every 4 males diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;Fombonne, E. (2009). Epidemiology of pervasive developmental disorders. Pediatric Research, 65(6), 591–598. http://doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7203&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, one in every 189 females and one in 42 males in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate=2014-04-18 |df= }} Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Data &amp; Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that females may also receive diagnoses somewhat later than males, however thus far results have been contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Begeer, S., Mandell, D., Wijnker-Holmes, B., Venderbosch, S., Rem, D., Stekelenburg, F., &amp; Koot, H. M. (2013). Sex Differences in the Timing of Identification Among Children and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43, 1151–1156. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-012-1656-z&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in presentation of [[Autism#Characteristics|autistic traits]] are widely supported within the [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism#Autistic culture and community|autistic community]], and gaining support in the professional field. [[Hans Asperger]] was one of the first people to study autism, yet all of his four students were male. Another early researcher, [[Leo Kanner]] described "autistic disturbances of affective contact" in the group consisting of eight boys and three girls.&lt;ref&gt;Kanner, L. (1943). Autistic disturbances of affective contact. Nervous Child, 2, 217-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Since biological differences exist between males and females, it follows that the presentation of autism would differ as well. Recent studies suggest this to be true, with evidence of increased incidence of [[social anxiety]],&lt;ref name="ludlow2015" /&gt; [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S., Jaffa, T., Davies, S., Auyeung, B., Allison, C., &amp; Wheelwright, S. (2013). Do girls with anorexia nervosa have elevated autistic traits? Molecular Autism, 4(1), 24. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-4-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhind, C., Bonfioli, E., Hibbs, R., Goddard, E., Macdonald, P., Gowers, S., … Treasure, J. (2014). An examination of autism spectrum traits in adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their parents. Molecular Autism, 5(1), 56. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-5-56&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-harm]] in autistic females.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, I. L., Tsiouris, J. A., Flory, M. J., Kim, S.-Y., Freedland, R., Heaney, G., … Brown, W. T. (2010). A Large Scale Study of the Psychometric Characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale: Findings and Evidence for Increased Self-Destructive Behaviors in Adult Females with Autism Spectrum Disorder. J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 599–609.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female protective effect hypothesis==
According to the female protective effect hypothesis, more extreme genetic mutations are required for a girl to develop autism than for a boy. In 2012, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] researchers published findings suggesting that, on average, more genetic and environmental risk factors are required for girls to develop autism, compared to boys. The researchers analyzed DNA samples of nearly 800 families affected by autism and nearly 16,000 individuals with a variety of [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s. They looked for various types of [[Mutation|gene mutations]]. Overall, they found that females diagnosed with autism or another neurodevelopmental disorder had a greater number of harmful mutations throughout the [[genome]] than did males with the same disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquemont, S., Coe, B., Hersch, M., Duyzend, M., Krumm, N., Bergmann, S., Beckmann, J., Rosenfeld, J., Eichler, E. (2014) A Higher Mutational Burden in Females Supports a “Female Protective Model” in Neurodevelopmental Disorders. The American Society of Human Genetics, http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(14)00059-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality and gender variance==
[[Sexuality]] is often discussed within the autistic community, with many observations that identities other than [[Cisgender|cis]]-[[Heterosexuality|hetero]] seem to be more common than is observed in the [[neurotypical]] population. There have not been many formal studies on this to date, however members of the community speculate that autistic individuals generally have different ideals, perceptions, and desires than neurotypicals, or simply do not comprehend or agree with society's expectation, making them more apt to diverge from the norm.

===Gender identity===
A study looking at the co-occurrence of ASD in patients with [[gender dysphoria]] found 7.8% of patients to be on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, A. L. C., Noens, I. L. J., Cohen-Kettenis, P. T., van Berckelaer-Onnes, I. A., &amp; Doreleijers, T. A. (2010). Autism Spectrum Disorders in Gender Dysphoric Children and Adolescents. J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 930–936. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-010-0935-9&lt;/ref&gt; This is much higher than the estimated 1% of people with ASD in the general population, suggesting a link between autism and gender variance.

As of yet, there have been no studies specifically addressing the occurrence of autism in [[intersex]] individuals, and this is an area that requires further research.

=== Sexual satisfaction ===
A study conducted by Byers and Nichols (2014), explored the level of sexual satisfaction of [[High-functioning autism|high functioning autistic individuals]], with researchers testing the sexual and relationship satisfaction of neurotypical versus high functioning autistic individuals. The results suggest that men with ASD are generally less satisfied with their relationship or marriage compared to neurotypical men and women, and women with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sexual Satisfaction of High-Functioning Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder|last = Byers|first = E|date = 2014|journal = Sexuality and Disability Sex|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis ==
Some authors, clinicians and experts like [[Judith Gould (psychologist)|Judith Gould]], [[Tony Attwood]], [[Lorna Wing]] and [[Christopher Gillberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/gender.aspx |title=Gender and autism |publisher=The National Autistic Society |date= |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that autism in females may be underdiagnosed due to better natural superficial [[Imitation|social mimicry]] skills in females, partially different set of symptoms and less knowledge about autism in females among experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwood|first1=Tony|title=Asperger's and Girls|date=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1932565409|pages=2–6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Foreword|preword]] to the book ''Asperger's and Girls'', Tony Attwood writes: "These tentative explanations for the apparent underrepresentation of girls with Asperger's Syndrome have yet to be examined by objective research studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwood|first1=Tony|title=Asperger's and Girls|date=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1932565409|page=6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically Judith Gould has discussed the idea that a pervasive developmental disorder called [[pathological demand avoidance]], which is not officially included in [[Psychiatry#Diagnostic manuals|diagnostic manuals]] may offer a glimpse about how autism in females may present in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shiggs55.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pda-conference-plenary-session-jacqui-smith-and-judy-gould.pdf |title=Missed Diagnosis or Misdiagnosis?

{{Fascism sidebar}}
The '''Silver Legion of America''', commonly known as the '''Silver Shirts''', was an underground American [[Fascism|fascist]] organization founded by [[William Dudley Pelley]] that was headquartered in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/THR-SS1.PDF "The Silver Shirts: Their History, Founder, and Axtivities". August 24, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; and announced publicly on January 30, 1933.  The group was effectively dissolved on December 8, 1941 when police called for the open arrest of any individuals associated with the group.

==History==
A [[white-supremacist]], [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] group&lt;ref name="americainwwii.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americainwwii.com/articles/americans-for-hitler/|title=Americans for Hitler|last=Van Ells|first=Mark D.|date=August 2007|publisher=americainwwii.com|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; modeled after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Brownshirts]], the paramilitary Silver Legion wore a [[Silver (color)|silver]] shirt with a blue tie, along with a [[campaign hat]] and blue [[corduroy]] trousers with [[Leggings#Military_use|leggings]]. The uniform shirts bore a [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] letter ''L'' over the heart: an emblem meant to symbolize '''L'''oyalty to the United States, '''L'''iberation from materialism, and the Silver '''L'''egion itself. The blocky [[slab serif]] ''L''-emblem was in a [[typeface]] similar to the present-day [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell Extra Bold]]. The organizational flag was a plain silver field with such a red ''L'' in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]] at the upper left.

By 1934, the Silver Shirts claimed to have about 15,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://holocaustonline.org/silver-shirts/|title=Silver Shirts|last=|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 1935, a Nazi agent befriended mining fortune heiress Jessie Murphy, convincing her to contribute cash, and the use of her ranch, recently purchased from screen cowboy [[Will Rogers]], to the fascist movement. The Silver Shirts began construction of the [[Murphy Ranch]], situated on a secluded, 55-acre site in the Los Angeles hills, meant to serve as a fortified world headquarters after the expected [[fascist]] global conquest.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116684/Hitlers-Los-Angeles-bunker-planned-run-Nazi-empire-war.html | work=Daily Mail | title=Heil Hollywood: The Los Angeles bunker from which Hitler planned to run Nazi empire after the war | location=London | date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Silver Shirt leader Pelley called for a "Christian Commonwealth" that would combine the principles of racism, nationalism, and theocracy, while excluding Jews and non-whites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/william-dudley-pelley-1885-1965/|title=William Dudley Pelley (1885-1965)|last=Schultz|first=Will|date=|website=North Carolina History Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He claimed he would save America from Jewish communists just as "Mussolini and his Black Shirts saved Italy and as Hitler and his Brown Shirts saved Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-gangsters-in-america|title=Jews in America:  Jewish Gangsters|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelley ran for president of the United States in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]] on a third-party ticket. Pelley hoped to seize power in a "silver revolution" and set himself as dictator of the United States. He would be called "the chief" just like other fascist world leaders who had similar titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/clarke/1934/01/pelley.htm|title=Pelley’s Silver Shirts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the presidency remained in the hands of incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. By around 1938, the Silver Legion's membership was down to about 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryreader.com/modern-history/6-things-may-known-nazis-america/|title=6 Things You May Not Have Known About Nazis in America|last=Bernstein|first=Arnie|date=October 7, 2013|website=The History Reader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on Sunday, December 7, 1941, local police occupied the "world headquarters" bunker compound and detained members of the 50-man caretaker force.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt; The declaration of war on the United States by Nazi Germany and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] led to the rapid decline of the Silver Legion.

==In popular culture==
* A fictionalized depiction of the Silver Shirts forms a large part of the plot in ''[[The Night Letter]]'' by [[Paul Spike]].
* The character of Berzelius "Buzz" Windrip, loosely modeled after Silver Legion founder William Dudley Pelley, was elected U.S. president in 1936 and became the dictator of America in ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', a cautionary novel by [[Sinclair Lewis]]. Some literary scholars contend that the Windrip character was modeled after Louisiana politician [[Huey Long]], who was not associated with the Silver Shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[[It Can't Happen Here]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Silver Shirts are also a British political movement in [[Harry Turtledove|Harry Turtledove's]] ''[[American Empire (Harry Turtledove)|American Empire]]'' and ''[[Settling Accounts]]'' series of [[alternate history]] novels. They are likely an analog of the real-world [[British Union of Fascists]], because [[Oswald Mosley]] is a prominent leader.
* The Silver Shirts appear in [[James Lee Burke]]'s novel ''Dixie City Jam'', a novel in the [[Dave Robicheaux]] series.
* The Silver Legion of America is a political party in the video game ''[[Hearts of Iron IV]]''. The in-game USA can turn into the Silver Legion-led Free American Empire if a [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Coup d'état|coup]] occurs or if the player changes their ideology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12276">'''Speech delay''', also known as '''alalia''', refers to a delay in the development or use of the mechanisms that produce speech.&lt;ref name="Dodd 2013 8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Diagnosis and Treatment of Children with Speech Disorder|last = Dodd|first = Barbara|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2013|isbn = 1118713346|location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speech communication|Speech]] – as distinct from [[language]] – is the actual process of making sounds, using such organs and structures as the [[lung]]s, [[vocal folds|vocal cords]], [[mouth]], [[tongue]], [[tooth|teeth]], etc.  [[Language delay]] refers to a delay in the development or use of the knowledge of language.

Because language and speech are two independent stages, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech (i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language. In this case, the child would be attempting to produce an [[age appropriate]] amount of language, but that language would be difficult or impossible to understand. Conversely, since a child with a language delay typically has not yet had the opportunity to produce speech sounds, it is likely to have a delay in speech as well.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The warning signs of early speech delay are categorized into [[age-related milestones]], beginning at the age of 12 months and continuing through early adolescence.&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;

At the age of 12 months, there is cause for concern if the child is not able to do the following:

* Using gestures such as waving good-bye and pointing at objects
* Practicing the use of several different consonant sounds&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Vocalizing or communicating needs&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;

Between the ages of 15 and 18 months children are at a higher risk for speech delay if they are displaying the following:

* Not saying "momma" and "dada"
* Not reciprocating when told "no", "hello", and "bye"&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Does not have a one to three word vocabulary at 12 months and up to 15 words by 18 months
* Is unable to identify body parts&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Displaying difficulties imitating sounds and actions&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;
* Shows preference to gestures over verbalization&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;

Additional signs of speech delay after the age of 2 years and up to the age of 4 include the following:

* Inability to spontaneously produce words and phrases&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Inability to follow simple directions and commands&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Cannot make two word connections&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent&gt;{{cite web|last=babycenter|title=Warning signs of a toddler's language delay|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_warning-signs-of-a-toddlers-language-delay_12293.bc|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lacks consonant sounds at the beginning or end of words&lt;ref name=kidshealth&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelsen|first=Amy|title=Delayed Speech or Language Development|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/behavior/not_talk.html#|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Is difficult to understand by close family members&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Is not able to display the tasks of common household objects&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;
* Is unable to form simple 2 to 3 word sentences

== Effects ==

Studies show that children diagnosed with speech delay are more likely to present with behavioral and social emotional problems both in childhood and as adults.  Decreased receptive language, reading, and learning skills are common side effects for children that suffer from a speech delay and do not receive adequate intervention.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Denise|title=Speech Delay in Kids Linked to Later Emotional Problems|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20100628/speech-delay-in-kids-linked-to-later-emotional-problems|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar studies suggest that children with speech delays are more likely to have a difficult time communicating and bonding with peers, which could have negative effects on their psychosocial health later in life.&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt;

== Causes ==

At times, speech delay and impairment is caused by a physical disruption in the mouth such as a deformed frenulum, lips, or palate.  If the motion or ability to form words and appropriate sounds is disrupted, the child may be slow to pick up words and lack the ability to shape their mouth and tongue in the formation of words.&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Michigan|title=Speech and Language Delay and Disorder|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/speech.htm|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other more serious concerns are those that can be caused by oral-motor issues.&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=KKH /&gt;  Oral-motor dysfunction refers to a lack or delay in the area of the brain that speech is formed and created and communicated to the mouth and tongue.&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt; While speech may be the only concern, this disorder can be highlighted with feeding issues as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children that are having speech delay disorders could have the following characteristics (Shriberg 1982): 
* Speech mechanism in which speech is associated with hearing, motor speech and craniofacial malfunction

The many other causes of speech delay include bilingual children with phonological disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Diagnosis and Treatment of Children with Speech Disorder|last = Dodd|first = Barbara|publisher = Johan Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2013|isbn = 1118713346|location = |pages = 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[autism spectrum disorders]], childhood apraxia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Diagnosis and Treatment of Children with Speech Disorder|last = Dodd|first = Barbara|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2013|isbn = 1118713346|location = |pages = 211}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auditory processing disorder]], prematurity, cognitive impairment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Diagnosis and Treatment of Children with Speech Disorder|last = Dodd|first = Barbara|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Songs|year = 2013|isbn = 1118713346|location = |pages = 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[deafness|hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="kidshealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UM" /&gt;   In addition, when children are addicted to screens, they aren’t stimulated to be involved in conversations, causing speech delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Kelly |title=Your Wrong Parenting May Lead to Speech Delay in Children |url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/uae-health/your-wrong-parenting-may-lead-to-speech-delay-in-children |publisher=Khaleej Times |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broomfield and Dodd's (2004a) found out after survey that 6.4% of children who are perfectly normal showed speech difficulty while they lacked these disorders will often show early signs and are at times identified as "at risk" when the speech delay is diagnosed.

== Therapies and treatments ==

After the initial diagnosis of speech delay, a hearing test will be administered to ensure that hearing loss or deafness is not an underlying cause of the delay.&lt;ref name=KKH&gt;{{cite web|last=Keep Kids Healthy|title=Speech Delay|url=http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/welcome/conditions/speechdelay.html|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a child has successfully completed the hearing test, the therapy or therapies used will be determined. There are many therapies available for children that have been diagnosed with a speech delay, and for every child, the treatment and therapies needed vary with the degree, severity, and cause of the delay. While speech therapy is the most common form of intervention, many children may benefit from additional help from occupational and physical therapies as well. Physical and occupational therapies can be used for a child that is suffering from speech delay due to physical malformations and children that have also been diagnosed with a developmental delay such as autism or a language processing delay. Music therapy has effective results in the fundamentals of speech development, including phonological memory, sentence understanding, sentence memory, and morphological rule generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Wibke |last2=Ostermann |first2=Thomas |last3=Linden |first3=Ulrike |title=Effects of music therapy in the treatment of children with delayed speech development - results of a pilot study |journal=BioMed Central Complementary and Alternative Medicine |date=2010 |pages=10:39 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-10-39 |pmid=20663139 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921108/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children that have been identified with hearing loss can be taught simple sign language to build and improve their vocabulary in addition to attending speech therapy.

The parents of a delayed child are the first and most important tool in helping overcome the speech delay.&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt; The parent or caregiver of the child can provide the following activities at home, in addition to the techniques suggested by a speech therapist, to positively influence the growth of speech and vocabulary:

* Reading to the child regularly&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt;
* Use of questions and simple, clear language&lt;ref name=UM /&gt;&lt;ref name=KKH /&gt;
* Positive reinforcement in addition to patience&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=babycent /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt;

For children that are suffering from physical disorder that is causing difficulty forming and pronouncing words, parents and caregivers suggest using and introducing different food textures to exercise and build jaw muscles while promoting new movements of the jaw while chewing. Another less studied technique used to combat and treat speech delay is a form of therapy using music to promote and facilitate speech and language development.&lt;ref name=Music /&gt; It is important to understand that music therapy is in its infancy and has yet to be thoroughly studied and practiced on children suffering from speech delays and impediments.&lt;ref name=Music&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grob|first=Wibke|author2=Ulrike Linden |author3=Thomas Ostermann |title=Effects of music therapy in the treatment of children with delayed speech development - results of a pilot study|journal=BMC Complement Altern Med|date=21 July 2010|pmc=2921108|pmid=20663139|doi=10.1186/1472-6882-10-39|volume=10|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24651">'''Sumud''' ({{lang-ar|صمود}}) meaning "steadfastness"&lt;ref name=Abedp288&gt;Abed, 1988, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; or "steadfast perseverance" is an ideological theme and political strategy that first emerged among the [[Palestinian people]] through the experience of the [[dialectic]] of [[oppression]] and [[Resistance movement|resistance]] in the wake of the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name=Nassarp28&gt;Nassar and Heacock, 1990, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This noun is derived from a verb meaning "arrange, adorn, lay up, save".  &lt;ref&gt; Hippocrene Standard Arabic-English/English-Arabic Dictionary by Wortabet and Porter, c. 1995, page 177. &lt;/ref&gt;Those who are steadfast, that is those who exhibit sumud, are referred to as ''samidin'', the singular forms of which are ''samid'' (m.) and ''samida'' (f.).

With the passing of the years since 1967, Palestinians have distinguished between two main forms of sumud. The first, static sumud, is more passive and is defined by [[Ibrahim Dhahak]] as the "maintenance of Palestinians on their land." The second, resistance sumud (in Arabic, ''sumud muqawim'') is a more dynamic [[ideology]] whose aim is to seek ways of building alternative institutions so as to resist and undermine the Israeli occupation of the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref name=Nassarp28/&gt;

The ultimate [[symbol]] associated with the concept of sumud and the Palestinian sense of rootedness in the land is the [[olive]] tree, ubiquitous throughout [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Schulzp105&gt;Schulz and Hammer, 2003, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[icon]] of sumud that has often been portrayed in [[Palestinian art]]work is that of the mother, and more specifically, a [[peasant]] woman depicted as when pregnant.&lt;ref name=Jetterp163/&gt;

==Origins and development==
In the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], sumud represented the Palestinian political strategy as adopted from 1967 onward. As a concept closely related to the land, [[agriculture]] and [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]]ness, the ideal image of the Palestinian put forward at this time was that of the peasant (in Arabic, ''[[fellah]]'') who stayed put on his land, refusing to leave.&lt;ref name=Schulzp105/&gt; [[Baruch Kimmerling]] writes that the adoption of a strategy of sumud was motivated by a desire to avoid a second [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name=Kimmerlingp15&gt;Kimmerling, 2003, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Sumud as a strategy is more passive than that adopted by the [[Palestinian fedayeen]], though it has provided an important subtext to the narrative of the fighters, "in symbolising continuity and connections with the land, with peasantry and a [[rural]] way of life."&lt;ref name=Schulzp105/&gt;

===Static sumud===
In the 1970s, as the shift away from the underground militant activities of the Palestinian fedayeen fully gave way to the notion of sumud among Palestinians still living in what was once historic Palestine, the mother emerged as "an absolutely perfect representation" of the sumud ideology. The [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and [[Palestinian people#Folklore|folklore]] movement also thrived at this time, and the [[poster art]] produced made the image of very round, pregnant peasant women into the [[icon]]s of sumud.&lt;ref name=Jetterp163&gt;Jetter et al., 1997, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, sumud called for "a collective third way between submission and [[exile]], between passivity and ... [[Palestinian political violence|violence]] to end the occupation." Static sumud, though underscored by the determination to stay on one's land, was also characterized by an attitude of resignation and perhaps even self-pity. The objective of simply remaining in place manifested itself in a reliance on hand-outs, such as those received from ''The Steadfastness Aid Fund of the [[Jordan]]ian-Palestinian Joint Committee'', established by the [[Arab League|Arab Summit]] Conference in [[Baghdad]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Nassarp28/&gt;

===Resistance sumud===
The emergence of medical relief committees in the early 1980s, made up of doctors from hospitals in [[Jerusalem]] who would spend their days off [[Volunteering|volunteer]]ing to establish and operate [[clinics]] in Palestinian [[village]]s was the first widespread manifestation of resistance sumud. By 1983, eight such committees were providing medical services throughout the West Bank. Uniting to form the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees, this [[grassroots]] organization provided a model for other such committees which emerged in the years and decades to follow.&lt;ref name=Nassarp28/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, [[Yasser Arafat]], describing how sumud is a political strategy that is prerequisite to fighting said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The most important element in the Palestinian program is holding onto the land. Holding onto the land and not [[warfare]] alone. Warfare comes at a different level. If you only fight - that is a tragedy. If you fight and [[emigrate]] - that is a tragedy. The basis is that you hold on and fight. The important thing is that you hold onto the land and afterward - combat."&lt;ref name=Schulzp106&gt;Schulz and Hammer, 2003, p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sumud in this sense has meant "staying put despite continuous assault." It is not merely about passive endurance, but "an act of unyielding resistance and defiance." [[Palestinian refugee]]s, both those living within and outside of the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]], often describe their ability to both resist and endure [[Palestinian refugee camps|camp]] life as sumud. The holding out of Palestinian refugees against the assaults on [[Tel al-Zaatar massacre|Tel al-Zaatar]] and [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Shatila]] in [[Lebanon]] are cited as prime examples of sumud.&lt;ref name=Schulzp106/&gt;

Noam Chomsky, in his book [[The Fateful Triangle]], quotes [[Raja Shehadeh]] who says that there are three ways to resist occupation, "blind hatred" ("the terrorist"), "mute submission" ("the moderate"), and the way of "the Samid". He quotes Shehadeh as saying "You, Samid, choose to stay in that prison, because it is your home, and because you fear that if you leave, your jailer will not allow you to return. Living like this, you must constantly resist the twin temptations of either acquiescing in the jailer’s plan in numb despair, or becoming crazed by consuming hatred for your jailer and yourself, the prisoner."&lt;ref name="Chomsky1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noam Chomsky|title=Fateful Triangle: The United States, Israel, and the Palestinians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1ZfAxkbGFYC|year=1999|publisher=South End Press|isbn=978-0-89608-601-2|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-violent civil disobedience===
Since 1967, nonviolent protests mounted by Palestinians, such as [[general strike]]s, [[boycott]]s and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s, have been intimately associated with the concept of sumud.&lt;ref name=HolyLand&gt;{{cite web|title=A Timeline of Palestinian Nonviolent Resistance|publisher=Holy Land Trust|url=http://www.holylandtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=96|accessdate=2008-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329082815/http://www.holylandtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=96|archivedate=2008-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raja Shehadeh]]'s conceptualization of sumud, as non-violent attitude of life that could forge a third way between acceptance of the occupation and opting for violent struggle, gave a voice to those many Palestinians who refused to leave their land and tried to go on with their daily lives. While simply carrying on with daily life under often impossible circumstances can in itself be considered a form of non-violent resistance, more active forms of non-violent civil disobedience have also been inspired and informed by the concept of sumud.&lt;ref name=Teeffelen&gt;{{cite web|title=Another way: educational materials on non-violence|author=Toine van Teeffelen|publisher=Palestine-Education.net|url=http://www.palestine-education.net/index.php?|date=November 15, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328233534/http://www.palestine-education.net/index.php|archivedate=March 28, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Intifada====
{{Main|First Intifada}}
During the First Intifada (1987&amp;ndash;1993) the concept of resistance sumud gained full expression in the focus on "freeing Palestinians from dependence on [[Israel]] by refusing to cooperate and by building independent institutions and committees."&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt;

A comprehensive nonviolence action plan, announced by [[Hanna Siniora]] and [[Mubarak Awad]] in January 1988, called upon Palestinians to boycott Israeli products and end cooperation with Israel. Merchants in the Gaza Strip and West Bank shut down their shops in protest over Israel's treatment of demonstrators. Palestinian women began to [[Agriculture|cultivate crops]] on previously uncultivated land so as to supplant the need for Israeli produce, and underground, makeshift schools were opened by Palestinians to respond to Israel's closure of 900 educational establishments in the occupied territories.&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt;

In September–October 1989, as Israel tried to quell the Intifada, tax [[Raid (military)|
raids]] were implemented, whereby [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military forces]] and tax officials would enter a town, levying heavy taxes against Palestinian individuals and businesses, and walking out with millions of dollars in savings, goods and household items. In [[Beit Sahour]], villagers responded by mounting a tax revolt under the slogan, "[[No taxation without representation|No Taxation without Representation]]." The refusal to pay taxes was met with the imposition of a total Israeli [[siege]] on the village, preventing the entry of food and medical supplies, withholding electricity supplies and imposing strict [[curfew]]s. Personal belongings, furniture, factory machinery and cars were confiscated by the army and many residents of Beit Sahour were also beaten and arrested. The villagers nevertheless persisted until Israel called off the siege and the raids at the end of October 1989, due to media exposure and the ensuing international outcry.&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt;

==Symbols, icons, literary references==
In addition to the peasant, and the pregnant peasant woman in particular, the [[olive tree]] and its long history of rootedness in the region is a primary symbol of sumud for Palestinians. This association manifested itself in [[Palestinian literature|Palestinian poetry]], such as in [[Raja Shehadeh]]'s 1982 poem which reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Sometimes, when I am walking in the hills ... unselfconsciously enjoying the touch of the hard land under my feet, the smell of [[Za'atar|thyme]] and the hills and trees around me, I find myself looking at an olive tree, and as I am looking at it, it transforms itself before my eyes into a symbol of the ''samidin'', of our struggle, of loss. And at that very moment I am robbed of the tree; instead there is a hollow space into which anger and pain flow."&lt;ref name=Schulzp106/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shehadeh, a West Bank lawyer, did not confine his references to sumud to poetry. In his book ''The Third Way'' (1982), he wrote, "We ''samidin'' cannot fight the Israelis' brute physical force but we must keep the anger burning - steel our wills to fight the lies. It is up to us to remember and record."&lt;ref name=Kempp139&gt;Kemp, 2004, p. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adriana Kemp]] notes of his representation of the samid that it is a situation of ambivalence, citing Shaehadeh's note on his voluntary return to the West Bank after being in Europe where he could have stayed, wherein he writes, "It is strange coming back like this, of your own free will, to the chains of sumud."&lt;ref name=Kempp139/&gt; Shehadeh also harshly critiqued the Palestinian elite who benefitted from paying "only widely patriotic lip-service to our struggle, [which] was more than my sumud in my poor and beloved land could stomach." Ironically, many Palestinians viewed people like Shehadeh, from a notable middle-class family in the West Bank, as forming part of the strata which benefitted most from the policies of financial support for the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) in the 1980s and accused them of promoting maintenance of the status quo through the policy of sumud.&lt;ref name=Kempp139/&gt;

[[Edward Said]] found encouragement in the increased self-consciousness and determination to stay in historic Palestine that had gained prominence among Palestinians in the occupied territories. In ''After the Last Sky: Palestinian Lives'' (1986), he references Shehadeh's work and characterizes sumud as "an entirely successful tactical solution" at a time when no efficacious strategy is available.&lt;ref name=Gaess&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]|date=July 1987|title=Book Review: After the Last Sky: Palestinian Lives|author=Roger Gaess|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0787/87070020.html|accessdate=2008-03-25|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Palestinian Like Me'' (1989), [[Yoram Binur]], an Israeli journalist and committed [[Zionism|Zionist]] who lived undercover as an Arab labourer for six months in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]] in order to experience what such a life might be like, describes sumud as "an attitude, a philosophy, and a way of life." It is, "[...] a more basic form of resistance growing out of the idea that merely to exist, to survive and to remain on one's land is an act of defiance - especially when deportation is the one thing that Palestinians fear most."&lt;ref name=Binur&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian Like Me|year=1989|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rGw95RD1oRQJ:mofetnet.macam.ac.il/FileFetcher.aspx%3Fid%3D141148%26imageType%3DcourseFile|author=Yoram Binur|accessdate=2008-03-25}}{{broken link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing more active forms of sumud, Binur tells of his encounter with two Arabs who were employed as construction workers at the [[Israeli settlement]] of [[Beit El]]. In response to Binur's  admonishment (in his role as an Arab) for working for the "worst of them", the workers replied that not only does the money they receive for such work allow them to be samidin by living where they are, but that in their work they take advantage of every opportunity to "fight them". Binur asks, "What can you do as a simple labourer?" To which one of the workers replies:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Quite a bit. First of all, after I lay the tiles in the bathroom or kitchen of an [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settler]], when the tiles are all in place and the cement has already dried, I take a hammer and break a few. When we finish installing sewage pipes, and the Jewish subcontractor has checked to see that everything is alright, then I stuff a sackful of cement into the pipe. As soon as the water runs through that pipe the cement gets hard as rock, and the sewage system becomes blocked."&lt;ref name=Binur/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sliman Mansour]], a Palestinian artist, has produced images that "gave visual form to the newly formulated ideology of Sumud," which [[Gannit Ankori]] describes as "a firm rootedness in the land, regardless of the hardships and humiliation caused by occupation." Among the examples of Mansour's work that are cited by Ankori are two oils on canvass, ''Olive-picking'' (1987) and ''Olive-picking Triptych'' (1989).&lt;ref name=Ankori&gt;Ankori, 2006, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhannad 'Abd Al-Hamid, columnist for the Palestinian daily [[Al-Ayyam (Ramallah)|Al-Ayyam]], wrote that resistance (''muqawama'') is the legitimate [[Right of resistance|right]] of the Palestinian people, but that, in light of its steep cost and limited results, other means of struggle should be used. Al-Hamid argues that:&lt;ref name="memri"&gt;http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&amp;Area=palestinian&amp;ID=IA53809 MEMRI. "Fatah Members: "The Principle of Resistance and Armed Struggle Must Not Be Relinquished."" by C. Jacob, 6 August 2009. Retrieved: 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Resistance is survival and steadfastness. It is planting trees, developing education, boycotting Israeli products, [launching] a popular uprising against the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|racist separation fence]], building homes in [East] Jerusalem, reopening the institutions [there], struggling against all forms of corruption, boycotting companies that contribute to the Judaization of Jerusalem and also to the building of the settlements, and also boycotting companies that supply arms to the occupation army. There are a hundred more ways of resistance that will damage the occupation more than they will damage us, while preserving the legitimate right of resistance under conditions that will not harm the security and interests of the [Palestinian] people. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, some other high pofile Fatah members, as Husam Khader, declared: "Fatah has not changed its national identity, and it retains the option of resistance and armed struggle. But now, for the first time... it is permitting the option of negotiations as one of the Palestinian people's strategic options and as a possible way of attaining its political goals."&lt;ref name="memri" /&gt;

[[File:Palestinian family in Yanoon.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Palestinian family in [[Yanun]], near [[Nablus]] 23 August 2004]]

A photography exhibition, ''The Spirit of Sumud'', composed by [[James Prineas]] and supported by the Arab-Educational Institute and the Artas Folklore Center in [[Bethlehem]] and Palestine-Family.net,&lt;ref name=PalestineFamily&gt;{{cite web|title=Website strives to preserve Palestinian culture, raise awareness about Palestinian issue|publisher=Palestine News Network (PNN)|url=http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=862|date=October 24, 2006|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sumud today as, "the [[non-violent resistance]] of the Palestinians against land confiscation and [[ethnic cleansing]]. Like an old olive tree deeply rooted to the ground, those practicing sumud refuse to move-away despite political, economic and physical injustices committed against them."&lt;ref name=Spirit&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spirit of Sumud|author=James Prineas|url=http://www.sumud.net/|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Oliphant]], a South African [[Ecumenical Accompanier]] based in [[Bethlehem]] as part of a program coordinated by the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC), discusses the importance of sumud to Palestinian life in withstanding economic and political hardships. In a March 2007 report describing his experiences in the West Bank, he writes that sumud "describes the Palestinian spirit or [[geist]]. Regardless of the situation, Sumud kicks in and regulates the response to the threat or danger and humanity kicks in and lifts the communal spirit and makes coping possible - coping at all costs. This has the effect of presenting a deception that all is okay. More importantly it also engenders sharing widely amongst family members: better to have 20 families sharing 3000 shekels than 19 families going hungry." Oliphant also likened sumud to the traditional Southern [[Africa]]n concept of [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]].&lt;ref name=Oliphant&gt;{{cite web|title=10080 Minutes in Paradise - The Ride to agadir and Other Stories|author=Michael Oliphant|publisher=South African Council of Churches|date=March 27, 2007|url=http://www.sacc.org.za/news07/oliphant.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328234304/http://www.sacc.org.za/news07/oliphant.html|archivedate=March 28, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toine van Teeffelen]] of the Arab Educational Institute in Bethlehem defines the sumud concept as, on the one hand, relating "to a vertical dimension of Palestinian life, 'standing strong' on the land, having deep roots." On the other hand, sumud "indicates a horizontal time dimension – an attitude of patience and persistence, of not giving up, despite the odds." &lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=8-18&amp;cid=17&amp;did=4987&amp;pageflip=1&lt;/ref&gt; 
Motivated by the need to find sources of hope in the present Palestinian context, the Arab Educational Institute recently developed pedagogical applications of the sumud concept, taking it outside strictly political boundaries. The following values are stressed as constitutive of sumud: its democratic or participative character, openness to many different life stories, agency or willpower, an aesthetic perspective, and the possibility of connecting sumud with wider human values and circles of community.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=8-18&amp;cid=17&amp;did=4987&amp;pageflip=1 For a contribution on sumud as "resistance in daily life," explaining the aims of the Peace Sumud House established near the Separation Wall at Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, see http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=8-18&amp;cid=17&amp;did=4988&amp;pageflip=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current examples of Sumud ==
The Palestinian village [[Aqabah]], located in the northeastern [[West Bank]], is currently being threatened by demolition orders which have been issued by the Israeli Civil Administration against the entire village. The Civil Administration had previously expropriated large areas of privately registered land in the village, and as of May 2008 it has threatened to demolish the following structures: the mosque, the [[British government]]-funded medical clinic, the internationally funded kindergarten, the Rural Women's Association building, the roads, the water tank, and nearly all private homes. According to Haj Sami Sadek, the mayor of the village, and [[Gush Shalom]], the Israeli Peace Bloc, the purpose of the demolition orders is to destroy the village and expropriate most of the village's land for the Israeli military purposes. With the help of international organizations such as the [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions]], [[Gush Shalom]], and [[The Rebuilding Alliance]], the village residents plan to fight the demolition orders and remain in their homes. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''''In the Last Days of the City''''' (Akher Ayyam Al Madina)&lt;br /&gt;
"In the fading grandeur of [[downtown Cairo]], Khalid, a 34 year old filmmaker is struggling to make a film about a city in which everything he loves is leaving him. He is about to be kicked out of his house, the woman he loved is emigrating, and the death of his father has awakened memories of life before childhood death of his sister when Cairo and his country seemed a brighter world. Now, all around him, dreams as much as buildings are disintegrating, but the need to keep going has not. Capturing the stories of his friends at home, and abroad, in Beirut and Baghdad and Berlin, Khalid learns how to live and keep creating, in the face of ruin, of war, and disappearing hopes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lastdaysofthecity.com/ |title=Website of In the Last Days of the City |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director's Quote: "I am making this film out of love for my city and because I want to show its contradictions – its rising violence and invisible magic, and the story of our silence as we watch our cities being conquered by oppression, ignorance and extremism. In Cairo, like in every other city in the Middle East, there is the feeling that we can’t keep going like this – the end is near, and it might be violent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/Sanad/Projects/Tamer%20El%20Said |title=Tamer El Said |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Abu Dhabi Film Festival |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late art director Salah Marei worked closely with Tamer El Said on the location sets for the film, "[h]e took notice of every little aspect, even the door knobs, keys and keychains.” They looked at more than 60 apartments to find the most suited one for the film, deciding upon the color of the walls to match the skin tones of the two main actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/7152/Arts--Culture/Film/Remembering-Salah-Marei.aspx |title=Remembering Salah Marei |author=Menna Taher and Wael Eskandar |date= |work=7 March 2011 |publisher=Ahram Online |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On a Monday''''' (Yom al-Itneyn)&lt;br /&gt;
The 10-minute fiction, produced in Egypt in 2005, was screened at more than 51 festivals in 24 countries, and scooped nine international and local awards.  It is on when love emerges in the details in this innovatively simple day-in-the-life story of a married couple who one random Monday discover each other anew due to a change in routine. ''On a Monday'' received several prizes at international film festivals including the prize for Best Short Film in Cairo, and the Silver Falcon at the Arab Film Festival in Rotterdam.

'''''Take Me''''' (Ghaeir Khodoni)&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt/UAE, 2004, 53 min. Borrowing its title from a famous song of Moroccan leftist activists, Take Me is a powerful story of an undefeatable will to survive: for one's country, for one's family, and to tell the story of one's life. The film revisits the harrowing memories of a group of Moroccan men who as young activists were ”kidnapped,” tortured, and held in isolation without explanation or a trial. Through the grim subject matter the bonds of friendship they formed through shared experience and their hope for a more just Morocco rise to the surface. The film, produced by [[Al Jazeera|Al-Jazeera]], won the 2004 Ismailia Film Festival Prize.

== Cimatheque ==

El Said co-founded Cimatheque, a multi purpose space dedicated to celebrating film and supporting the needs of independent filmmakers in Egypt. Built in the context of Egypt’s emergent alternative cinema scene and a country in transition, it is conceived as a dynamic work space for independent filmmakers to collaborate, research and network, while addressing essential needs: education, screening and resources. Equipped with a screening room, viewing stations and a specialised library of films and books, Cimatheque aims to enable access to films rarely, if ever, shown in Egypt, featuring a rich variety of international films within a wider screening programme that gives essential exposure to Arab and Egyptian independent films. Alongside this, Cimatheque provides a year round educational programme of workshops and courses focusing on key issues like producing, screen-writing, editing and camera work, bringing together local and international filmmakers and industry professionals to exchange skills and experiences. Hosting an analogue film laboratory and accordant training programme, filmmakers are allowed to work with alternative methodologies and film material at affordable rates. Open to the public and filmmakers of all levels of experience, Cimatheque is planned to be a hub for filmmakers and film lovers alike, working to build a strong platform for alternative cinema in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arteeast.org/pages/naas/naas_members |title=Network of Arab Arthouse Screens - Naas |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ArteEast |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/cimathe?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts |title=Cimatheque |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Textiles of [[Mexico]]''' have a long history. The making of [[fiber]]s, cloth and other [[textile]] goods has existed in the country since at least 1400 BCE. Fibers used during the pre-Hispanic period included those from the [[yucca]], [[Arecaceae|palm]] and [[Furcraea|maguey]] plants as well as the use of [[cotton]] in the hot lowlands of the south. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the Spanish introduced new fibers such as [[silk]] and [[wool]] as well as the European foot treadle [[loom]]. Clothing styles also changed radically. Fabric was produced exclusively in workshops or in the home until the era of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1880s to 1910), when the mechanization of [[weaving]] was introduced, mostly by the French. 
Today, fabric, clothes and other textiles are both made by craftsmen and in factories. Handcrafted goods include pre-Hispanic clothing such as [[huipil]]s and [[sarape]]s, which are often [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Clothing, [[carpet|rug]]s and more are made with natural and [[natural dye|naturally dyed]] fibers. Most handcrafts are produced by [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous people]], whose communities are concentrated in the center and south of the country in states such as [[Mexico State]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Chiapas]]. The textile industry remains important to the economy of Mexico although it has suffered setback due to competition by cheaper goods produced in countries such as [[China]], [[India]] and [[Vietnam]].

==History==
[[File:Murales Rivera - Färberei.jpg|thumb|Diego Rivera mural depicting the making of textiles in the pre-Hispanic period]]

===Pre-Hispanic period===
The oldest known fabric fragments in Mexico have been found in the arid north of the country in states such as [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Durango]] and date to approximately between 1800 and 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=424 |title=El Textil Artesanal en México, Introducción – Antecedentes Históricos |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Textile Crafts in Mexico, Introduction - Historical Precedents |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083752/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=424 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Hispanic times, the most common woven fibers in dry areas were from the yucca and palm trees, with cotton grown in the hot humid areas near the coast. It was unknown to the [[Aztec]]s until they conquered cotton growing areas and began demanding it as tribute. Then, only the upper classes were permitted to wear it. Given the important status cotton cloth had, it is often used as money. For some ceremonial garments, [[amate]] or bark paper was used.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=2722 |title=Evolucion del Textil en México despues de la Colonia |work=Artes e Historia |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Evolution of textiles in Mexico after the colonial period |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094504/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=2722# |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Each of the sedentary Mesoamerican cultures had a god of weaving. Women were often buried with woven items they had made. Cortés mentions the Aztecs’ skill in weaving in one of this letters to the king of Spain, in very favorable terms.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

===Colonial era===
[[File:WeaverTexcoco1.JPG|thumb|Weaver using foot treadle loom of the type introduced by the Spanish]]
After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the production of cloth and the wearing of clothes in Mesoamerica changed drastically. Most pre-Hispanic forms of dress and body adornment were banned by the Spanish as “uncivilized.” Indigenous, European and Asian fabrics influenced Mexican cloth production by the mid colonial period.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt; The Spanish did not favor the native cotton, nor did they find the material produced on traditional [[Loom#Back strap loom|backstrap looms]] wide enough. New techniques and materials were introduced. Spanish modes of dress, itself a mixture of European, [[Asia Minor]] and [[Egypt]]ian influences, were introduced as well. At first wool and silk fabric was imported, then sheep and [[silkworm]]s as well as European foot pedal looms all by the late 1530s. By 1580, Mexico had become one of the most productive areas for wool and silk cloth. Most of the production was concentrated in the present day states of Oaxaca, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Puebla]]. At first Spanish weavers dominated production, but they were soon replaced by native weavers who were making material cheaper. Instead of prohibiting Indian made fabric, European weavers decided instead to hire them, creating workshops. While the indigenous weavers were not paid much, the Spanish owners did make money. These workshops eventually produced enough fabric for both internal consumption and for export to [[Spain]], the [[Philippines]], [[Central America]] and [[Peru]]. Silk cloth production was particularly dominant from 1540 to 1580; However, the end of this period, the yearly [[Manila Galleon]] was regularly bringing cheaper silk from Asia.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt;

While cotton cloth was not favored by the Europeans, it was still made and offered as tribute to Spanish overlords. Commercializing the fiber was difficult as the plant grows in the lowlands near the oceans and not near the manufacturing areas in the highlands, and transportation costs were high. Large cotton weaving workshops were not founded until the second half of the 17th century. Eventually, the production of this fabric as well as wool fabric filled the gap left by the disappearance of Mexican silk fabric production.  Wool fabric remained important because it was favored by the upper tiers of colonial society, and because sheep could be raised near major weaving areas, such as [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]],  [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Morelia|Valladolid]], [[Acámbaro]], and [[San Miguel de Allende]].&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt;

In times past, fabric and clothing were made to last for decades, but today fabric is much cheaper and much of what clothing is bought is soon thrown away. This is mostly due to the mechanization of weaving, which has made fabric inexpensive.&lt;ref name="ecological"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los nuevos textiles ecológicos |author= Gabriela Casavantes |url=http://www2.esmas.com/mujer/ecomujer/099481/los-nuevos-textiles-ecolgicos |newspaper=es mas |location=Mexico |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The new ecological textiles |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, as in other parts of the world, the introduction of modern transportation and communications brought about major changes in the production and distribution of goods and in firms' management and structure.&lt;ref name="porfirian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gómez-Galvarriato |first1=Aurora  |date=Autumn 2008 |title= Networks and Entrepreneurship: The Modernization of the Textile Business in Porfirian Mexico |journal=Business History Review |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=475–505 |doi=10.1017/s0007680500082611}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century, industrialization affected textile production with the introduction of steam-powered machines and the efforts of French immigrants from [[Barcelonnette]], who began to arrive in Mexico in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;  The mass production of textiles, especially cotton textiles, developed earlier than in other countries outside of Western Europe and the United States, nearing the same level as in England in the mid-18th century despite social unrest at that time. Mechanization of cloth production began in the 1830s; however, high internal taxes among states kept production facilities small and unconsolidated. While Mexican production lagged behind that of Europe, certain regions of the country such as La Laguna, in the modern states of [[Durango]] and Coahuila, became important producers of cotton fabric. The most widely produced fabric was called “manta,” a natural cotton favored by many indigenous groups.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

The development of steamship lines and railroad networks allowed Mexico-produced fabrics to be exported. The consolidation of power by Porfirio Díaz in the 1880s opened up business opportunities and made foreign investment possible. By the end of the 19th century, textile production and distribution was the country’s largest manufacturing sector, mostly controlled by French immigrants. The immigrants worked together, forming the “Barcelonnette network.” They started off with small textile mills and dry goods stores, which eventually grew into large factories and [[department store]]s, including [[Palacio de Hierro]], which still exists.  These French immigrants consolidated textile operations by the end of the 19th century, and by the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]] changed their power source from steam to electricity. They also changed textile mills from mostly family-owned organizations to more modern enterprises with professional managers and stock sold on exchanges.&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;

The [[sewing machine]] appeared in the early 20th century and became widely used to join fabric and for embroidery . This led to another level of textile production: finished clothing.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

==Craft and indigenous textiles today==

===Indigenous tradition===
[[File:WeaverZaachila2.JPG|thumb|Woman in Zaachila, Oaxaca weaving with a backstrap loom]]

Textiles is one of Mexico’s more important crafts as it represents the continuation of tradition as well as its fusion with modern designs and techniques. Both pre-Hispanic and colonial era style textiles are still made in Mexico. In addition, many of the textile factories use machines based on old foot pedal looms from the colonial period. There are basically four types of fibers used for fabric production:&lt;ref name="turedomex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.edomexico.gob.mx/iifaem/htm/html/textil.htm |title= TEXTIL Artesania Mexiquense |publisher= Secretaria de Turismo Estado de Mexico |location=Mexico State |language=Spanish |trans-title=Craft textiles in Mexico State |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Vegetable products such as cotton
* Animal products such as wool and silk
* Minerals such as [[Goldwork (embroidery)|gold and silver thread]]
* Synthetics.
Raw materials for textiles fall into two groups: smooth fibers such as silk, cotton, and wool, introduced to the American continent by the [[conquistador]]s; and hard fibers native to Mexico such as [[ixtle]], [[lechuguilla]], reeds, palm, twigs,  and [[willow]]. In indigenous regions of Mexico, women are responsible for clothing the community, a process which often begins with harvesting natural fibers and then [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[dyeing]], and weaving textiles. In various parts of Mexico, both native backstrap looms and pedal-driven looms of European origin are used to weave principally cotton and wool.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/208-the-artesanias-of-michoacan-an-introduction |title= The artesanias of Michoacan - an introduction  |date= October 9, 2008 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most handcrafted textiles are produced by the sixty or so indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico, who mostly live in rural areas in the center and south of the country. In these textiles, traditional indigenous designs, and in some cases techniques still survive.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  One common technique in craft fabric is [[brocade]], which allows for raised designs to be woven into the cloth.&lt;ref name="maestros"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=6235&amp;id_seccion=5334&amp;id_subseccion=3050&amp;id_documento=821 |title= Para convertir la hebra en telas Salon de Maestros de Arte Popular |work= Artes e Historia |location= Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title= Converting fiber into cloth – Masters’ Room at the (Museum of ) Popular Art |accessdate= June 1, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094522/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=6235&amp;id_seccion=5334&amp;id_subseccion=3050&amp;id_documento=821 |archivedate= July 19, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous textiles are made at home by women and used for clothing, home use, decorative use and ceremonial use. Items include those that are hand woven, hand embroidered, [[knitting|knitted]] and more.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  Clothing is one of the ways that these groups distinguish themselves from each other and the world at large. Some of these garments include the huipil, the [[quechquemitl]], [[Tilmàtli|tilmas]], sandals and [[rebozo]]s.&lt;ref name="artshistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583 |title=Introduccion al Textil de la Epoca Contemporanea |author=CONACULTa |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Introduction to textiles of the modern era |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094529/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583# |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ethnic groups, such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] in central Mexico commercialize their original and traditional creations as well as produce them for domestic consumption. People in coastal areas continue to plant cotton, spin it, dye it with natural elements such as [[indigo]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Indigenous clothing===
[[File:MixDressRMH.JPG|thumb|100px|Huipil on display at the Regional Museum of [[Huajuapan]].]]
Most of the pre-Hispanic clothing that survives is for women.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  These include “enredos”, or wrap dresses, fajas, or cloth belts, huipils, a type of tunic, quechquemitl, which is a kind of rectangular or square short poncho. The last was originally worn directly on the upper body of a woman but today it is worn over a blouse.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=655 |title=El Textil Artesanal en México Los Diseños |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Craft textiles in Mexico Introduction- Designs |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083815/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=655 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose-fitting sack dresses, called huipils in Oaxaca and guanengos in [[Michoacán]], are often heavily embroidered with [[running stitch|straight stitching]], [[cross stitches|cross stitching]] and [[tuck (sewing)|tucks]] with floral and geometric motifs.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:RebozosBeltsZaachila.JPG|thumb|left|Rebozos and "fajas" or sash/belts for sale in Zaachila, Oaxaca]]
A widely used garment in both indigenous and mixed race communities is the rebozo. This is a long rectangular shawl used both as a wrap and as a means to carry children or heavy objects tied onto the body. The rebozo came about during the colonial period, not in the pre-Hispanic era.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;  The rebozo is a synthesis of three historical influences, the pre-Hispanic “mámatl,” the Spanish mantilla and the “repacejo,” an Oriental garment.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;  This is a long rectangular piece of cloth with long [[fringe (textiles)|fringes]] at both ends. Most rebozos are made with multicolored designs woven into the pieces using threads of different colors. Those of a single color are usually made of yarn or thread that has been [[tie-dye]]d to produce color variations in the final piece. This latter style is called “jaspe” or jasper and are usually woven on backstrap looms.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

The rebozo has been produced mostly in central Mexico since the colonial period, with some of the best known producers in Mexico State and Michoacan. [[Tenancingo, Mexico State|Tenancingo]] is one of the best known producers of craft rebozos, usually made of cotton but wool is also used. Traditional rebozos in the [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] area are often of white and blue over a black background and may be embroidered in tiny cross stitch.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:Sarape patrn.jpg|left|thumb|Portion of a sarape]]
Few pre-Hispanic male clothing pieces survive since many [[Mesoamerica]]n males went about nude or semi nude, causing Spanish authorities to force them to adopt European shirts and pants early. This early colonial style shirts and pants have changed little in indigenous communities and are now identified with indigenous groups, especially the [[Tarahumara]] in Chihuahua, the [[Tacuate people|Tacuates]] in Oaxaca and the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]]s in Chiapas.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  Many male garments are heavily embroidered in multiple colors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;  Since indigenous pants lack pockets, many men carry decorated bags called [[moral]]s. The only pre-Hispanic male garment to survive is the sarape, which is used only in certain areas of Mexico.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

In addition to clothing, other items are woven such as bedspreads, blankets, hats, cinches and knapsacks. The designs for these are most often woven into the fabric itself, but embroidered stars, border designs, deer, and other can be seen as well. These items may be made with various fibers include those derived from the maguey plant.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Embroidery===
[[File:Embroidery by Virginia Sa¦ünchez de Cornelio.jpg|thumb|left|Embroidered panel by Virginia Sanchez de Cornelio of Oaxaca]]
[[File:BlousesSkirtsHuastecaMAP.JPG|thumb|Embroidered blouses from the [[La Huasteca]] region of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].]]
One of the most distinctive aspects of indigenous handcrafted textiles is the use of embroidery. Indigenous motifs found on garments range from geometric patterns, [[zig-zag]], spirals, moons, crosses and [[fretwork|stepped frets]]. Thin cloth belts that wrap around the waist (fajillas) are common in a number of indigenous groups and are richly embroidered. The borders are often adorned with zig-zag edging, such as those of the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]s. The [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s use a moon pattern on these belts along with their morrals or carrying bags, and the Tarahumara tend to decorate theirs with triangular designs. Many of the embroidery patterns of the huipils in Oaxaca, also show pre-Hispanic influence. Flower designs are popular for embroidering women’s clothing among the Otomis, Nahuas, [[Huastecs]], Huichols and others. Spirals and curved designs appear with frequency especially in the center and south of the country.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

In addition to flowers, other themes from nature in woven and embroidered designs include plants, animals such as squirrels, rabbits, deer, armadillos, doves, hummingbirds, pelicans, seagulls and fish. [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] embroidered belts are known for their zoomorphic designs and those of [[Santo Tomás Jalieza]] tend to have images of large plumed birds. The cloth napkins of [[San Mateo del Mar]] have images of aquatic birds such as pelicans and seagulls, with those of the Tacuates of [[Santiago Zacatepec]] have borders with many diminutive animals such as centipedes, scorpions, birds, iguanas, cats, foxes and more.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

Human figures appear with relative frequency as well. They feature prominently on the embroidered napkins of [[San Juan Colorado]] and as Danza de la Pluma dancers on the cloth belts of Santo Tomás Jalieza. Patriotic symbols such as two-headed eagles, the three colors of the Mexican flag and the eagle with serpent crest. These are most prevalent in the central region of the country among the Otomis, Nahuas, Huastecos, Huicholes and others.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;
Christian symbols such as the cross, virgins, saints, angels and other elements were introduced by evangelists in the early colonial period. These appear on small and large pieces such as men’s shirts among the Tzotzil in Chiapas, in the fabrics of [[San Miguel Ameyalco]], which feature churches, and the appearance of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in many textiles in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla|Sierra Norte]] of Puebla.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

Popular sayings or phrases also appear especially in the textiles of the Purépecha around Lake Pátzcuaro and in the state of Puebla.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

===Looms===
[[File:WeavingTeotitlan1.JPG|thumb|150px|Man working on treadle loom in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca]]
Two types of looms are employed in the making are handcrafted fabrics, the pre-Hispanic backstrap loom and the introduced European foot pedal loom. Traditionally, weaving, especially on the backstrap loom, was considered to be women’s work. Women still produce items such as kitchen cloths, tablecloths, carrying bags and ornamental items with traditional designs. Although considered primitive, the backstrap loom is versatile and allows for different techniques and combinations of techniques, some of which can be very complicated. It allows for the combining of different fibers such as cotton with wool or silk.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;  Designs are woven into the cloth on this loom by changing thread colors and/or by adding items such as shells or other matter into the finished product. The backstrap loom is most prevalent in the south of the country.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

The foot pedal loom was brought to Mexico after the Conquest. Unlike pieces done on backstrap looms, pieces done on these machines have traditionally been done by men with wool being the favored fiber.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;   This type of loom is most extensively used in the center and north of the country.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  The principal advantage of this loom is that it allows for pieces of greater width than backstrap looms and has been used to create sarapes, rugs, blankets and more.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

===Rugs and other items made in Oaxaca and Mexico State===
[[File:Family of Bulmaro Pe¦ürez Mendoza finishing off a tapete.jpg|left|thumb|Bulmaro Perez Mendoza family finishing off a rug]]
Two states that continue to have significant handcrafted textile production are Oaxaca and Mexico State. Oaxaca is known for its variety of handcrafted textiles including rugs, rebozos, tablecloths and traditional clothing such as huipils. These are made backstrap looms or foot pedal looms.&lt;ref name="elcolor"&gt;{{cite news |title= El color de tus textiles |author=Alicia Boy |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=September 17, 2000 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The color of your textiles }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico State craft pieces are mostly produced in [[Jiquipilco]], [[Tejupilco de Hidalgo]], [[Temascaltepec de González]], [[Temoaya]], [[Valle de Bravo]], [[Zacazonapan]], [[Toluca]] and Tenancingo producing napkins, tablecloths, sheets, kitchen items, clothing, bathroom items, rebozos and rugs.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;
[[File:DiamanteMEAPO.JPG|thumb|150px|"Diamante Ojo de Dios" by Antonio Ruiz Gonzalez of Teotitlan del Valle at Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca]]
Both states also are significant producers of rugs. The making of knotted rugs by the Otomi in Mexico State is relatively recent. It began in 1969 when Ernesto Fernández Hurtado of the Bank of Mexico decided to promote a pilot center in Temoaya for the study and manufacture of this type of rug using traditional Otomi designs. Today, these rugs are a distinctive feature in Mexico State crafts. The rugs are made with 100% virgin wool and have an average knot density of 140,000 m2. There are about 21 different designs offered with 250 variations in colors and size.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;  Most are sold in upper-class neighborhoods of Mexico City, but due to the problem of cheap imitations, some vendors only sell from their workshops.&lt;ref name="encuentros"&gt;{{cite news |title= Encuentros con Mexico / Nudos que asombran en el Estado de Mexico|author=Ricardo Diazmunoz |author2=Maryell Ortiz de Zarate |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=August 21, 2005 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encounters in Mexico/Knots that amaze in Mexico State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teotitlán del Valle]] in Oaxaca is known for its woven rugs. Most producers make their rugs on foot pedal looms using wool dyed with [[natural dye|natural materials]] such as [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and the [[cochineal]] bug.&lt;ref name="valles"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los valles centrales de Oaxaca  |author=Carlos Puga |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=October 31, 1999 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The central valleys of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs are also produced in [[San Pablo de Mitla|Mitla]], [[Santa Ana del Valle]] and [[Tlacolula de Matamoros]] along with blankets and a type of sarape.&lt;ref name="elcolor"/&gt;  One distinguishing feature of Oaxaca rug production is the use of the cochineal insect. This insect has been used since pre-Hispanic times to dye fiber, producing colors ranging from purple to yellow, varying depending on what the ingredients, such as certain flowers or lime juice, are added. For a time, the use of natural dyes was threatened by cheaper [[synthetic dye|synthetics]] but the use of natural dyes has made a comeback.&lt;ref name="elcolor"/&gt;

===Value and protection of handcrafted textiles===
[[File:RugsTexSaleTeotitlan1.JPG|thumb|left|Rugs and other textiles for sale in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca]]
After the Mexican Revolution, references to native Mexican cultures became fashionable, including arts crafts food and regional clothing. This was expressed in the arts by those such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Dr. Atl]].&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;
Since that time, there have been a number of efforts to maintain and expand the textile producing traditions, especially of the south of Mexico. The Textile Museum has a collection of 4,000 pieces and is located in the former monastery of San Pablo in the [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|city of Oaxaca]]. The museum was opened in 2008 and sponsored by the [[Alfredo Harp Helú]] Foundation. The pieces include modern, colonial and pre-Hispanic textiles. Clothing items include huipils, enredos, quechquemilts, skirts, rugs and wall hangings. The collection is in three divisions Textiles of Oaxaca, Textiles of Mexico and Textiles of the World.&lt;ref name="anuncian"&gt;{{cite news |title= Anuncian nueva sede para Museo Textil de Oaxaca |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/467152.html |agency=Notimex |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=New site announced for the Textile Museum of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sna' Jolobil, or House of the Textiles in the [[Tzotzil language]], is a cooperative of more than 600 Tzotzil and Tzeltal women in 12 municipalities in Chiapas based in [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]]. It was founded to promote and elevate the textile crafts, especially those produced on backstrap looms, with the aim of preserving traditional techniques and designs as well as promoting the economic fortunes of women weavers. The organization has a collection of antique huipils available for study and reproduction as well as workshops in weaving and producing vegetable dyes. The organization has been successful in attracting more young people into the craft. In 1986, it received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (National Prize of Sciences and the Artes) and numerous members have earned individual awards for their work.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

[[File:ClothesSaleSolidaridadDF.JPG|thumb|Traditional clothing for sale on a sidewalk in Mexico City]]
Federal agencies such as [[FONART]] and various state agencies have their own promotional efforts including annual crafts contests and the recognition of masters in various fields, including textiles.  [[Florentina López de Jesús]] is an [[Amusga people|Amusgo]] from [[Xochistlahuaca]], [[Guerrero]]. She learned to weave from her mother at six years of age as well as to prepare raw cotton and spin it into yarn. She continued to weave as well as to do other jobs to help out her family. As an adult she began to make pieces specifically for sale such as tablecloths, placemats, rebozos and huipils, traveling to [[Ometepec]] to market. Her work caught the attention of FONART in between 1969 and 1971, which led to her becoming a member of the La Flor de Xochistlahuaca artisans’ cooperative. Since then, she has given workshops to people in her region as well as the Curso de Tintes Naturales sobre Algodon (Natural Dyes for Cotton Course) in 1994 and has promoted the use of brown cotton called “coyochi.” Her work has won a number of awards including 2nd place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1987, 1st place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1991 and Premio Nacional de Artesanias de SECOFI in 1993.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Juan Rayón Salinas, whose parents were craftsmen, is from Mexico State. He began working with textiles in 1970, and in 1971 the state government began work to open a Centro de Capacitación de Tapiz y de Bajo Liso to introduce European techniques for making rugs. Traditionally Rayón’s hometown of [[Xonacatlán]] made wool sarapes, but he entered the center specializing in throw rugs. He work was recognized and he began to participate in exhibitions in Mexico and abroad. After working for a time with the Centro, he established his own independent workshop. His work can be seen in various cities in Mexico as well as in New York. Also from Xonacatlán, Reyna Rayón Salinas is known for her cloth belts and embroidery, which she has been making since she was 12.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;
[[File:TzotzilDressMAPDF.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Garb from the Nahua community of Cuetzalan, Puebla, on display at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
Cosme Flores is from the [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|city of Tlaxcala]], son and grandson of weavers who made wool rugs. He began weaving when he was 11 along with working in agriculture. His work has won various prizes such as first place in the Concurso Estatal de Artesanias Tlaxcaltecas in 1993 and 1994. His work is also featured in a permanent exhibition at the Museo de Artes y Tradiciones Populares de Tlaxcala.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Justina Oviedo Rangel is of the [[Huave people|Huave ethnic group]] in Oaxaca. She began weaving when she was eight on her own while playing. When her mother saw her ability, she began to give her formal lessons. She specializes in napkins, placeholders and tablecloths, but also makes huipils. She also makes figures of clay. Her work has won awards such as the Concurso de Tejido de San Mateo del Mar in 1978 and various times since then until 1989.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Evaristo Borboa was born in Tenancingo, Mexico State, where the making of rebozos is a tradition. He began weaving when he was 12, making rebozos using a backstrap loom, rather than the European loom. This means that each of his rebozos are made individually rather 26-30 at a time, which is possible with larger looms. He is also known for his knotted or “ikat” technique as well as the jasper style. Interested in older styles of rebozos, he began in experiment in 1947 with these older designs. In the 1960s, upon visiting the Virgin of [[Zapopan]], he noticed that the image was wrapped only in a simple shawl. He offered to make the image new rebozo, something he has done every year since. Recognition has come late in Borboa's life winning awards from FONART and state agencies starting in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;
[[File:Zinacantán - Tissage traditionnel.JPG|thumb|Woman weaving on backstrap loom in Chiapas]]
Handcrafted textiles have also been promoted as a tourist attraction in its own right. This is especially true in the state of Chiapas.&lt;ref name="piratechina"&gt;{{cite news |title= Peligra artesanía por piratería china |url= http://www.terra.com.mx/Turismo/articulo/175211/ |agency=Notimex |newspaper=Terra |location=Mexico |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Chinese pirated items putting crafts in danger }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican handcrafted textiles have experienced a resurgence of interest due to the reassessment of them as a luxury item and the rising interest in some consumer sectors in locally crafted wares. Many of these textiles are being incorporated into items sold by globally recognized brands.&lt;ref name="cnnexpan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Industria del lujo revalora la artesanía |author=Marco A. Hernández |url= http://www.cnnexpansion.com/estilo/2010/04/16/artesania-glocal |newspaper=CNN Expansión |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Luxury industry revalues crafts }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Vuitton]], who has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, sponsored an exhibition called “Historias de Tradición artesanal” (Stories of Artisan Tradition) at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="cnnexpan"/&gt;

However, handcrafted textiles not only compete with other types of imported textiles, but also countries like China and [[Guatemala]] are producing imitations of traditional Mexican indigenous designs. These can be found both inside and outside of Mexico. The Asociacion de Mujeres Empresarias in Chiapas considers the imitations to be a form of trademark infringement and puts native weavers livelihoods at risk. Organizations such as this work to have indigenous designs marked as intangible world heritage to protect it with markers for authenticity—much as is done for [[tequila]] or [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]].&lt;ref name="piratechina"/&gt;

==Current textile industry==

===Current importance of the sector===
Modern textile production in Mexico dates back to the era of Porfirio Díaz from the 1880s to 1910.&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;  Today, textile production plays an important role in the [[gross domestic product]] of Mexico, since it is exported and generates employment. Textile production includes the making of thread, cloth and decoration, in both natural and synthetic fibers. It accounts for about 1.2% of the total GDP and 7.1% of the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economia.gob.mx/?P=1326 |title= Programa para la competitividad de la cadena de fribra textile-vestido |author= Oscar Escalera Antezana  |publisher= Ministry of the Economy of Mexico |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Program for the competitiveness of the fiber textile clothing chain |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth largest manufacturing activity in the country.&lt;ref name="dragon"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wharton.universia.net/index.cfm?fa=viewfeature&amp;id=911&amp;language=english |title= The Chinese Dragon Threatens Mexico’s Textile Industry |date= Feb 9, 2005  |publisher=Wharton School de la Universidad de Pennsylvania y Universia.  |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the Mexican Revolution to the mid-2000s, the sector saw steady growth. Much of the growth in the last four decades was spearheaded by “maquiladoras” or manufacturing plants along the northern border, which can import raw materials duty-free to make exportable products.&lt;ref name="meltdown"&gt;{{cite news |title= Maquila meltdown |author=BILL MONGELLUZZO |newspaper=Journal of Commerce |location=New York |date=April 14, 2003 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important textile area is the state of [[Guanajuato]], which is Mexico’s third largest producer. Some of these products include clothing, thread and sewing fabric, sheets, tablecloths, decorative pillows, rugs, carpets and tarps. Clothing items include jeans, other pants, blouses, [[tshirts]], sweaters, vests, jackets, skirts and others, for national and international brands such as [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]], Chipieco, Carhartt, Echojeans, Polo Ralph Lauren, JCPenney, Old Navy, Timberland and more.&lt;ref name="irapuato"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irapuato.gob.mx/Negocios/negociostextil.php |title=Industria Textil |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Irapuato |location=Irapuato, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Textile Industry |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the mid-2000s, the sector began to decline, mostly due to foreign competition. A significant number of jobs have been lost since 2003 as well as a number of factories. Many of these operations and jobs are shifting to Asia.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt;

===Exports to the United States===
The U.S. is the largest textile importer and almost all textile producing countries compete for a share of this market. Mexico ranks fourth in textile exports to the U.S. according to OTEXA.&lt;ref name="irapuato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="costosos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Resultan costosos textiles mexicanos |author=Myriam Garcia |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=August 9, 2005 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican textiles turn out to be costly }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico’s advantages in this market is it proximity and favorable tariffs, especially since the passage of NAFTA. In 2004, all restrictions and quotas on Mexican textiles were lifted in the United States.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

However, textile exports to the U.S. fell from more than 11 billion dollars in 2004 to just over 10 billion in 2005,&lt;ref name="demandachina"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico demandara a China por practicas ilegales; [Source: El Universal]|author=Guadalupe Hernandez Espinosa |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location=Miami |date=June 17, 2005 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexico sues China for illegal practices }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the U.S. imports more from other countries, who produce more cheaply.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;

From January through September 2004, U.S. imports of Mexican-made apparel reached $5.069 billion, 4.3% below the total registered for the same period in 2003, according to the CNIV, Mexico’s textile industry association. Meanwhile, U.S. imports of Chinese garments grew 21.7% during that period to reach $6.69 billion Yet Mexican-made products began to lose their competitiveness in the U.S. because taxes and tariffs on imports from other countries were also dropping.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

===Non-U.S. markets===
While the U.S. is by far the major market for Mexican textiles, Mexico has free-trade pacts with 43 countries, one of the largest such networks in the world. Until very recently, this did not include China, which has been seen as an “enemy” rather than as a potential trading partner. There has been changes in this as Mexico seeks to expand business ties with China, especially in attracting capital.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt; In the Americas, Mexico is part of the Central America Tree Trade Agreement,&lt;ref name="schwab"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Schwab Signs Textile Customs Cooperation Agreement with Mexico Office of the United States Trade Representative |publisher=U.S. Trade Representative |year=2007 |url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/archives/2007/january/schwab-signs-textile-customs-cooperation- |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014442/http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/archives/2007/january/schwab-signs-textile-customs-cooperation-# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently Mexico and Peru struck a deal for the import and export of clothing and other textiles.&lt;ref name="aztec21"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://azteca21.com/n/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11582:considerable-potencial-de-comercio-entre-sectores-textil-y-vestido-de-mexico-y-peru-intermoda&amp;catid=5&amp;Itemid=356|title= Considerable potencial de comercio entre sectores textil y vestido de México y Perú: INTERMODA |date=December 2009 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Considerable business potential between the textile and clothing sectors of Mexico and Peru:Intermoda |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico’s textile exports to Canada increased fivefold by the mid-2000s, raising its market share in that country to five percent. Export growth to Canada has slowed since then but remains fairly strong.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2005022-eng.htm |title= Stretching or Shrinking? The Textile and Clothing Industries in Canada |author= Diana Wyman |publisher= International Trade Division Statistics Canada |location=Canada |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic clothing market===
Nine major chain stores control 40% of the brick-and-mortar sales, but approximately 58% of the domestic clothing market obtains its goods through illegal channels, either through smuggling, robbery or the evasion of taxes.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt; Much of the illegal Chinese textiles sold in Mexico enter through the United States, where labels are changed to avoid Mexico's 533% tariff on Chinese goods.&lt;ref name="demandachina"/&gt;

===Mexico’s international competitors===

In addition to those from China, Mexican textile exports face competition from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt; Vietnam, Hong Kong and Central America.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="costosos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vietrival"&gt;{{cite news |title= Vietnam se convierte en rival textil para México |author= Manuel Lombera Martínez |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/finanzas/54833.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Vietnam becomes a textile rival for Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Mexican textiles held around 12% of the U.S. market while Indian textiles 3.84%. Other Asian countries with presence include Hong Kong (5.7%), Indonesia (5.3), Vietnam and Bangladesh (5% each) .&lt;ref name="indiaolvera"&gt;{{cite news |title= Supera India en textiles a Mexico |author=Silvia Olvera |author2=Alberto Barrientos |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=March 17, 2006 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=India surpasses Mexico in textiles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the reason for this is that labor costs are significantly higher in Mexico than in Asia. Mexico also has regulations that inhibit investment, as well as stricter environmental laws.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;  Mexican fabrics cost 3.45 dollars per square meter while Chinese textiles cost 2.69 dollars. While the cost of Mexican fabric has increased 2%, those from a number of other countries in Asia and Central America have gone down. One major factor behind this is Mexico’s relatively expensive labor costs.&lt;ref name="costosos"/&gt; Another reason Asian products are cheaper is that utilities such electricity, gas and transport is cheaper.&lt;ref name="vietrival"/&gt;

China is Mexico’s most important competitor. Not only are products from this country cheaper, the supply chain in China is more organized than in Mexico. For example, most threads used to sew clothing are produced in China; Mexico produces little, creating the need to import such. This can cause production delays. Mexico is also mostly limited to the making of basic items with little added value instead of more fashionable products that sell for more. In addition, Mexico also has protectionist policies designed to inhibit foreign investment and ownership of textile production facilities in the country.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

One example of this is the [[maquiladora]] industries. Prior to the 2000s, maquiladoras owned by Asian concerns who imported materials from Asia to make products for the U.S. enjoyed the same tax advantages as those who used Mexican suppliers. However, this was changed during the beginning of the 21st century. This caused many Asian maquiladoras to close and move to Asia as the tax advantages no longer compensated for higher labor costs.&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt;

Mexico has also complained to the [[World Trade Organization]] that China has been engaging in “illegal practices” such as “dumping” (selling abroad at a price lower than local markets) to the detriment of the Mexican industry. Mexico claims that the Chinese government subsidizes textiles sales abroad to gain market share.&lt;ref name="demandachina"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' has published an article in which he says, "''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang’s All Here]]'' seems like an ingeniously designed vintage pinball machine: a triumph of mechanical engineering, not electronics." And continues: "the production was the apotheosis of Miranda’s career at Fox, and the other four films in the set follow its decline. [[Walter Lang]]'s 1944 ''[[Greenwich Village (film)|Greenwich Village]]'', with [[Don Ameche]] and [[Vivian Blaine]], and [[Lewis Seiler]]'s barely recognizable version of the [[Cole Porter]] musical ''[[Something for the Boys (film)|Something for the Boys]]'' (1944), with Ms. Blaine and [[Phil Silvers]], both have glorious Technicolor and decent production values," according to the critic, but in ''[[Doll Face]]'' and ''[[If I'm Lucky (film)|If I'm Lucky]]'', Miranda had been reduced to supporting roles. "In the new realism that dominated postwar cinema, which stories could accommodate a character as utterly unreal as the Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat?," question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/movies/homevideo/17dvds.html|title=New DVDs: The Carmen Miranda Collection |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 17, 2008|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||ゼルダの伝説 スカイウォードソード|Zeruda no Densetsu: Sukaiwōdo Sōdo|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[Wii]] [[Home video game console|home console]], developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. The sixteenth mainline entry in [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]], it was released worldwide in November 2011. The game was made available worldwide on the [[List of Wii games on Wii U eShop|Wii U eShop]] in September 2016. Taking the role of series protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], players navigate the floating island of Skyloft and the land below it, completing quests that advance the story and solving environmental and dungeon-based puzzles. Gameplay mechanics and combat, the latter focusing on attacking and blocking with sword and shield, are reliant on the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion device.

''Skyward Sword'' is the first game in the [[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|''Zelda'' continuity]], detailing the origins of the Master Sword, a recurring weapon within the series. Link, resident of a floating town called Skyloft, heads on a quest to rescue his childhood friend [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]] after she is kidnapped and brought to the Surface, an abandoned land below the clouds. Armed with the Goddess Sword and aided by a spirit named Fi, Link must ensure Zelda's safety and stop Ghirahim as he attempts to resurrect his master, Demise.

Development lasted around five years, beginning after the release of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'' in 2006. Multiple earlier ''Zelda'' games influenced the developers, including ''Twilight Princess'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''. Many aspects of the game's overworld and gameplay were designed to streamline and populate the experience for players. The art style was influenced by the work of impressionist painters including [[Paul Cézanne]]. The implementation of Wii MotionPlus proved problematic for the developers, to the point where it was nearly discarded. It was the first ''Zelda'' game to use a live orchestra for the majority of its tracks, with music composed by a team led by Hajime Wakai and supervised by [[Koji Kondo]].

First revealed in 2009, it was initially planned for release in 2010 before being delayed to 2011 to further refine and expand it. The game was a critical and commercial success, receiving perfect scores from multiple journalistic sites, winning and receiving nominations for numerous industry and journalist awards, and selling over three million copies worldwide. Despite the accolades it received, points of widespread criticism directed toward certain aspects of the game's design proved to be a key influence in the development of the next entry for home consoles, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:LoZ Skyward Sword gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Link flies on his Loftwing bird through the sky. The game's visuals were inspired by [[Impressionism|impressionist]] artists such as [[Paul Cézanne]], while its controls were tailored exclusively for the [[Wii MotionPlus]].&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardArtstyle"/&gt;]]
''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game in which players take on the role of series protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] through a series of monster-populated overworlds and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and bosses.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt; Link is controlled using the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], and the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuk and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuk is also used to make Link perform a forward roll.&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt; Link can sprint for short distances, but sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGVpreview"/&gt; Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt;

Fighting enemies, which appear in both the overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpreview"/&gt; Link's sword movements are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements.&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGVpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpreview"/&gt; By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches.&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPpreview1"/&gt; The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, it can be used to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck.&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt; Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGpreview"/&gt;

The game takes place on the floating island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands; the three Surface overworlds where the majority of the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals in the clouds. Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available, and are sometimes mandatory for completing the main quest. Skyloft is navigated with a bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPpreview1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGpreview"/&gt; During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, who is able to give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an enemy is targeted and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt;

Traditional series items such as Bombs and the Bow and Arrow appear, along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle that flies to areas beyond Link's reach and a whip for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and activating levers.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGVpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpreview"/&gt; Link's shield takes damage when blocking attacks fail, and may eventually break. Items and equipment can be upgraded, making them stronger and more durable. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardUpgrade"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Skyward Sword'' takes place at the beginning of the [[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|''Zelda'' continuity]]:&lt;ref name="ONMtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HyruleHistoria"/&gt; according to legend, three ancient Goddesses bestowed a great wish-granting power: the Triforce. The Demon King Demise sought the Triforce, and laid waste to much of the land in his quest for it. The Goddess Hylia gathered the survivors and sent them into the sky, allowing her to launch a full-scale offensive against Demise. She was victorious, but the land was severely damaged. Uncounted years later, the outcrop is known as Skyloft, and its people believe the "Surface" below the clouds is a myth.&lt;ref name="HyruleHistoria"/&gt;&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Fi''': This is a tale you humans have passed down through uncounted generations... It tells of a war of unmatched scale and ferocity, the likes of which would never be seen again. One dark, fateful day, the earth cracked wide and malevolent forces rushed forth from the fissure. They mounted a brutal assault upon the surface people, driving the land into deep despair... They burnt forest to ash, choked the land’s sweet springs, and murdered without hesitation. They did all this in their lust to take the ultimate power protected by Her Grace, the goddess. The power she guarded was without equal. Handed down by gods of old, this power gave its holder the means to make any desire a reality. Such was the might of the ultimate power that the old ones placed it in the care of the goddess. To prevent this great power from falling into the hands of the evil swarming the lands... The goddess gathered the surviving humans on a outcropping of earth. She sent it skyward, beyond the reach of the demonic hordes. Beyond even the clouds. With the humans safe, the goddess joined forces with the land dwellers and fought the evil forces, sealing them away. At last, peace was restored to the surface. This is a tale that you humans have told for many ages, generation to generation...  But there are other legends, long hidden away from memory, that are intertwined with this tale. Now, a new legend bound to this great story stands ready to be revealed. A legend that will be forged by your own hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present, knight-in-training Link passes his final exam despite the attempted interference of his class rival Groose, who considers himself a romantic rival for Link's childhood friend [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]]. After passing the exam and on a celebratory flight together, Zelda is whisked away below the clouds by a dark tornado. After recovering back on Skyloft, Link is led to the island's statue of Hylia by Fi, the spirit of the Goddess Sword residing within the statue. Link draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise. Opening a way to the Surface, Link is guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple, where he meets an old woman who tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. Link is also confronted by Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise. At the Temple of Time in the Lanayru Desert, Link defends Zelda and Impa from Ghirahim, giving the two time to depart through a Time Gate into the past which Impa destroys as they pass through.

Returning to the Temple of Hylia, Link is followed by Groose and the two end up on the Surface together. Link then has to defeat the Imprisoned, a monstrous form of Demise attempting to reach the Sealed Temple, after the old woman shows him a second dormant Time Gate. With the Imprisoned defeated, Link sets out to strengthen the Goddess Sword by passing trials set by the ancient Goddesses and using their gifts to find Sacred Flames to purify and strengthen the blade so the Time Gate can be awakened. Returning to find the Imprisoned attempting to break free, Link reseals it with help from Groose. Activating the Time Gate and traveling to the past, he finds Zelda and learns that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia: Hylia could not kill Demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again, so she created the Goddess Sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using the Triforce to wish Demise's destruction, as only mortals can use the artifact. Zelda then seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen Demise's seal, granting her power to the Goddess Sword and upgrading it into the Master Sword.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Zelda''': The old gods created a supreme power that gave anyone who possessed it the ability to shape reality and fulfill any desire. They called it: The Triforce. In his thirst to make the world his own, Demise readied a massive army of monsters for war. He sought to take the Triforce for himself by force. [...] After a long and fierce battle, the goddess, Hylia, succeeded in sealing away Demise. However, soon after the demon king was imprisoned, it became clear that the seal would not hold long against his fearsome power. Hylia had suffered grave injuries in her battle with the demon king. She knew that if he broke free again, there would be no stopping him. And if the demon king were to free himself, it would mean the end of the world for all beings of this land. In order to put an end to the demon king, Hylia devised two separate plans and set them both into motion. First, she created Fi. She made the spirit that resides in your sword to serve a single purpose: to assist her chosen hero on his mission. Her second plan... was to abandon her divine form and transfer her soul to the body of a mortal. ...She made this sacrifice, as you have likey guessed, so that the supreme power created by the old gods could one day be used. For while the supreme power of the Triforce was created by the gods, all of its power can never be wielded by one. Knowing this power was her last and only hope, the goddess gave up her divine powers and her immortal form.  You've probably figured it out by now, haven't you, Link? You are the chosen hero, and I, Zelda... I am the goddess reborn as a mortal. We must stop [Demise] from freeing himself from the seal that imprisons him. At any cost... That is why I intend to remain here in this time and place... To sustain the seal as best as I can. As long as I continue this vigil, we may be able to prevent the demon king from fully reviving himself in our own time.&lt;/ref&gt;

Link locates the Triforce on Skyloft and uses it to destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim intends to use Zelda as a sacrifice to resurrect him in the past.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Ghirahim''': My master may have perished in this age, but in the past he lives yet! I'm taking the girl back through that gate to help me revive the demon king!&lt;/ref&gt; Link pursues Ghirahim into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who turns out to be the spirit of Demise's sword, but is unable to prevent Zelda from being used to reincarnate Demise's humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise: Link triumphs and absorbs Demise's essence into the sword, but Demise curses Link and Zelda's descendants to be haunted by his [[Ganon|reincarnated rage]].&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Demise''': Extraordinary. You stand as a paragon of your kind, human. You fight like no man or demon I have ever known. Though this is not the end. My hate... never perishes. It is born anew in a cycle with no end! I will rise again! Those like you... Those who share the blood of the goddess and the spirit of the hero... They are eternally bound to this curse. An incarnation of my hatred shall ever follow your kind, dooming them to wander a blood-soaked sea of darkness for all time!&lt;/ref&gt; To complete the sword's seal, Link drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result. Groose, Link and Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the Time Gate, as she is a person of that time period and must watch over the Master Sword.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Impa''': Zelda, Your Grace, you possess the memories of the goddess. You must understand why that is not possible. I am a being of this age. My place is here. / '''Zelda''': I... I know that, but... / '''Impa''': You must return to your own time. I will take care of the gate once you have passed through. / '''Zelda''': I... can't do that. You and I have been through so much together. I don't want to leave you alone. Please, Impa. Come back with us. / '''Impa''': Zelda, at the command of the goddess, I passed through the Gate of Time, I did so to protect you and aid the fight to prevent the world's destruction. The last remnants of Demise are decaying slowly within the sword. Someone must stay behind to watch over this blade. His spirit must not reawaken. He must never be allowed to threaten the world again.&lt;/ref&gt; In the present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that she was Impa. The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to watch over the Triforce: she and Link together establish the [[The Legend of Zelda#Setting|kingdom of Hyrule]].&lt;ref name="HyruleHistoria"/&gt;&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Zelda''': Look around us! As a child, I always dreamed of a world below. I wanted to see the surface with my own eyes and feel the land’s warm breeze on my skin. I... I think I want to live here. I always want to feel solid ground beneath my feet, see the clouds above my head, and watch over the Triforce. What about you, Link? What will you do now?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and release===
[[File:Eiji Aonuma.jpg|thumb|''Skyward Sword'' producer [[Eiji Aonuma]] at the 2007 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]
''Skyward Sword'' began development in 2006, after the release of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'' for [[GameCube]] and Wii. It was developed by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development]], a development division of series publisher [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt; They were assisted in development by the Kyoto branch of [[Monolith Soft]].&lt;ref name="MonolithGames"/&gt; Its producer was [[Eiji Aonuma]], a major contributor to the ''Legend of Zelda'' series. His main preoccupation during these early stages was whether the developers could continue creating ''The Legend of Zelda'' games using the same development mindset that had been used up to ''Twilight Princess''.&lt;ref name="IGNbehind"/&gt; The game's director was [[Hidemaro Fujibayashi]]: previously working as assistant director on ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], ''Skyward Sword'' was his first project for home consoles. He began work on ''Skyward Sword'' after finishing ''Phantom Hourglass'', and continued working on the game alongside his work on ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks]]''. When ''Spirit Tracks'' was finished, Fujibayashi and the game's development team transferred back to working on ''Skyward Sword''.&lt;ref name="IGNbehind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN2010"/&gt;

According to Aonuma, the team's starting point for development was the Wii version of ''Twilight Princess'': feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with ''Twilight Princess'', they used their previous work as a foundation for the next game. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', by that time considered the series' most memorable game.&lt;ref name="SkywardTwilight"/&gt; Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardBudget"/&gt; The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation.&lt;ref name="1UPtwists"/&gt; By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.&lt;ref name="SkywardComplete"/&gt;

A new ''Zelda'' game was first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto stated that the ''Zelda'' development team were reforming to create new games.&lt;ref name="SkywardHints"/&gt; Miyamoto later confirmed at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) that a new ''Zelda'' was in development for the Wii.&lt;ref name="SkywardConfirm"/&gt; The game was unveiled at E3 2009, although its title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, along with its planned 2010 release window.&lt;ref name="SkywardReveal"/&gt; In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's playability brought this release window into doubt. He also noted that his wish to focus on the new game meant that the release date of ''Spirit Tracks'' was shifted to the end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010.&lt;ref name="AndriaAonumaE3"/&gt; The game's title was announced at the event, along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration.&lt;ref name="SkywardOfficial"/&gt; According to Miyamoto, the game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as the staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product if they put the convenience of the company ahead of creating a quality experience. They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish up the game as a whole.&lt;ref name="SkywardDelayReason"/&gt;

Multiple promotional elements were created: a five-part online comic was written and illustrated by [[Jerry Holkins]] and [[Mike Krahulik]] under their ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)#Penny Arcade Presents|Penny Arcade Presents]]'' series, and television commercials featuring actor and comedian [[Robin Williams]] and his daughter [[Zelda Williams|Zelda]] were made, playing on the actor's stated love for the series.&lt;ref name="KotakuComic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesWilliams"/&gt; ''Skyward Sword'' released in all regions in November 2011: it released in Europe on November 18, North America on November 20, Japan on November 23, and Australia on November 24.&lt;ref name="SkywardEU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardUS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardJP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardAU"/&gt; The game was released as both a standard edition and a limited deluxe edition that included a gold Wii Remote Plus. An anniversary CD was included with both editions containing orchestrated versions of various iconic musical pieces from the series.&lt;ref name="SkywardEditions"/&gt; Following its release, a glitch was discovered that corrupted save files if three late-game events were taken in a certain order. Once revealed, Nintendo issued instructions on avoiding it and set up a special channel on their Wii site in Japan to gain feedback, along with offering to manually repair corrupted save files.&lt;ref name="EuroBug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaBug"/&gt;

===Scenario===
The script for cinematic scenes was written by Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on at the same time as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt; As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin story for the weapon.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt; An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt; The early part of the story was quite different from earlier ''Zelda'' games, playing out in a similar way to a school drama.&lt;ref name="1UPAonumaE3"/&gt; Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt;

The relationship between Link and Zelda was quite different from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was not royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface.&lt;ref name="1UPpostmortem"/&gt; Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]]-style gag, it was cut down to two during development.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt; The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation during the course of the story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt;

Fi was created before the implantation of Wii MotionPlus, when she was going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design was based on the design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit.  She also served as an alternate explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist.&lt;ref name="1UPpostmortem"/&gt; According to staff, Fi's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda3"/&gt; Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi.&lt;ref name="1UPpostmortem"/&gt; Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from ''Ocarina of Time'': he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link's sword around randomly.&lt;ref name="1UPAonumaE3"/&gt; Character designs were far more detailed than in previous ''Zelda'' games. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda7"/&gt; The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by [[Impressionism|impressionist]] artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as [[Claude Monet]]: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to [[Paul Cézanne]]'s work. The basic starting point for the art style was that it was a fantasy world.&lt;ref name="SkywardArtstyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianInterview"/&gt; The final version was referred to as a balance between the cartoon styling of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' and ''Twilight Princess'', where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link. The team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link's mature appearance.&lt;ref name="IGN2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPart"/&gt;

===Design===
[[File:Wiimote-with-Motionplus-Attach.jpg|thumb|left|Despite early difficulties implementing it, the gameplay of ''Skyward Sword'' made extensive use of the [[Wii MotionPlus]], resulting in multiple design elements revolving around its use.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN2010"/&gt;]]
During development, the team faced a lot of problems when designing the game so it would be both familiar for series fans and fresh to old and new players. The pieces of gameplay experimentation meant that the development was "a more fundamental ground-up process" than earlier games such as ''The Wind Waker''. Their earlier games had involved lifting elements from earlier games and pasting them into a new entry, but for ''Skyward Sword'' the developers wanted to add a new play structure to avoid fans seeing it as more of the same.&lt;ref name="1UPtwists"/&gt; The original concept for gameplay using the Wii MotionPlus was proposed by Fujibayashi at a point when the team were already developing the gameplay around the console's standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk control scheme. When first proposed, Aonuma was highly enthusiastic, and his wish to change to Wii MotionPlus meant that work on the game needed to begin all over again.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt; The use of Wii MotionPlus proved challenging for the developers to implement, to the point where at one point Aonuma seriously considered dropping it from the game entirely. After the release of ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'', the team saw how motion controls could be used for swordplay: after talking with the development team, they were able to borrow the technology and used it to create the motion-driven swordplay.&lt;ref name="IGN2010"/&gt; The implementation of Wii MotionPlus meant that the enemy [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] needed to be able to counter it, adjusting their stances depending on the position of Link's sword.&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt;

When creating Link's sword movements, the team initially wanted them to be as realistic as possible, but because it was detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt; The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous games. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda2"/&gt; Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda7"/&gt; The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control.&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt; The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt; At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage.&lt;ref name="1UPAonumaE3"/&gt; When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers.&lt;ref name="1UPpostmortem"/&gt; The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt;

In past ''Zelda'' games, the team had made numerous new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players would be able to full appreciate them through repeated visits.&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IwataZelda2"/&gt; The team also created the world based on their experiences with ''Twilight Princess'': feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles.&lt;ref name="IGNbehind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt; The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda5"/&gt; The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'', with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative.&lt;ref name="1UPAonumaE3"/&gt; Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt;

Each Surface overworld had a specific theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around changing the rules of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda4"/&gt; The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda2"/&gt; While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda3"/&gt; For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Twilight Princess''. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda4"/&gt; Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda3"/&gt; The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies that could not be defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in ''Phantom Hourglass'' and ''Spirit Tracks'', but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with.&lt;ref name="NinPowerInter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IwataZelda3"/&gt; They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.&lt;ref name="1UPpostmortem"/&gt;

===Audio===
The game's sound team consisted of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, with the other composers being [[Shiho Fujii]], [[Mahito Yokota]], and Takeshi Hama.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSVkondo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NinFujii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GShama"/&gt; Longtime series composer [[Koji Kondo]] had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia.&lt;ref name="IGNbehind"/&gt; He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a [[Macintosh|Mac computer]].&lt;ref name="OSVkondo"/&gt; Fujii was responsible for the music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among her work was the music for Skyloft. She used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments.&lt;ref name="NinFujii"/&gt; A first for the ''Zelda'' series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in ''Twilight Princess'', which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially did not think of using an orchestra, and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai asked him about it. An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt;

Using the orchestra enabled a greater expression of emotion, which meant that they used it when creating scores for environments, cinematic scenes, and emotional moments within the story. Conversely, the team were given less freedom to adjust tracks as they had been able to with synthesized tracks. Something new they did for ''Skyward Sword'' was producing unique themes for specific characters such as Link and Zelda. They also added people singing songs, another element new to the series. One notable element was the game's main theme "Ballad of the Goddess", which was actually a reversed version of the recurring tune "Zelda's Lullaby".&lt;ref name="IGNbehind"/&gt; Due to the use of an orchestra and the sheer amount of extra work going into the sound design, the music team doubled in size from the standard five-person group, and became the largest sound team at the time to have worked on a Nintendo game.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt; The positive reception of the orchestral score within the company led to the creation of '' The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert'', a celebratory concert featuring orchestrated versions of classic ''Zelda'' themes.&lt;ref name="IwataZelda6"/&gt; Music was also woven into the story and gameplay through the use of the harp Link receives, using a recurring theme within the series of music being a central part of the experience. In contrast to previous games, the instrument could be played at any time rather than at specific times and places.&lt;ref name="IGNbehind"/&gt;

''Skyward Sword'' received acclaim from multiple journalistic magazines and websites upon release; it received a score of 93/100 on aggregate site [[Metacritic]] based on 81 reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaScore"/&gt; It was the site's 10th highest scoring game of 2011,&lt;ref name="MetaBestOverall"/&gt; and also ranked as the 6th best-reviewed Wii game of all time.&lt;ref name="MetaBestWii"/&gt; It received perfect scores from multiple publications:&lt;ref name="MetaScore"/&gt; these included ''[[Famitsu]]'',&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; [[IGN]],&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]],&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'',&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Magazine]]''&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"/&gt; and ''VideoGamer.com''.&lt;ref name="VGreview"/&gt; In the case of ''Famitsu'', ''Skyward Sword'' was the third ''Zelda'' game and sixteenth video game in the magazine's history to be given a perfect score at that time.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt;

''Famitsu'' was highly positive, praising the overworld and gameplay: one reviewer felt that it would form the new standard for both the ''Zelda'' series and video games as a whole.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; ''Edge'' was highly positive about all aspects of the game aside from the player-driven upgrade system, and even then it was not enough to spoil the experience for the reviewer.&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"/&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' gave it similar praise, saying that "it's truly worthy of being called 'epic'".&lt;ref name="NPreview"/&gt; Ray Carsillo of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' appreciated the game's nostalgic value, but found the motion control difficult to handle and kept the game from being truly great.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; Jose Otero, writing for [[1UP.com]], praised the developers for putting effort into moving away from ''Zelda'' tradition and called it one of the better games in the series, but said that those detrimental elements that remained such as side quests and some item usage made ''Skyward Sword'' "a weird middle ground filled with genuine surprises, inessential carry-overs, and copy/paste quest structures".&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s Tom McShea was notably less positive than other critics, praising the storyline, dungeons, enemies and visuals while faulting the controls for being unreliable and feeling that most of the experience felt both unnecessary and overly familiar.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; [[Destructoid]]'s Jonathan Holmes called ''Skyward Sword'' his new favorite 3D game from the series, but noted that its exclusive use of motion controls would put off potential players.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; Oli Welsh of Eurogamer was highly positive, praising the controls, gameplay experience and additional elements such as upgrades: he gave particular praise to the game's visuals, which were impressive despite hardware limitations.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; ''Game Informer''{{'}}s Phil Kollar echoed both general praise of the gameplay and presentation, and minor issues experienced with the motion controls: he concluded by saying that Nintendo had fulfilled its initial promises for the Wii with ''Skyward Sword''.&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]]'s Carolyn Gudmundson called it "perfectly balanced mix of innovation and classic Zelda gameplay" despite minor control issues.&lt;ref name="GRreview"/&gt;

[[GameTrailers]] noted that, despite its many strengths such as a believable relationship between Link and Zelda, ''Skyward Sword'' represented the series' "first gray hairs" due to some of its mechanics feeling dated in the modern gaming landscape.&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt; IGN's Richard George felt that the game returned ''The Legend of Zelda'' to being a revolutionary series in the gaming industry, praising almost every aspect of the game with the exception of the soundtrack, which he felt did not live up to series standards despite its quality.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; [[Joystiq]] writer Griffin McElroy noted that a lot of the game's content seemed unnecessary and extravagant, but said that beneath this surface lay "the best ''Zelda'' game of all time".&lt;ref name="JoystiqReview"/&gt; Steve Hogarty of ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' shared many points of praise with other positive journalist reviews, calling it the greatest game in the series to date.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt; ''VideoGamer.com''{{'s}} Chris Schilling called it one of the best ''Zelda'' games, praising its motion controls, narrative and treatment of series tradition.&lt;ref name="VGreview"/&gt;

===Awards===
Following its release, ''Skyward Sword'' won numerous awards. At IGN's "Best of 2011" awards, it was awarded "Best Game",&lt;ref name="IGNawardWiiOverall"/&gt; "Best Graphics",&lt;ref name="IGNawardWiiGraphics"/&gt; "Best Sound"&lt;ref name="IGNawardWiiSound"/&gt; and "Best Story"&lt;ref name="IGNawardWiiStory"/&gt; in the Wii category. It was also given the "Reader's Choice" award in the "Best Overall Game" category: it was also among those nominated as the site's "[[Game of the Year]]".&lt;ref name="IGNawardWiiChoice"/&gt; In [[Digital Trends]]' similar awards, it was named as "Best Action-Adventure" and "Best Wii Exclusive", and was nominated for the site's "Game of the Year" award.&lt;ref name="DTaward"/&gt; RPGamer's own "Best of 2011" awards named ''Skyward Sword'' "Best Console and PC Game" and awarded it for "Best Music".&lt;ref name="SkywardRPGconsole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardRPGmusic"/&gt; It also received "Game of the Year" awards from ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'', GameSpot, ''Edge'' and ''Nintendo Power''.&lt;ref name="EdgeAward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGMawards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEpowerAward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gspot_awards"/&gt; It received "Excellence" and "Most Valuable Character" awards from ''Famitsu'', the latter being awarded for the protagonist Link.&lt;ref name="FamAward"/&gt; It received multiple nominations in 2012 at the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences|D.I.C.E. Awards]], [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] and the [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Games Awards]].&lt;ref name="SpikeAwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardDICE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardBafta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SkywardChoice"/&gt; At Spike, the game won awards for "Best Wii Game" and "Best Motion Game".&lt;ref name="SkywardSpikeWin"/&gt; ''Skyward Sword'' has since been ranked among the best games developed for the Wii.&lt;ref name="GItopWii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRtopWii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNwiiBest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGwiiBest"/&gt;

===Sales===
Upon its Japanese debut, ''Skyward Sword'' sold nearly 195,000 units, reaching the top of sales charts.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesJP"/&gt; Sales quickly declined, dropping out of the Top 20 within a few weeks. By the end of December, it had sold less than 320,000 units: this was below equivalent sales for other recent home console and portable ''Zelda'' games.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesGama"/&gt; The game's sales were strong overall going into January 2012, with its largest sales coming from North America.&lt;ref name="AndriaNinSales"/&gt; Its first month sales in North America came to around 600,000 units, nearly double its Japanese sales.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesGama"/&gt; In the UK, ''Skyward Sword'' was the seventh best-selling game of November in the multiformat charts, stated as impressive given the waning popularity of the platform.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesUK1"/&gt; It was also the region's top-selling Wii game during its week of release, supplanting the previous week's top seller ''[[Just Dance 3]]''.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesUK2"/&gt; It failed to reach the top-five best-selling Wii games for that year.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesUK3"/&gt; Its total worldwide first-week sales came to 919,119 units. According to Nintendo of America president [[Reggie Fils-Aime]], ''Skyward Sword'' was the fastest selling game in the series at that time.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesFirst"/&gt; As of December 2011, the game has sold 3.41 million units worldwide:  380,000 of these units were sold in Japan while 3.04 million units were sold overseas.&lt;ref name="SkywardSalesReport"/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Main|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild}}
When development started on the next home console ''Zelda'' game, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', the developers wanted to improve on what they had achieved with ''Skyward Sword'', along with creating a non-linear world based on player complaints about the linearity of ''Skyward Sword''.&lt;ref name="PolyBreath"/&gt; Aonuma and Fujibayashi both returned respectively as producer and director.&lt;ref name="IGNbreath"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SegmentBreath"/&gt; Aonuma's stated wish with ''Breath of the Wild'' was "to expand and make a better ''Skyward Sword''". In addition, Aonuma stated that it might be possible to create an HD remake of ''Skyward Sword'' for current hardware.&lt;ref name="IGNbreath"/&gt; The game was later re-released on the [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] for the [[Wii U]] on September 1, 2016: it was released as part of the series' 30th anniversary celebrations.&lt;ref name="SkywardWIIU"/&gt;

'''''The Report from Iron Mountain''''' is a book published in [[1967 in literature|1967]] (during the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]]) by [[Dial Press]] which puts itself forth as the report of a government panel. The book includes the claim it was authored by a Special Study Group of fifteen men whose identities were to remain secret and that it was not intended to be made public. It details the analyses of a government panel which concludes that war, or a credible substitute for war, is necessary if governments are to maintain power. The book was a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller and has been translated into fifteen languages.  Controversy still swirls over whether the book was a satiric hoax about think-tank logic and writing style or the product of a secret government panel. The document is a favorite among conspiracy theorists, who reject the statement made in 1972 by satirist [[Leonard Lewin]] that the book was a spoof and that he was its author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/oliver-stone-rewrites-history-again.html?src=dayp&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Oliver Stone Rewrites History|first1=Andrew|last1=Goldman|date=November 22, 2012|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The book was first published in 1967 by [[Dial Press]], and went out of print in 1980. [[E. L. Doctorow]], then an editor at Dial, and Dial president Richard Baron agreed with Lewin and [[Victor Saul Navasky|Victor Navasky]] to list the book as nonfiction and to turn aside questions about its authenticity by citing the footnotes.&lt;ref name="kifner"&gt;{{cite news|first1=John|last1=Kifner|title=L. C. Lewin, Writer of Satire Of Government Plot, Dies at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/30/us/l-c-lewin-writer-of-satire-of-government-plot-dies-at-82.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=January 30, 1999|page=A.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberty Lobby]] put out an edition c. 1990, claiming that it was a U.S. government document, and therefore inherently in the [[public domain]]; Lewin sued them for [[copyright infringement]], which resulted in a settlement. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Neither side would reveal the full terms of the settlement, but Lewin received more than a thousand copies of the bootlegged version."&lt;ref name="kifner"/&gt;

Likewise, an edition was brought out in 1993 by Buccaneer Books, a small publisher reprinting out of print political classics.  It is unclear whether this was authorized by the author.

In response to the bootleg editions, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] brought out a new hardcover edition in 1996 under their Free Press imprint, authorized by Lewin, with a new introduction by Navasky and afterword by Lewin both insisting the book was fictional and satire, and discussing the original controversy over the book and the more recent interest in it by [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]].

A new paperback edition was published in 2008.

== Contents ==
According to the report, a 15-member panel, called the Special Study Group, was set up in 1963 to examine what problems would occur if the United States entered a state of lasting peace. They met at an underground nuclear bunker called Iron Mountain (as well as other, worldwide locations) and worked over the next two years. A member of the panel, one "[[John Doe]]", a professor at a college in the Midwest, decided to release the report to the public.

The heavily footnoted report concluded that peace was not in the interest of a stable society, that even if lasting peace "could be achieved, it would almost certainly not be in the best interests of society to achieve it." War was a part of the economy. Therefore, it was necessary to conceive a state of war for a stable economy. The government, the group theorized, would not exist without war, and nation states existed in order to wage war. War served the vital function of diverting collective aggression. They recommended "credible substitutes" and paying a "blood price" to emulate the economic functions of war. Prospective government-devised alternatives to war included reports of alien life-forms, the reintroduction of a "euphemized form" of slavery "consistent with modern technology and political processes", and - one deemed particularly promising in gaining the attention of the malleable masses - the threat of "gross pollution of the environment".

==Reaction by Lyndon Johnson==
''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' claimed in its November 20, 1967 issue to have confirmation of the reality of the report from an unnamed government official, who added that when [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] read the report, he 'hit the roof' and ordered it to be suppressed for all time.  Additionally, sources were said to have revealed that orders were sent to U.S. embassies, instructing them to emphasize that the book had no relation to U.S. Government policy.&lt;ref&gt;'"Hoax of Horror? A Book That Shook White House", ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', November 20, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hoax or real? ==

When it was first published, controversy surrounded the book over the question whether it was a hoax or real. In an article in the March 19, 1972 edition of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Lewin said that he had written the book.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Lewin, [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_ironmountain12.htm "Report From Iron Mountain, 'The Guest Word'"], ''The New York Times Book Review'', March 19, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the "Most Successful Literary Hoax."  Some people claim that the book is genuine and has only been called a hoax as a means of damage control. ''Trans-Action'' devoted an issue to the debate over the book. [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine published a 28,000-word excerpt.&lt;ref name="kifner"/&gt;

In a remembrance of E. L. Doctorow published in 2015 in ''[[The Nation]]'', Victor Navasky asserted his involvement in creating ''Report from Iron Mountain'', naming Leonard Lewin as the main writer with "input" from economist John Kenneth Galbraith, two editors of the satirical magazine [[Monocle (satirical magazine)|''Monocle'']] ([[Marvin Kitman]] and Richard Lingeman) and himself. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=Navasky|last1=Navasky |first1=Victor |authorlink=Victor Navasky|last2= |first2= |year=2015 |title=E.L. Doctorow, 1931-2015|journal=[[The Nation]] |volume=301 |issue=7&amp;8 |pages=4 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/so-long-e-l-doctorow-its-been-good-to-know-yuh/|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purported statements made by John Kenneth Galbraith in support of authenticity===
On November 26, 1967, the report was reviewed in the book section of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' by [[Herschel McLandress]], supposedly the pen name for Harvard professor [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. McLandress wrote that he knew firsthand of the report's authenticity because he had been invited to participate in its creation; that although he was unable to be part of the official group, he was consulted from time to time and had been asked to keep the project secret; and that while he doubted the wisdom of letting the public know about the report, he agreed totally with its conclusions.

He wrote: "As I would put my personal repute behind the authenticity of this document, so would I testify to the validity of its conclusions.  My reservation relates only to the wisdom of releasing it to an obviously unconditioned public."&lt;ref&gt;"News of War and Peace You're Not Ready For", by [[Herschel McLandress]]. Book World, in ''The Washington Post'', November 26, 1967, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks later, in an [[Associated Press]] dispatch from London, Galbraith went even further and jokingly admitted that he was a member of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times Diary", ''[[The Times]]'', February 5, 1968, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, Galbraith backed off.  When asked about his 'conspiracy' statement, he replied: "For the first time since Charles II ''[[The Times]]'' has been guilty of a misquotation... Nothing shakes my conviction that it was written by either [[Dean Rusk]] or Mrs. [[Clare Boothe Luce]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Gailbraith Says He Was Misquoted", ''[[The Times]]'', February 6, 1968, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original reporter reported the following six days later: "Misquoting seems to be a hazard to which Professor Galbraith is prone.  The latest edition of the Cambridge newspaper Varsity quotes the following (tape recorded) interchange:
Interviewer: 'Are you aware of the identity of the author of Report from Iron Mountain?'
Galbraith: 'I was in general a member of the conspiracy, but I was not the author.  I have always assumed that it was the man who wrote the foreword – Mr. Lewin'."&lt;ref&gt;"Touche, Professor", ''[[The Times]]'', February 12, 1968, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas''''' is the sixth game in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six|Rainbow Six]]'' series of video games. It was released for the [[Xbox 360]] on November 21, 2006, and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] on December 12, 2006. The [[PlayStation Portable]] version was released on June 12, 2007, while the [[PlayStation 3]] version was released on June 26, 2007. The game's storyline follows a new team that is dispatched to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] to defeat international terrorist Irena Morales and her army of mercenaries that are repeatedly attacking key locations in the city.
A [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2|sequel]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] was released on Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 consoles in March 2008 and on PC in April 2008.&lt;ref name="Geddes2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Geddes|first=Ryan|title=Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 Announced|url=http://au.ps3.ign.com/articles/836/836749p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2010-05-31|date=November 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Rainbow Six Vegas'' changes the series with multiple new features, such as a new health system where the player regenerates health while not taking fire (it should be noted that the player may sometimes be killed instantly, without a chance to regenerate health; this usually happens from grenades, as well as taking close-range fire from very powerful weapons, particularly to the head). The player's vision is greatly impaired while damaged, similar to the health system in ''[[Gears of War]]''.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=30 December 2009|url=http://au.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/rainbowsixvegas/review.html|title=Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130033135/http://au.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/rainbowsixvegas/review.html|archivedate=30 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] view has been included for moments where players can blind-fire around corners to lay down suppression or covering fire.&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt; Other changes include a larger enemy presence and much tougher artificial intelligence,&lt;ref name="dailygame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygame.net/news/archives/006073.php|title=Rainbow Six Vegas|date=February 11, 2006|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a shift in focus to where kills will be much harder to obtain, a reincarnated aiming system similar to the aiming system of the old ''Rainbow Six'' games and a [[Context sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] [[D-pad]] based command system for the player's squad and sections of gameplay where the player will scale buildings and cause environmental damage. The player can also give voice commands using the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 headset,&lt;ref name="dailygame" /&gt; but teammates are no longer audible through the headset.

There is no mission planning feature or save system; instead, the game uses a checkpoint system.&lt;ref name="dailygame" /&gt; The developers also opted to almost entirely exclude cutscenes, telling the story through video feeds on a heads-up display. The player also has various skills, such as the ability to rappel up and down buildings while shooting and the ability to fast rope into an area.

==Plot==
In the year 2010, Rainbow operatives Logan Keller ([[Andrew Pifko]]), Gabriel Nowak (Thomas Michael) and Kan Akahashi ([[Dennis Akiyama]]) are on a mission in a [[Mexico|Mexican]] border town, assisted by intelligence officer Joanna Torres ([[Athena Karkanis]]) and pilot Brody Lukin ([[Andrew Pifko]]). Their objective is to arrest Irena Morales (Amanda Martinez), a terrorist ringleader. As the team reaches its landing zone in a helicopter, Logan [[fast-rope]]s down first but is separated from his group.

Logan fights his way through the terrorist-infested streets and meets up with Gabriel and Kan at an old Spanish church. After infiltrating a train yard and freeing a group of hostages, Rainbow eventually makes their way to a mine where Irena is hiding. However, after a surprise attack, Irena escapes and Gabriel and Kan are captured by terrorists.

Alone and armed only with his sidearm, Logan fights his way through an abandoned factory, eventually escaping by helicopter. He is then instructed to handle a related crisis in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He is dropped outside the Calypso Casino and links up with his new team: Michael Walters ([[Isaac C. Singleton Jr.]]), a British demolitions expert, and Jung Park ([[Paul Sun Hyung Lee]]), a Korean electronics expert. The team clears out the casino and saves a group of hostages. They also rescue a [[NATO]] weapons researcher, who reveals that a second researcher has been captured.

Rainbow is then taken to the Red Lotus casino in order to rescue a kidnapped reporter. The reporter informs them that the terrorists are using a news van as a communications hub. Logan's team destroys the hub, then flies out to rescue the kidnapped weapons researcher. Rainbow is dropped on the Vertigo Spire, a luxury hotel along the likes of the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere]]. The team finds and rescues the missing researcher, who informs the team about a micro-pulse bomb that was placed in the Vertigo. Michael disarms the bomb, and Rainbow is then extracted to locate Gabriel and Kan.

The team is dispatched to Dante’s Casino, where they find and free Gabriel. They also find Kan, but he is fatally shot in an ambush. Before he dies, Kan reveals that the attack in Las Vegas is a distraction, and Irena's terrorists are planning a far bigger attack. The team proceeds to a theatre to hack a terrorist server. Irena's target is revealed to be the Nevada Dam (very similar to the [[Hoover Dam]]).

Rainbow arrives at the dam, where they discover another micro-pulse bomb. After Michael defuses the bomb, the team fast-ropes to the bottom of the dam. A hostage informs them that the dam will buckle unless they open an emergency release valve. The crisis is resolved and the team proceeds further into the dam, where they find that it is a weapons research lab. It turns out the terrorists have a micro-pulse missile on top of the dam.

Logan presses forward, confronts Irena Morales herself and kills her. The team then heads to the top of the dam and destroys the missile. Logan receives a transmission from Gabriel, who tells him that he is Irena's mole. He proceeds to hijack the team's helicopter and throws out Joanna and Brody.

Gabriel attempts to escape with the helicopter. Logan can either let Gabriel escape or he can shoot it down with his weapon. Afterward, Logan and the team are sent out to find the organization behind Irena's and Gabriel's terrorist activity. When the mission completes, the words "To Be Continued" appear on the screen, implying [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2|a sequel]]. As the credits roll, a news clip states that a helicopter had crashed in the lake, but Gabriel's body was not found.

==Development==

===Patches===
The game featured a number of glitches/bugs upon release. Eventually, patches were released months after the game's release. One of the main things that the game was criticised for was the lack of a stand-alone dedicated server for the PC version, which the community tried to develop on their own, in hopes that Ubisoft would improve on what the community tried to accomplish. However, Ubisoft took the unmodified stand-alone dedicated server and included it into a patch.

During November 2007, the North American Support Supervisor announced on the Ubisoft forums that Ubisoft "has and will always provide support for this title", and also confirmed that Ubisoft was working on another patch."&lt;ref name="UbisoftForum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubisoft Forum |url=http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/3801065024/m/3711069245 |work=Ubisoft Official Forums |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821203220/http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/3801065024/m/3711069245 |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patch was released on July 19, 2007, and updated the game to version 1.05. Since that time, Ubisoft has released the latest patch 1.06.&lt;ref name="TomClancy2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas|url=http://www.ubi.com/AU/Games/Info.aspx?pId=4842&amp;tab=download&amp;dcId=63|publisher=Ubisoft|accessdate=2010-05-31|date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collector's Edition===
A Limited Collector's Edition of ''Rainbow Six: Vegas'' was released at the game's launch featuring alternative cover art and a bonus disc. The bonus disc contained a documentary on the making of ''Rainbow Six: Vegas'' and a ''Rainbow Six'' retrospective, which features information on all ''Rainbow Six'' games in the series.&lt;ref name="TomClancy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas (Limited Collector's Edition) for Xbox 360|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/xbox360/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-limited-collectors-edition|publisher=MobyGames|accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion packs===
On April 18, 2007, the ''Player's Pack Red Edition'' was released as downloadable content on [[Xbox Live]]. The pack includes two new game modes. The first is "Assassination" whereby one team has to protect a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] armed only with a pistol, whilst the other team needs to assassinate him. The second is ''Conquest'' (a "capture and hold"-style game, whereby each team has to hold as many [[strategy|strategic]] points for as long as possible). Three new maps were also included: "Doscala Restaurant," "Marshalling Yard," and "Roof." The maps "Killhouse" and "Border Town" have been redesigned and packaged as two new "redux" maps. The expansion pack comes directly after an update was released for the game. All original game modes and maps are compatible with those featured in the ''Player's Pack Red Edition''. On July 6, 2007, the Red Pack was made available for download free of charge.&lt;ref name="RainbowSix2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Six Vegas: Player’s Pack Red Edition|url=http://rainbowsixgame.us.ubi.com/article.php?news_id=5424|publisher=Ubisoft|accessdate=2010-05-31|date=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2007, a new downloadable content pack was released. The ''Player's Pack Black Edition'' features five new maps. "Red Lotus", "Wartown" and "Neon Graveyard" are the three newly featured maps. "Streets: Redux" has been redesigned in a similar fashion to the Redux maps found in the ''Player's Pack Red Edition'', and "Presidio" is a map overhauled and upgraded from ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield]]''. On June 27, 2007, the ''Black Edition'' was retracted from the Xbox Live Marketplace. Ubisoft announced that it was pulled due to a pricing error and that the pack (which was originally priced at 800 Microsoft Points) was intended to be free.&lt;ref name="RainbowSix2007a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Six Vegas Black Edition Map Pack Update|url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/13855/Rainbow-Six-Vegas-Black-Edition-Map-Pack-Update/|publisher=TeamXbox|accessdate=2010-05-31|date=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2007, the ''Black Edition'' was re-released for download free of charge; Xbox Live users who paid for the pack had their points reimbursed.&lt;ref name="Alexis2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Six Vegas: Player's Pack: Black Edition Downloadable Content Now Available For Xbox 360 |url=http://www.gamingbits.com/content/view/2245/2/|publisher=Gaming Bits|accessdate=2010-05-31|author=Alexis M.|date=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ''Red'' and the ''Black'' player packs were released for PC platform on July 26, 2007, and are included in the PS3 retail version.&lt;ref name="RainbowSix2007b"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Six Vegas Map Pack |url=http://www.gamershell.com/news_40448.html|publisher=Gamershell|accessdate=2010-08-09|date=July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maarten2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Six: Vegas Map Pack Released|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48149|publisher=Shack News|accessdate=2010-08-09|author=Maarten Goldstein|date=July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman visitor at Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, Malaysia-10Aug2010.jpg|upright|thumb|A white tube top]]
A '''tube top''', colloquially known in the UK as a '''boob tube''',&lt;ref&gt;"Boob tube": a redesignation of a dismissive 1960s [[sobriquet]] for [[television]], or "idiot box"; "boobs" derives from "bubbies" ([http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2038/whats-the-origin-of-booby-trap The Straight Dope: "The Origin of 'Booby Trap{{'"}}]); the screen was a [[cathode ray tube]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[shoulder]]less, [[sleeve]]less women's garment that wraps around the upper [[torso]]. It is generally tight over the [[breast]]s, and usually uses elastic bands at its top and bottom to prevent it from falling. The tube top's precursor was a beachwear or informal summer garment worn by young girls in the 1950s that became more widely popular in the 1970s and returned to popularity in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beck |first1=Rachel |date=1 June 1998 |title=Are you ready to slip back into a tube top this summer? |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19980601&amp;id=rC0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Rr8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7000,797873 |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Iranian fashion designer [[Elie Tahari]] claimed that he helped popularize tube top after his arrival in New York in 1971.&lt;ref name=pagan&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Pagan |title=Who Made That Tube Top? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/magazine/who-made-that-tube-top.html |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=17 August 2012 |page=MM19 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original tube tops, as spotted by Tahari in a New York factory run by Murray Kleid, were elasticated gauze tubes reportedly produced through a factory manufacturing error. Murray ran with this product for years, and eventually Tahari bought tubes from Kleid, later setting up his own factory to mass produce tube tops to meet widespread demand.&lt;ref name=pagan/&gt;

'''Virilization''' or '''masculinization'''&lt;!-- NOTE: The term "masculinization" redirects here. Because of this, and WP:Alternative title, the term should be bolded and mentioned in the lead. --&gt; is the biological development of [[sex differences]], changes that make a [[male]] body different from a [[female]] body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/virilization|title=Virilization definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the changes of virilization are produced by [[androgen]]s. Virilization is most commonly used in three medical and [[biology of gender]] contexts: prenatal [[sexual differentiation]], the postnatal changes of normal male [[puberty]], and excessive androgen effects in females.

==Prenatal virilization==
In the prenatal period, virilization refers to closure of the [[perineum]], thinning and wrinkling (rugation) of the [[scrotum]], growth of the [[phallus]], and closure of the [[urethral groove]] to the tip of the [[penis]]. In this context, ''masculinization'' is synonymous with ''virilization.''

Prenatal virilization of genetic females and undervirilization of genetic males are common causes of [[ambiguous genitalia]] and [[intersex]] conditions.

===High===
Prenatal virilization of a genetically female fetus can occur when an excessive amount of androgen is produced by the fetal [[adrenal gland]]s or is present in maternal blood. In the severest form of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], complete masculinization of a genetically female fetus results in an apparently normal male anatomy with no palpable [[testes]]. More often, the virilization is partial and the genitalia are ambiguous.

It can also be associated with [[progestin-induced virilisation]].

===Low===
''Undervirilization'' can occur if a genetic male cannot produce enough androgen or the body tissues cannot respond to it. Extreme undervirilization occurs when no significant androgen hormones can be produced or the body is completely insensitive to androgens. Both result in a female body. Partial undervirilization produces ambiguous genitalia part-way between male and female. The mildest degree of undervirilization may be a slightly small penis. Examples of undervirilization are [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]], and some forms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

==Normal virilization==
{{See also|Puberty#Changes in males}}
In common as well as medical usage, virilization often refers to the process of normal male [[puberty]]. These effects include growth of the penis and testes, accelerated growth, [[Pubarche|development of pubic hair]], and other androgenic hair of face, torso, and limbs, [[Voice change|deepening of the voice]], increased musculature, thickening of the jaw, prominence of the neck cartilage, and broadening of the shoulders.

==Abnormal childhood virilization==
Virilization can occur in childhood in both males and females due to excessive amounts of androgens. Typical effects of virilization in children are [[pubic hair]], accelerated growth and bone maturation, increased [[muscle strength]], [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], and adult body odor. In males, virilization may signal [[precocious puberty]], while [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and androgen producing tumors (usually) of the [[gonad]]s or adrenals are occasional causes in both sexes.

==In adolescent or adult females==
Virilization in females can manifest as [[clitoris|clitoral]] enlargement, increased muscle strength, acne, [[hirsutism]], frontal hair thinning, deepening of the voice, and [[menstrual period|menstrual]] disruption due to [[anovulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Gynecologic Health|first1=Kerri Durnell |last1=Schuiling|first2= Frances E.|last2= Likis|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year= 2005|isbn=0-7637-4717-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the possible causes of virilization in females are:

* [[Androgen]]-producing tumors of the
** [[ovary|ovaries]]
** [[adrenal gland]]s (see [[adrenal tumor]])
** [[pituitary gland]] (see [[pituitary adenoma]])
* [[Hyperthecosis]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]]
* [[Anabolic steroid]] exposure
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]] (late-onset)
* [[Conn's syndrome]]

== Medically induced virilization in transgender people ==
{{See also|Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)}}Transgender people who were [[Sex assignment|medically assigned female at birth]] sometimes elect to take [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormone replacement therapy]]. This process causes virilization by inducing many of the effects of a typically male puberty. Many of these effects are permanent, but some effects can be reversed if the transgender individual stops or pauses their medical treatment.

=== Permanent virilization effects ===
* Deepening of the voice
* Growth of facial and body hair
* Male-pattern [[baldness]]
* Enlargement of the [[clitoris]]
* [[Breast atrophy]] – possible shrinking and/or softening of breasts

=== Reversible virilization effects ===
* Further muscle development (especially upper body)
* Increased sweat and changes in body odor
* Prominence of veins and coarser skin
* Alterations in blood lipids ([[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]])
* Increased red blood cell count

==Demasculinization==
Demasculinization refers to the reversal of virilization. Some but not all aspects of virilization are reversible. Demasculinization occurs naturally with [[andropause]], pathologically with [[hypogonadism]], and artificially or medically with [[antiandrogen]]s, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, and [[orchiectomy]].

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in Oman''' were historically excluded from the forums of everyday life. But with the dispersal of Omanis in the early 1900s and their return in the early 1970s, a more contemporary population of Omanis that were influenced by the British colonial values during their time abroad have slowly challenged many traditions of gender segregation. Women now pursue careers and professional training, slowly moving from their previous household confinement to the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Skeet, Ian. Oman: Politics and Development. New York: St. Martin's, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In Oman, 17 October is celebrated every year as the Omani Women's Day with various pro-female events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://main.omanobserver.om/node/68798 Women’s Day celebrations today], 17 October 2011. Retrieved 2011-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

In 1970, the political and social atmosphere of Oman changed with the advent of a new ruler, [[Sultan Qaboos|Sultan Qaboos bin Said]], son of the conservative and rigid [[Said bin Taimur]]. After decades of stagnant to non-existent growth, Qaboos overthrew his father in a palace coup and immediately began numerous social programs, commissioning hospitals, clinics, schools, etc. Many Omanis who had been living abroad to get a proper education returned to participate in the construction of a new nation. The abroadees also brought with them the liberal and open attitude of their host countries, including the idea of equal gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dawn Chatty|Chatty, Dawn]]. "Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints." International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Sultan Qaboos introduced many reforms funded mostly by the oil revenue, targeting development and social services. He also appointed the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman|Majlis al-Shura]] (Consultative Council), a body of representatives elected by the people that review legislation. This act gave the people more control in their government which had been previously in complete control of the royal family and his appointed cabinet. In the September 2000 elections, 83 candidates were elected for seats in the Majlis al-Shura, including two women. In 1996, the Sultan issued "The Basic Law of the Sultanate of Oman" to serve as a form of written constitution. This document gives the Omani people their basic civil liberties as well as guaranteeing equality and protection under the law. In 2002, universal suffrage was granted to all Omanis over the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;"Oman - Leadership." Encyclopedia of the Nations. Web. 1 May 2012. http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Oman-LEADERSHIP.html&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Sultan’s Royal Decree in 2008 gave women the equal right to own land as held by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf Issan, Salha. "Preparing for the Women of the Future: Literacy and Development in the Sultanate of Oman." Hawwa (Leiden) 8.2 (2010): 120-53&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan Qaboos also recently signed the Decent Work Country Programme, a service dedicated to increase job opportunities for women as well as stand for justice, equality, and freedom. The program is supposed to be implemented from 2010 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Neelufer, and Srilekha Goveas. "A Role and Contributions of Women in the Sultanate of Oman." International Journal of Business and Management 6.3 (2011): 232-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Modern education was foreign to Omanis before 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Skeet, Ian. Oman: Politics and Development. New York: St. Martin's, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the reforms made by Sultan Qaboos, there were only three primary schools serving 900 boys, focusing mainly on reciting the Quran and learning basic math and writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Lamki, Salma M. "Higher Education in the Sultanate of Oman: The Challenge of Access, Equity and Privatization." Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management 24.1 (2002): 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Sultan Qaboos introduced the universal education policy for both men and women,&lt;ref&gt;Al Riyami, Asya, and Mustafa Afifi. "Women Empowerment and Marital Fertility in Oman." The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association 78.1, 2 (2003): 55-72.&lt;/ref&gt; increasing female attendance in schools from 0% in 1970 to 49% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Neelufer, and Srilekha Goveas. "A Role and Contributions of Women in the Sultanate of Oman." International Journal of Business and Management 6.3 (2011): 232-39&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following, 600,000 students, both male and female, enrolled in over 1000 schools, bringing Oman one step closer to the goal of "education for all".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Lamki, Salma M. "Higher Education in the Sultanate of Oman: The Challenge of Access, Equity and Privatization." Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management 24.1 (2002): 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this first stage of universal education was established, the Ministry of Education implemented measures to improve the quality of education. In the 1980s, the Omani government sponsored construction of school buildings, the providing of adequate equipment and textbooks, and the provision of teacher training. The reforms continue today and saw a tremendous growth in school attendance.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. UNESCO. Education as a Motor for Development: Recent Education Reforms in Oman with Particular Reference to the Status of Women and Girls. By Shapour Rassekh. Geneva, Switzerland: International Bureau of Education, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The gender equality was the next focus of the education reform, especially after Oman’s 1995 "Vision 2020" that focused on the country’s economic future. As a result, in 2003 to 2004, 48.4% of students were female and out of 32,345 teachers of both genders, 56% were female.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. UNESCO. Education as a Motor for Development: Recent Education Reforms in Oman with Particular Reference to the Status of Women and Girls. By Shapour Rassekh. Geneva, Switzerland: International Bureau of Education, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past the College of Engineering at Sultan Qaboos University banned the entrance of female students, claiming that the "outdoor setting" of engineering field work was not gender appropriate. Though students protested, many women had to transfer to other institutions; this has changed and even females are allowed to be in it.&lt;ref&gt;Chatty, Dawn. "Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints." International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor and employment==
[[File:Oman (124).jpg|thumbnail|An Omani family]]
Ever since the 1970s, women typically educated overseas were encouraged to return to [[Oman]] and help to "rebuild the nation." With a leader who embraced the ideals of modernization and progress, women were able to hold jobs in nearly every profession: banking, medicine, engineering, teaching, etc. According to a UNICEF-sponsored census, 40% of economically active women were in professional job categories.&lt;ref&gt;Chatty, Dawn. "Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints." International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, 17% of the Omani workforce was made up of women.&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf Issan, Salha. "Preparing for the Women of the Future: Literacy and Development in the Sultanate of Oman." Hawwa (Leiden) 8.2 (2010): 120-53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, however, the government started to retract their previous liberties and slowly restrict the professions deemed "gender acceptable" for women. The number of professional women decreased and women were forced into more traditional roles as "nurturers and caregivers." The Omani Women’s Association, the first women’s government-recognized group in Oman, was stripped of the majority of its independence and was passed to the male-led Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor. In 1984, it was replaced with a Directorate General of Women and Child Affairs with a sub-unit for women’s associations. The main goal of this unit was to set up classes for women to learn basic household skills and day-care centers for the handicapped and disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Chatty, Dawn. "Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints." International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the slight setbacks, Oman is still considered to be one of the leading Gulf countries in terms of gender equality and continue to make positive strides. In 1997, the Omanisation Policy was implemented, committing to the promise of gradually replacing foreign labor dependence with Omani workers, giving women more of a chance to participate in the work force and making jobs more accessible to all Omanis.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Neelufer, and Srilekha Goveas. "A Role and Contributions of Women in the Sultanate of Oman." International Journal of Business and Management 6.3 (2011): 232-39&lt;/ref&gt; Women now make up 30% of the workforce and even serve in ministerial positions. The ministers of higher education, tourism, and social development in the cabinet are all women, as well as the US Ambassador and the head of national authority for industrial craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Katzman, Kenneth. Oman: Reform, Security, and U.S. Policy. Rep. no. RS21534. Vol. 7-5700. Washington D.C.: Congressional Research Service, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common role for the Omani woman is still the role of housewife. The housewife is essential to the upkeep of the family and will take command of all agricultural production while her husband is away for months at a time. These women work hard to support a family and tend to many matters traditionally seen by the man.&lt;ref&gt;Chatty, Dawn. "Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints." International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54&lt;/ref&gt;
Women are not allowed to cover their face (niqab) in professional institutes , number of Omani and expats women not able to show their participation in public field , even it is not allow women to cover their face while driving

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Oman}}
Omani society and legislation as a whole is based on the Islamic Sharia law which provides men and women with different rights and responsibilities. The country's progressive interpretation of Sharia law means that women are allowed to participate in politics, society and workforce to the fullest extent possible, but at the same time not allowing them to ignore their responsibilities they have towards their families.

The country has made a concerted effort to improve the rights of women in accordance with the Sharia, at the same time keeping their responsibilities in mind as well.

==Attire==

The rules of  modesty in Islamic culture require a woman to be modestly covered at all times, especially when traveling farther from the home. At home, the Omani woman wears a long dress to her knees along with ankle-length pants and a leeso, or scarf, covering her hair and neck. Multitudes of lively colored ''Jalabiyyas ''are also worn at home. Once outside the home, dress is varied according to regional tastes. For some of a more conservative religious background, the [[burqa]] is expected to be worn to cover her face in the presence of other males, along with the wiqaya, or head scarf, and the abaya, an all-enveloping cloak revealing only her hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;Wikan, Unni. Behind the Veil in Arabia: Women in Oman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women from varying regions of the Sultanate wear the scarf to cover only their hair.

The cotton burqa is symbolic of the expectations of the ideal woman and act as a mark of respect to represent her modesty and honor as well as her status. The burqa, first worn by a young girl after her seven-day honeymoon, is on whenever she is in the presence of strangers or outside the home, covering most of her face from view. The highest and lowest classes of Omanis do not wear the burqa—the highest being the children and relatives of the Sultan and the lowest being the poorest women in the town. This makes the burqa a symbol of rank as well. Some burqa differ in regions and designs as well, varying in size, shape and color. The Quran,however, makes no references specific to the modern day burqa.&lt;ref&gt;Wikan, Unni. Behind the Veil in Arabia: Women in Oman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[abaya]] ''is the conservative dress of choice, favored by women of most social classes and regions. The multitudes of designs and decadent embellishments on the modern day ''[[abaya]] ''has allowed it to become a versatile clothing that can be made either plain or a fashion statement, in Oman and in other neighboring Islamic countries.

==Family==

Women have always been seen as a wife and mother first and foremost. A good marriage and the bearing of children determine their social status and as soon as a woman is wed, most of her decisions are made by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Chatty, Dawn. "Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints." International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage is a defining moment in the life of an Omani woman and marks her transformation from girl to woman. Though Sultan Qaboos extended both males and females the legal right to choose their spouse in 1971, tradition holds that the girl's father is responsible for setting up a proper match and securing his daughter’s happiness. Most girls get married around the time they reach puberty, for the timely arrival of sexual desire is supposed to coincide with marriage. In this way, every unwed Omani girl is expected to be a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Wikan, Unni. Behind the Veil in Arabia: Women in Oman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

In combination with the improvements in other areas of female life, the importance of sexual health and health education of women has come to the forefront recently. Even in 2004, 15% of adolescent girls aged 15–20 were married, a much higher statistic than other countries and resulting in a very young and uneducated population of young mothers. In 1994, the government implemented a birth spacing program and encouraged the use of contraceptives among married couples by providing them for free in most health centers.&lt;ref&gt;Riyami, Asya, Mustafa Afifi, and Ruth Mabry. "Women's Autonomy, Education and Employment in Oman and Their Influence on Contraceptive Use." Reproductive Health Matters 12.23 (2004): 144-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was effective and the total fertility rate dropped from a staggering 7.05 in 1995 to 4.8 in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Al Riyami, Asya, and Mustafa Afifi. "Women Empowerment and Marital Fertility in Oman." The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association 78.1, 2 (2003): 55-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Book Day''' is a charity event held annually in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on the first Thursday in March. It is the local manifestation of ''[[World Book and Copyright Day]]'' (also known as ''International Day of the Book'' or ''World Book Days'') organized by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. On World Book Day, every child in full-time education in the UK is given a voucher to be spent on books.

The Day was first celebrated in 1995 in the United Kingdom. The original, global [[World Book Day]] event is generally observed on 23 April - it was changed in the UK to avoid clashes with Easter school holidays and with [[St George's Day]]. Conversely, a separate event [http://www.worldbooknight.org/ World Book Night] organized by independent charity [[The Reading Agency]] is held on 23 April.

==History==
The United Kingdom's own version of World Book Day began in 1998, launched by [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] at the [[Globe Theatre]] in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Several million schoolchildren in the UK were given a special £1 World Book Day Book Token (€1.50 in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) which could be redeemed against any book in any UK bookshop. A specially created WBD anthology priced at £1 (€1.50 in Ireland) was also published. All World Book Day [[point of sale]] and the £1 book carried the special World Book Day logo to help unify the initiative through all outlets.

Since then, World Book Day UK has followed a similar pattern, gradually growing each year to encompass more initiatives, such as ''Spread The Word'', ''[[Quick Reads Initiative]]'' and ''Books for Hospitals''. Every year, the number of children receiving a World Book Day Book Token has increased.

In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 [[List of World Book Day Books|books]] were published, covering a wider age-range.  Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

In 2006, World Book Day began its support of and association with the ''Quick Reads''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/vitallink/Quickreads.html#background Quick Reads website]&lt;/ref&gt; initiative for adult emergent readers.

In 2007, World Book Day celebrated its 10th anniversary with the publication of 10 £1 books. Since then every child in full-time education in the UK and Ireland is entitled to receive a £1 World Book day Book token every year. They can swap their WBD token for one of specially-produced [[List of World Book Day Books|£1 WBD books]] or they can get £1 off a full-price book or audio book priced £2.99 or more.

==Administration==
World Book Day is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=1079257  Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not raise funds for itself but does support [http://www.bookaid.org Book Aid International]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookaid.org/cms.cgi/site/  Book Aid International website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Readathon as its nominated charities, encouraging schools to hold special fundraising events for children less fortunate than themselves. World Book Day is not funded by the British Government although the Quick Reads element does receive support from ACE, DIUS and NIACE. The funding for World Book Day activities comes principally from the major sponsor, National Book Tokens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/index.asp?m=32&amp;c=1157  National Book Tokens website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK book trade (publishers and booksellers).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">The '''World Crafts Council AISBL (WCC-AISBL)''' is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that was founded in 1964 to promote fellowship, foster economic development through income generating craft related activities, organize exchange programs, workshops, conferences, seminars, and exhibitions—and in general, to offer encouragement, help, and advice to the craftspersons of the world. The organization is now formally registered in Belgium as an international organization and ''AISBL'' is there the french shortcut for an ''international [[association without lucrative purpose]]''. The WCC is organised into five regions: Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The organization is affiliated to [[UNESCO]].

The WCC was founded in 1964 by [[Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay|Kamaladevi Chattopadhay]] and [[Aileen Osborn Webb]] (who had founded the [[American Craft Council]] in 1943.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftvic.org.au/resources/craft-culture/2002/global-peace-through-craft-the-formation-of-the-world-crafts-council ''Global Peace Through Craft: The Formation of the World Crafts Council'', By Sandra Alfoldy], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The WCC (Europe) meets once a year and the 2011 meeting was held in [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture360.org/event/dublin-world-crafts-council-europe-conference/ ''Dublin: World Crafts Council Europe conference'', by Judith Staines], 17 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Crafts Council meets every four years. In 2012, the General Assembly occurred in [[Chennai]] when [http://www.kaivalam.com/ Usha Krishna] was the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaivalam.com ''Kaivalam''] Kaivalam Craft Summit&lt;/ref&gt; After this General Assembly the Presidency will move from India to China.

In 2014, WCC Golden Jubliee Celebration Summit was held in Dongyang, China, more than 2000 craftpeople from 63 countries participated. In 2016, the General Assembly occurred in [[Isfahan, Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://isfwcc.ir/wcc18th/Introduction.aspx , ''The 18th General Assembly of the World Crafts Council Isfahan''], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; from September 22 to 29.
