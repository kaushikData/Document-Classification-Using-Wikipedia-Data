      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14434">'''Adaptive comparative judgement''' is a technique borrowed from [[psychophysics]] which is able to generate reliable results for educational assessment – as such it is an alternative to traditional exam script marking. In the approach, judges are presented with pairs of student work and are then asked to choose which is better, one or the other. By means of an iterative and adaptive algorithm, a scaled distribution of student work can then be obtained without reference to criteria.

==Introduction==
Traditional exam script marking began in Cambridge 1792 when, with undergraduate numbers rising, the importance of proper ranking of students was growing. So in 1792 the new Proctor of Examinations, William Farish, introduced marking, a process in which every examiner gives a numerical score to each response by every student, and the overall total mark puts the students in the final rank order. [[Francis Galton]] (1869) noted that, in an unidentified year about 1863, the [[Senior Wrangler]] scored 7,634 out of a maximum of 17,000, while the Second Wrangler scored 4,123. (The 'Wooden Spoon' scored only 237.)

Prior to 1792, a team of Cambridge examiners convened at 5pm on the last day of examining, reviewed the 19 papers each student had sat – and published their rank order at midnight. Marking solved the problems of numbers and prevented unfair personal bias, and its introduction was a step towards modern objective testing, the format it is best suited to. But the technology of testing that followed, with its major emphasis on reliability and the automatisation of marking, has been an uncomfortable partner for some areas of educational achievement: assessing writing or speaking, and other kinds of performance need something more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] and judgemental.

The technique of Adaptive Comparative Judgement is an alternative to marking. It returns to the pre-1792 idea of sorting papers according to their quality, but retains the guarantee of reliability and fairness. It is by far the most reliable way known to score essays or more complex performances{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source(s) needed to justify such a strong claim|date=September 2018}}. It is much simpler than marking, and has been preferred by almost all examiners who have tried it. The real appeal of Adaptive Comparative Judgement lies in how it can re-professionalise the activity of assessment and how it can re-integrate [[Educational assessment|assessment]] with learning.

==History==

===Thurstone's law of comparative judgement===
{{quote|"There is no such thing as absolute judgement"|Laming (2004)&lt;ref&gt;* Laming, D R J (2004) ''Human judgment : the eye of the beholder.'' London, Thomson.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The science of comparative judgement began with [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. A pioneer of [[psychophysics]], he proposed several ways to construct scales for measuring sensation and other [[psychological]] properties. One of these was the [[law of comparative judgment]] (Thurstone, 1927a, 1927b),&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L L (1927a). ''Psychophysical analysis''. American Journal of Psychology, 38, 368-389. Chapter 2 in Thurstone, L.L. (1959). The measurement of values. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L L (1927b). ''The method of paired comparisons for social values''. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 21, 384-400. Chapter 7 in Thurstone, L.L. (1959). The measurement of values. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; which defined a mathematical way of modeling the chance that one object will 'beat' another in a comparison, given values for the 'quality' of each. This is all that is needed to construct a complete measurement system.

A variation on his model (see [[Pairwise comparison]] and the BTL model), states that the difference between their quality values is equal to the log of the odds that object-A will beat object-B:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{log\;odds}(A\ \text{beats}\ B\mid v_a,v_b)=v_a-v_b
&lt;/math&gt;

Before the availability of modern computers, the mathematics needed to calculate the 'values' of each object's quality meant that the method could only be used with small sets of objects, and its application was limited. For Thurstone, the objects were generally sensations, such as intensity, or attitudes, such as the seriousness of crimes, or statements of opinions. Social researchers continued to use the method, as did market researchers for whom the objects might be different hotel room layouts, or variations on a proposed new biscuit.

In the 1970s and 1980s, comparative judgement appeared, almost for the first time in educational assessment, as a theoretical basis or precursor for the new Latent Trait or Item Response Theories. (Andrich, 1978) These models are now standard, especially in item banking and adaptive testing systems.

===Re-introduction in education===
The first published paper using Comparative Judgement in education was Pollitt &amp; Murray (1994), essentially a research paper concerning the nature of the English proficiency scale assessed in the speaking part of Cambridge's CPE exam. The objects were candidates, represented by 2-minute snippets of video recordings from their test sessions, and the judges were Linguistics post-graduate students with no assessment training. The judges compared pairs of video snippets, simply reporting which they thought the better student, and were then clinically interviewed to elicit the reasons for their decisions.

Pollitt then introduced Comparative Judgement to the UK awarding bodies, as a method for comparing the standards of A Levels from different boards. Comparative judgement replaced their existing method which required direct judgement of a script against the official standard of a different board. For the first two or three years of this Pollitt carried out all of the analyses for all the boards, using a program he had written for the purpose. It immediately became the only experimental method used to investigate exam comparability in the UK; the applications for this purpose from 1996 to 2006 are fully described in Bramley (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Bramley, T (2007) ''Paired comparison methods''. In Newton, P, Baird, J, Patrick, H, Goldstein, H, Timms, P and Wood, A (Eds).'' Techniques for monitoring the comparability of examination standards. London'', QCA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Pollitt presented a paper at the conference of the International Association for Educational Assessment titled Let's Stop Marking Exams, and another at the same conference in 2009 titled Abolishing Marksism. In each paper the aim was to convince the assessment community that there were significant advantages to using Comparative Judgement in place of marking for some types of assessment. In 2010 he presented a paper at the Association for Educational Assessment – Europe, How to Assess Writing Reliably and Validly, which presented evidence of the extraordinarily high reliability that has been achieved with Comparative Judgement in assessing primary school pupils'skill in first language English writing.

===Adaptive comparative judgement===
Comparative judgement becomes a viable alternative to marking when it is implemented as an adaptive web-based assessment system. In this, the 'scores' (the model parameter for each object) are re-estimated after each 'round' of judgements in which, on average, each object has been judged one more time. In the next round, each script is compared only to another whose current estimated score is similar, which increases the amount of statistical information contained in each judgement. As a result, the estimation procedure is more efficient than random pairing, or any other pre-determined pairing system like those used in classical comparative judgement applications. (Pollitt, 2012).&lt;ref name=p2012&gt;Pollitt, A (2012) The method of Adaptive Comparative Judgement. Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice. 19: 3, 1-20.  DOI:10.1080/0969594X.2012.665354&lt;/ref&gt;

As with computer-adaptive testing, this adaptivity maximises the efficiency of the estimation procedure, increasing the separation of the scores and reducing the standard errors. The most obvious advantage is that this produces significantly enhanced reliability, compared to assessment by marking, with no loss of validity.

===Current comparative judgement projects===

==== Digital Assess ====
The Digital Assess platform is the original adaptive comparative judgement system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalassess.com www.digitalassess.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The system is designed to run at scale deployments of Adaptive Comparative Judgements and has been used around the world in a wide range of contexts. The company is currently developing new versions of the approach that utilise machine learning to substantially reduce the number of required judgements.

==== Open Source Comparative Judgement Projects ====
The Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-PAC) is a consortium with University of Antwerp, iMinds and Ghent University to create an open source Comparative Judgement application. D-PAC, In collaboration with No More Marking Ltd, have released the algorithms that power [http://www.nomoremarking.com www.nomoremarking.com] under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

====Free Web-based Comparative Judgement ====
[http://www.nomoremarking.com No More Marking] have created a free online Comparative Judgement application, along with a repository of useful information.

====e-scape====
The first application of Comparative Judgement to the direct assessment of students was in a project called [[e-scape]], led by Prof. Richard Kimbell of London University's Goldsmiths College (Kimbell &amp; Pollitt, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell R, A and Pollitt A   (2008)   ''Coursework assessment in high stakes examinations: authenticity, creativity, reliability Third international Rasch measurement conference''. Perth: Western Australia: January.&lt;/ref&gt; The development work was carried out in collaboration with a number of awarding bodies in a Design &amp; Technology course. Kimbell's team developed a sophisticated and authentic project in which students were required to develop, as far as a prototype, an object such as a children's [[pill dispenser]] in two three-hour supervised sessions.

The web-based judgement system was designed by Karim Derrick and Declan Lynch from TAG Developments, now a part of Digital Assess, and based on the original [[MAPS (software)]] assessment portfolio system, now known as Manage. Goldsmiths, TAG Developments and Pollitt ran three trials, increasing the sample size from 20 to 249 students, and developing both the judging system and the assessment system. There are three pilots, involving Geography and Science as well as the original in Design &amp; Technology.

====Primary school writing====
In late 2009, TAG Developments and Pollitt trialled a new version of the system for assessing writing. A total of 1000 primary school scripts were evaluated by a team of 54 judges in a simulated national assessment context. The reliability of the resulting scores after each script had been judged 16 times was 0.96, considerably higher than in any other reported study of similar writing assessment. Further development of the system has shown that reliability of 0.93 can be reached after about 9 judgements of each script, when the system is no more expensive than single marking but still much more reliable.&lt;ref name="p2012"  /&gt;

Several projects are underway at present, in England, Scotland, Ireland, Israel, Singapore and Australia. They range from primary school to university in context, and include both formative and summative assessment, from writing to mathematics. The basic web system is now available on a commercial basis from TAG Assessment (http://www.tagassessment.com), and can be modified to suit specific needs.

=====University of Limerick=====

ACJ has been used by Seery, Canty, Gordon and Lane in the University of Limerick, Ireland to assess undergraduate student work on Initial Teacher Education programmes since 2009.

=====Purdue University=====

ACJ has been used by Dr. Bartholomew at Purdue University to assess design portfolios in middle, high-school, and university students.   Bartholomew has also used ACJ as a formative assessment teaching and learning tool for open-ended problems.

'''Anthony Charles Thiselton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1937) is an English [[Anglican]] priest, [[theologian]], and academic. He has written a number of books and articles on a range of topics in [[Christian]] [[theology]], [[biblical studies]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].  He has served on the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]], appointed by the [[Minister of Health]].

He was educated at [[City of London School]], with degrees from [[King's College London]] (BD, MTh) the [[University of Sheffield]] (PhD) and the [[University of Durham]] (DD). He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Chester]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chester University profile|url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/node/12797|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2012.  Thiselton is an Honorary Fellow of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranmer Hall - Honorary Fellows|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/st-johns.college/cranmer/cranmer_staff/honorary-fellows/|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fellow of Kings College London and fellow of the British Academy.

Thiselton is a former head of theology at the [[University of Nottingham]] and was also [[Principal (academia)|principal]] of both [[St John's College, Nottingham]] (1986 to 1988) and [[St John's College, Durham]] (1988 to 1992).&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Thiselton | forenames = Anthony Charles | id = 19906 | accessed = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a priest and canon in the [[Church of England]], in which he represents the Diocese of Southwell on the church's [[General Synod]]. He is an associate priest in the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Attenborough, Nottingham. On 25 June 2002, he was presented with a [[Lambeth Degree]] of Doctorate of Divinity by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[George Carey]].

He was visiting Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena; Calvin College, Grand Rapids; Regent College, Vancouver; North Park, Seminary, Chicago; the University of Utrecht, Netherlands; several seminaries in South Korea; Senior Lecturer in the University of Sheffield; and Professor of Theology in the University of Chester.

He served on the Church of England General Synod membership, and its Commissions and Committees:  Crown Nominations Commission, 2000-2010); Appointments Committee (2008–13); and Theological Education and Training Committee (1999-2005).  Outside Synod he remained on the Doctrine Commission for nearly 30 years: Church of England Doctrine Commission (1976-2006); Acting Chairman, (1987); Church of England Faith and Order Group (1979–89); Theological Education in the Anglican Communion (2003–06).

His main published work has been in the areas of [[hermeneutics]] (especially hermeneutical theory and its relationship to biblical interpretation), Christian doctrine (including eschatology and pneumatology), and biblical studies, in particular with two substantial commentaries on [[1 Corinthians]]. He is unusual in academic theology for publishing research-level works across such a broad range of topics.

He received a ''[[Festschrift|festschrift]]'', edited by Stanley Porter and Matthew Malcolm, entitled ''Horizons in Hermeneutics'' (Eerdmans) in April 2013. In June 2012 he was also the subject of a one-day conference in his honour, at the University of Nottingham, at which he presented a response paper to several contributors who spoke in light of his work. Proceedings from this conference were published by Paternoster (in the UK) and IVP (in the US) as ''The Future of Biblical Interpretation'' (2013). St John's College, Nottingham, inaugurated a series of "Thiselton lectures" in 2013 to honour his work in hermeneutics. He gave the first of these himself, in June 2013.

'''Ashen light''' is a hypothesised subtle glow that has been claimed to be seen on the night side of the planet [[Venus]]. The phenomenon has not been scientifically confirmed. If real, it may be associated with [[lightning]], which has not been detected.&lt;ref name="Russell, Philips"/&gt;

== History of observations==

The ashen light was first reported by the astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] on 9 January 1643, and he named it "The Ashen Light of Venus."  Subsequent claims have been made by various observers including [[Sir William Herschel]], [[Sir Patrick Moore]], [[Dale P. Cruikshank]], and [[William K. Hartmann]].&lt;ref name='Gingrich2001'&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Paradoxical Ashen Light of Venus |author=Gingrich, M. |author2=Myers, E. |url=http://www.eastbayastro.org/2001/0301/r0301-2.htm |journal=Bulletin of the Eastbay Astronomical Society|volume=77 |issue=7 |date=Mar 2001 |location=Oakland, CA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iO9&gt;{{cite news |last=Inglis-Arkell |first=Esther |url=http://io9.com/the-four-hundred-year-mystery-of-the-ashen-light-of-ven-568548720 |title=The four-hundred-year mystery of the Ashen Light of Venus |work=iO9 |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=2015-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ashen light has often been sighted when Venus is in the evening sky, when the evening terminator of the planet is toward the Earth.&lt;ref name='Gingrich2001'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winder2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Winder |first=Jenny |url=http://www.universetoday.com/94848/the-mystery-of-venus-ashen-light-2/ |title=The Mystery of Venus’ Ashen Light |work=[[Universe Today]] |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=2015-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observation attempts were made on 17 July 2001, when a 67% Venus reappeared from behind a 13% moon. None of the observers of this occurrence (including some using 61&amp;nbsp;cm 'Super RADOTS' telescopes) reported seeing the ashen light. Video from the event was captured, but the camera  was too insensitive to detect even the earthshine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smdc.army.mil/KWAJ/Hourglass/issues-archived/01Issues/hourglass7_24_01.pdf 2001 Jul 17 Reappearance of Venus from the Marshall Islands], by Peter Rejcek. See page 8. Retrieved 2015-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly favourable viewing opportunity occurred on 8 October 2015, with a 40% illuminated Venus reappearing from behind the unlit limb of a 15% sunlit Moon. The event was visible in dark skies throughout Central Australia and was recorded by David and Joan Dunham (of the International Occultation Timing Association) using a 10" f/4 Newtonian with a Watec 120N+ video camera from a location just north of Alice Springs. They also observed the event visually with an 8" SCT telescope. Neither the real-time visual observation nor close visual inspection of the video recording showed any sign of the dark side of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6TsRBQaMzI 2015 October 8 Reappearance of Venus from Australia], by Dunham D.W. &amp; J.B. (2015-Oct-08).&lt;/ref&gt; While not conclusive, these observations suggest the ashen light is more likely attributable to telescope optics and eye physiology rather than atmospheric phenomena on Venus.

The [[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|''Akatsuki'']] spacecraft, by Japan's space agency [[JAXA]], was injected into Venus orbit on 7 December 2015. Part of its scientific payload includes the Lightning and Airglow Camera ('''LAC''') which is currently looking for lightning in the [[visible spectrum]] (552-777&amp;nbsp;nm). To image lightning, the orbiter has sight of the dark side of Venus for about 30 minutes every 10 days.&lt;ref name=Takahashi&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1911381T Hunt for optical lightning flash in Venus using LAC onboard Akatsuki spacecraft]. Takahashi, Yukihiro; Sato, Mitsuteru; Imai, Masataka. 19th EGU General Assembly, EGU2017, proceedings from the conference held 23-28 April, 2017 in Vienna, Austria., p.11381.&lt;/ref&gt; No lightning has been detected.&lt;ref name=Takahashi/&gt;

==Hypotheses==

The [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck telescope]] on Hawaii reported seeing a subtle green glow and suggested it could be produced as [[ultraviolet]] light from the Sun splits molecules of carbon dioxide ({{chem|C|O|2}}), known to be common in Venus' atmosphere, into carbon monoxide ({{chem|C|O}}) and oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}). However, the green light emitted as oxygen recombines to form {{chem|O|2}} is thought too faint to explain the effect,&lt;ref name="Winder2012"/&gt; and it is too faint to have been observed with amateur telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/jan-9-1643-astronomer-sees-ashen-light-of-venus-2/ |title=Jan. 9, 1643: Astronomer Sees Ashen Light on Venus |work=Wired Science |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, [[Venera 4]] found the Venusian [[magnetic field]] to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the [[ionosphere]] and the [[solar wind]],&lt;ref&gt;Dolginov, Nature of the Magnetic Field in the Neighborhood of Venus, COsmic Research, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Venus's small [[Magnetosphere of Venus|induced magnetosphere]] provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against [[cosmic radiation]].

It was hypothesized in 1957 by Urey and Brewer that CO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CO{{su|b=2|p=+}} and O{{su|b=2|p=−}} ions produced by the [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the Sun were the cause of the glow.&lt;ref&gt;''Some Topics in Molecular Astronomy''.

Bibliographic Code: 1960JRASC..54...97M&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, it was hypothesized that the Ashen light is an auroral phenomena due to solar particle bombardment on the dark side of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ashen Light: An auroral phenomenon on Venus |journal=Planetary and Space Science |date=June 1969 |last= Levine |first=Joel S. |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=1081–1087 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0032063369900014 |accessdate=2015-09-05 |doi=10.1016/0032-0633(69)90001-4|bibcode = 1969P&amp;SS...17.1081L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, it was thought that the cause of the glow was lightning on Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Discovery of frequent lightning discharges in clouds on Venus |journal=Nature |date=20 March 1980 |last=Ksanfomaliti |first=L.

However, a Monte Carlo simulation program, indicates that the lightning hypothesis as the cause of the glow is incorrect, as not enough light could be transmitted through the atmosphere to be seen from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The transmission to space of the light produced by lightning in the clouds of Venus |journal=Icarus |year=October 1982 |last=Williams |first=Mark A. |last2=Thomason |first2= Larry W. |last3= Hunten |first3=Donald M. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=166–170 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(82)90176-2 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103582901762 |accessdate=2015-09-05 |bibcode = 1982Icar...52..166W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers have speculated it may be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=R.

The vertical scale of the wavefronts plotted is highly exaggerated.]]

'''Astronomical seeing''' refers to the amount of apparent blurring and [[twinkling]] of [[astronomical object]]s like [[star]]s due to [[turbulence|turbulent mixing]] in the [[atmosphere]] of [[Earth]], causing variations of the optical [[refractive index]]. The seeing conditions on a given night at a given location describe how much [[Earth's atmosphere]] perturbs the images of stars as seen through a [[telescope]].

The most common seeing measurement is the [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM) of the optical intensity across the ''seeing disc'' (the [[point spread function]] for imaging through the atmosphere). The FWHM of the point spread function (loosely called seeing disc diameter or "''seeing''") is the best possible [[angular resolution]] that can be achieved by an [[optical telescope]] in a [[long-exposure photography|long-exposure image]], and corresponds to the FWHM of the fuzzy blob seen when observing a [[point source|point-like source]] (such as a star) through the atmosphere. The size of the seeing disc is determined by the seeing conditions at the time of the observation. The best conditions give a seeing disk diameter of ~0.4 [[minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] and are found at high-altitude [[observatory|observatories]] on small islands such as [[Mauna Kea Observatory|Mauna Kea]] or [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory|La Palma]].

Seeing is one of the biggest problems for Earth-based [[astronomy]]. While large [[telescope]]s have theoretically milli-arcsecond resolution, the real image is limited to the average seeing disc during the observation. This can easily mean a factor of 100 between the potential and practical resolution. Starting in the 1990s, new [[adaptive optics]] have been introduced that can help correct for these effects, dramatically improving the resolution of ground-based telescopes.

== Effects ==

| Typical short-exposure negative image of a binary star ([[Zeta Boötis]] in this case) as seen through atmospheric seeing. Each star should appear as a single [[Airy disk|Airy pattern]], but the atmosphere causes the images of the two stars to break up into two patterns of ''speckles'' (one pattern above left, the other below right). The speckles are a little difficult to make out in this image due to the coarse pixel size on the camera used (see the simulated images below for a clearer example). The speckles move around rapidly, so that each star appears as a single fuzzy blob in long exposure images (called a ''seeing disc''). The telescope used had a diameter of about 7''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (see definition of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; below, and example simulated image through a 7''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; telescope).
|}
Astronomical seeing has several effects:
# It causes the images of [[point source]]s (such as stars), which in the absence of atmospheric turbulence would be steady [[Airy disk|Airy patterns]] produced by diffraction, to break up into speckle patterns, which change very rapidly with time (the resulting speckled images can be processed using [[speckle imaging]])
# Long exposure images of these changing speckle patterns result in a blurred image of the point source, called a ''seeing disc''
# The brightness of stars appears to fluctuate in a process known as [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] or twinkling
# Atmospheric seeing causes the fringes in an [[astronomical interferometer]] to move rapidly
# The distribution of atmospheric seeing through the atmosphere (the C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; profile described below) causes the image quality in [[adaptive optics]] systems to degrade the further you look from the location of reference star

The effects of atmospheric seeing were indirectly responsible for the belief that there were [[Martian canal|canals on Mars]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  In viewing a bright object such as Mars, occasionally a [[isoplanetic patch|still patch]] of air will come in front of the planet, resulting in a brief moment of clarity.  Before the use of [[charge-coupled device]]s, there was no way of recording the image of the planet in the brief moment other than having the observer remember the image and draw it later.  This had the effect of having the image of the planet be dependent on the observer's memory and preconceptions which led the belief that Mars had linear features.

The effects of atmospheric seeing are qualitatively similar throughout the visible and near [[infra-red]] wavebands. At large telescopes the long exposure image resolution is generally slightly higher at longer wavelengths, and the timescale (''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - see below) for the changes in the dancing speckle patterns is substantially lower.

== Measures ==
There are three common descriptions of the astronomical seeing conditions at an observatory:
* The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc
* ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the size of a typical "lump" of uniform air within the turbulent atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;

*The C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; profile

These are described in the sub-sections below:

=== The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc ===
Without an atmosphere, a small star would have an apparent size, an "[[Airy disk]]", in a telescope image determined by [[diffraction]] and would be inversely proportional to the diameter of the telescope.  However, when light enters the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the different temperature layers and different wind speeds distort the light waves, leading to distortions in the image of a star. The effects of the atmosphere can be modeled as rotating cells of air moving turbulently. At most observatories, the turbulence is only significant on scales larger than ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (see below—the seeing parameter ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm at visible wavelengths under the best conditions) and this limits the resolution of telescopes to be about the same as given by a space-based 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm telescope.

The distortion changes at a high rate, typically more frequently than 100 times a second. In a typical astronomical image of a star with an [[exposure time]] of seconds or even minutes, the different distortions average out as a filled disc called the point spread function or "seeing disc". The [[diameter]] of the seeing disk, most often defined as the [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM), is a measure of the astronomical seeing conditions.

It follows from this definition that seeing is always a variable quantity, different from place to place, from night to night, and even variable on a scale of minutes. Astronomers often talk about "good" nights with a low average seeing disc diameter, and "bad" nights where the seeing diameter was so high that all observations were worthless.

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;Image:Eps_aql_movie_not_2000.gif|Slow motion movie of the image seen at a telescope when looking at a star at high magnification (negative images). The telescope used had a diameter of about 7''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (see definition of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; below, and example simulated image through a 7''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; telescope). The star breaks up into multiple blobs (speckles) -- entirely an atmospheric effect. Some telescope vibration is also noticeable.&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The FWHM of the seeing disc (or just "seeing") is usually measured in [[arcsecond]]s, abbreviated with the symbol (″). A 1.0″ seeing is a good one for average astronomical sites. The seeing of an urban environment is usually much worse. Good seeing nights tend to be clear, cold nights without wind gusts. Warm air rises ([[convection]]), degrading the seeing, as do wind and clouds. At the best high-altitude mountaintop [[observatory|observatories]], the wind brings in stable air which has not previously been in contact with the ground, sometimes providing seeing as good as 0.4".

=== ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ===
The astronomical seeing conditions at an observatory can be conveniently described by the parameters ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

For telescopes with diameters smaller than ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the resolution of long-exposure images is determined primarily by diffraction and the size of the Airy pattern and thus is inversely proportional to the telescope diameter.

For telescopes with diameters larger than ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the image resolution is determined primarily by the atmosphere and is independent of telescope diameter, remaining constant at the value given by a telescope of diameter equal to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; also corresponds to the length-scale over which the turbulence becomes significant (10–20&amp;nbsp;cm at visible wavelengths at good observatories), and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the time-scale over which the changes in the turbulence become significant. ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; determines the spacing of the actuators needed in an [[adaptive optics]] system, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; determines the correction speed required to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere.

The parameters ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; vary with the wavelength used for the astronomical imaging, allowing slightly higher resolution imaging at longer wavelengths using large telescopes.

The seeing parameter ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is often known as the [[Fried parameter]] (pronounced "freed"), named after [[David L. Fried]]. The atmospheric time constant ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is often referred to as the [[Greenwood frequency|Greenwood time constant]], after [[Darryl Greenwood]].

==== Mathematical description of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ====
[[Image:ast seeing 2r0.png|thumb|Simulated negative image showing what a single (point-like) star would look like through a ground-based telescope with a diameter of 2''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The blurred look of the image is because of [[diffraction]], which causes the appearance of the star to be an [[Airy disk|Airy pattern]] with a central disk surrounded by hints of faint rings.

The atmosphere makes the image break up into several blobs (''speckles''). The speckles move around very rapidly, so that in a long-exposure photograph the star would appear as a single blurred blob.]]
[[Image:ast seeing 20r0.png|thumb|Simulated negative image showing what a single (point-like) star would look like through a ground-based telescope with a diameter of 20''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The atmosphere makes the image break up into several blobs (''speckles''). The speckles move around very rapidly, so that in a long-exposure photograph the star would appear as a single blurred blob.]]

Mathematical models can give an accurate model of the effects of astronomical seeing on images taken through ground-based telescopes. Three simulated short-exposure images are shown at the right through three different telescope diameters (as negative images to highlight the fainter features more clearly—a common astronomical convention). The telescope diameters are quoted in terms of the Fried parameter &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; (defined below). &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a commonly used measurement of the astronomical seeing at observatories. At visible wavelengths, &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; varies from 20&amp;nbsp;cm at the best locations to 5&amp;nbsp;cm at typical sea-level sites.

In reality, the pattern of blobs (''speckles'') in the images changes very rapidly, so that long-exposure photographs would just show a single large blurred blob in the center for each telescope diameter. The diameter (FWHM) of the large blurred blob in long-exposure images is called the seeing disc diameter, and is independent of the telescope diameter used (as long as adaptive optics correction is not applied).

It is first useful to give a brief overview of the basic theory of optical propagation through the atmosphere. In the standard classical theory, light is treated as an oscillation in a field &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.  For monochromatic plane waves arriving from a distant point source with wave-vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;
\psi_{0} \left(\mathbf{r},t\right)
= A_{u}e^{i\left (\phi_{u} + 2\pi\nu t + \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} \right )}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\psi_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex field at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and
time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, with real and imaginary parts corresponding to the electric and magnetic field components, &lt;math&gt;\phi_{u}&lt;/math&gt; represents a phase offset,
&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the light determined by &lt;math&gt;\nu=c\left |
\mathbf{k} \right | / \left ( 2 \pi \right )&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A_{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of the light.

The photon flux in this case is proportional to the square of the amplitude &lt;math&gt;A_{u}&lt;/math&gt;, and the optical phase corresponds to the complex argument of &lt;math&gt;\psi_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. As wavefronts pass through the Earth's atmosphere they may be perturbed by refractive index variations in the atmosphere. The diagram at the top-right of this page shows schematically a turbulent layer in the Earth's atmosphere perturbing planar wavefronts before they enter a
telescope. The perturbed wavefront &lt;math&gt;\psi_{p}&lt;/math&gt; may be related at any given instant to the original planar wavefront &lt;math&gt;\psi_{0}
\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
&lt;math&gt;
\psi_{p} \left(\mathbf{r}\right) = \left ( \chi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)
e^{i\phi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)}\right ) \psi_{0} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; represents the fractional change in wavefront amplitude and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the change in wavefront phase introduced by the atmosphere. It is important to emphasise that &lt;math&gt;\chi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; describe the effect of the Earth's atmosphere, and the timescales for any changes in these functions will be set by the speed of refractive index fluctuations in the atmosphere.

==== The Kolmogorov model of turbulence ====
A description of the nature of the wavefront perturbations introduced by the atmosphere is provided by the [[turbulence#Kolmogorov's theory|Kolmogorov model]] developed by Tatarski,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely used in simulations of astronomical imaging. The model assumes that the
wavefront perturbations are brought about by variations in the refractive index of the atmosphere. These refractive index variations lead directly to phase fluctuations described by &lt;math&gt;\phi_{a}
\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, but any amplitude fluctuations are only brought about as a second-order effect while the perturbed wavefronts propagate from the perturbing atmospheric layer to the telescope. For all reasonable models of the Earth's atmosphere at optical and
infra-red wavelengths the instantaneous imaging performance is dominated by the phase fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\phi_{a}
\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The amplitude fluctuations described by
&lt;math&gt;\chi_{a} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; have negligible effect on the structure of the images seen in the focus of a large telescope.

For simplicity, the phase fluctuations in Tatarski's model are often assumed to have a Gaussian random distribution with the following second-order structure function:
&lt;math&gt;
D_{\phi_{a}}\left(\mathbf{\rho} \right) = \left \langle \left | \phi_{a} \left (
\mathbf{r} \right ) - \phi_{a} \left ( \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{\rho}
\right ) \right | ^{2} \right \rangle _{\mathbf{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_{\phi_{a}} \left ({\mathbf{\rho}} \right )&lt;/math&gt; is the atmospherically induced variance between the phase at two parts of the wavefront separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; in the aperture plane, and &lt;math&gt;&lt;...&gt;&lt;/math&gt; represents the ensemble average.

For the Gaussian random approximation, the structure function of Tatarski (1961) can be described in terms of a single parameter &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
D_{\phi_{a}} \left ({\mathbf{\rho}} \right )
= 6.88 \left ( \frac{\left | \mathbf{\rho} \right |}{r_{0}} \right ) ^{5/3}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; indicates the ''strength'' of the phase fluctuations as it
corresponds to the diameter of a circular telescope aperture at which atmospheric phase perturbations begin to seriously limit the image resolution. Typical &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; values for I band (900&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength) observations at good sites are 20–40&amp;nbsp;cm. It should be noted&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; also corresponds to the aperture diameter for which the variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma ^{2}&lt;/math&gt; of the wavefront phase averaged over the aperture comes approximately to unity:
&lt;math&gt;
\sigma ^{2}=1.0299 \left ( \frac{d}{r_{0}} \right )^{5/3}
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents a commonly used definition for &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, a parameter frequently used to describe the atmospheric conditions at astronomical observatories.

&lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt; can be determined from a measured C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; profile (described below) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{0}=\left ( 16.7\lambda^{-2}( \cos \gamma )^{-1}\int_{0}^{\infty}dh C_{N}^{2}(h) \right )^{-3/5}&lt;/math&gt;

where the turbulence strength &lt;math&gt;C_{N}^{2}(h)&lt;/math&gt; varies as a function of height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; above the telescope, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the angular distance of the [[astronomical source]] from the [[zenith]] (from directly overhead).

If turbulent evolution is assumed to occur on slow timescales, then the timescale ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is simply proportional to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; divided by the mean wind speed.

The refractive index fluctuations caused by Gaussian random turbulence can be simulated using the following algorithm:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/tubbs/papers/spie_06/tubbs_spie_2006_pdf.pdf The effect of temporal fluctuations in r0 on high-resolution observations] {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Robert N. Tubbs  Proc SPIE 6272 pp 93T, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_a (\mathbf{r})=\mbox{Re}[\mbox{FT}[R(\mathbf{k})K(\mathbf{k})]]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi_a(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is the optical phase error introduced by atmospheric turbulence, R (k) is a two-dimensional square array of independent random complex numbers which have a Gaussian distribution about zero and white noise spectrum, K (k) is the (real) Fourier amplitude expected from the Kolmogorov (or Von Karman) spectrum, Re[] represents taking the real part, and FT[] represents a discrete Fourier transform of the resulting two-dimensional square array (typically an FFT).

[[Image:Not telescope sunset 2001.jpg|thumb|Astronomical observatories are generally situated on mountaintops, as the air at ground level is usually more convective. A light wind bringing stable air from high above the clouds and ocean generally provides the best seeing conditions (telescope shown: [[Nordic Optical Telescope|NOT]]).]]

==== Turbulent intermittency ====
The assumption that the phase fluctuations in Tatarski's model have a Gaussian random distribution is usually unrealistic. In reality, turbulence exhibits intermittency.&lt;ref&gt;

* Baldwin, J. E.; Warner, P. J.; Mackay, C. D., The point spread function in Lucky Imaging and variations in seeing on short timescales, Astronomy and Astrophysics V. 480 pp 589B.
&lt;/ref&gt;

These fluctuations in the turbulence strength can be straightforwardly simulated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/tubbs/papers/spie_06/tubbs_spie_2006_pdf.pdf The effect of temporal fluctuations in r0 on high-resolution observations]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Robert N. Tubbs  Proc SPIE 6272 pp 93T, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_a (\mathbf{r})=\mbox{Re}[\mbox{FT}[(R(\mathbf{k})\otimes I(\mathbf{k}))K(\mathbf{k})]]&lt;/math&gt;

where I (k) is a two-dimensional array which represents the spectrum of intermittency, with the same dimensions as R (k), and where &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; represents convolution. The intermittency is described in terms of fluctuations in the turbulence strength &lt;math&gt;C_n^2&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the equation for the Gaussian random case above is just the special case from this equation with:
:&lt;math&gt;I (k) = \delta (|k|)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta()&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]].

=== The &lt;math&gt;C_n^2&lt;/math&gt; profile ===
A more thorough description of the astronomical seeing at an observatory is given by producing a profile of the turbulence strength as a function of altitude, called a &lt;math&gt;C_n^2&lt;/math&gt; profile. &lt;math&gt;C_n^2&lt;/math&gt; profiles are generally performed when deciding on the type of adaptive optics system which will be needed at a particular telescope, or in deciding whether or not a particular location would be a good site for setting up a new astronomical observatory. Typically, several methods are used simultaneously for measuring the &lt;math&gt;C_n^2&lt;/math&gt; profile and then compared. Some of the most common methods include:
# SCIDAR (imaging the ''shadow patterns'' in the scintillation of starlight)
# LOLAS (a small-aperture variant of SCIDAR designed for low-altitude profiling)
# SLODAR
# MASS
# MooSci (11-channel lunar scintillometer for ground level profiling)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Villanueva|first=Steven, Jr.|author2=Depoy, D.

There are also mathematical functions describing the &lt;math&gt;C_n^2&lt;/math&gt; profile. Some are empirical fits from measured data and others attempt to incorporate elements of theory. One common model for continental land masses is known as Hufnagel-Valley after two workers in this subject.

== Overcoming atmospheric seeing ==
[[Image:Seeing Moon.gif|frame|right|An animated image of the [[Moon]]'s surface showing the effects of Earth's atmosphere on the view]]

The first answer to this problem was [[speckle imaging]], which allowed bright objects with simple morphology to be observed with diffraction-limited angular resolution. Later came [[NASA]]'s [[Hubble Space Telescope]], working outside the atmosphere and thus not having any seeing problems and allowing observations of faint targets for the first time (although with poorer resolution than speckle observations of bright sources from ground-based telescopes because of Hubble's smaller telescope diameter). The highest resolution visible and infrared images currently come from imaging optical [[astronomical interferometer|interferometer]]s such as the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]] or [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope]], but those can only be used on very bright stars.

Starting in the 1990s, many telescopes have developed [[adaptive optics]] systems that partially solve the seeing problem. The best systems so far built, such as [[Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research|SPHERE]] on the ESO [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] and [[Gemini Planet Imager|GPI]] on the Gemini telescope, achieve a [[Strehl ratio]] of 90% at a wavelength of 2.2 micrometers, but only within a very small region of the sky at a time.
[[File:A Mix of Colours and Wonder.jpg|thumb|left|Astronomers can make use of an artificial star by shining a powerful laser to correct for the blurring caused by the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Mix of Colours and Wonder|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1524a/|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] A wider field of view can be obtained by using multiple deformable mirrors conjugated to several atmospheric heights and measuring the vertical structure of the turbulence, in a technique known as Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics.

[[File:Jupiter_with_Lucky_Imaging.jpg|thumb|right|This amateur lucky imaging stack using the best of 1800 frames of Jupiter captured using a relatively small telescope approaches the theoretical maximum resolution for the telescope, rather than being limited by seeing.]]
Another cheaper technique, [[lucky imaging]], has had good results on smaller telescopes. This idea dates back to pre-war naked-eye observations of moments of good seeing, which were followed by observations of the planets on cine film after [[World War II]]. The technique relies on the fact that every so often the effects of the atmosphere will be negligible, and hence by recording large numbers of images in real-time, a 'lucky' excellent image can be picked out. This happens more often when the number of r0-size [[isoplanetic patch|patches]] over the telescope pupil is not too large, and the technique consequently breaks down for very large telescopes. It can nonetheless outperform adaptive optics in some cases and is accessible to amateurs. It does require very much longer observation times than [[adaptive optics]] for imaging faint targets, and is limited in its maximum resolution.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''Bavarian School of Public Policy''' (German: ''Hochschule für Politik München'') - is an independent institution within the [[Technical University of Munich]]. The Bavarian School of Public Policy is a unique institution, focusing on future-oriented, transdisciplinary, and applied research and teaching. In cooperation with the Technical University of Munich (TUM), the Bavarian School of Public Policy is dedicated to educating the next generation of political scientists. Technological progress in areas like energy, the environment, climate change, big data, data security, and mobility is having an increasingly important impact on the society. To keep up with tomorrow’s key technologies, the course program at HfP provides an opportunity for students to combine the traditional content of a political science degree with technology modules run by diverse TUM departments.

== History ==

The Bavarian School of Public Policy was founded during the period of upheaval that followed the end of World War II. Prompted by the US military government, and with the participation of constitutional law lecturer Prof. Hans Nawiasky, a decision was made in fall 1948 to set up an institution with the primary goal of teaching the principles of democracy. The discipline of “political science”, already well-established in the US, would serve as the school’s model. On July 14, 1950 the “Hochschule für Politische Wissenschaften” was founded – as a corporation under private law.

On October 27, 1970, the Bavarian Parliament enacted the “Law governing the Bavarian School of Public Policy”. This gave the school the status of an “institutionally autonomous institution at the University of Munich”. This made HfP the only institution of higher education in the Federal Republic of Germany whose legal basis is a higher education act unique to that institution. Moreover, the law was also the first higher education act in the Federal Republic of Germany.

In a law dated February 16, 1981, the Bavarian School of Public Policy was given the legal status of a public body. The main advantage for students was the opportunity to earn a full academic qualification and potentially carry on to complete a PhD.

The Bavarian Parliament instigated the reform process that is currently underway in October 2013. In July 2014, it decided to make the Technical University of Munich (TUM) the new host university for the Bavarian School of Public Policy. This landmark decision opens up new opportunities to develop the discipline of political science by incorporating insights from TUM’s excellent work in the social sciences, the natural sciences and engineering.

The law governing the Bavarian School of Public Policy was enacted in early December 2014, and the Constitution in January 2015. On December 18, 2014 the appointment procedure for the new HfP professorships began. Out of 350 applications from Germany and abroad, seven professors were appointed, who took up their duties at the Bavarian School of Public Policy on 1 March / 1 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/33035/|title=Bavarian School of Public Policy ready for takeoff|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tum.de|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, the Bavarian School of Public Policy moved to its new premises in the Briennerforum at Königsplatz.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfp.tum.de/en/studies/bachelors-program/|title=Hochschule für Politik: Bachelor’s Program|website=www.hfp.tum.de|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==

&lt;big&gt;Bringing Politics and Technology together&lt;/big&gt;

The Bachelor’s degree in Political Science (B.Sc.) started in the 2016/17 Winter Semester. In the 2017/18 Winter Semester the Bavarian School of Public Policy established the new Master's program in Politics &amp; Technology (M.Sc.). Both study programs based on a unique concept worldwide. This provides a "full-scale political science education with possible emphasis in policy areas at the interface between politics and technology". &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Interdisciplinary study program
* Comprehensive grounding in political science with the opportunity to specialize in focus areas at the interface of politics and technology
* Strong practical element, with a three-month, supervised internship requirement

The '''blood–testis barrier''' is a physical barrier between the [[blood vessel]]s and the [[seminiferous tubule]]s of the animal [[testicle|testes]]. The name "blood-testis barrier" is misleading in that it is not a blood-organ barrier in a strict sense, but is formed between [[Sertoli cell]]s of the seminiferous tubule and as such isolates the further developed stages of germ cells from the blood. A more correct term is the "Sertoli cell barrier" (SCB).

==Structure==
The walls of seminiferous tubules are lined with primitive germ layer cells and by [[Sertoli]] cells.&lt;ref name=ganong&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Barrett KE, Barman SM, Boitano S, Brooks H|title=Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 24th Edition|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn= 978-1-25-902753-6|pages=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barrier is formed by [[tight junction]]s, [[adherens junction]]s and [[gap junction]]s between the [[Sertoli cell]]s, which are [[sustentacular cell]]s (supporting cells) of the [[seminiferous tubules]], and divides the seminiferous tubule in a basal compartment (outer side of the tubule, in contact with blood and lymph) and an adluminal compartment (inner side of the tubule, isolated from blood and lymph). The tight junctions are formed by [[intercellular adhesion molecules]] in between cells that are anchored to actin fibers within the cells. For the visualization of the actin fibers within the seminiferous tubules see Sharma et. al.'s immunofluorescence studies.&lt;ref name="Sharma-2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S, Hanukoglu A, Hanukoglu I | title = Localization of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and CFTR in the germinal epithelium of the testis, Sertoli cells, and spermatozoa | journal = J. Mol. Histol. | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–208 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29453757 | doi = 10.1007/s10735-018-9759-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The presence of the SCB allows Sertoli cells to control the adluminal environment in which germ cells (spermatocytes, spermatids and sperm) develop by influencing the chemical composition of the luminal fluid. 
The barrier also prevents passage of [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] agents (bodies or substances that are [[toxicity|toxic]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) into the seminiferous tubules.

The fluid in the lumen of seminiferous tubules is quite different from plasma; it contains very little protein and glucose but is rich in androgens, estrogens, potassium, inositol and Glutamic and [[Aspartic]] acid. This composition is maintained by blood–testis barrier.&lt;ref name="ganong"/&gt;

The barrier also protects the germ cells from blood-borne noxious agents,&lt;ref name="ganong"/&gt;
prevents antigenic products of germ cell maturation from entering the circulation and generating an [[autoimmune]] response,&lt;ref name="ganong"/&gt; and may help establish an osmotic gradient that facilitates movement of fluid into the tubular lumen.&lt;ref name=ganong/&gt;

===Note===

[[Steroids]] penetrate the barrier.
Some [[proteins]] pass from [[Sertoli]] cells to [[Leydig]] cells to function in a [[paracrine]] fashion.&lt;ref name="ganong"/&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Auto-immune response===
The blood–testes barrier can be damaged by trauma to the testes (including torsion or impact), by surgery or as a result of [[vasectomy]].  When the blood–testes barrier is breached, and sperm enters the bloodstream, the [[immune system]] mounts an [[autoimmune]] response against the sperm, since the immune system has not been tolerized against the unique sperm antigens that are only expressed by these cells.  The anti-sperm [[antibody|antibodies]] generated by the immune system can bind to various [[antigen]]ic sites on the surface of the developing sperm within the testes.  If they bind to the head, the sperm may be less able to fertilize an [[ovum|egg]], and, if they bind to the tail, the motility of the sperm can be reduced.

[[File:Clean-In-Place Unit at the World of Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|A clean-in-place unit on display at the [[World of Coca-Cola]] in [[Atlanta]]]]
'''Clean-in-place''' ('''CIP''') is a method of cleaning the interior surfaces of pipes, vessels, process equipment, [[Filtration|filters]] and associated fittings, without disassembly.

Up to the 1950s, closed systems were disassembled and cleaned manually. The advent of CIP was a boon to industries that needed frequent internal cleaning of their processes. Industries that rely heavily on CIP are those requiring high levels of hygiene, and include: [[Dairy#Industrial production|dairy]], [[beverage]], [[Brewing#Brewing process|brewing]], [[Food processing#Industries|processed foods]], [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]], and [[cosmetics]].

The benefit to industries that use CIP is that the cleaning is faster, less labor-intensive and more repeatable, and poses less of a chemical exposure risk. CIP started as a manual practice involving a balance tank, [[Centrifugal Pump|centrifugal pump]], and connection to the system being cleaned. Since the 1950s, CIP has evolved to include fully automated systems with [[programmable logic controller]]s, multiple balance tanks, [[sensors]], [[valves]], [[heat exchangers]], [[data acquisition]] and specially designed spray nozzle systems. Simple, manually operated CIP systems can still be found in use today.

Depending on soil load and process geometry, the CIP design principle is one of the following:
* deliver highly turbulent, high flow-rate solution to effect good cleaning (applies to pipe circuits and some filled equipment).
* deliver solution as a low-energy spray to fully wet the surface (applies to lightly soiled vessels where a static sprayball may be used).
* deliver a high energy impinging spray (applies to highly soiled or large diameter vessels where a dynamic spray device may be used).
Elevated temperature and chemical detergents are often employed to enhance cleaning effectiveness.

== Factors affecting the effectiveness of the cleaning agents ==
'''Temperature of the cleaning solution'''. Elevating the temperature of a cleaning solution increases its dirt removal efficiency. Molecules with high kinetic energy dislodge dirt faster than slow moving molecules of a cold solution.

'''Concentration of the cleaning agent'''. A concentrated cleaning solution will clean a dirty surface much better than a dilute one due to the increased surface binding capacity.

'''Contact time of the cleaning solution'''. The longer the detergent contact period, the higher the cleaning efficiency. After some time, the detergent eventually dissolves the hard stains/soil from the dirty surface.

'''Pressure exerted by the cleaning solution (or turbulence)'''. The turbulence creates an abrasive force that dislodges stubborn soil from the dirty surface.

==Groundwater sources==

Originally developed for cleaning closed systems as described above, CIP has more recently been applied to [[groundwater]] source [[borehole]]s used for high end-uses such as natural mineral / spring waters, food production and carbonated soft drinks (CSD).

Boreholes that are open to the atmosphere are prone to a number of chemical and microbiological problems, so sources for high end-use are often sealed at the surface ([[headworks]]). An air filter is built into the headworks to permit the borehole to inhale and exhale when the water level rises and falls quickly (usually due to the pump being turned on and off) without drawing in airborne particles or contaminants (spores, molds, fungi, bacteria, etc.).

In addition, CIP systems can be built into the borehole headworks to permit the injection of cleaning solutions (such as sodium hypochlorite or other sanitizers) and the subsequent recirculation of the mix of these chemicals and the groundwater. This process cleans the borehole interior and equipment without any invasive maintenance being required.

==Bioreactors, fermentors, and mix vessels==

CIP is commonly used for cleaning bioreactors, fermenters, mix vessels, and other equipment used in biotech manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and food and beverage manufacturing. CIP is performed to remove or obliterate previous [[cell culture]] batch components. It is used to remove in-process residues, control [[bioburden]], and reduce [[endotoxin]] levels within processing equipment and systems. Residue removal is accomplished during CIP with a combination of heat, chemical action, and [[turbulent flow]].

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] published a CIP regulation in 1978 applicable to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The regulation states, “Equipment and utensils shall be cleaned, maintained, and sanitized at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product beyond the official or other established requirements.”&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1978). "Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals: Equipment cleaning and maintenance." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|21|211|67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeatable, reliable, and effective cleaning is of the utmost importance in a manufacturing facility. Cleaning procedures are validated to demonstrate that they are effective, reproducible, and under control. In order to adequately clean processing equipment, the equipment must be designed with smooth stainless steel surfaces and interconnecting piping that has cleanable joints. The chemical properties of the cleaning agents must properly interact with the chemical and physical properties of the residues being removed.

A typical CIP cycle consists of many steps which often include (in order):
* Pre-rinse with WFI (water for injection) or PW ([[purified water]]) which is performed to wet the interior surface of the tank and remove residue. It also provides a non-chemical pressure test of the CIP flow path.
* [[Sodium hydroxide|Caustic]] solution single pass flush through the vessel to drain. Caustic is the main cleaning solution.
* Caustic solution re-circulation through the vessel.
* Intermediate WFI or PW rinse
* Acid solution wash – used to remove mineral precipitates and protein residues.
* Final rinse with WFI or PW – rinses to flush out residual cleaning agents.
* Final air blow – used to remove moisture remaining after CIP cycle.

Critical parameters must be met and remain within the specification for the duration of the cycle. If the specification is not reached or maintained, cleaning will not be ensured and will have to be repeated. Critical parameters include temperature, flow rate/supply pressure, chemical concentration, chemical contact time, and final rinse [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] (which shows that all cleaning chemicals have been removed).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31637">The '''conservation and restoration of time-based media art''' is the study and practice of conserving time-based media and its components. The conservation and restoration of time-based media art is a complex undertaking within the field of conservation that includes understanding both physical and digital conservation methods; there are many facets of time-based media conservation. Its major aim is to detect and monitor short and long-term changes that an artwork may undergo in response to its environment, technological developments, exhibition-design, or technicians' preferences.&lt;ref name="guggenheimENP"&gt;Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420201942/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |archivedate=2015-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time-based media art==
Time-based media is any media that takes time to view, in other words it has a dimension of duration (e.g. five minutes and 10 seconds). Time based-media also contains a technology component, as hardware will be required to view the work.&lt;ref name="smithsonianND"&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). Time-Based Media Art at the Smithsonian. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/tbma/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814070709/http://www.si.edu/tbma/about |archivedate=2015-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time-based media art may be made on a physical media, such as film stock, by a digital means, or a combination of the two. Examples of time-based media include artworks and installations composed of video, audio, film, slides, software-based art or other forms of technology-based artworks.&lt;ref name="smithsonianND"/&gt; A time-based media artwork will consist of the medium- for example a video tape or DVD, the equipment it is played on, and any additional installation components.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"&gt;Iles, Chrissie and Huldisch, Henriette (2005). Keeping Time: On Collecting Film and Video Art in the Museum. In ''Collecting the New''. Altshuler, Bruce (Ed.) NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works containing video and/or audio may at times be referred to as "4D" (four-dimensional), referencing time as the fourth dimension, in addition to the other three dimensions in artwork: length, width, and height. Some time-based media works may overlap, in some respects, with [[New media art|New Media Art]]. Other terms that may also refer to time-based media art include "variable media art", "electronic art", "moving-image art", "technology-based art" and "time-based media". Time-based media collections may be housed in libraries and archives, but time-based media art collections are typically housed in museums, where film and video are collected as fine art and where the collection is typically smaller than in a library or archive.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Museums are more likely to collect video and installation-specific equipment as well.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; The majority of time-based media art is completed on noncommercial films stocks, such as 8mm or 16mm, on videotape, or via a digital means. Time-based media art is differentiated from professional or commercial film-making.

== Preservation and conservation strategies ==
Guidelines for collecting and preserving time-based media art are still evolving, and standards have not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Generally though, video and film must be looked at differently because of the difference between the two mediums, despite having the similarity of being recorded in time. Thus procedures for preservation and conservation will vary between the mediums. Video is a coded system, the information stored on the magnetic or digital tape can be retrieved only with a specific electronic playback device; the images on the film strip, however, are legible on their own, though the projector provides the only means by which they can be viewed.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; When collecting film and video art, a master and at least one sub-master should be obtained. In some cases, and exhibition copy will be obtained as well, in other cases it will be copied by the museum. The Guggenheim Museum provides preservation models for [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_5.pdf Analog Standard Definition Video], [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_6.pdf Digital Standard Definition Video], and [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_7.pdf High Definition Video]. Some conservators recommend that sub-masters be in digital format, as analog tape suffers from [[generation loss]], each time it is duplicated.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Digital formats can suffer from generation loss as well, but it can be avoided through good practice. The sub-master will be used to make new copies of the work and the format of the sub-master needs to be updated when it nears obsolescence. Obsolescence is of particular concern to time-based media art conservationists as many artworks are tied to hardware which is no longer manufactured or supported. File formats reaching obsolescence are another concern, as operating systems change and old formats are replaced by newer ones. Fortunately there are some methods in place to help prevent the total loss of time-based media artworks.

=== Preventative measures ===
The protection against physical loss, technological obsolescence, and digital loss of the file are important aspects of a holistic approach to preservation strategies. Measures must also be taken against environmental factors, such as humidity and pests to ensure the long-term preservation of any physical media. [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] is an important part of any museum preventative conservation plan. It is important to note that preventative measures do not stop deterioration fully, they merely prolong the time it takes for the media to deteriorate. Some media, like certain film stocks, are more stable than others, and some media, such as magnetic videotape are potentially unstable, so again different approaches will be necessary.

==== Storage and maintenance of physical objects ====
Good storage practices help ensure the long-life of an artwork and should be incorporated into a museum's conservation strategy. Storage practices vary by media, so a museum will need to employ a range of storage options to best care for their time-based media art collections. A variety of physical media, such as film, tape, and disks must be stored properly to prevent physical loss. Prevention is the best measure of protection against loss. How media is stored will be dependent on the type of media it is, film has different considerations than disks or videotape. Generally, time-based media storage will require cool temperatures and low humidity.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"&gt;IMAP. (2009). Preservation 101. Retrieved from www.imappreserve.org/pres_101/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film''' - film reels are typically stored in their metal or plastic canisters, laid flat, and stacked on top of each other. Film must be stored in a climate-controlled room due to its susceptibility to heat and humidity. Film may also have additional special storage considerations, which may involve low temperature freezes to retard further damage.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service (n.d.) Cold Storage. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/html/intro1_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303014739/http://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/html/intro1_1.html |archivedate=2015-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; How stable the film is depends largely on the type of stock, but film, if well taken care of, is generally able to last for long periods of time. Film has been made on a variety of materials, including nitrate-based stock (see: [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|Nitrocellulose]]) and acetate-based stocks, and polyester-backed film, each have their own considerations. Nitrate film must be handled carefully, as it is highly flammable; [[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|cellulose acetate film]] stocks are at risk of vinegar syndrome, whereas polyester-backed films are not.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt; Film is stored in a colder environment than other time-based media, and different types of film have different optimum storage temperatures. "Color film should be stored at the coldest possible temperature to reduce fading," 0-30 degrees Fahrenheit, while black and white film can be stored at a temperature of 25-50 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Magnetic Videotape'''- Magnetic videotape was never meant to last, and often has a short life (often only a few decades) especially if exposed to warm or humid conditions.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Videotapes, should be stored in upright, under cool, dry, dust-free conditions.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Videotapes may be stored in polypropylene cases, but without paper inside the cases and "magnetic media should never be stored at temperatures below 46 degrees Fahrenheit".&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt; Magnetic media should also be kept away from magnetic sources, which could demagnetize them.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Optical Digital Media''' - DVDs and CDs are another media that will need storage space. Optical media should be stored in hard plastic jewel cases or other inert plastic containers; avoid storage in plastic sleeves. DVDs and CDs can be stored at temperatures ranging from 62-68 degrees Fahrenheit, with 33-45% relative humidity, but cooler temperatures are recommended to ensure a longer life.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Playback Devices''' - Because time-based media is dependent on technology to view it, playback devices must also be stored. There are some devices that will apply to many works in a time-based media art collection, but specific types of technological devices may be required for the art or preferred by the artist. Maintaining the technology that the time-based media art is played on is one conservation strategy, and what is stored depends on the device. Consumer products, for example, are not meant for repeated viewing on such a large scale and are usually not expected to have a long enough life to maintain the device well into the future. Due to rapid changes in video technology and the high cost of maintaining and storing equipment, storage and maintenance of some playback devices may not practical for a museum as a primary strategy.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Museums do at times need to store obsolete technology though, such as VCRs, old computers, video game systems, etc., particularly if they have been customized for the artwork by the artist. In these cases, conservation strategies could included acquiring spare parts (early on in the acquisition process, before the technology goes out of manufacture), making new components if necessary, and/or "recreating significant features by inexact substitution" (in order words, using the "best match").&lt;ref name="PLManagement"&gt;Laurenson, Pip (2005). The Management of Display Equipment in Time-based Media Installations. Tate Papers. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7344 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926045821/http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7344 |archivedate=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until better solutions are found, keeping and maintaining old technology will remain a necessity. Unlike video equipment, film equipment is far more stable and museums may be more likely to conserve the equipment along with the media because there is less upkeep and film equipment does not need constant replacement due to obsolescence.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; A working projector will always run film. Technological devices should be stored in a clean, climate controlled environment, as humidity can be damaging to electronic components.

====Digital preservation====
Digital files must be preserved and stored as well, otherwise they also risk degradation. Due to the large amounts of storage space that may be needed, museums may want to employ the use of a digital repository that offers digital preservation as a service. Repositories will keep the digital file stored, perform migration (moving the old format to a new, usable format), and typically offer some guarantee of preservation for a specified period of time. Artists may also wish to seek out a repository for storage of their digital artwork. Rhizome's [http://rhizome.org/artbase/?ref=header Artbase] is an online archive that seeks to preserve contemporary digital art. Part of digital media storage is to ensure continuity of the digital file through format changes, thus migration becomes a likely strategy. Some conservators recommend that medium upgrades take place at least every five years, making duplication a main strategy of digital conservation.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt;

Time-based media art that either has an inherent digital component (i.e. a born-digital work) or has been digitized will have the need to be preserved digitally. While this work may not entirely be completed by the conservator, conservators will be aware of the methods used to preserve digital media. The Variable Media Approach, a strategy that comes from the Guggenheim Museum's Variable Media Initiative research, offers a way in which to define the artwork "independently from medium so that the work can be translated once its current medium is obsolete." &lt;ref&gt;Variable Media Network (n.d.) Retrieved from http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is a methodology that approaches a work as independent from its media, so that is may be thought of as a behavior and not something tied to its hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Depocas, Alain  (2003). The Guggenheim Museum and the Daniel Langlois Foundation: The Variable Media Network. Retrieved from http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=98&lt;/ref&gt; This process looks to preserve works despite the uncertainty of technological developments of the future. By making a work independent from its medium, the Variable Media Approach hopes to ensure the life of the artwork well into the future, beyond the obsolescence of all current technology. The approach encompasses four aspects: Storage, Migration, Emulation, and Reinterpretation.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"&gt;Guggenheim Museum. (n.d.). The Variable Media Initiative. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423083848/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media |archivedate=2015-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage is the most basic strategy. Migration simply means to copy the files to new storage media. With migration, conservators preserve the original aspects of the work. Emulation is not as straight forward, it involves some amount of interpretation and is more an imitation of the original work. In the context of digital media, "emulation offers a powerful technique for running an out-of-date computer on a contemporary one".&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; Reinterpretation is the most radical strategy, as it involves recreation of the work.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt;

When formats or storage media become obsolete, "time-based art is typically migrated to newer, accessible platforms".&lt;ref name="SICollaborations"&gt;Smithsonian Institution (2010). Collaborations in Conserving Time-Based Art: A Summary of Discussion Group Sessions of a Colloquium. Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/content/tbma/documents/Time-Based-Art_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505095855/http://www.si.edu/content/tbma/documents/Time-Based-Art_Report.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This will mean updating the file format so that it is playable on newer technology. In some cases, this may not be in keeping with the artist's wishes, as he or she may wish to continue viewings of their work in a specific format. If the format is integral to the work, then upkeep becomes more involved and maintaining the usability of the artwork against the odds of obsolescence in both media and technology becomes a major preservation challenge.&lt;ref name="SICollaborations"/&gt; For this reason, it is encouraged that artists allow for some flexibility in future iterations of the artwork.

=== Examination and documentation ===
Examining and documenting the physical state of an object is an important part of understanding its overall condition. The process of examination and documentation will alert conservators to any problems that need immediate or future attention.

==== Physical examination ====
The physical components of time-based media art must be examined in order to understand their physical condition. With film, physical examination will identify a variety of deterioration processes, such as vinegar syndrome in safety films or color dye fading in color film stock. It is important to identify these early, not only to try to prevent further deterioration, but to intervene with treatment or to make a duplicate copy. Without the examination process, time-based media may degrade beyond repair and possibly be lost entirely.

==== Condition assessments ====
Condition assessments are procedures that are carried out by conservators or other collections care professionals to document the overall condition of an object. These assessments are necessary for all the types of media and technology associated with time-based media art. The assessments stay in the object's file and give future conservators insight into the object's life history. They are performed upon intake of an object into a collection, before and after the object goes on loan, and as necessary. They make note of any physical issues that may be present, such as tears, stains, scratches, or other damage. Film is especially vulnerable to tears and warping, while DVDs and CDs scratch easily. Other issues cannot be seen, such as demagnetization of tape, and require other methods of examination. After the condition of a physical object is assessed, the examiner may recommend treatment if necessary.

Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) recommends taking certain steps to assessing the condition of time-based media: 1) Examine the container - damage on the outside of a container could mean damaged media inside the container. Cases should be examined for dents, stains, and molds or fungus. 2) Check for odor - it may be an indication that the media has deteriorated. Vinegar syndrome emits a vinegar-like odor when present. If media smells musty it could indicate magnetic decay. 3) Examine the surface and the edges - look for powder, dust, dirt and residue, they may indicate deterioration or surface contamination. 4) Identify the format - Knowing the media format is important to proper handling. 5) Play the tape - In some cases it may be necessary to play the tape, a process that if not handled carefully could damage the media. Playback can detect "noise, color shift, distortion, and timing flaws".&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

==== Further documentation ====
Because time-based media has a fourth dimension of time, not present in other types of works, additional documentation to understand the allographic nature of the media may be required, and is recommended. Such documents include the Guggenheim Museum's [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/Iteration_Report.pdf Iteration Report] or [http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/ Variable Media Questionnaire] (VMQ), developed as part of the Variable Media Initiative. The reports collect information about the nature or behavior of the art, so that future curators and conservators can understand it from an artistic and behavioral point of view, as well as a technical point of view. This allows museum professionals to recreate, or make a new iteration, of a particular time-based media artwork. The most common behaviors assigned to time-based media art are interactive, encoded, and networked.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; Because a new viewing of a time-based work can only be an iteration, by making each viewing as close to the artist's desires as possible, the nature of the artwork is conserved.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; The reports collect information such as how to install the artwork, what the space (walls, floors, ceilings, additions) should look like and how it should be arranged, how equipment should be installed, and the technical set-up of the work. Each iteration will be dependent on the physical constraints of the room, so that no two installations will be completely alike. In the VMQ, an artist can order his or her preferences for technical specifications and whether any technology other than the original is allowed to be used. The reports are an important means of understanding how to set-up a work and make it as close to the prior iterations as possible.

===Research===
The history of time-based media art is not long, compared to more traditional forms of art. Much research is still needed in this area in order to move toward and achieve standardizations of practice.

====Research projects====
Two major research projects into time-based media include the Guggenheim Museum's [http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media Variable Media Initiative] and the Smithsonian's [http://www.si.edu/tbma/about Time Based Media and Digital Art Working Group].

=====The Variable Media Initiative=====
The Guggenheim Museum's research has led to the Variable Media Approach, and the Variable Media Questionnaire, a tool of the Variable Media Approach. Beginning in 1999, the Variable Media Initiative is one of the museum's most well-known research initiatives. Originally funded by a grant from the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology in Montreal, Canada, the Variable Media Network (VMN) has grown into a group of international institutions and consultants, including University of Maine, the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archives, Franklin Furnace, Rhizome.org, and Performance Art Festival &amp; Archives &lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; It defined a new approach to documenting contemporary artworks dependent on media, by defining the media as "variable", the artwork becomes untangled from its material aspects, allowing preservation of the work through time without loss of meaning.

===Treatment===
Treatment methods of time-based media art include a mix of both traditional and new techniques. Not all of the work will fall to a conservator, because of the highly technical nature of some of the devices, "certain tasks have to be delegated to respective experts, such as media technicians, video engineers, programmers, film-lab professionals, service technicians, and similar specialists".&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420201942/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |archivedate=2015-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maintenance of the technology is an important part of the conservation process for many works of art.

====Treatment of physical objects====
Time-based media conservators will treat and maintain a variety of objects, including film reels, projectors, computers, TVs, and other types of technology. In cases of videotape and DVDs, migration of the work to another format will more likely be the case. Because there are so many types of media that support time-based media art, treatment of each type will vary. While the prevention of physical film degradation is important, the preservationist's main goal is to preserve the image, as the film itself often decays rapidly and beyond repair (see: [[Film preservation|Film Preservation]]). Film preservation falls into several categories: conservation, which is the "protection of the original film artifact"; duplication, which is the "making of a surrogate copy"; and restoration, which is the attempt to "reconstruct a specific version of a film", which will include piecing together footage from all known sources.&lt;ref name="NFPFGuide"&gt;National Film Preservation Foundation (2004). The Film Preservation Guide: The basics for archives, libraries, and museums. San Francisco, CA: National Film Preservation Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Film restoration will involve the use of duplicates, not the originals.&lt;ref name="NFPFGuide"/&gt; Duplication of an original to a new and stable film stock (a continuing process, as eventually the duplicate will degrade) and repairing tears in the physical film are common types of treatment for film stock. There is a growing need to understand digital processes of duplication as well. While much duplication still requires that film be moved to a new and stable film stock, digital has been advancing as a method of duplication, though many argue it should not be used alone as digital files are unproven in the long term (see again: [[Film preservation|Film Preservation]]).

In the case of technology, treatment will look more like maintenance and will be required to keep the object functional. Obsolescence of technology is a major concern as discussed under Storage and Maintenance of Physical Objects.

=== Education and outreach  ===

====Access====
Access is the process through which artistic content is shared with public, such as providing researchers access to materials for scholarly work. Museums will more likely lend copies for study purposes, though study of the original may be warranted at times.

====Community outreach====
Festivals such as Portland's [[Time-Based Art Festival]] take place annually and are reflective of the general acceptance of time-based media art outside the walls of the museum.

== Education and training==

===Educational programs===
There are few conservation programs specific to time-based media art, but the [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch/en/ Bern University of the Arts] in Bern, Switzerland offers an MA program for the Conservation of Modern Materials and Media. Programs that include some aspect of time-based media include [https://www.rochester.edu/College/FMS/graduate/selznick.html The Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation at the University of Rochester] in New York and [http://cinema.tisch.nyu.edu/page/miap.html New York University's Moving Image Archiving and Preservation program]. At UCLA, there is an [http://mias.gseis.ucla.edu/ M.A. in Moving Image Archive Studies]. The latter three programs deal primarily in archival film preservation, which requires specialized training in a variety of film stocks. A film preservationist must be knowledgeable about and trained to work with many types of film. In a museum context, the film is more likely to be consumer sizes like super 8mm and 16mm, not the 35mm that is used in commercial film making, as they are the preferred medium of artist and amateur filmmakers. Typically, the 35mm stock will be more prevalent in a library or archive. Because of the few formalized education programs in time-based media, most conservators of time-based media art make their way there through a professional path.

===Professional training===
Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) is a non-profit organization that offers training to professionals within time-based media art preservation to include workshops, cataloging training, public programs, one-on-one assessments, and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Independent Media Arts Preservation (n.d.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20682">'''Developmental toxicity''' is any structural or functional alteration, reversible or irreversible, which interferes with [[homeostasis]], [[Auxology|normal growth]], [[cell differentiation|differentiation]], [[Developmental biology|development]] or behavior, and which is caused by environmental insult (including [[drug]]s, [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors such as [[alcohol]], diet, and environmental [[toxic]] chemicals or physical factors).  It is the study of adverse effects on the development of the organism resulting from exposure to toxic agents before conception (either parent), during prenatal development, or post-natally until puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pj5iQgAACAAJ|title = Casarett &amp; Doull's Essentials of Toxicology|last = Klaassen|first = Curtis|last2 = III|first2 = John B.

The effect of the developmental toxicants depends on the type of substance, dose and duration and time of exposure.

|228x228px]]
Certain [[Pathogen]]s are also included since the toxins they secrete are known to cause adverse effects on the development of the organism when the mother or fetus is infected. Developmental toxicology is a science studying adverse developmental outcomes. This term has widely replaced the early term for the study of primarily structural [[congenital abnormalities]], [[teratology]], to enable inclusion of a more diverse spectrum of [[congenital disorder]]s. Typical factors causing developmental toxicity are [[radiation]], infections (e.g. [[rubella]]), maternal metabolic imbalances (e.g. [[alcoholism]], [[diabetes]], [[folic acid]] deficiency), drugs (e.g. [[anticancer drugs]], [[tetracyclines]], many [[hormones]], [[thalidomide]]), and environmental chemicals (e.g. [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]], [[Lead poisoning|lead]], [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[PBDEs]], [[Hexabromocyclododecane|HBCD]], [[tobacco smoke]]). The  first-trimester exposure is considered the most potential for developmental toxicity.

Once fertilization has taken place, the toxicants in the environment can pass through the mother to the developing embryo or fetus across the placental barrier. The fetus is at greatest risk during the first 14th to 60th day of the pregnancy when the major organs are being formed. However, depending on the type of toxicant and amount of exposure, a fetus can be exposed toxicant at any time during pregnancy. For example, exposure to a particular toxicant at one time in the pregnancy may result in organ damage and at another time in the pregnancy could cause death of the fetus and miscarriage. There are a number of chemicals, biological agents (such as bacteria and viruses), and physical agents (such as radiation) used in a variety of workplaces that are known to cause developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/safety/research/files/repro_dev.pdf|title=Workplace Hazards to Reproduction and Development: A Resource for Workers, Employers, Health Care Providers, and Health &amp; Safety Personnel|last=Sharon L.B.S|first=Drozdowsky|publisher=Safety and Health Assessment and Research for Prevention (SHARP) Washington State Department of Labor and Industries|access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental disorders can include a wide range of physical abnormalities, such as bone or organ deformities, or behavioral and learning problems, such as a mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Julvez|first=Jordi|last2=Grandjean|first2=Philippe|date=2009-10-01|title=Neurodevelopmental toxicity risks due to occupational exposure to industrial chemicals during pregnancy|journal=Industrial Health|volume=47|issue=5|pages=459–468|issn=1880-8026|pmid=19834254|doi=10.2486/indhealth.47.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposures to some chemicals during pregnancy can lead to the development of cancer later in the life of the child and are called transgenerational carcinogens. Exposure to toxicants during the second and the third trimester of a pregnancy can lead to slow fetal grown and result in low birth weight.

== History ==
Researchers have been able to ascertain toxicity associated with abnormal development with new breakthrough in [[developmental biology]]. Recognition of the developmental toxic effects of various molecules is recent development.

Terato means monster in Greek. Until the 18th century, the [[Preformationism|preformism]] theory was accepted by which abnormal growth was considered as deformations. The 19th century saw developmental in descriptive embryology where abnormalities were now considered as malformations or errors during a developmental process giving rise to the concept of teratogenesis. By the 20th century, the concept of epigenesis the interaction between a genetic program and environment was established and in the second half of the 20th century researchers had evidence that environmental factors can cause malformations and even trans-generational effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-60492-8|title=Landmarks in Developmental Biology 1883–1924 - Springer|last=Sander|first=Klaus|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-60492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal irradiation and congenital malformations ===
One of the first environmentally induced congenital malformations in humans were recognized as a result of maternal irradiation. Hiroshima (’53), and Nagasaki (’55), had ascertained this fact for the first time based on the records of births occurring before May 31, 1946, but after the atomic bombing (August 6, 1945, in Hiroshima; August 9th, 1945 in Nagasaki). A 20% increase in microcephaly frequency was seen in children with in-utero radiation exposure during the first trimester of the pregnancy (Miller 1956, 1968). Sensitivity to these radiations was seen to be predominantly high during the 7-15th week of [[gestation]].

Two important points observed during this study was:
# The severity and frequency of the congenital abnormalities seen increased with dose of radiation which depended on the closeness to the source or explosion.
# It was determined that there were critical periods of pregnancy when these exposures had the maximum effect on the fetal development.

=== Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) ===
{{main article|Congenital rubella syndrome}}
[[Rubella]] was the first recognized human epidemic of malformations. Following a widespread epidemic of rubella infection in 1940, Norman Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist, reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection in early pregnancy. This indicated that the virus had to cross the placental barrier to reach the fetus and cause malformations. The time of exposure to the virus also had a direct impact on the incidence of congenital malformations with exposure during week 4, 5-8 and 9-12 weeks of pregnancy caused 61%, 26% and 8% of  congenital malformations. This was the first published recognition of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The progeny had congenital eye, heart and ear defects as well as mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rubella.html|title=Pinkbook {{!}} Rubella {{!}} Epidemiology of Vaccine Preventable Diseases {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thalidomide Tragedy(1950) ===
{{main article|Thalidomide}}
Thalidomide was extensively used for the treatment of nausea in pregnant women in late 1950s and early 1960s until it became apparent in the 1960s that it resulted in severe birth defects. Fetus that were exposed to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb malformation by which the limb were not developed or appeared as stumps. Other effects also seen with thalidomide exposure included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jsonpedia.org/annotate/resource/html/en:Thalidomide|title=JSONpedia - Thalidomide|website=jsonpedia.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thalidomide tragedy marked a turning point in toxicity testing, as it prompted United States and international regulatory agencies to develop systematic toxicity testing protocol. The effects of thalidomide led to important discoveries in the biochemical pathways of limb development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=James H.|last2=Scialli|first2=Anthony R.|date=2011-07-01|title=Thalidomide: the tragedy of birth defects and the effective treatment of disease|journal=Toxicological Sciences|volume=122|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfr088|issn=1096-0929|pmid=21507989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and Risk assessment ==
Testing for developmental toxicant is done in different stages:
* ''Fertilization to implantation'' - Fertilization followed by increase in cell number, cleavage and cavitaion to form the blastocyst which gets implanted. Toxicant exposure at this stage usually prevents implantation and results in death. e.g. DDT, nicotine 
* ''Implantation to gastrulation'' - The three germ layers are formed and the cells start migrating out to initiate organogenesis. This is most sensitive stage for alcohol toxicity.  
* ''Organogenesis'' - It is the formation of limbs, organs, nervous system, urinary and genital systems by the process of cell differentiation, migration and cell interactions from the 3rd to 8th week of human gestation. e.g. DES 
* ''Morphogenesis -'' Includes the stages of growth and physiological maturation from week 8 till birth. Teratogenic effects results in deformations and rather than malformations in the fetus.  
* ''Post Natal to puberty'' - Environmental toxicant exposures. 
Because of the complexity of the embryo-fetal development, including the maternal-fetal interactions during gestation, it is important to understand the mechanism of toxicity and test the toxic effect in more than two species before confirming the substance to be a developmental toxicant. Embryo have different critical periods for the organ formation from day 15 to day 60 and hence the susceptibility to toxicant injury is directly related to the period of development.

== Toxicity effects ==
Developmental toxicity is the alterations of the developmental processes (organogenesis, morphogenesis) rather than functional alterations of already developed organs. The effects of the toxicants depends on the dose, threshold and duration. The effects of toxicity are:
# Minor structural deformities - e.g. Anticonvulsant drugs, Warfarin, Retinoic Acid derivatives
# Major structural deformities - e.g. DES (diethylstilbestrol), cigarette smoking
# Growth Retardation - e.g. Alcohol, Polychlorinated Biphenyls
# Functional alterations - e.g. Retinoic Acid derivatives, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Phenobarbitol, Lead
# Death- e.g. Rubella, ACE inhibitors

=== Effects on Neurulation ===
Neurulation is one of the most important stages in the development of vertebrates. It is the process of formation of a flat neural plate which then convolutes to form the hollow neural tube.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Scott (2014). ''Developmental biology''. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the main targets of developmental toxicity and defects in neurulation is a common consequence of toxicant exposure and results in large proportion of human defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60KwBgYNjMoC|title=Developmental Toxicology|last=CaroleAKimmel|date=1994-06-30|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780781701372|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Photo of baby with FAS.jpg|thumb|Facial characteristics that suggest the diagnosis of FAS.]]

=== Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) ===
{{main article|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder}}
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a term that constitutes the set of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during the course of pregnancy. These effects can include physical and cognitive problems. FASD patient usually has a combination of these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html|title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: MedlinePlus|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extent of effect depends on exposure frequency, dose and rate of ethanol elimination from amniotic fluid. FAS disrupts normal development of the fetus, which may cause certain developmental stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recognizing and Managing Children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effects: A Guidebook.|last=B.|first=McCreight,|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since alcohol elimination is slow in a fetus than in an adult and the fact that they do not have a developed liver to metabolize the alcohol, alcohol levels tend to remain high and stay in the fetus longer. Birth defects associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol can occur in the first three to eight weeks of pregnancy before a woman even knows that she is pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/|title=Home {{!}} FASD {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DES (diethylstilbestrol) ===
{{main article|Diethylstilbestrol}}
DES (diethylstilbestrol) is a drug that mimics [[estrogen]], a female hormone. From 1938 until 1971 doctors prescribed this drug to help some pregnant women who had had miscarriages or premature deliveries on the theory that miscarriages and premature births occurred because some pregnant women did not produce enough estrogen naturally to sustain the pregnancy for full term . An estimated 5-10 million pregnant women and the children born during this period were exposed to DES. Currently, DES is known to increase the risk of  breast cancer, and cause a variety of birth-related adverse outcomes exposed female offsprings such as spontaneous abortion, second-trimester pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, stillbirth, neonatal death, sub/infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues . DES is an important developmental toxicant which links the fetal basis of adult disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Casey E.|last2=Fenton|first2=Suzanne E.|date=2013-06-01|title=Exposure to Diethylstilbestrol during Sensitive Life Stages: A legacy of heritable health effects|journal=Birth defects research.

=== Methylmercury ===
{{main article|Methylmercury}}
Methylmercury and inorganic mercury is excreted in human breast milk and infants are particularly susceptible to toxicity due to this compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=J.|last2=Jiang|first2=Z.|last3=Wang|first3=Y.|last4=Qureshi|first4=I.

=== Chlorpyrifos ===
{{main article|Chlorpyrifos}}
It is a [[organophosphate]] [[insecticide]]  which acts on the nervous system of insects by [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|inhibiting acetylcholinesterase]] but are moderately toxic to humans. But it is known have [[developmental]] effects appear in [[fetuses]] and children even at very small doses. It has been shown to cause abnormal reflexes in neonates, poorer mental development in 2 and 3 year olds, poorer verbal IQ in 3 ½ and 5 year old and pervasive developmental disorder in 2, 3 and 3 ½ year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov|title=EPA Archives|website=archive.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental Endocrine disruptors ===
Endocrine disruptors are molecules that alter the structure or function of the endocrine system like DDT, BPA etc. Prenatal BPA exposure is associated with aggression and neurobehaviour changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Joe M.|last2=Yolton|first2=Kimberly|last3=Dietrich|first3=Kim N.|last4=Hornung|first4=Richard|last5=Ye|first5=Xiaoyun|last6=Calafat|first6=Antonia M.|last7=Lanphear|first7=Bruce P.|date=2009-12-01|title=Prenatal Bisphenol A Exposure and Early Childhood Behavior|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=117|issue=12|pages=1945–1952|doi=10.1289/ehp.0900979|issn=0091-6765|pmc=2799471|pmid=20049216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epigenetics ===
{{main article|Epigenetics}}
Most toxicants are known to affect only a fraction of exposed population. This is due to the differences in the genetic makeup of the organisms which affects toxicant metabolism and clearance from the body. Effect of developmental toxicants depends on the genetic makeup of the mother and fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Rebecca E.|last2=Goodman|first2=Jay I.|date=2002-05-01|title=Epigenetics and DNA Methylation Come of Age in Toxicology|url=http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/1/11|journal=Toxicological Sciences|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=11–16|doi=10.1093/toxsci/67.1.11|issn=1096-6080|pmid=11961211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major Developmental Toxicants ==

Some of the known developmental toxicants can be grouped under the following categories:

Reproductive toxins:
* [[Aminopterin]]
* [[Methotrexate]]
* [[Androgen]]
* [[ACE inhibitor]]
* [[Antituberculous drug]]
* [[Caffeine]]

The DQZ transform is the product of the [[Alpha-beta transformation|Clarke transform]] and the Park transform, first proposed in 1929 by [[Robert H. Park]].&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;R.H. Park ''Two Reaction Theory of Synchronous Machines'' AIEE Transactions 48:716-730 (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

The DQZ transform is often used in the context of electrical engineering with [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase circuits]]. The transform can be used to rotate the reference frames of ac waveforms such that they become dc signals. Simplified calculations can then be carried out on these dc quantities before performing the inverse transform to recover the actual three-phase ac results. As an example, the DQZ transform is often used in order to simplify the analysis of three-phase synchronous machines or to simplify calculations for the control of three-phase [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]]. In analysis of three-phase synchronous machines the transformation transfers three-phase stator and rotor quantities into a single rotating reference frame to eliminate the effect of time-varying inductances.

==Introduction==
The DQZ transform is made of the Park and Clarke transformation matrices. The Clarke transform (named after [[Edith Clarke]]) converts vectors in the ''ABC'' reference frame to the ''XYZ'' (often ''&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;z'') reference frame. The primary value of the Clarke transform is isolating that part of the ''ABC''-referenced vector which is common to all three components of the vector; it isolates the common-mode component (i.e., the ''Z'' component). The power-invariant, right-handed, uniformly-scaled Clarke transformation matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;K_{C} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

To convert an ''ABC''-referenced column vector to the ''XYZ'' reference frame, the vector must be pre-multiplied by the Clarke transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{u}_{XYZ} = K_{C}\cdot \vec{u}_{ABC}
&lt;/math&gt;.
And, to convert back from an ''XYZ''-referenced column vector to the ''ABC'' reference frame, the vector must be pre-multiplied by the inverse Clarke transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{u}_{ABC} = K_{C}^{-1}\cdot \vec{u}_{XYZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The Park transform (named after [[Robert H. Park]]) converts vectors in the ''XYZ'' reference frame to the ''DQZ'' reference frame. The primary value of the Park transform is to rotate the reference frame of a vector at an arbitrary frequency. The Park transform shifts the frequency spectrum of the signal such that the arbitrary frequency now appears as "dc" and the old dc appears as the negative of the arbitrary frequency. The Park transformation matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;K_{P} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''&amp;theta;'' is the instantaneous angle of an arbitrary ''&amp;omega;'' frequency. To convert an ''XYZ''-referenced vector to the ''DQZ'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the Park transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{DQZ} = K_{P}\cdot u_{XYZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.
And, to convert back from a ''DQZ''-referenced vector to the ''XYZ'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the inverse Park transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{XYZ} = K_{P}^{-1}\cdot u_{DQZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The Clarke and Park transforms together form the ''DQZ'' transform:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{CP} = K_{P}\cdot K_{C}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; \frac{-1}{2} &amp; \frac{-1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \to \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\
   \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The inverse transform is:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{CP}^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
   \cos{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
   \cos{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

To convert an ''ABC''-referenced vector to the ''DQZ'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the DQZ transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{DQZ} = K_{CP}\cdot u_{ABC}
&lt;/math&gt;.
And, to convert back from a ''DQZ''-referenced vector to the ''ABC'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the inverse DQZ transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{ABC} = K_{CP}^{-1}\cdot u_{DQZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.

To really understand this transform better, a derivation of the transform is included.

==Derivation==

===The Park transform derivation===

The Park transform is based on the concept of the [[dot product]] and projections of vectors onto other vectors. First, let us imagine two unit vectors, &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; (the unit vectors, or axes, of the new reference frame from the perspective of the old reference frame), and a third, arbitrary, vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;. We can define the two unit vectors and the arbitrary vector in terms of their [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinates in the old reference frame:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D} =
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{X}
   + \sin{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Q} =
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{X}
   + \cos{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY} =
   v_{X}\hat{u}_{X}
   + v_{Y}\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are the unit basis vectors of the old coordinate system and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; unit vectors (i.e., the angle between the two reference frames). The projection of the arbitrary vector onto each of the two new unit vectors implies the dot product:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{D} =
   \hat{u}_{D}\cdot \vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \cos{\left(\theta\right)} v_{X}
   + \sin{\left(\theta\right)} v_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_{Q} =
   \hat{u}_{Q}\cdot \vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} v_{X}
   + \cos{\left(\theta\right)} v_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
So, &lt;math&gt;v_{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; onto the &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; axis, and &lt;math&gt;v_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; onto the &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; axis. These new vector components, &lt;math&gt;v_{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, together compose the new vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{DQ}&lt;/math&gt;, the original vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the new ''DQ'' reference frame.
[[File:DQZ 8.svg|frameless|center|358px|Projection of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; onto the ''DQ'' reference frame.]]

Notice that the positive angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; above caused the arbitrary vector to rotate backwards when transitioned to the new ''DQ'' reference frame. In other words, its angle with respect to the new reference frame is less than its angle to the old reference frame. This is because the reference frame, not the vector, was rotated forwards. Actually, a forwards rotation of the reference frame is identical to a negative rotation of the vector.


The operation above can be summarized by a single matrix equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{DQ} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;.
This tensor can be expanded to three-dimensional problems, where the axis about which rotation occurs is left unaffected. In the following example, the rotation is about the ''Z'' axis, but any axis could have been chosen:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{P} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Clarke transform derivation===

====The ABC unit basis vectors====
Consider a three-dimensional space with unit basis vectors ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''. The sphere in the figure below is used to show the scale of the reference frame for context and the box is used to provide a rotational context.
[[File:DQZ 1.svg|frameless|center|358px|''ABC'' unit basis vectors.]]

Typically, in electrical engineering (or any other context that uses three-phase systems), the three-phase components are shown in a two-dimensional perspective. However, given the three phases can change independently, they are by definition orthogonal to each other. This implies a three-dimensional perspective, as shown in the figure above. So, the two-dimensional perspective is really showing the projection of the three-dimensional reality onto a plane.
[[File:DQZ 6.svg|frameless|center|358px|Two-dimensional perspective of a three-dimensional reality.]]
Three-phase problems are typically described as operating within this plane. In reality, the problem is likely a balanced-phase problem (i.e., ''v&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0) and the net vector
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = v_{A}\hat{u}_{A} + v_{B}\hat{u}_{B} + v_{C}\hat{u}_{C}&lt;/math&gt;
is always on this plane.

====The AYC' unit basis vectors====
To build the Clarke transform, we actually use the Park transform in two steps. Our goal is to rotate the ''C'' axis into the corner of the box. This way the rotated ''C'' axis will be orthogonal to the plane of the two-dimensional perspective mentioned above. The first step towards building the Clarke transform requires rotating the ''ABC'' reference frame about the ''A'' axis. So, this time, the 1 will be in the first element of the Park transform:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
   0 &amp; -\sin{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The following figure shows how the ''ABC'' reference frame is rotated to the ''AYC' '' reference frame when any vector is pre-multiplied by the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; matrix. The ''C' '' and ''Y'' axes now point to the midpoints of the edges of the box, but the magnitude of the reference frame has not changed (i.e., the sphere did not grow or shrink).This is due to the fact that the norm of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; tensor is 1: ||''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|| = 1. This means that any vector in the ''ABC'' reference frame will continue to have the same magnitude when rotated into the ''AYC' '' reference frame.
[[File:DQZ 2.svg|frameless|center|358px|''AYC' '' unit basis vectors. The ''C' '' and ''Y'' axes now point to the edges of the box, but the magnitude has not changed.]]

====The XYZ unit basis vectors====
Next, the following tensor rotates the vector about the new ''Y'' axis in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to the ''Y'' axis (The angle was chosen so that the ''C' '' axis would be pointed towards the corner of the box.):
:&lt;math&gt;K_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; : \theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right) \to 35.26^\circ&lt;/math&gt;,
or
:&lt;math&gt;K_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that the distance from the center of the sphere to the midpoint of the edge of the box is {{math|{{radical|2}}}} but from the center of the sphere to the corner of the box is {{math|{{radical|3}}}}. That is where the 35.26° angle came from.

The norm of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix is also 1, so it too does not change the magnitude of any vector pre-multiplied by the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix.
[[File:DQZ 3.svg|frameless|center|358px|''XYZ'' unit basis vectors. The ''Z'' axis (rotated ''C' '' axis) now points into the corner of the box.]]

====The zero plane====
At this point, the ''Z'' axis is now orthogonal to the plane in which any ''ABC'' vector without a common-mode component can be found. Any balanced ''ABC'' vector waveform (a vector without a common mode) will travel about this plane. This plane will be called the zero plane and is shown below by the hexagonal outline.
[[File:DQZ 4.svg|center|358px|Plane of the vectors without common mode indicated by the hexagonal outline. The ''Z'' axis is orthogonal to this plane, and the ''X'' axis is parallel to the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane.]]

The ''X'' and ''Y'' basis vectors are on the zero plane. Notice that the ''X'' axis is parallel to the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane. The ''X'' axis is slightly larger than the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane. It is larger by a factor of {{math|{{radical|3/2}}}}. The arbitrary vector did not change magnitude through this conversion from the ''ABC'' reference frame to the ''XYZ'' reference frame (i.e., the sphere did not change size). This is true for the power-invariant form of the Clarke transform. The following figure shows the common two-dimensional perspective of the ''ABC'' and ''XYZ'' reference frames.
[[File:DQZ 7.svg|center|358px|Two-dimensional perspective of the ''ABC'' and ''XYZ'' reference frames.]]

It might seem odd that though the magnitude of the vector did not change, the magnitude of its components did (i.e., the ''X'' and ''Y'' components are longer than the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' components). Perhaps this can be intuitively understood by considering that for a vector without common mode, what took three values (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' components) to express, now only takes 2 (''X'' and ''Y'' components) since the ''Z'' component is zero. Therefore, the ''X'' and ''Y'' component values must be larger to compensate.

====Combination of tensors====
The power-invariant Clarke transformation matrix is a combination of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tensors:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{C} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
   \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{K_2}\cdot\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{K_1}&lt;/math&gt;,
or
:&lt;math&gt;K_{C} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that when multiplied through, the bottom row of the ''K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' matrix is 1/{{math|{{radical|3}}}}, not 1/3. (It should be noted that Edith Clarke did use 1/3 for the power-variant case.) The ''Z'' component is not exactly the average of the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' components. If only the bottom row elements were changed to be 1/3, then the sphere would be squashed along the ''Z'' axis. This means that the ''Z'' component would not have the same scaling as the ''X'' and ''Y'' components.
[[File:DQZ 9.svg|frameless|center|358px|''K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' frame (blue) and the original Edith matrix (green).]]
As things are written above, the norm of the Clarke transformation matrix is still 1, which means that it only rotates an ''ABC'' vector but does not scale it. The same cannot be said for Clarke's original transform.

====Power-variant form====

It is sometimes desirable to scale the Clarke transformation matrix so that the ''X'' axis is the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane. To do this, we uniformly apply a scaling factor of {{math|{{radical|2/3}}}} to get the power-variant Clarke transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\hat{C}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot 
\underbrace{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{K_C}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\hat{C}} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{2}{3} &amp; -\frac{1}{3} &amp; -\frac{1}{3} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
   \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This will necessarily shrink the sphere by a factor of {{math|{{radical|2/3}}}} as shown below. Notice that this new ''X'' axis is exactly the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane.
[[File:DQZ 5.svg|center|358px|The scaled ''XYZ'' reference frame of the power-variant Clarke transform.]]

With the power-variant Clarke transform, the magnitude of the arbitrary vector is smaller in the ''XYZ'' reference frame than in the ''ABC'' reference frame (the norm of the transform is {{math|{{radical|2/3}}}}), but the magnitudes of the individual vector components are the same (when there is no common mode). So, as an example, a signal defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
   A \\
   B \\
   C
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\omega t\right)} \\
   \cos{\left(\omega t - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\
   \cos{\left(\omega t + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
becomes, in the ''XYZ'' reference frame,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
   X \\
   Y \\
   Z
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\omega t\right)} \\
   \cos{\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \\
   0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,
a new vector whose components are the same magnitude as the original components: 1. In many cases, this is an advantageous quality of the power-variant Clarke transform.

===The DQZ transform===

The DQZ transformation uses the Clarke transform to convert ''ABC''-referenced vectors into two differential-mode components (i.e., ''X'' and ''Y'') and one common-mode component (i.e., ''Z'') and then applies the Park transform to rotate the reference frame about the ''Z'' axis at some given speed. The ''X'' component becomes the ''D'' component, which is in ''direct'' alignment with the vector of rotation, and the ''Y'' component becomes the ''Q'' component, which is at a ''quadrature'' angle to the direct component. The DQZ transform is
:&lt;math&gt;K_{CP} = K_{P}\cdot K_{C}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; \frac{-1}{2} &amp; \frac{-1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Code implementation==

For computational efficiency, it makes sense to keep the Clarke and Park transforms separate and not combine them into one transform.

A computationally-efficient implementation of the power-invariant Clarke transform is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
X = (2*A – B – C)*(1/sqrt(6));
Y = (B – C)*(1/sqrt(2));
Z = (A + B + C)*(1/sqrt(3));
&lt;/source&gt;
while its inverse is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
A = (1/sqrt(3))*Z;
B = A - (1/sqrt(6))*X;
C = B – (1/sqrt(2))*Y;
B += (1/sqrt(2))*Y;
A += (sqrt(2/3))*X;
&lt;/source&gt;
A computationally-efficient implementation of the power-variant Clarke transform is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
X = (2*A – B – C)*(1/3);
Y = (B – C)*(1/sqrt(3));
Z = (A + B + C)*(sqrt(2)/3);
&lt;/source&gt;
while its inverse is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
A = (1/sqrt(2))*Z;
B = A – (1/2)*X;
C = B – (sqrt(3)/2)*Y;
B += (sqrt(3)/2)*Y;
A += X;
&lt;/source&gt;
Evidently, the constant coefficients could be pre-calculated.

A computationally-efficient implementation of the Park transform is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
co = cos(theta);
si = sin(theta);

D = co*X + si*Y;
Q = co*Y - si*X;
&lt;/source&gt;
while its inverse is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
co = cos(theta);
si = sin(theta);

X = co*D - si*Q;
Y = si*D + co*Q;
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, it makes sense to only calculate &lt;tt&gt;co&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;si&lt;/tt&gt; once if both the Park and inverse Park transforms are going to be used.

==Example==
In electric systems, very often the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' values are oscillating in such a way that the net vector is spinning. In a balanced system, the vector is spinning about the ''Z'' axis. Very often, it is helpful to rotate the reference frame such that the majority of the changes in the abc values, due to this spinning, are canceled out and any finer variations become more obvious.

The DQZ transformation can be thought of in geometric terms as the projection of the three separate sinusoidal phase quantities onto two axes rotating with the same angular velocity as the sinusoidal phase quantities.
[[File:Geometric interpretation of dqo transform.jpg|frameless|center|716px|DQZ example.]]
Shown above is the DQZ transform as applied to the stator of a synchronous machine. There are three windings separated by 120 physical degrees. The three phase currents are equal in magnitude and are separated from one another by 120 electrical degrees. The three phase currents lag their corresponding phase voltages by &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The ''DQ'' axes are shown rotating with angular velocity equal to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, the same angular velocity as the phase voltages and currents. The ''D'' axis makes an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta = \omega t&lt;/math&gt; with the phase ''A'' winding which has been chosen as the reference.The currents &lt;math&gt;I_D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_Q&lt;/math&gt; are constant dc quantities.

==Comparison with other transforms==

===Park's transformation===

The transformation originally proposed by Park differs slightly from the one given above. In Park's transformation q-axis is ahead of d-axis, qd0, and the \theta angle is the angle between phase-a and q-axis, as given below:

:&lt;math&gt;P= \frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta)&amp;\cos(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp;\cos(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}) \\
\sin(\theta)&amp; \sin(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp; \sin(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}) \\
\frac{1}{2}&amp;\frac{1}{2}&amp;\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos(\theta)&amp; \sin(\theta)&amp;1\\
\cos(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp; \sin(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp;1\\
\cos(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp; \sin(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp;1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===αβγ transform===
{{Main article|αβγ transform}}

The dqo transform is conceptually similar to the [[αβγ transform]]. Whereas the dqo transform is the projection of the phase quantities onto a rotating two-axis reference frame, the αβγ transform can be thought of as the projection of the phase quantities onto a stationary two-axis reference frame.

In [[astronomy]], '''dropout''' is a [[radiation]] source whose radiation intensity falls off sharply below a specific [[wavelength]]. The source will be easily visible when its light is filtered to wavelengths longer than the cutoff value, but will "drop out" of the image when it is filtered to wavelengths shorter than the threshold.

This is a standard method for locating distant galaxies in [[Hubble Deep Field|deep field images]]. Because the [[hydrogen]] that surrounds the galaxies absorbs light with a wavelength around 100 nanometers, the galaxies have a natural dropout threshold. The exact wavelength of this threshold is [[redshift]]ed and can be used to determine the distance to the galaxy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16436">The term '''emotional literacy''' has often been used in parallel to, and sometimes interchangeably with, the term [[emotional intelligence]]. However, there are important differences between the two. Emotional literacy was noted as part of a project advocating humanistic education in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lotecka, L. (1974) A project advocating humanistic education: An evaluation of its effect on public school teachers. Journal of Drug Education, 4(2), 141-149.  Available at http://elguides.cc/AProject.pdf (accessed April 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==

The term was used extensively by [[Claude Steiner]] (1997)&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;Steiner, C. with Perry, P. (1997) Achieving Emotional Literacy. London: Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt; who says:

Emotional literacy is made up of 'the ability to understand your [[emotions]], the ability to listen to others and [[empathise]] with their emotions, and the ability to express emotions productively. To be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you. Emotional literacy improves relationships, creates loving possibilities between people, makes co-operative work possible, and facilitates the feeling of community.&lt;ref name=Steiner/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Steiner breaks emotional literacy into 5 parts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Knowing your feelings.
#Having a sense of [[empathy]].
#Learning to manage our emotions.
#Repairing [[emotional problem]]s.
#Putting it all together: emotional interactivity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having its roots in [[counseling]], it is a social definition that has interactions between people at its heart.  According to Steiner emotional literacy is about understanding your feelings and those of others to facilitate relationships, including using dialogue and self-control to avoid negative arguments.  The ability to be aware and read other people's feelings enables one to interact with them effectively so that powerful emotional situations can be handled in a skillful way.  Steiner calls this "emotional interactivity". Steiner's model of emotional literacy is therefore primarily about dealing constructively with the emotional difficulties we experience to build a sound future. He believes that personal power can be increased and relationships transformed. The emphasis is on the individual, and as such encourages one to look inward rather than to the social setting in which an individual operates.

==British context==

In Britain, the term 'emotional literacy' is often used and has developed, building on the work of Steiner and Goleman&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than [[IQ]]. London: Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt;  as a social construction – as opposed to the more individualistic 'emotional intelligence' with the attempts to measure it as if emotions were measurable in a relatively rational way.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"&gt;Boler, M. (1999) Feeling power: emotions and education. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, G. 2004"&gt;Matthews, G., Zeidner, M. and Roberts, R. D. (2004) Emotional intelligence: science and myth. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burman, E. 2009"&gt;Burman, E. (2009) Beyond 'emotional literacy' in [[Women's studies|feminist]] and [[educational research]], [[British Educational Research Association|British Educational Research Journal]], 35(1): 137-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators did not like the way that 'emotional intelligence' focused so much on the individual and there were clear attempts to avoid the narrow EQ tests that were in use for two reasons:
#The idea of an EQ test had resonance with discredited{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=December 2015}} [[psychometric measure]]s of intelligence such as [[IQ test]]s.
#People were also concerned with the way that pupils could be subject to even more control through the introduction of emotional intelligence into the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, G. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"&gt;Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] in England and Wales emphasized a range of cognitive skills that were controlled through exams. Educators saw the need to expand the range of skills that pupils required and were also concerned with [[social inclusion]]. The Labour  Government provided an overarching rationale for this with its promotion of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;DfCSF (2007) The Children's Plan: Building brighter futures. London: Department for Children, Schools and Families.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DfCSF (2008) Indicators of a school's contribution to well-being. London: Ofsted&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when the [[Department of Children, Schools and Families]] developed a scheme for schools – called the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) – it was  based on Goleman's definition of [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Goleman, D. 1996"&gt;Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than IQ. London: Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skills 2007"&gt;Department for Education and Skills (2007) Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning for secondary schools (SEAL) Introductory Guide. Ref: 00043-2007DWO-EN-04  London: HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence any distinctions between the terms emotional intelligence and emotional literacy were blurred. Even so, key educators in Britain continued to use the term emotional literacy. Emotional literacy took on an aspect that was concern with personal growth. For example, the importance of developing relationships is, to a degree, in Weare's definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ability to understand ourselves and other people, and in particular to be aware of, understand, and use information about the emotional states of ourselves and others with competence. It includes the ability to understand, express and manage our own emotions, and respond to the emotions of others, in ways that are helpful to ourselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;Weare, K. (2003) Developing the emotionally literate school. London: Paul Chapman. p2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, the organization Antidote&lt;ref&gt;Antidote (2010) Definition of Emotional Literacy. Available at http://www.antidote.org.uk/learning/about.php (accessed April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; defined emotional literacy as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the practice of interacting with others in ways that build understanding of our own and others' emotions, then using this understanding to inform our actions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These definitions acknowledge both the individual and other people and so [[inter-personal relationships]] and the need for dialogue are included. Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, P. (2001) Nurturing Emotional Literacy. London: David Fulton.&lt;/ref&gt; has taken a broad approach to emotional literacy in a Local Education Authority (LEA) where he considers its development is important for teachers as well as pupils.

However, there was still an underlying assumption about the individual and how they develop as if they were culturally isolated and separate from factors such as religion and gender.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt; Also, the development of emotional literacy was justified by arguing that its introduction would help to improve other factors such as behavior, [[attendance]] and [[academic achievement]]. Boler&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;  researched four of the emotional programs in America. She pointed out that the programs tended to view pupils as individuals who are in need of development through enabling them to control their impulses. This can mean that pupils are to become responsible for their own control and that other social factors can be ignored. It is possible that these programs can open the way for greater control of pupils with even their emotions being assessed.
On the one hand the development of emotional literacy programs can be seen as progressive, but on the other the focus seems quite inward, as there is little reference leading to any broader concept of social and political reform.&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt;

In the same way that Goleman&lt;ref name="Goleman, D. 1996"/&gt; discusses emotional intelligence educational programs, emotional literacy programs can also be more about coping with the social and political status quo in a caring, interactive and emotionally supportive environment than with any systematic attempt to move beyond it to social improvement.

==Culturally situated==

Matthews (2006)&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt; argues against the concept of 'emotional intelligence' and for a developed definition of 'emotional literacy'.  His starting point is that all social and emotional interactions take place in a cultural context and that generally all emotions are felt because of interactions with other people.
He argues that a group may, for example, contain men and women and people from a range of ethnicities. One could judge a person's emotional literacy by observing what they brought to the situation, the way they interacted and the degree to which they showed empathy, and, the recognition of "self" and "others". The way that one can reliably gauge the emotional literacy of a person is to see them interacting in a group and see how they behave towards other people of different genders, sexuality and social class.  Hence, it makes little sense to talk about emotional literacy of a person as if it were separate from such factors – someone may be able to empathize with people of their own sex, but not different sexualities or religions. Also, one may think that they can empathize with the other sex, or another religion, but the other person may not agree with them. Indeed, the views of other people are essential in deciding upon such factors.  There is always a social context and in any context power differentials operate.  Any form of paper and pen test will only give access to what a person thinks, not to the important view of how others think.  For example, many men (and women) would say that they were not sexist, yet a person from the opposite sex may not agree. A person cannot tell how well they, say, empathize, only other people tell them if they are. A manager may think they are self-confident, open and friendly, but others find him or her aggressive and [[bullying]].

Hence, according to Matthews, emotional literacy is a social process that takes place in a social setting, is something that is never really achieved, and has to be seen in conjunction with others. This indicates that key components of emotional literacy, which is a continual process, that includes dialogue, [[Ambiguity tolerance|acceptance of ambiguity]] and the ability to reflect. Judgments are made on a person's individual-in-group emotional literacy.  He argues:

{{quote|text=Emotional literacy involves factors such as people understanding their own and others' emotional states; learning to manage their emotions and to empathize with others. It also includes the recognition that emotional literacy is both an individual development and a collective activity and is both about self-development and the building of community so that ones own sense of emotional well-being grows along with that of others, and not at their expense. Emotional literacy involves connections between people and working with their differences and similarities while being able to handle ambiguity and contradiction. It is a dynamic process through which the individual develops emotionally and involves culture and empowerment. For example, it includes understanding how the nature of social class, 'race' and gender (sexism and homophobia) impinge on peoples' emotional states to lead to an understanding of how society could change. Hence it incorporates an understanding of power exchanges between people and a challenging of power differentials.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press. pp178&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On this view emotional literacy is developed to help people understand themselves, others and the power connections between them. Matthews links emotional literacy to equality and social justice. Emotional literacy is not just to be "nice", but also to know when to stand up for viewpoints and fight for a case. It is not about more control over people, but less. As McIntosh and Style&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, P. and Style, E. (1999) Social, Emotional and Political Learning, in Cohen, J. (ed.) Educating Minds and Hearts. Social and Emotional Learning and the Passage into Adolescence. New York: Teachers College. p137&lt;/ref&gt; argue schools are always involved in social, emotional and power relations, yet "power relations are a taboo subject in K-12 schooling and in the majority culture of the United States. Power relations are therefore little understood systemically. Students, however, learn about power by watching, by imitating, by avoidance of what they fear".

==In education==

In general, most of the criticisms of courses to promote pupils' emotional development have been directed at those that develop emotional intelligence. For example, there are the courses developed in the USA and Britain.&lt;ref name="Skills 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casel (2003) Safe and Sound. An educational leader's guide to evidence-based social and emotional learning programs. Chicago: University of Chicago Press  (Available at: www.casel.org/downloads/Safe%20and%20Sound/1A_Safe_&amp;_Sound.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elias, M., Zins, J., Weissberg, R. and Frey, K. (1997) Promoting Social and Emotional Learning. Virginia USA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt; The critiques of these courses include that:
# Emotional intelligence/literacy courses can lead to more control over pupils with them being more defined in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burman, E. 2009"/&gt;
# The assessment of emotional intelligence/literacy can lead to pupils being labeled as inadequate.
# Emotional intelligence courses can locate problems in the individual that are also a function of how society is organised.
# When courses are taught it is often assumed that pupils are emotionally ready to deal with what is on the curriculum, whereas they may not be.
# The whole agenda of teaching emotional development can lead to pupils being seen as deficit in emotional control and so can depress their  potential to have faith in future goals&lt;ref&gt;Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Emotional intelligence courses have moral and ethical aspects that are not made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Rietti, S. (2009) Emotional intelligence and moral agency: Some worries and a suggestion, Philosophical Psychology, 22(2): 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews has tried to avoid some of the difficulties.  For example, his strategies for the classroom mean that pupils only develop when, and in what areas, they are able.  Emotional development between the genders has been the focus of research&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (2004) Promoting emotional literacy, equity and interest in KS3 science lessons for 11- to 14-year-olds; the 'Improving Science and Emotional Development' project, International Journal of Science Education, 26(3): 281-308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B., Kilbey, T., Doneghan, C. and Harrison, S. (2002) Improving attitudes to science and citizenship through developing emotional literacy, School Science Review, 84(307): 103-114.&lt;/ref&gt; with a small reference to 'race'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. and Sweeney, J. (1997) Collaboration in the science classroom to tackle racism and sexism, Multi-cultural Teaching, 15(3): 33-36.&lt;/ref&gt; But these are limited in strategies and do not tackle fully the critiques.

Models of food-sharing are based upon general [[evolutionary theory]]. When applied to human behavior, these models are considered a branch of [[human behavioral ecology]]. Several types of food-sharing models have been developed, including [[kin selection]], [[reciprocal altruism]], tolerated theft, group cooperation, and costly signaling. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism models of food-sharing are based upon evolutionary concepts of kin selection and [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]]. Since the theoretical basis of these models is formulated around [[reproductive fitness]], one underlying assumption of these models is that greater resource accumulation increases reproductive fitness. Food-sharing has been theorized as an important development in early human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Isaac |first=Glynn |title=The Food-sharing Behavior of Protohuman Hominids |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1038/scientificamerican0478-90 |journal=Scientific American |volume=238 |issue=4 |pages=90–108 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0478-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1978-10-01 |title=The Harvey Lecture Series, 1977-1978.

==Kin selection models==

[[W. D. Hamilton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |authorlink=W. D. Hamilton |date=1964 |title=The genetical evolution of social behavior |url= |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |pages=1:52}}&lt;/ref&gt; was among the first to propose an explanation for [[natural selection]] of altruistic behaviors among related individuals. According to his model, natural selection will favor altruistic behavior towards kin when the benefit (as a contributing factor to reproductive fitness) towards the recipient (scaled based upon Wright's [[coefficient of genetic relatedness]] between donor and recipient) outweighs the cost of giving. In other words, [[kin selection]] implies that food will be given when there is a great benefit to the recipient with low cost to the donor. An example of this would be sharing food among kin during a period of surplus. The implications of kin-selection is that natural selection will also favor the development of ways of determining kin from non-kin and close kin from distant kin. When [[Hamilton's rule]] is applied to food-sharing behavior, a simple expectation of the model is that close kin should receive food shares either more frequently or in larger quantities than distant relatives and non-kin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Feinman |first=Saul |date=2016-12-07 |title=An evolutionary theory of food sharing |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/053901847901800404 |journal=Social Science Information |volume=18 |issue=4–5 |pages=695–726 |doi=10.1177/053901847901800404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, greater imbalances in the quantities shared between close kin are expected than those shared with non-kin or distantly related individuals&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hames |first=Raymond |title=Garden labor exchange among the Ye'kwana |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0162309587900288 |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=259–284 |doi=10.1016/0162-3095(87)90028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, if reciprocal altruism is an important factor, then this may not be the case among close kin who are also reciprocity partners&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gurven |first=Michael |last2=Hill |first2=Kim |last3=Kaplan |first3=Hillard |last4=Hurtado |first4=Ana |last5=Lyles |first5=Richard |date=2000-06-01 |title=Food Transfers Among Hiwi Foragers of Venezuela: Tests of Reciprocity |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007067919982 |journal=Human Ecology |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=171–218 |doi=10.1023/A:1007067919982}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see subsection below). Based on Feinman's&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; extension of Hamilton's model, cheating such as recipients not sharing food with their donors, is more likely to take place between unrelated (or distantly related) individuals than closely related individuals.

==Reciprocal models==

In addition to expanding the ideas of Hamilton and kin-based altruism, Saul Feinman&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also theorized food-sharing based on [[Robert Trivers]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Trivers |first=Robert L. |authorlink=Robert Trivers |date=1971-03-01 |title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/406755 |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35–57 |doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of [[reciprocal altruism]]. Following Trivers' ideas, reciprocal altruism models of food-sharing generate expectations of when and how a recipient of food from a donor will share food in a future interaction with that donor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Hillard |last2=Hill |first2=Kim |last3=Cadeliña |first3=Rowe V. |last4=Hayden |first4=Brian |last5=Hyndman |first5=David Charles |last6=Preston |first6=Richard J. |last7=Smith |first7=Eric Alden |last8=Stuart |first8=David E. |last9=Yesner |first9=David R. |date=1985-01-01 |title=Food Sharing Among Ache Foragers: Tests of Explanatory Hypotheses [and Comments and Reply] |jstor=2743137 |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=223–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Winterhalder |first=Bruce |title=Diet choice, risk, and food sharing in a stochastic environment |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-4165(86)90017-6 |journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=369–392 |doi=10.1016/0278-4165(86)90017-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the kin selection model, food will be shared when the benefit towards the recipient is greater than the costs to the donor, such as a period of surplus.

[[File:Chimpanzees-Share-Forbidden-Fruit-pone.0000886.s002.ogv|thumb|Food sharing in [[chimpanzee]]s]]

In 1984, Jim Moore&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=Jim |title=The evolution of reciprocal sharing |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0162309584900311 |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology | year=1984 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |doi=10.1016/0162-3095(84)90031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model for the evolution of reciprocal food-sharing based on evidence from [[chimpanzee]]s and modern human [[hunter-gatherer]] groups. This model was designed to address problems that Trivers' model failed to address. One problem, according to Moore, was that the model did not adequately explain the initial development of reciprocal altruism. If a population started with one reciprocal altruist who only gives benefits to other reciprocal altruists, then this trait would not be selected as there would be no other altruists to interact with.

Moore's model made the following assumptions:

* Humans evolved from chimp-like ancestors with a similar hierarchical social structure (i.e., open dominance hierarchy that is male-dominated)
* Males were highly motivated to achieve high rank. The short term reward of this was the position itself and the long-term reward was reproductive success, which resulted from greater access to mates with high rank position.
* Begging behavior similar to that of [[chimpanzee]]s existed, such as that between an infant and mother
* There is an intermediate range of resource abundance that will favor sharing (e.g., meat for human ancestors that were occasionally-carnivorous herbivores)

With these assumptions, Moore proposed that human ancestors would have learned to hunt and share food if they faced punitive action from other group members if an individual did not share food with the group. An individual who finds a scarce, defensible resource would have faced begging behavior from other group members. Costs and benefits of sharing in this scenario can be sorted into status, fight risk, and nutritional value. Nutritional value is determined by the size of the food portion relative to the nutritional needs of the individuals. The nutritional value remains constant throughout this scenario, or declines in value as portions of it are consumed by the obtaining individual. As another individual begs with increasing intensity, the beggar's social cost increases, until the beggar's social costs exceed that of fighting; this is paralleled by the benefits to the food-obtainer. If the benefits to the food-obtainer exceed the beggar's cost of fighting, then the beggar should attack. At or before this time, the food-obtainer should decide to share or not. This decision is made depending on the expected reaction from the beggar. It is expected that they will decide to share at a time that would maximize benefits and minimize loss in nutritional value. If the beggar was initially dominant, it may follow up the first sharing interaction with further begging or fighting, reciprocation of sharing, or let the incident pass. Further begging and fighting impose risk onto the beggar as the food-obtainer might feel and behave dominantly and become dominant if the beggar loses. Inaction allows the food-obtainer to remain slightly dominant. If other group members witnessed this change in dominance position, then the beggar may demonstrate [[redirected aggression]] and attack a lower-rank bystander. Later, when the beggar obtains food, it may chose to reciprocate after getting the initial food-obtainer to beg, but this only occurs if the benefits offered exceed the status cost of the initial food-obtainer's begging. Thus, Moore's model predicted that natural selection would favor aggressive sharing and assertive reciprocation to re-establish status.

Feinman attempted to combine kin selection and reciprocal food-sharing models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on inequalities in direct access to food resources among hunter-gatherers, donors are more likely to share foods that their recipients do not have direct access to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feinman also hypothesizes that, as a donor's reproductive value decreases, the probability of the donor giving food increases, either with or without reciprocal sharing. For example, older individuals (mostly women) in some foraging societies will share food and care of younger unrelated individuals. Further, the probability of a donor giving food will decrease as the reproductive value of a recipient also decreases. Some foods are not as predictable in their distribution and are thus termed less reliable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As foods become less reliable, they are expected to be shared more because they are rarer than more commonly encountered food sources. As food becomes scarcer, donors are expected to become more strict in their sharing habits and may favor close relatives, recipients who actively reciprocate and give food, and recipients with higher reproductive value (such as younger offspring or prospective mates) over others. Donors will also tend to share with those who remain familiar and in close proximity to them. Feinman also hypothesizes that donors are more likely to share with those who are culturally similar to them over those who are culturally different.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recent studies of chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates have found evidence to support reciprocal sharing; however, other factors such as grooming and begging behaviors may also contribute to patterns of nonhuman primate food sharing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jaeggi |first=Adrian V. |last2=Stevens |first2=Jeroen M.G. |last3=Van Schaik |first3=Carel P. |date=2010-09-01 |title=Tolerant food sharing and reciprocity is precluded by despotism among bonobos but not chimpanzees |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21288/abstract |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jaeggi |first=Adrian V. |last2=Groot |first2=Evelien De |last3=Stevens |first3=Jeroen M.

==Tolerated theft==

Models of tolerated theft seek to explain why in some hunter-gatherer societies, scrounging behaviour is tolerated by other members of a group.&lt;ref name=BlurtonJones1987&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blurton Jones |first=Nicholas G. |date=1987-03-01 |title=Tolerated theft, suggestions about the ecology and evolution of sharing, hoarding and scrounging |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/053901887026001002 |journal=Information (International Social Science Council) |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=31–54 |doi=10.1177/053901887026001002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This developed in response to variance-reduction models, as reciprocal behavior might have socially related taboos tied to it (such as rules preventing a person to accumulate more wealth). Variance-reduction models seek to explain why redistribution of large food packages (caches or prey items) occurs in daily practices of hunter-gatherers. According to variance reduction theory, it is more optimal to do so than to let excess food rot or spoil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Blurton Jones argued from an evolutionary biology perspective that, if these taboos did not exist, then it would be more beneficial to be selfish if one found food and did not share and also accepted shares from others (essentially, a cheater under altruism models). Under this idea, selfishness would be expected to develop as a dominant behavior. Unlike cooperative models that link sharing to hunting, tolerated theft links sharing to arrival of any food package (either hunted or scavenged). Cooperative and reciprocal models, according to Jones, could not explain how food-sharing initially developed in societies. He claimed tolerated theft did, then once it became frequent, reciprocal altruism could develop.&lt;ref name=BlurtonJones1987/&gt;

Jones outlines several assumptions for his model of tolerated theft:&lt;ref name=BlurtonJones1987/&gt;

* Food can be taken by force, unlike rescue or other reciprocal behaviors
* Food can be broken apart into portions, like parts of a single carcass
* Individuals fight only for fitness gain. In this case, a resource’s fitness benefit determines the fight outcome. Individuals with much to gain will fight harder and usually win, gaining the fitness benefit.
* Resource values are unequal, but individuals have equal [[resource holding potential]] (RHP), a measurement of strength and fighting ability. 
* Some parts of a food package will have higher value than others (i.e., they follow a [[Diminishing returns|diminishing]] value curve).

Therefore, the individual that obtains a large package of food (in cases where this seldom happens) faces asymmetric contests over food, and the obtainer does not benefit from fighting over less valuable portions. However, latecomers who have not obtained food on their own will have much to gain even from the less valuable portions. It is not worth the effort for a food-obtainer to fight over these portions, and so the obtainer should be expected to relinquish these without a fight since it would likely lose to the latecomer. Thus, another expectation is that natural selection will favor the ability to assess costs and benefits. Among frequently interacting individuals, the roles of obtainer and latecomer/thief are interchanged, balancing out benefits of latecomer gains and obtainer losses, so reciprocation develops to avoid injury. Equal, reciprocal sharing is the eventual consequence from this tolerated theft behavior. When food packages are small to begin with, then theft is less tolerated as portions have lower returns along the assumed diminishing value curve. Hoarding is expected in cases where either food can be defended, there is a season of scarcity, a synchronous glut (ex. salmon run or agricultural harvest), or when accumulated food no longer follows a diminishing curve (as with financial capital). Scrounging is expected to increase among groups when active foragers miss out on sharing opportunities due to their own acts of less successful foraging. Foragers do worse than scroungers because scroungers are able to participate in 100% of sharing events.

Based on studies by de Waal and others,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; chimpanzees exhibit tolerated theft behaviors. These are typically between mother and offspring and involve commonly available plant foods.

== Costly signaling models ==

[[Costly signaling theory|Costly signaling]] has been interpreted from ethnographic studies in regards to food sharing to explain why certain individuals (primarily men) tend to target difficult-to-acquire foods that sometimes produce less optimal yields. One explanation for this behavior is as a means for men to signal their reproductive quality to prospective mates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hawkes |first=Kristen |last2=Bliege Bird |first2=Rebecca |date=2002-01-01 |title=Showing off, handicap signaling, and the evolution of men's work |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20005/abstract |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=58–67 |doi=10.1002/evan.20005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Eric Alden |date=2004-12-01 |title=Why do good hunters have higher reproductive success? |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-004-1013-9 |journal=Human Nature |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=343–364 |doi=10.1007/s12110-004-1013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hawkes |first=K. |last2=O'connell |first2=J.

In their study of turtle hunting by the [[Meriam people]] (one of the indigenous [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples), Smith and Bliege Bird&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Eric Alden |last2=Bird |first2=Rebecca L. Bliege |date=2000-07-01 |title=Turtle hunting and tombstone opening |url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(00)00031-3/fulltext |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=245–261 |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00031-3 |pmid=10899477}}&lt;/ref&gt; frame this collective food-sharing behavior within a costly signaling framework. Among the Meriam, a family will sponsor a turtle-hunting group to collect turtles for feasting purposes associated with funerary activities. Since the hunting group does not receive any of the turtles in return, this behavior does not fit within a reciprocal or cooperative food-sharing framework. Instead, the benefits to hunters is through the signals from hunting. The leaders of these hunting groups signal their skills, specialized knowledge, and charisma which allow them to gain widespread social status when they are successful. This benefit allows hunters to gain priority in other social considerations such as marriages and alliances. The family who sponsored these hunting groups receives all of the captured turtles with no expectation of reciprocal payment in the future. The costs to the hunters are through provisioning the hunt itself, including the purchase of fuel for the boats.

Another consideration of group cooperation is as a way to increase food yields in comparison to acquiring food individually; this can be considered a form of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Bruce Winterhalder&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; incorporates food-sharing among groups into the diet breadth model derived from [[optimal foraging theory]] as a means to reduce risk. Risk is measured in this model as a measure of the probability that a forager's net acquisition rate (NAR) falls below a minimum value, such as a threshold for starvation. Through the use of a [[Stochastic calculus|stochastic model]], a group of independent foragers are able to meet and pool their resources at the end of a foraging period and divide the total resources equally among the group. Through a series of simulations exploring values of group size and other parameters of the model, the results suggest that risk is effectively reduced by pooling and dividing equal shares of resources. When compared with changes in diet breadth, sharing seems to be better at reducing risk than changing the diet breadth. Examination of various group sizes suggests that small groups are capable of effectively reducing risk.

'''Health information on the Internet''' refers to all communication related to health done on the [[Internet]].

==Types==
As a general communication channel, various Internet products serve every type of general health information.

===Targeting types of information to different audiences===
In the late 1990s researchers began to note that huge numbers of people were using the Internet to seek health information, despite various problems with the quality of information or inefficiencies in accessing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Risk | first1 = A. | last2 = Petersen | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.20.2713 | title = Health Information on the Internet | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 20 | pages = 2713–2715 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12020308| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various problems have been identified for those using [[search engines]] to seek health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berland | first1 = G.

There is a premise that patients with access to their personal health information presented in a form they can understand will be able to interpret and learn from this information in a way that benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=JS|author2=Intille, SS |author3=Morris, ME |title=To track or not to track: user reactions to concepts in longitudinal health monitoring.|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e29|pmid=17236264|pmc=1794006|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.4.e29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians worry that patients using their own medical history records as a starting point for personal research on the Internet are at risk for being overwhelmed and misinformed when seeking health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robeznieks|first=A|title=Getting personal.

As of 2013 opinions about the relationship health care providers should have with online health information were still being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnan|first=Jeanne M.|title=Online Medical Professionalism: Patient and Public Relationships: Policy Statement From the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=16 April 2013|volume=158|issue=8|pages=620–7|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-8-201304160-00100|pmid=23579867}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one 2014 study, "The flow of information has fundamentally changed, and physicians have less control over health information relayed to patients.

====Background on the doctor–patient relationship====
{{main article|Doctor–patient relationship}}
Physicians have difficulty explaining complicated medical concepts to their patients and patients have difficulty understanding complicated things which physicians tell them. One reasons for this is that a patient's visit to a physician is likely to be less than 15 minutes, and in any case, physicians are unable to spend the amount of time which patients that patients typically desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechanic|first=David|author2=McAlpine, Donna D. |author3=Rosenthal, Marsha |title=Are Patients' Office Visits with Physicians Getting Shorter?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 January 2001|volume=344|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1056/NEJM200101183440307|pmid=11172143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians use medical terms which patients do not understand, but which they would like to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=CM|author2=Wilson, C |author3=Wang, F |author4= Schillinger, D |title=Babel babble: physicians' use of unclarified medical jargon with patients|journal=American journal of health behavior|date=Sep–Oct 2007|volume=31 Suppl 1|pages=S85–95|pmid=17931142 |doi=10.5993/ajhb.31.s1.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is consensus that patients should have [[shared decision making]], which means that they make informed decisions about the direction of their health care in collaboration with their physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock III|first=Clarence H.|author2=Edwards, Kelly A. |author3=Hasenberg, Nicole M. |author4=Laidley, Tracy L. |author5= Levinson, Wendy |title=Informed Decision Making in Outpatient Practice|journal=JAMA|date=22 December 1999|volume=282|issue=24|pages=2313–20|doi=10.1001/jama.282.24.2313|pmid=10612318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich, educated, socially advantaged patients enjoy many more benefits of shared decision making than patients who have disadvantages in getting healthcare, including lower socioeconomic class or having a minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiscella|first=Kevin|author2=Epstein, Ronald M.|title=So Much to Do, So Little Time:care for the socially disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=22 September 2008|volume=168|issue=17|pages=1843–52|doi=10.1001/archinte.168.17.1843|pmid=18809810|pmc=2606692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of patient understanding of health contributes to a range of problems including tendency to not adhere to the physician's medical advice and missing medical appointments.&lt;ref name="Wicks 2010"&gt;A better source should be used to support this claim, although this source is good enough for how it is used here.

====Resources====
Various social forums exist in which anyone can have conversations about health with their peers. Such forums are especially popular among patients who seek to have conversations with other patients with a shared medical concern.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G.|title=Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions|journal=BMJ|date=15 May 2004|volume=328|issue=7449|pages=1166–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166|pmid=15142921|pmc=411092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who participate in online communities which discuss health issues report feeling relief about their health worries, perceiving more control over their health and medical condition, having more medical knowledge, and having more personal agency overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barak|first=Azy|author2=Boniel-Nissim, Meyran |author3=Suler, John |title=Fostering empowerment in online support groups|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=September 2008|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1867–1883|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic medical literature===
The written record of medical consensus is stored in [[scientific journals]]. Since the advent of [[electronic publishing]] there has been [[academic journal publishing reform]] which had a range of effects, including more researchers and physicians having greater access to professional information in medical journals through the Internet.

===Patients' personal health information===
Through various sources both publicly and privately available, datasets containing health information about large numbers of patients are available on the Internet to an extent which was impossible to manage before the Internet.

==Quality==
Measures and standards for ensuring quality control on the Internet have been criticized and no one standard is universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jadad | first1 = A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among all sources there is a wide variance in quality of health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fahy|first=E|author2=Hardikar, R |author3=Fox, A |author4= Mackay, S |title=Quality of patient health information on the Internet: reviewing a complex and evolving landscape.|journal=The Australasian medical journal|year=2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–28|pmid=24567763 |doi=10.4066/AMJ.2014.1900 |pmc=3920473}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nature and quality of online health-related information seeking on the web is challenging and complex and many researchers investigated this issue benefiting from a wide range of theories from different disciplines.&lt;/ref&gt; Among all sources there is a wide variance in quality of health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Khosrowjerdi, M. (2016). A review of theory-driven models of trust in the online health context. IFLA Journal, 42(3): pp. 189-206. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0340035216659299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal health information==
For many applications people wish to use health information on the Internet to give insight about a personal health concern. Because of this, the goal is often to use the Internet to find information described in a person's [[medical record]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since the advent of [[electronic media]], medical records have been increasingly kept as [[electronic medical records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} If electronic medical records were shared online then it would be easy to match those with information and conduct a range of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagliari|first=C|author2=Detmer, D |author3=Singleton, P |title=Potential of electronic personal health records.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Aug 18, 2007|volume=335|issue=7615|pages=330–3|pmid=17703042|doi=10.1136/bmj.39279.482963.AD|pmc=1949437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, all medical records are [[protected health information]] because sharing personal health information exposes an individual to a range of harms which result from violation of their [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There is currently broad international debate about how to balance patient and commercial medicine demands for personal health information with individual's needs for safety and respect.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Electronic medical records===
{{main article|Electronic medical record}}
An electronic medical record is a [[medical record]] stored as [[electronic media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=P. C|author2=Ash, J. S |author3=Bates, D. W |author4=Overhage, J M. |author5= Sands, D. Z |title=Personal Health Records: Definitions, Benefits, and Strategies for Overcoming Barriers to Adoption|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=1 March 2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=121–126|doi=10.1197/jamia.M2025 |pmid=16357345 |pmc=1447551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-identification===
{{main article|De-identification}}
De-identification is an attempt to divide a collection of information about a particular person so that all information which identifies the person is removed, and with intent to distribute whatever information is left. The closer the data is to [[anonymization]] the less valuable the data is to those who want it, so in general, data is only de-identified somewhat and rarely anonymized. There are many controversies in de-identification.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Research using personal health information===
There is a large demand for access to large collections of various types of personal health information.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Almost all of this demand is commercial.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Distribution of collections of personal health information===
Various groups have expressed worry over danger to the public which results from the distribution of collections of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/05/data-protection-eu-anonymous |title=Data protection in the EU: the certainty of uncertainty |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |work=theguardian.com |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom proposed to sell datasets of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/19/nhs-patient-data-available-companies-buy |title=NHS patient data to be made available for sale to drug and insurance firms |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |work=theguardian.com |date=19 January 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/04/care-data-nhs-healthcare |title=Thanks to Care.data, your secrets are no longer safe with your GP (Wired UK) |first=Asher |last=Wolf |work=wired.co.uk |date=7 February 2014|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics''' ('''MANA''' from ''MAterials NanoArchitectonics'') is a special research unit established in 2007 at the [[National Institute for Materials Science]] (NIMS) within the [http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-toplevel/ World Premier International (WPI)] Research Center Initiative by the Japan [[Society for the Promotion of Science]] (JSPS).

== Members ==

MANA brings together outstanding researchers from [[Japan]] and other countries to conduct research at NIMS. The organizations providing foreign researchers are named "satellites" and currently include 

*[[University of Cambridge]] (UK)
*[[University of California]] (US)
*[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (US)
*[[CNRS]] (France)
*[[University of Tsukuba]] (Japan)
*[[Tokyo University of Science]] (Japan) and
*[[Hokkaido University]] (Japan).

MANA [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/about/advisor/index.html advisors] include [[Nobel Prize]] laureates [[Harold Kroto]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]], as well as other prominent scientists ([[C. N. R. Rao]], [[Galen D. Stucky]], etc.) and industry leaders (L. Schlapbach, CEO of [[Empa]]). 

MANA [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/members/principal_investigator/index.html members] include such recognized scientists as [[Omar M. Yaghi]], [[Christoph Gerber]], [[James Gimzewski]], [[Mark Welland]] and others. 

MANA currently (September 2008) employs only several tens members,
originating from at least 9 countries (Japan, UK, US, China, India, Russia, France, Italy and Sweden). However, the number of employees is planned to increase up to about 200.

== Purpose and structure ==

The purpose of establishing MANA is very unusual for a scientific institution in a way that a relatively small unit (MANA, about 50 employees) is put forward to lead the research of a large scientific body (NIMS, about 1500 employees). In fact, MANA is considered as a mechanism of [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/about/ourgoal/sysreform.html reorganization] of the whole research system of NIMS. Consequently, best young scientists from all over the world are hired to conduct research, and the elite senior scientists are invited to guide them. Despite very young age of MANA, important results have already been obtained and published in major journals, such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and [[Science (journal)|Science]], and more are expected to come in the nearest future. 

Another unusual feature of MANA is that although it is located in Japan and most its employees are Japanese, its primary language is English. This feature reflects the initiative of NIMS to become a leading and truly international scientific center.

== Research directions ==

The research directions of MANA are based on the concept named [[nanoarchitectonics]] - a technology allowing to manipulate a group of atoms or molecules. Consequently, much effort is devoted to the synthesis and characterization of various [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanostructures]] with the results published in the main scientific journals and the [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/research/index.html MANA research] and [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/news/index.html MANA news] pages.

== Scientific cooperation ==
In September 2008, MANA embarked on a new program of scientific cooperation with the [[Yonsei University]] in [[Seoul]], [[Korea]].  The exchange of researchers and research information between the two institutions is projected as a crucial factor in collaborative research on the development and evaluation of sustainable chemical technology and nano-biofusion technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nims.go.jp/eng/wnew/080901/index.html  "MANA signed a cooperation agreement with Yonsei University, Korea,"] ''News at MINS.'' September 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interpretant''', in [[semiotics]], is the effect of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] on someone who reads or comprehends it. The concept of "interpretant" is part of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s "triadic" theory of the sign. For Peirce, the interpretant is an element that allows taking a ''representamen'' for the sign of an ''object'', and is also the "effect" of the process of ''semeiosis'' or signification.

Peirce delineates three types of interpretants: the immediate, the dynamical, and the final or normal.

==Immediate Interpretant==
"The Immediate Interpretant consists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to produce, not to any actual reaction." (Letter to William James, CP 8.315, 1909)

==Dynamical Interpretant==
"[The] Dynamical Interpretant consists in direct effect actually produced by a Sign upon an Interpreter of it. [---] [The] Dynamical Interpretant is that which is experienced in each act of Interpretation and is different in each from that of the other... [it] is a single actual event." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

==Final or Normal Interpretant==
"[The] Final Interpretant is [...] the effect the Sign would produce in any mind upon which the circumstances should permit it to work out its full effect. [---] ...[It] is the one Interpretative result to which every Interpreter is destined to come if the Sign is sufficiently considered. [---] The Final Interpretant is that toward which the actual tends." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

[[Image:Klismaphilia_Enema_Mylar_Balloon__This_Bag's_for_You.JPG|thumb|A helium-filled mylar balloon that was a decoration at a gathering of klismaphiles.]]
'''Klismaphilia''' (or ''klysmaphilia''), from the Greek words {{lang|grc|κλύσμα}} ("enema", from {{lang|grc|κατακλυσμός}}, "deluge, flood") and {{lang|grc|φιλία}} ("(fraternal) love"), is a [[paraphilia]] involving enjoyment of, and [[sexual arousal]] from, [[enema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias.html Paraphilias] from [http://www.psychologytoday.com Psychology Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1973|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference. Report of two cases.|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=27|pages=232–50 | issue=2|pmid=4704017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''klismaphilia'' was coined in 1973 by Dr. Joanne Denko, an early investigator in this field, to describe the activities of some of her patients,&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=J.|date=October 1982|title=Klismaphilia--a physiological perspective.|journal=American journal of psychotherapy|publisher=Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy|location=United States|volume=36|pages=554–66|issn=0002-9564|pmid=7158678|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom she referred to as ''klismaphiliacs''.&lt;ref name="Denko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1976|title=Amplification of the erotic enema deviance.|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=30|pages=236–55 | issue=2|pmid=937588}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''klismaphile''&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':489,516&lt;/ref&gt; is also in use for describing a person with klismaphilia, and is considered synonymous with klismaphiliac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=klismaphile|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/klismaphile|work=Wiktionary|accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestation==
===General===
Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies, by actually receiving or giving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretense of being constipated).&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; Klismaphilia is practiced by men and women, although men are more likely to be klismaphiles, as with most paraphilias.&lt;ref name="Agnew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; Klismaphiles might gain pleasure from a large, water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure. Often, klismaphiles report discovering these desires after a chance administration of an enema sometime in their childhood, but some do report discovering these feelings later on.&lt;ref name="Agnew"/&gt; Usually, klismaphiles carry out normal lives and successfully engage in this behavior secretly.

An enema can be an auxiliary to, or a substitute for, genital [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; Men and women with the paraphilia enjoy sexual enema play, both heterosexually and homosexually, experiencing [[sexual arousal]] from enemas which they find gratifying or sensual.&lt;ref name="Agnew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; Additionally, in men enemas can stimulate the [[prostate]] gland.

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]] in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female." He stated, "There still other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample ... enemas, and other anal insertions, ... were employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred Charles | title = Sexual Behavior in the Human Female | publisher = Indiana University Press | place = Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.A. | year = 1953 | isbn = 978-0-253-33411-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enemas are sometimes used in [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, ''Klismaphilia'':74,77,78,79&lt;/ref&gt; for [[erotic humiliation]]&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':515,516,520&lt;/ref&gt; or for physical discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Brame et al., ''Different loving &amp;ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,517&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equipment ===
[[Image:Aluminium Enema Nozzle 02.jpg|thumb|An [[aluminium]] nozzle, a non-medical enema apparatus.]]

For administering enemas not intended for medical purposes there are specialty items, such as the aluminium nozzle shown to the right, that are commonly used in activities involving klismaphilia. Such items are available on the Internet and in [[sex shop]]s in a great variety of sizes, styles, and materials.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, ''Klismaphilia'':78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) classifies klismaphilia under the diagnosis of "Paraphilias, Not Otherwise Specified". The diagnostic code is 302.9.&lt;ref name="DSM"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Proactive treatment for klismaphilics is not generally recommended, due to the lack of any significant desire to be "cured".&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; Health treatment for klismaphilia thus is typically only focused on ensuring the techniques employed and chemicals used are not harmful to the practitioner.&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; Caution should always be maintained on the part of the practitioners experimenting with new techniques and concoctions; in certain cases cramps produced by the chemicals used have led to hospitalizations,&lt;ref name="Denko"/&gt; in other circumstances the effects can even be life-threatening.&lt;ref name="Case report"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y441825m5135088x/ |title=Rectal Impaction With Epoxy Resin: A Case Report |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |doi=10.1016/j.gassur.2004.12.010 |volume=9 |journal=Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery |pages=747–749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio Maestà.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints]]'' (1308–1311), [[Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo a Siena|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], [[Siena]].]]
'''Maestà''' {{IPA-it|maeˈsta|}}, the Italian word for "majesty", designates an [[Iconography|iconic formula]] of the enthroned [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[child Jesus]], whether or not accompanied with [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s. The ''Maestà'' is an extension of the "[[Seat of Wisdom]]" theme of the seated "Mary [[Theotokos]]", "Mary Mother of God", which is a counterpart to the earlier icon of [[Christ in Majesty]], the enthroned Christ that is familiar in Byzantine [[Mosaics]]. '''''Maria Regina''''' is an art historians' synonym for the [[icon]]ic image of Mary enthroned, with or without the Child.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Lawrence's discussion of this image, "Maria Regina", ''Art Bulletin'' '''7''' (1924–1925:150-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the image seems to have developed, based perhaps on Byzantine precedents such as the coin of Constantine's Empress [[Fausta]], crowned and with their sons on her lap&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Lawrence 1924:&lt;/ref&gt; and on literary examples, such as [[Flavius Cresconius Corippus]]'s celebration of [[Justin II]]'s coronation in 565.&lt;ref&gt;In Corippus' poem, Sophia (Wisdom) prays "''Virgo, creatoris genetrix sanctissima mundi, excelsi regina poli...''". (''Corippus'', A. Cameron, ed., ''In laudem Justini augusti minoris'' (London) 1976, vol. II:52f. The more familiar ''In laudem Mariae'', praising Mary as [[Regina Coeli|Queen of Heaven]], is a late sixth century poem, perhaps by [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings depicting the ''Maestà'' came into the mainstream artistic repertory, especially in Rome, in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Several rare examples in fresco and mosaic, including the lost apse mosaic in the first church in Rome dedicated to Mary, the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]], are listed by John L. Osborne, "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche", ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981:299–310) p. 304f.&lt;/ref&gt; with an increased emphasis on the veneration of Mary. The ''Maestà'' was often executed in [[fresco]] technique directly on plastered walls or as paintings on gessoed wooden [[altar]] [[panel painting|panels]].

A more domestic representation, suitable to private devotion, is the iconographic theme of [[Madonna and Child]].

==Examples of ''Maestà'' in painting==
{{main|Maestà (Duccio)}} 
The most famous example of the ''Maestà'' is the ''Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints'', an [[altarpiece]] comprising many individual paintings commissioned by the city of [[Siena]] in 1308 from the artist [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]]. The painting was installed in the [[Siena Cathedral|city's cathedral]] on June 9, 1311. Although it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's ''Maestà'' set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of Byzantine art towards more direct presentations of reality.

Creating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the ''Maesta'' were episodes from the life of Christ, focusing on his Passion. Sacred narrative unfolds in elegant episodes enacted by graceful figures who seem to dance their way through these stories while still conveying emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ''Maesta'' was dismantled in 1771, its power and beauty can only be imagined from scattered parts, some still in Siena, Italy, but others elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noted examples of the ''Maestà'' are [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Maestà'' in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, or [[Cimabue]]'s fresco in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]].

[[Image:MPI aussen.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law| Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition (formerly known as the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law)]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Innovation und Wettbewerb}})  is a [[Munich]], [[Germany]], based research institute, which is part of the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science]], which manages more than 90 institutes and research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.intellecprop.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/organization/summary/mpg.cfm ''Max Planck Society, Organization''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905233929/http://www.intellecprop.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/organization/summary/mpg.cfm |date=2012-09-05 }}. Consulted on January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was formerly known as ''Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law'' and the name was changed to ''Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition'' in view of the broader focus of the institute and its interdisciplinary character. The major research areas of the institute are intellectual property, innovation and competition.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.ip.mpg.de/en/about_us.html&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from providing research support for scholars from across the world, the institute also publishes the ''[[International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law]]'' (IIC). 

As of 2015, Prof. [[Dietmar Harhoff]] is the Managing Director of the Institute. Prof. [[Reto M. Hilty]] and Prof. [[Josef Drexl]], are Directors of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.ip.mpg.de/en/academic_body/directors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
In 1952, a new school of law “The Institute for Foreign and International Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law” was founded at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University]] of Munich. Under the leadership of its first Director [[Eduard Reimer]] (1896–1957), President of the [[German Patent Office]], the Institute quickly gained international importance and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm ''Academic History of the Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205204249/http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm |date=2007-02-05 }}. Consulted on January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Eugen Ulmer]] (1903–1988) put a stamp on the research work for decades; he notably promoted the expansion of the national and international copyright and competition law. In 1966, as its founding Director, he established the “Max-Planck Institute for Foreign and International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law”.

Alongside Eugen Ulmer, [[Friedrich-Karl Beier]] (1926–1997) and Gerhard Schricker (until 2003) were admitted to the Directorate of the Max Planck Institute. In the following decades, the Max Planck Institute would exert a wide-ranging influence on the national and international development of the relevant fields of law. An outstanding example of this influence was research based on [[comparative law]] analyses regarding European harmonisation of the law against unfair competition of [[trademark law]], of [[design law]] as well as [[copyright law]]. Also essential were comparative law studies on the patentability of biotechnological inventions or the exploration of limits between the trademark rights.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

In 2002, the Institute was modernised significantly, in particular with respect to personnel, areas of expertise, and its facilities. On 1 January 2002, Josef Drexl, Reto M. Hilty and [[Wolfgang Schön]] were appointed to the Directorate of the Max Planck Institute, serving alongside [[Joseph Straus]], who was appointed Director in 2001 taking over the directorship from Gerhard Schricker. On 1 July 2002, a new department “Accounting and Taxes” was added to the newly formed unit “Intellectual Property Law and Competition Law”. This department was conceived to cover law regarding capital market information and the taxation of companies as constituents of the international economic and competition regime.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Also in 2002, the [[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center]] (MIPLC) was founded, which from an administrative point of view is managed as an independent department of the Institute, but is supported by the [[Max Planck Society]] in cooperation with the [[University of Augsburg]], the [[Technical University Munich]] as well as the [[George Washington Law School]], Washington D.C. The MIPLC conducts both research as well as teaching and, since autumn 2003, offers an internationally networked LLM degree, under the direction of Joseph Straus (until 2008) and Josef Drexl (as of 2009) and staffed by world-renowned academics.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm ''Academic History of the Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205204249/http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm |date=2007-02-05 }}. Consulted on January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis is on IP law and courses are held in English. Students come from many countries of all five continents.

In 2009 [[Kai A. Konrad]] was appointed to the Directorate of the Institute and the Department of Public Economics was added to the formed unit "Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law". The main field of Public Economics studies the functioning of government, as well as the challenges and the opportunities for reform. The Department analyzes the limits and scope of government, with a special focus on levying taxes to finance its core tasks in a modern nation state.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

In January 2011 the MPI for Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Geistiges Eigentum, Wettbewerbs- und Steuerrecht}}) was split to form the MPI for Intellectual Property and Competition Law under the directorship of Josef Drexl and Reto M. Hilty, and the [[MPI for Tax Law and Public Finance]] under the directorship of Kai A. Konrad and Wolfgang Schön.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law, [http://www.intellecprop.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/news.cfm?fuseaction_pre=detail&amp;prid=78&amp; "As of 1 January 2011 the MPI for Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law will be split (News)"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803160353/http://www.intellecprop.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/news.cfm?fuseaction_pre=detail&amp;prid=78&amp; |date=3 August 2012 }}, Consulted on January 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time these Institutes, along with the [[MPI for Foreign and International Social Law]], joined together to form the [[Munich Max Planck Campus for Legal and Economic Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm ''Academic History of the Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205204249/http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm |date=2007-02-05 }}.

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.

*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

== Some realms of communication and their theories ==
*message production: [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivist Theory]], [[Action Assembly|Action Assembly Theory]]
*message processing: [[Elaboration Likelihood Model]], [[Inoculation theory]]
*discourse and interaction: [[Speech Acts Theory]], [[Coordinated Management of Meaning]]
*developing relationships: [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]], [[Social Penetration Theory]], [[Predicted outcome value theory|Predicted Outcome Value Theory]]
*ongoing relationships: Relational Systems Theory, [[Relational Dialectics]]
*organizational: [[Structuration Theory]], [[Control theory (sociology)|Unobtrusive and Concertive Control Theory]]
*small group: Functional Theory, [[Symbolic Convergence Theory]]
*media processing and effects: [[Social Cognitive Theory]], [[Uses and Gratifications Theory]]
*media and society: [[Agenda-setting theory|Agenda Setting]], [[Information deficit model]], [[Spiral of silence]], [[Symbolic Convergence Theory]]
*culture: [[Speech Code Theory|Speech Codes Theory]], [[Face Negotiation Theory|Face-saving Theory]]

The '''National Justice Project''' ('''NJP''') is a not for profit legal service established to promote [[human rights]], [[social justice]] and to fight against disadvantage and discrimination in Australia through strategic legal action, effective advocacy and communication.

The Project brings together academics, legal practitioners and advocates from a wide range of disciplines to identify, assess and conduct test-case litigation. In order to do so it generates research and has developed expertise in identifying test-cases with the potential to contribute to long-term and strategic change to the Australian legal system and amongst our near neighbours.

in order to select and undertake strategic ligation that advances [[social justice]] and [[human rights in Australia]] and among its near neighbours.

==Social Justice Clinic==
[[George Newhouse]], is the Principal Solicitor of the NJP and an Adjunct Professor at [[Macquarie University Law School]]. The project also operates a social justice clinic located within the [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney (Australia)|NSW]].

The clinic provides practical legal experience and training for law students as part of the NJP's commitment to social change.

==Projects==
The NJP's main projects are:

* The Aboriginal Health Matters Project
* The Pacific Justice Project; and 
* The Aboriginal Innocence Project

===Aboriginal Health Matters===
The Aboriginal Health Matters Project (the AHM) is the first of its kind in Australia. The AHM project is dedicated to using the law to highlight cases of medical mistreatment of Aboriginal Australians based on systemic policy failures and unconscious bias or racial profiling. .&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many in the community who aim to improve the health and welfare of Aboriginal Australians but the ALM initiative is focused on the legal response to the problem. Our strategically selected cases are calculated to: 

•	raise awareness about the poor treatment and outcomes for Aboriginal/Indigenous Australians on their journey through the health system – particularly focused on emergency or hospital interactions; and
 
•	seek reform in Medical Practice and independent review of the treatment of Aboriginal/Indigenous Australians in the health system nationally.

The AHM focuses on achieving real outcomes for Aboriginal Australians by working with Aboriginal doctors, Aboriginal legal and Health services and Jumbunna Indigenous House of Learning Research Unit, wh to build close associations with Aboriginal communities and generate research to steer strategic case selection. The AHM Project builds on existing research and relationships with Aboriginal and Community Legal Centres to support the legal work of the Project.

===Pacific Justice Project===
There is a desperate lack of access to justice in South East Asia and the Pacific.

In order to address this problem the National Justice Project has galvanised Australian social justice lawyers to provide legal administrative and other support to Lawyers in Papua New Guinea, Irian Jaya, Nauru, East Timor and the Pacific Islands.

===The Aboriginal Innocence Project===
The Aboriginal Innocence Project is the first Innocence Project in Australia specifically dedicated to the wrongful conviction and incarceration of Aboriginal Australians. The AIP will be a vital part of the Australian social justice landscape.

In each case, the AIP will aim to:

1. Correct errors (or facilitate exoneration in the event of wrongful conviction); and

2. Prevent errors (or generate research that facilitates law reform).

The AIP's strategy is to obtain a just outcome for the individual and also to influence change to ensure the injustice is not repeated. This will be achieved through research and strategic case selection by senior solicitors. The selected cases will then be reviewed, and briefs will be prepared for barristers who will act on a pro-bono basis. 
The Project is unique because it will commence with the strategic selection of cases relating to the wrongful conviction of Aboriginal Australians after being tried or interviewed without an interpreter or with an unqualified and/or co-accused interpreter. This will not only include cases where an appellant is non-English speaking but also when an appellant speaks “Aboriginal-English” and/or demonstrates gratuitous concurrence

==Management and governance==
The National Justice Project is governed by a board of directors that includes:
* Jo Scard Chairperson
* Audrey Rodda
* Elizabeth O'Shea
* Adjunct Professor [[George Newhouse]] 
* Stephen Castan
* Dan [[Michael Mori]] 
* Duncan Fine

The current Principal Solicitor is [[George Newhouse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4779">The '''network theory of aging''' supports the idea that multiple connected processes contribute to the biology of aging. Kirkwood and Kowald helped to establish the first model of this kind by connecting theories and predicting specific mechanisms. In departure of investigating a single mechanistic cause or single molecules that lead to [[senescence]], the network theory of aging takes a [[systems biology]] view to integrate theories in conjunction with computational models and quantitative data related to the biology of aging.

==Implications==

* The [[free radical theory]], describing the reactions of free radicals, antioxidants and proteolytic enzymes, was computationally connected with the protein error theory to describe the error propagation loops within the cellular translation machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Kowald A, Kirkwood TB. Towards a network theory of ageing: a model combining the free radical theory and the protein error theory J Theor Biol. 1994 May 7;168(1):75-94&lt;/ref&gt;
* The study of gene networks revealed proteins associated with aging to have significantly higher connectivity than expected by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Promislow DE. Protein networks, pleiotropy and the evolution of senescence. Proc Biol Sci. 2004 Jun 22;271(1545):1225-34&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investigation of aging on multiple levels of biological organization contributed to a [[physiome]] view, from genes to organisms, predicting lifespans based on scaling laws, fractal supply networks and metabolism as well as aging related molecular networks.&lt;ref&gt;Kriete A, Sokhansanj BA, Coppock DL, West GB. Systems approaches to the networks of aging.
Ageing Res Rev. 2006 Nov;5(4):434-48 {{PMID|16904954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The network theory of aging has encouraged the development of data bases related to human aging. Proteomic network maps suggest a relationship between the genetics of development and the genetics of aging.&lt;ref&gt;de Magalhaes JP, Costa J, Toussaint O. HAGR. The Human Ageing Genomic Resources. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D537-43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchical Elements ==
The network theory of aging provides a deeper look at the damage and repair processes at the cellular level and the ever changing balance between those processes. To fully understand the network theory as its applied to aging you must look at the different hierarchical elements of the theory as it pertains to aging.

# Elementary particles of quantum systems- The aging process is described as an equation where a structure in an unbalanced state begins to change and that is seen primarily in the actions of quantum particles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkó|first=Gábor I.|last2=Gyurkó|first2=Dávid|last3=Veres|first3=Dániel V.|last4=Nánási|first4=Tibor|last5=Csermely|first5=Peter|date=2009-09-28|title=Network strategies to understand the aging process and help age-related drug design|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/gm90|journal=Genome Medicine|volume=1|pages=90|doi=10.1186/gm90|issn=1756-994X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Monomers of biological macro-molecules- After a while, different types of protein damage become widespread due to the build up of damages within the protein. Over time, the maturation of cross-links, proteolytic cuts, and amino acid truncations are very apparent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Proteins- Protein-protein exchanges either cease to exist or the connections between them become weaker due to energy loss and injury to the protein itself. This then leads to the protein being displaced in the cell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Cells- Connections within the cell begin to either tighten or loosen up eventually leading to weakened connections. There is a high price associated with these connections, especially within the brain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Organisms- As individuals age, their social networks begin to decline. Only thing remaining is the contacts for the most important social functions. Cognitive deterioration due to aging and loss of support systems leads to more declines in old age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Social groups- A decline in social groups mimics the declines associated with the aging process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Ecosystems forming a global ecological network- Networks within our ecosystems show us that we should be very concerned about the aging of our habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Elements of human systems- The aging process can be portrayed through human conceptual, cultural, and technological networks. With time, each of these networks begin to decline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32570">'''Neurodiversity''' is an approach to [[learning]] and [[mental health]] that argues various [[neurological condition]]s are the result of normal [[Human genome#Genomic variation in humans|variations in the human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:457919/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title=Autism as a Natural Human Variation: Reflections on the Claims of the Neurodiversity Movement|publisher=Linköping University|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neurodiversity" is a [[portmanteau]] of "neurological" and "diversity" that originated in the late 1990s as a challenge to prevailing views of certain neurological conditions as being inherently [[pathological]], instead asserting that neurological differences should be recognized and respected as a social category on par with [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], or disability status.

The neurodiversity movement describes itself as an international [[civil rights movements|civil rights movement]], of which the [[autism rights movement]] is its most influential submovement. Citing the classic legal maxim, "[[Nothing About Us Without Us]]", the movement promotes self-advocacy of its members. Neurodiversity advocates promote support systems (such as inclusion-focused services, accommodations, communication and assistive technologies, occupational training, and independent living support)&lt;ref name="ASAN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/policy-advocacy/position-statements/|title=Position Statements|publisher=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow those who are "non-neurotypical" to live their lives as they are, rather than being coerced or forced to adopt what neurodiversity proponents see as uncritically accepted ideas of normality, or to conform to a clinical ideal.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neurodiversitysymposium.wordpress.com/what-is-neurodiversity/|title=What is Neurodiversity?|publisher=National Symposium on Neurodiversity at Syracuse University|year=2011|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodiversity frames [[autism spectrum|autism]], dyslexia, and other neurological conditions as natural human variations rather than pathologies or disorders, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) [[cure]]d, instead believing them to be authentic forms of human [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], self-expression, and being.

==Terminology==
According to the 2011 National Symposium on Neurodiversity held at [[Syracuse University]], neurodiversity is:

{{quote|... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"/&gt;}}

==Autism rights movement==
{{further|Autism rights movement}}
The [[autism rights movement]] (ARM) is a [[social movement]] within the neurodiversity movement that encourages autistic people, their caregivers and society to adopt a position of neurodiversity, accepting autism as a variation in functioning rather than a [[mental disorder]] to be cured.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARM advocates a variety of goals including a greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;&lt;ref name=AAP&gt;[http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ Mission Statement.] Autism Acceptance Project.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other views: the mainstream perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the genes that cause autism; and the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

Many autistic supporters of autism rights describe themselves through words that emphasize the condition as an intrinsic part of their identity, such as "autistic", or "aspie" for those with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Ortega2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ortega|first1=Francisco|title=The Cerebral Subject and the Challenge of Neurodiversity|journal=BioSocieties|date=December 2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=425–445|doi=10.1017/S1745855209990287|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/biosoc/journal/v4/n4/full/biosoc200938a.html|language=en|issn=1745-8552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts to a general recommendation by [[United States|US]] disability advocacy organizations{{who|date=July 2018}} for the use of [[person-first language]] when referring to a person with a medical or mental condition or disability, which emphasizes the ''person'' with the condition, who has, rather than is defined by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059–3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];

===Acceptance perspective===
Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;Harmon, Amy. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.  Retrieved on 2007-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates believe that common therapies for the behavioral and language differences associated with autism, like [[applied behavior analysis]], are not only misguided but also unethical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelle Dawson|Dawson, Michelle]]. [http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists.] (2004-01-18). Retrieved on 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''"acceptance perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism spectrum|autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal&gt;{{cite news |author=Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |accessdate=2007-07-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work|publisher=Autistics.org|accessdate=2012-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215181832/http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|archivedate=2012-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARM is a part of the larger disability rights movement, and as such adheres to the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waltz, M |title=Autism: A Social and Medical History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=0-230-52750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies.

===Advocacy===
According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature and "broaden[ing] the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn.

A 2009 study&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Edward|author2=Pollak, David|title=Student experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from the BRAINHE project.|journal=Dyslexia|date=January 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=23–41|pmid=19140120|doi=10.1002/dys.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Edward Griffin and David Pollak separated 27 students (with autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and stroke), into two categories of self-view: "a 'difference' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a 'medical/deficit' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition". They found that although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a difference view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals".&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;

A 2013 online survey said this: "Such a deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit".&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

Cybernetics and computer culture, for example, may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind.&lt;ref name=BlumeAtlantic/&gt;}}

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece on June 30, 1997, Blume did not use the term "neurodiversity", but he did describe the foundation of the idea in the phrase "neurological pluralism":&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Yet, in trying to come to terms with an NT [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[neurotypical]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;]-dominated world, autistics are neither willing nor able to give up their own customs. Instead, they are proposing a new social compact, one emphasizing neurological pluralism. ... The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate [...] is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best."&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT/&gt;}}

Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement, writing:&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet. A project called CyberSpace 2000 is devoted to getting as many people as possible in the autistic spectrum hooked up by the year 2000, reason being that "the Internet is an essential means for autistic people to improve their lives, because it is often the only way they can communicate effectively. ... The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity.&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT/&gt;}}

Some authors&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;&lt;ref name="article"/&gt; also credit the earlier work of autistic advocate [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]], who was a principal early organizer of the international online autism community. Sinclair's 1993 speech, "Don't Mourn For Us",&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;Sinclair, Jim. [http://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html Don't Mourn For Us.] Autism Network International, n.d..  Retrieved on 2013-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that some parents considered their child's autism diagnosis as "the most traumatic thing that ever happened to them". Sinclair (who did not speak until the age of 12) addressed the communal grief parents felt by asking them to try to take the perspectives of autistic people themselves:
{{quote|Non-autistic people see autism as a great tragedy, and parents experience continuing disappointment and grief at all stages of the child's and family's life cycle. But this grief does not stem from the child's autism in itself. It is grief over the loss of the normal child the parents had hoped and expected to have ... There's no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person—and if it were possible, the person you'd have left would not be the same person you started with. This is important, so take a moment to consider it: Autism is a way of being. It is not possible to separate the person from the autism.&lt;ref name=Sinclair/&gt;}}

The term "neurodiversity" has since been applied to other conditions and has taken on a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger's syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ danda.org.uk]  DANDA website.  Retrieved on 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of neurodiversity is controversial.&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; Those supporting the [[medical model of disability]] identify the mental differences associated with these conditions as disorders, deficits, and dysfunctions, intrinsic differences in functioning which cause impairments in many areas of life. From this point of view, the mental states that are encompassed by neurodiversity are medical conditions that can and should be treated.&lt;ref name="Pollak"&gt;Pollak, David. 2009.

Author David Pollak sees neurodiversity as an inclusive term for the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because they think it sounds too medical.&lt;ref name="Pollak" /&gt;

The concept of neurodiversity as applied to [[autism]] is criticized for being skewed towards the "high-functioning" individuals of the autistic spectrum or those with milder forms of the condition. Those with "low-functioning" autism are often significantly impaired in their everyday functioning, and may not be able to function effectively with even the extensive use of advanced [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]]. Because many of these low-functioning individuals are unable to communicate effectively to express their opinions and wishes, controversy surrounds the issue of who represents them and what represents their interests.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Michael|title=Why we should be cautious about celebrating autism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/why-we-shouldnt-celebrate-autism/17468#.VxzY_nBWY7k|website=www.spiked-online.com|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sue Rubin]], an autistic woman and author who was the subject of the documentary ''[[Autism is a World]]'', favors a cure for the condition and asserts that while those with high-functioning autism tend to support the neurodiversity anti-cure position, those who have low-functioning autism generally hold the opposite opinion.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Sue|title=Acceptance versus cure|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|website=www-cgi.cnn.com|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=25 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926031713/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|archive-date=26 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis ... some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt;

Criticism has been levied against the "acceptance" position of neurodiversity advocates, with it being noted that even though the biomedical therapies that target the clinical features of, for example, autism and the conditions that may co-occur with it, do not amount to a complete cure, such treatments can still potentially significantly improve the everyday functioning and quality of life of those with these conditions. While such treatments require substantial investment and development and would not be available for application in the immediate future, they may provide greater benefit in the future and in the long-term.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick" /&gt; Many of those who view autism as a disabling developmental disease consider that the acceptance perspective of neurodiversity insults the suffering of its patients and their families.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;  Biology professor [[Jerry Coyne]] says that in its extreme, neurodiversity wishes to deny medical treatment for any person with a mental condition, particularly autism, even if the person wants a medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Coyne"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry |title=What do we do about “neurodiversity”? |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/what-do-we-do-about-neurodiversity/ |website=Why Evolution Is True |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Mitchell (writer)|Jonathan Mitchell]], an [[autistic]] author and blogger who is a vocal opponent of the neurodiversity movement and an advocate for research for a cure for autism, criticizes the concept of neurodiversity for providing "simplistic solutions to hard problems" and trivializing the disabling aspects of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Mark|title=A different way of thinking|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/feature/different-way-thinking|website=News|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers his condition to have negatively affected his life, describing autism as having "prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend. It's given me bad fine motor coordination problems where I can hardly write. I have an impaired ability to relate to people. I can't concentrate or get things done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Jon|title=Shortage of Brain Tissue Hinders Autism Research|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/02/04/170835708/shortage-of-brain-tissue-sets-autism-research-back|website=NPR|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes neurodiversity as a "tempting escape valve" for many of the people who are on the autism spectrum; and commenting on the supposition of a general acceptance of neurodiversity by those on the spectrum, he says that "most persons with an autism-spectrum disorder have never expressed their opinions on someone's blog and never will". He states that neurodiversity has no solution for low-functioning autistics.&lt;ref name=Solomon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Jonathan|title=Neurodiversity: Just Say No - An Article by Jonathan Mitchell|url=http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html|website=www.jonathans-stories.com|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticizes [[Temple Grandin]] for making generalizations about the condition and the experiences of those with it, saying that her generalizations trivialize his suffering.&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Lawrence|title=American Normal : The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome|date=2002|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-95307-6|pages=114–115, 155, 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to these positions, Mitchell is one of the most controversial voices in the autistic blogosphere, and has been highly criticized by many members of the neurodiversity movement.&lt;ref name=Hayasaki2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayasaki|first1=Erika|title=The Debate Over an Autism Cure Turns Hostile|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/27/one-activists-search-cure-his-autism-drawing-violent-backlash-306998.html|website=Newsweek|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World''''' ({{ISBN|978-0201483406}}) is a 1994 book by [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]. (The book was also published as ''Out of control: the rise of neo-biological civilization''.)  Major themes in ''Out of Control'' are [[cybernetics]], [[emergence]], [[self-organization]], [[complex systems]], [[negentropy]] and [[chaos theory]] and it can be seen as a work of [[techno-utopianism]].

==Summary==
The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organizations, intelligent computers as well as to the human brain.

==Reception==
''Out of Control'' has been translated into five languages, including Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese and Chinese. Additionally, the United Kingdom editions have been adapted into British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | people = Kevin Kelly( author) | title = "Kevin Kelly -- Out of Control."  | medium = Webpage  | publisher =   | location =   |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book was not widely reviewed when first released in 1994, but got visibly reviewed and extensively cited during the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| last = Turner| first = Fred
| title = From counterculture to cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the rise of digital utopianism

| location = Chicago| date = 2006| page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have called this book  a "mind-expanding exploration" (''Publishers Weekly'') and "the best of an important new genre" (''Forbes ASAP'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | people = Amazon webpage| title = "Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, &amp; the Economic World [Paperback]."| medium = Webpage  | publisher = Amazon.com, Inc.| location =   |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the book have contended that its position leaves us without a critical approach to politics and social power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Oxygen balance''' ('''OB''', or '''OB%''') is an expression that is used to indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to form [[carbon dioxide]] from [[carbon]], water from [[hydrogen]] molecules, all of its [[sulfur dioxide]] from [[sulfur]], and all metal oxides from metals with no excess, the molecule is said to have a '''zero oxygen balance'''. The molecule is said to have a '''positive oxygen balance''' if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a '''negative oxygen balance''' if it contains less oxygen than is needed; the combustion will then be incomplete, and large amount of toxic gases like [[carbon monoxide]] will be present. The sensitivity, [[strength (explosive)|strength]], and [[brisance]] of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.

The oxygen balance is calculated from the empirical formula of a compound in percentage of oxygen required for complete conversion of carbon to carbon dioxide, hydrogen to water, and metal to metal oxide.

The procedure for calculating oxygen balance in terms of 100 grams of the explosive material is to determine the number of [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s of oxygen that are excess or deficient for 100 grams of a compound.

:&lt;math&gt;OB\% = \frac{-1600}{Mol. wt. of compound} \times (2X + (Y/2) + M - Z)&lt;/math&gt;

where

''X'' = number of atoms of carbon, ''Y'' = number of atoms of hydrogen, ''Z'' = number of atoms of oxygen, and ''M'' = number of atoms of metal (metallic oxide produced).

In the case of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),

Molecular weight = 227.1

''X'' = 7 (number of carbon atoms)

''Y'' = 5 (number of hydrogen atoms)

''Z'' = 6 (number of oxygen atoms)

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;OB\% = \frac{-1600}{227.1} \times (14 + 2.5 - 6)&lt;/math&gt;

:OB% = −73.97% for TNT

Because sensitivity, [[brisance]], and strength are properties resulting from a complex explosive chemical reaction, a simple relationship such as oxygen balance cannot be depended upon to yield universally consistent results. When using oxygen balance to predict properties of one explosive relative to another, it is to be expected that one with an oxygen balance closer to zero will be the more brisant, powerful, and sensitive; however, many exceptions to this rule do exist. More complicated predictive calculations, such as those discussed in the next section of the [[explosive materials]] article, result in more accurate predictions.

One area in which oxygen balance can be applied is in the processing of mixtures of explosives. The family of explosives called [[amatol]]s are mixtures of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Ammonium nitrate has an oxygen balance of +20% and TNT has an oxygen balance of −74%, so it would appear that the mixture yielding an oxygen balance of zero would also result in the best explosive properties. In actual practice a mixture of 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT by weight yields an oxygen balance of +1%, the best properties of all mixtures, and an increase in strength of 30% over TNT.

Examples of materials with negative oxygen balance are e.g. [[trinitrotoluene]] (−74%), [[aluminium]] powder (−89%), [[sulfur]] (−100%), or [[carbon]] (−266.7%).

Examples of materials with positive oxygen balance are e.g. [[ammonium nitrate]] (+20%), [[ammonium perchlorate]] (+34%), [[potassium chlorate]] (+39.2%), [[sodium chlorate]] (+45%), [[potassium nitrate]] (+47.5%), [[tetranitromethane]] (+49%), [[lithium perchlorate]] (+60%), or [[nitroglycerine]] (+3.5%).

The theoretical compound [[trinitrotriazine]] has an oxygen balance of zero.

Commercial explosive materials should have oxygen balance close to zero, in order to minimize the production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s and [[carbon monoxide]]; the gaseous products of incomplete combustion are especially dangerous in confined spaces, e.g. [[coal mine]]s.

'''Paolo Soleri''' (21 June 1919 – 9 April 2013)&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; was an Italian [[architect]]. He established the educational [[Cosanti]] Foundation and [[Arcosanti]]. Soleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at [[Arizona State University]] and a [[National Design Award]] recipient in 2006.  He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri authored six books, including ''The Omega Seed'', "Arcology - City In the Image of Man", and numerous essays and monographs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Early life==
Soleri was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], [[Europe]]. He was awarded his "laurea" (master's degree) in [[architecture]] from the [[Politecnico di Torino]] in 1946. He visited the [[United States]] in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] at [[Taliesin West]] in Arizona, and at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin. During this time, he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1950, Soleri, with his wife Colly (née Corolyn Woods), returned to [[Italy]] where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory, Ceramica Artistica Solimene, in [[Vietri sul Mare|Vietri]] on the Amalfi coast.&lt;ref name="Solimene Ceramics Factory Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFOXomHEZ-w|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2011|title=Solimene Ceramics Factory Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and [[silt-cast]] architectural structures. For more than 40 years, proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work. Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at [[Arcosanti]] and [[Cosanti]] in Arizona.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1956, Soleri settled in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with Colly and the elder of their two daughters; the younger was born in Arizona. He began building [[Arcosanti]] in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students, as a place to test his urban design hypotheses. This "urban laboratory" (so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable, who at the time was the architectural critic of The NY Times) became internationally renowned.&lt;ref name="karissa"/&gt;

Paolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in [[urban planning]]. They established the Cosanti Foundation, a 501-3C educational non-profit foundation. Soleri's philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[paleontologist]] and philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery, beside his wife.&lt;ref name="karissa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karissa|first=Rosenfield|title=Remembering Paolo Soleri 1919–2013|url=http://www.archdaily.com/357747/remembering-paolo-soleri-1919-2013/ |work=Architecture Daily|publisher=ArchDaily| accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arcosanti==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
The Cosanti Foundation's major project is [[Arcosanti]]. Arcosanti, as originally designed by Soleri, was intended for 5,000 people; it has been in construction since 1970. Located near Cordes Junction, about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and visible from Interstate I-17 in central [[Arizona]], the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleri's concept of "[[Arcology]]", [[architecture]] coherent with [[ecology]]. Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city, designed to: maximize human interaction with ready access to shared, cost-effective infrastructural services; conserve water and reduce sewage; minimize the use of energy, raw materials and land; reduce waste and [[environmental pollution]]; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment. In 2010, construction was underway to complete Arcosanti's Greenhouse Apron, but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleri's death in 2013.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Arcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology. Soleri's other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean (Nova Noah), ''et al.'' (see: Arcology: City in the Image of Man). Since 1970, over 7000 people have participated in Arcosanti's construction.  Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network.&lt;ref&gt;Arcosanti Alumni Network. Retrieved from https://arcosanti.org/node/30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other achievements==
The International Architecture Symposium "Mensch und Raum" (Man and Space) at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] in 1984 received international attention. Paolo Soleri participated with, among others: [[Justus Dahinden]], [[Dennis Sharp]], [[Bruno Zevi]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Otto Kapfinger]], [[Frei Otto]], [[Pierre Vago]], [[Ernst Gisel]], and [[Ionel Schein]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri was a distinguished lecturer in the College of Architecture at [[Arizona State University]] and a member of the [[Lindisfarne Association]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1966, Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the [[Paolo Soleri Amphitheater]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. It was built for the IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts) on what is now the campus of the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] using large silt cast forms. The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws.&lt;ref name="krqe-demolish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/paolo-soleri-to-be-demolished-/|date=June 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2011|title=Paolo Soleri to be demolished|publisher=KRQE.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319150840/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/paolo-soleri-to-be-demolished-/|archivedate=March 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark exhibition, "City in the Image of Man - The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri", organized in 1970 by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], traveled extensively thereafter in the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], breaking records for attendance. "Two Suns Arcology, A Concept for Future Cities" opened in 1976 at the [[Xerox Square Center]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. In 1989, "Paolo Soleri Habitats: Ecologic Minutiae", an exhibition of arcologies, space habitats, and bridges, was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. More recently, "Soleri's Cities, Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond" was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in [[Scottsdale, AZ]]. A Soleri bell appears in the film [[What the *Bleep* Do We Know?]] His work has been exhibited worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1976, Paolo Soleri was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements, held it Vancouver, [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], [[North America]]. Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Paolo Soleri Archives, the collection of Soleri's drawings and writings, is located at Arcosanti. The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch under the direction of Tomiaki Tamura, a Cosanti Board Trustee and Arcosanti's Director of Special Projects. Tomiaki Tamura resides at Arcosanti.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

An interview with Soleri was featured in the environmental documentary [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|''The 11th Hour'']] (2007).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On 10 December 2010, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottsdalepublicart.org/permanent-art/soleri-bridge-and-plaza Soleri Bridge and Plaza. Retrieved from scottsdalepublicart.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art. The {{convert|130|ft|m|adj=on}} pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleri's design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale.

== Sexual abuse allegation ==
On 13 November 2017, Daniela Soleri—Paolo Soleri's daughter—published an article on the site ''[[Medium (website)|Medium]]'' accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In my early adolescence, my father, an architect and craftsman, began sexually molesting me, eventually attempting rape when I was 17."&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@soleri/sexual-abuse-its-you-him-and-his-work-88ecb8e99648|title=Sexual abuse: It's you, him, and his work|last=Soleri|first=Daniela|date=2017-11-14|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Encouraged to publish the article by the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her father's colleagues but received little response:

{{Quote|I finally told some of Soleri's inner circle about my experiences about 24 years ago, others learned of them six years ago when I tendered my letter of resignation from the board of Soleri's Cosanti Foundation, with an explanation of why. In response to receiving my letter, one of my father's long time colleagues and board member wrote "I am disappointed in everyone." A strange reaction from a man I had known since I was seven. Two years later he presided at a memorial seminar eulogizing Soleri and his work. His message seemed to be that, yes, he's disappointed that those things occurred, but he's equally disappointed that they are being brought up, instead of silenced.&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt;}}

In the article, Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleri's work and ideas. However, she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to "accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity".&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt; Of her father, Daniela wrote:

{{Quote|Soleri has been dead for nearly five years. The swell of hagiographic films, essays and performances has slowed, hopefully making room for a more useful perspective that includes not only consideration of his work, but also honest acknowledgment that he was flawed. That work will have to stand on its own, and not be seen as an inseparable part of Soleri as a person, including his best and worst behaviors.&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt;}}

As noted in ''[[Dezeen]]'', Daniela's article suggested that she had approached ''[[The New York Times]]'' or other news publishers to discuss her father's abuse, but had been turned away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/paolo-soleri-sexual-abuse-daughter-daniela-soleri/|title=Paolo Soleri accused of sexual abuse by daughter|last=Gibson|first=Eleanor|date=2017-12-18|website=[[Dezeen]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleri's:

{{Quote|We are saddened by Daniela Soleri's trauma. Her decision to speak out about her father's behavior towards her helps us confront Paolo Soleri's flaws, and compels us to reconsider his legacy. With Paolo Soleri's creative intelligence, he understood the need for discipline and limits to the urban form. However, his narcissism prevented him from understanding the need for discipline and limits on abusive behavior. We support and stand firmly with Daniela.

We know that Arcosanti and Cosanti are much greater than the ideas of one man. Over the past fifty years, more than 8,000 participants from all over the world have contributed to Arcosanti and Cosanti through our workshops and programs. Our work in urban planning will continue. It was considered radical fifty years ago and has proven itself relevant today. Our goal is a built environment inspired by Soleri's architecture that fosters community, integrates the natural world, and nurtures the best of human nature.&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/12/15/16781940/paolo-soleri-abuse-daughter-arcosanti|title=Architect Paolo Soleri's daughter Daniela recounts childhood abuse in open letter|last=Keith|first=Kelsey|date=2017-12-15|website=[[Curbed]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Curbed]]'' editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote "[Daniela] Soleri's account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth, but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful."&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed" /&gt; Keith noted that architecture as a profession "hasn't (yet) experienced its Weinstein moment", referring to the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] and the resulting "[[Weinstein effect]]" of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries.&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed" /&gt; In a 2018 ''Curbed'' article, Hilary George-Parkin said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"While Hollywood, tech, sports, media, politics, the restaurant industry, and others are reeling from high-profile revelations and resignations, the design world has remained—with the notable exception of Daniela Soleri's account of sexual abuse by her father, architect Paolo Soleri—mostly undisturbed in the public realm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/2/28/17058496/architecture-sexual-harassment-me-too-policies-gender|title=How top architecture firms measure up in the #MeToo era|last=Hilary|first=George-Parkin|date=2018-02-28|website=[[Curbed]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Criminology and penology|schools}}

In [[criminology]], the '''Positivist School''' has attempted to find scientific objectivity for the measurement and quantification of criminal behavior. As the [[scientific method]] became the major paradigm in the search for knowledge, the [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical School]]'s [[social philosophy]] was replaced by the quest for scientific laws that would be discovered by experts. It is divided into Biological, Psychological and Social.

==Biological positivism==
If [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of evolution]] was scientific as applied to animals, the same approach should be applied to "man" as an "animal".
===Physical characteristics===
Historically, [[medicine]] became interested in the problem of crime, producing studies of [[physiognomy]] (see [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]] and [[Franz Joseph Gall]]) and the science of [[phrenology]] which linked attributes of the mind to the shape of the [[Human brain|brain]] as reveal through the [[Human skull|skull]]. These theories were popular because they absolved [[society]] and any failures of its [[government]] of responsibility for criminal behavior.  The problem lay in the propensities of individual offenders who were biologically distinguishable from law-abiding [[citizen]]s. This theme was amplified by the [[Italian school of criminology|Italian School]] and through the writings of [[Cesare Lombroso]] (see ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''The Criminal Man'' and [[Anthropological criminology]]) which identified physical characteristics associated with [[Devolution (biology)|degeneracy]] demonstrating that criminals were [[atavism|atavistic]] throwbacks to an earlier evolutionary form. Charles Goring (1913) failed to corroborate the characteristics but did find criminals shorter, lighter and less intelligent, i.e. he found criminality to be "normal" rather than "pathological" (cf the work of [[Earnest Hooton|Hooton]] found evidence of biological inferiority). [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] identified three basic body or [[somatotype]]s (i.e. ''endomorphs, mesomorphs'', and ''ectomorphs''), and introduced a scale to measure where each individual was placed. He concluded that delinquents tended to mesomorphy. Modern research might link physical size and athleticism and aggression because physically stronger people have the capacity to use violence with less chance of being hurt in any retaliation. Otherwise, such early research is no longer considered valid. The development of [[genetics]] has produced another potential inherent cause of criminality, with [[chromosome]] and other genetic factors variously identified as significant to select heredity rather than environment as the cause of crime (''see: [[nature versus nurture]]''). However, the evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies shows no conclusive [[empirical evidence]] to prefer either cause.

===Intelligence===
There are a number of reputable studies that demonstrate a link between lower intelligence and criminality. But the evidence is equivocal because studies among the prison population simply test those criminals actually caught, which might be because they failed to plan the crimes properly or because they were unable to resist interrogation techniques and admitted their crimes. If their intelligence is poor, they are also less likely to be deterred.

===Other medical factors===
[[Testosterone]] and [[adrenaline]] have been associated with [[aggression]] and [[violence]], and the [[arousal]] and excited state associated with them. The excessive consumption of alcohol can lower blood sugar levels and lead to aggressiveness, and the use of chemicals in foods and drinks has been associated with hyper-activity and some criminal behaviour.

==Psychological positivism==
[[Sigmund Freud]] divided the personality into the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|id]], the primitive biological drives, the [[superego]], the internalised values, and the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]], [[memory]], [[perception]], and [[cognition]]. He proposed that criminal behaviour is either the result of [[mental illness]] or a weak conscience. [[John Bowlby]] proposed an [[attachment theory]] in which maternal deprivation was a factor that might lead to delinquency. This has been discounted in favour of general privation ([[Michael Rutter]]: 1981) or "broken homes" (Glueck: 1950) in which absentee or uncaring parents tend to produce badly behaved children.

[[Hans Eysenck]] (1987) stated that, "... certain types of personality may be more prone to react with anti-social or criminal behaviour to environmental factors of one kind or another."  He proposed three dimensions of personality: [[introversion]]/[[extroversion]], neuroticism, and [[psychoticism]]. For these purposes, personality is the settled framework of reference within which a person addresses the current situation and decides how to behave. Some traits will be dominant at times and then in a balanced relationship to other traits, but each person's traits will be reasonably stable and predictable (see Marshall: 1990 and Seidman: 1994). Hence, once conditioned into a criminal lifestyle, the relevant personality traits are likely to persist until a countervailing conditioning force re-establishes normal social inhibitions. Some forms of criminal behavior such as sexual offences, have been medicalised with treatment offered alongside punishment.

==Social positivism==
{{Main|Social positivism}}
In general terms, positivism rejected the Classical Theory's reliance on free will and sought to identify positive causes that determined the propensity for criminal behaviour. Rather than biological or psychological causes, this branch of the School identifies "society" as the cause. Hence, [[environmental criminology]] and other sub-schools study the spatial distribution of crimes and offenders (see [[Adolphe Quetelet]], who discovered that crimes rates are relatively constant, and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] which, under the leadership of [[Robert E. Park]], viewed the city as a form of superorganism, zoned  into areas engaged in a continuous process of invasion, dominance, and succession).  Meanwhile, [[Émile Durkheim]] identified society as a social phenomenon, external to individuals, with crime a normal part of a healthy society. Deviancy was nothing more than "boundary setting," pushing to determine the current limits of morality and acceptability.

[[File:Punch.jpg|thumb|1867 edition of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a ground-breaking [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] magazine of popular humour, including a great deal of satire of the contemporary, social, and political scene.]] {{Literature}}{{Performing arts}}
'''Satire''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]], and sometimes [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive [[social criticism]], using [[wit]] to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A feature of satire is strong [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]—"in satire, irony is militant"{{Refn | {{Citation | author-link = Northrop Frye | first = Northrop | last = Frye | title = quote}}{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} (literary critic).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Criticism|last=Frye|first=Northrup|publisher=Princeton UP|year=1957|isbn=0-691-06004-5|location=Princeton|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but [[parody]], [[burlesque (literary)|burlesque]], [[exaggeration]],&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"/&gt; juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.

Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including [[internet meme]]s, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots ==

The word satire comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''satur'' and the subsequent phrase ''[[wikt:satura#Latin|lanx satura]].'' ''Satur'' meant "full" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits".&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25–7 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.&lt;ref name="Kharpertian" /&gt;{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term "satire" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"/&gt;

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for “satyr” (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English “satire” comes from the Latin satura; but "satirize", "satiric", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}

The word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&amp;pg=PA2 p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour==
{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh. No matter how amusing it is, it doesn't count unless you find yourself wincing a little even as you chuckle.&lt;ref name="galaxy196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Laughter]] is not an essential component of satire;{{Sfn | Corum | 2002 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA175 175]}} in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and [[burlesque]].

Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://improbable.com/ig/ | title = Improbable | contribution = Ig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and psychological functions==
Satire and [[irony]] in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of [[social study]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt; They provide the keenest insights into a group's [[Collective unconscious|collective psyche]], reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power.&lt;ref name="Deloria69p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash1970p203"/&gt; Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babcock1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jo | last = Coppola | title = Comedy on Television | publisher = Commonweal | date = 12 December 1958 | page = 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a prominent example from [[ancient Greece]], philosopher [[Plato]], when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Willi2003p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg1962p39"/&gt;

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular [[need]] to [[debunk]] and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; Satire confronts [[public discourse]] and the [[collective imaginary]], playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them.&lt;ref name="WieseForbes2010p.xv"/&gt; [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"/&gt;

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; Institutions like the [[ritual clown]]s, by giving expression to the [[antisocial tendencies]], represent a [[safety valve]] which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the [[collective imaginary]], which are jeopardized by the [[Social repression|repressive aspects of society]].&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand1984p106"/&gt;

The state of [[political satire]] in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it,&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; and the state of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the [[Soviet Union]] where the [[dissidents]], such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was allowed, the most prominent satirist being [[Arkady Raikin]], political satire existed in the form of [[anecdote]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://samlib.ru/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml | last = Yatsko | first = V | title = Russian folk funny stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially [[Brezhnev]], famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric "modes".&lt;ref&gt;Corum (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA163 p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Worcester (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=foUbAQAAIAAJ ''The Art of Satire''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===
[[File:Satire (Orazio) - pag. 12.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;"Le satire e l'epistole di Q. Orazio Flacco", printed in 1814.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or [[Menippean satire|Menippean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Rolf Arnold|title=Komik und Satire|year=1973|publisher=Juris-Verlag|location=Zürich|isbn=978-3-260-03570-8 | language = German |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and "philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece" (Rankin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of "gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings" (Drury).&lt;ref name=nku.edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  authorlink = Raja Sharma | first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = [["Comedy" in New Light-Literary Studies]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.&lt;ref name=nku.edu/&gt; A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, "In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways." [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire "heals with morals what it hurts with wit" (Green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.

====Juvenalian====
{{See also|Satires of Juvenal}}
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. "He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.&lt;br /&gt;A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Juvenal satirist mocks "societal structure, power, and civilization" (Thomas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types &amp; Examples|work=Education Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. [[Jonathan Swift]] has been established as an author who "borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com" /&gt;

===Satire versus teasing===
In the [[history of theatre]] there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on [[politics]] and relevant issue, between satire and [[grotesque]] on one side, and [[jest]] with [[teasing]] on the other.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt; [[Max Eastman]] defined the [[spectrum]] of satire in terms of "degrees of biting", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and "kidding" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Max Eastman | first = Max | last = Eastman | year = 1936 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyd5wwn8acwC&amp;pg=PA236 | title = Enjoyment of Laughter | chapter = IV. Degrees of Biting | pages = 236–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] satirical playwright [[Dario Fo]] pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (''sfottò'').&lt;ref name="Lorch1997p128"&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Dario Fo | first1 = Dario | last1 = Fo | first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Lorch | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u12fXi_HDO4C&amp;pg=PA128 | title = Dario Fo | page = 128 | quote = In other writings Fo makes an important distinction between ''sfottò'' and satire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasing is the [[reactionary]] side of the [[comic]]; it limits itself to a shallow [[parody]] of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a [[subversive]] character, and a [[moral]] dimension which draws judgement against its targets.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990pn" /&gt;{{Refn | name = "Arroyop303" | {{Citation | first1 = José Luís Blas | last1 = Arroyo | first2 = Mónica Velando | last2 = Casanova | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CxZ_zH44PVkC&amp;pg=PA303 | title = Discurso y sociedad: contribuciones al estudio de la lengua en... | volume = 1 | pages = 303–4}} }}&lt;ref name = "Morson1988p114"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morson | first = Gary Saul | year = 1988 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpLiINhO83MC&amp;pg=PA114 | title = Boundaries of Genre | page = 114 | quote = second, that parodies can be, as Bakhtin observes, "shallow" as well as "deep" (''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', 160), which is to say, directed at superficial as well as fundamental faults of the original. [...] the distinction between shallow and deep [...] [is] helpful in understanding the complex ways in which parodies are used. For instance, shallow parody is sometimes used to pay an author an indirect compliment. The opposite of damning with faint praise, this parody with faint criticism may be designed to show that no more fundamental criticism ''could'' be made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo formulated an [[Operational definition|operational]] criterion to tell real satire from ''sfottò'', saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | year = 2005 | url = http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/147 | archivedate = December 25, 2005 | place = [[Italy|IT]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225171452/http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F147 | title = Matrix | quote = Dario Fo disse a Satyricon: —La satira vera si vede dalla reazione che suscita. | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;

Teasing (''sfottò'') is an ancient form of simple [[buffoonery]], a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonation]] of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, [[tic]]s, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with [[irony]]; it never harms the target's conduct, [[ideology]] and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;{{Refn | name="Arroyop303"}} ''Sfottò'' directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | language = Italian | url = http://www.nazioneindiana.com/2003/10/28/state-a-casa-a-fare-i-compiti-2/ | title = State a casa a fare i compiti | format = interview | editor1-first = Federica | editor1-last = Fracassi | editor2-first = Jacopo | editor2-last = Guerriero | journal = Nazione Indiana |date=October 2003 | quote = Lo sfottò è reazionario.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], the primary topics of literary satire have been [[politics]], [[religion]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdie Addis (2012) ''Qual è il tuo "tallone da killer"?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKysGIQV4SgC&amp;pg=PT20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while [[religious satire]] is that which targets [[religious belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p39"/&gt; Satire on sex may overlap with [[blue comedy]], [[off-color humor]] and [[dick joke]]s.

[[Scatology]] has a long literary association with satire,&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; as it is a classical mode of the [[grotesque]], the [[grotesque body]] and the satiric grotesque.&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andries2000p10"/&gt; [[Shit]] plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes [[death]], the turd being "the ultimate dead object".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human [[excrement]], exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duprat1982p178"/&gt; The [[ritual clown]]s of [[clown societies]], like among the [[Pueblo Indians]], have ceremonies with [[Coprophagia|filth-eating]].&lt;ref name="Parsons34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyers96"/&gt; In other cultures, [[sin-eating]] is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater),&lt;ref&gt;Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1923) ''Myths of Pre-Columbian America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA229 p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Marnham (2000) ''Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcddElQo9JkC&amp;pg=PA297 p.297]&lt;/ref&gt; by ingesting the food provided, takes "upon himself the sins of the departed".&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"/&gt; Satire about death overlaps with [[black humor]] and [[gallows humor]].

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners.&lt;ref name="Bloom1979"/&gt; Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. [[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Nicoll1951p179"/&gt; Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p189"/&gt;

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].&lt;ref name="Pollard1970p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1946p32"/&gt;

===Classifications by medium===
Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In [[preliterate culture]]s it manifests itself in [[ritual clown|ritual]] and folk forms, as well as in [[trickster]] tales and [[oral poetry]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, [[cartoon strip]]s, and [[graffiti]]. Examples are [[Dada]] sculptures, [[Pop Art]] works, music of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[Erik Satie]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; In modern [[media culture]], [[stand-up comedy]] is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into [[mass media]], challenging [[mainstream]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; [[Roast (comedy)|Comedy roast]]s, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Figured Ostracon Showing a Cat Waiting on a Mouse.jpg|thumb|Figured ostracon showing a cat waiting on a mouse, Egypt]]
One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, [[The Satire of the Trades]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = M | last = Lichtheim | title = Ancient Egyptian Literature | volume = I | year = 1973 | pages = 184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Helck | title = Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj | publisher = Wiesbaden | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; think that the context was meant to be serious.

The [[Papyrus Anastasi I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan H | last = Gardiner | title = Egyptian Hieratic Texts | series= I: Literary Texts of the New Kingdom | volume = I | place = Leipzig | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called "satire", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and [[societal commentary]],&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the [[political satire]] by which he criticized the powerful [[Cleon]] (as in ''[[The Knights]]''). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aristophanes003.html | chapter = Political and social satires of Aristophanes | editor-first = Alfred | editor-last = Bates | title = The Drama, Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization | volume = 2 | place = London | publisher = Historical Publishing | year = 1906 | pages = 55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Atkinson | jstor = 639144 | title = Curbing the Comedians: Cleon versus Aristophanes and Syracosius' Decree | journal = The Classical Quarterly | series = New | volume = 42 | number = 1 | year = 1992 | pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | title = Aristophanes: the Michael Moore of his Day | first = John Louis | last = Anderson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054115/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}} His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian [[Menander]]. His early play ''Drunkenness'' contains an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]].

The oldest form of satire still in use is the [[Menippean satire]] by [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]]. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of [[wikt:diatribe|diatribe]]. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was [[Quintilian]], who invented the term to describe the writings of [[Gaius Lucilius]]. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

===Medieval Islamic world===
{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}
Medieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry."{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77–8}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered "unchristian" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''[[Livre des Manières]]'' by {{ill|Étienne de Fougères|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

===Early modern western satire===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind - WGA3511.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]
Direct [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[François Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).

Two major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''

The [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" ([[Dryden]]).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: ‘Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.’}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires—the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting "juvenal" satire.&lt;ref name="Weinbrot2007p136"&gt;Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope § Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=06|author=Jonathan J.

[[Daniel Defoe]] pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' which mocks [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] patriotism, and ''[[The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters]]''—advocating [[religious toleration]] by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is a precursor to the development of [[political cartoons]] in 18th-century England.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, [[James Gillray]] from London.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent [[cartoonist]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ebenezer Cooke (poet)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1665–1732), author of "The Sot-Weed Factor" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===
[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]
Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:
:''"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,
:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;
:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,
:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!"

Novelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing "Letters to the Editor" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric "Letters to the Editor" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].

===20th-century satire===
[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"&gt;Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that "one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"&gt;Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American [[stand-up comedy]] most prominently by [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Mort Sahl]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; As they challenged the [[taboo]]s and [[conventional wisdom]] of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as ''[[sick comedian]]s''. In the same period, [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J. O'Rourke]], and [[Tony Hendra]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent satiric stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] acknowledged the influence ''The Realist'' had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010p94"&gt;Sullivan, James (2010) ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3dzVQ5wX9UC&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Carlin]] (2002) ''[http://paulkrassner.com/carlinintro.htm Introduction]'' to ''Murder At the Conspiracy Convention''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the [[satire boom]], led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]], whose stage show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and the [[television program]] ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/14/david-frost-satire-documentary "David Frost's Q&amp;A on how to be a satirist"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved February 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heller]]'s most famous work, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

The film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) starring [[Peter Sellers]] was a popular satire on the [[Cold War]].

===Contemporary satire===
Contemporary popular usage of the term "satire" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses [[caricature]] and [[parody]], by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]] from the British satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'']]
Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' was a satire of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norris (2014). British Television Animation 1997–2010: Drawing Comic Tradition". p. 153.

The television program ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing [[The Passion of the Jew|anti-Semitism]], [[Go God Go|militant atheism]], [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride|homophobia]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|environmentalism]], [[Gnomes (South Park)|corporate culture]], [[The Death Camp of Tolerance|political correctness]] and [[Red Hot Catholic Love|anti-Catholicism]], among many other issues.

Australian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (''[[We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year|We Can Be Heroes]]'', ''[[Summer Heights High]]'', ''[[Angry Boys]]'') and his work is often described as complex social satire.

[[File:Stephen Colbert by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Stephen Colbert]] satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his [[Comedy Central]] program in the U.S.]]
[[Stephen Colbert]]'s television program, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Colbert's character]] is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and "unwittingly" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

The American sketch comedy television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]&lt;ref name=TVGuide1&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/news/snl-hillary-clinton-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-amy-poehler/ Liz Raftery – "Who Did the Best Hillary Clinton Impression on SNL?", ''TV Guide'', April 30, 2015.

Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mollythedog2008.com/ | title = Molly the Dog | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053639/http://mollythedog2008.com/ | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.brianminer2008.com/ | title = Brian Miner | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir [[Terry Pratchett]], author of the internationally best-selling ''[[Discworld]]'' book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny – ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as "Simple J. Malarky". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the "exquisite agony" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.

[[File:2014- 02 - Obama and Putin, by Ranan Lurie.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Political satire by [[Ranan Lurie]]]]
Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Canada News Network]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), "Not Your Homepage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notyourhomepage.com/|title=Not Your Homepage – Check Your Morals At The Door, Come See the Internet Lore!|work=notyourhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. [[Mindry.in]], The Fruit Dish, [[Scunt News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |title=FRONT PAGE – Satirical News, Review, Comment &amp; Analysis |publisher=Scunt.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421054837/http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faking News]], [[El Koshary Today]], The Giant Napkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegiantnapkin.com/ |title=The Giant Napkin |publisher=Thegiantnapkin.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed Sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unconfirmedsources.com/ |title=Unconfirmedsources.com |publisher=Unconfirmedsources.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ''Onion''{{'}}s website). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. "It's whatever affects that person", said Mills. "So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]], a comedian from [[Shanghai]], is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold out shows ever since his rise to fame.

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, [[Reprise#In literature|reprising]] previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice.&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p136"&gt;Griffin, Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exaggeration]] is one of the most common satirical techniques.&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"&gt;Claridge, Claudia (2010) ''Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aegq_QdX6h8C&amp;pg=PA257 p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily [[Diminution (satire)|diminution]] is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; In Germany&lt;ref name="Geisler2005p73"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of [[art]] and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere [[freedom of information]] of journalistic kind.&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; In some countries a specific "right to satire" is recognized and its limits go beyond the "right to report" of journalism and even the "right to criticize".&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; Satire benefits not only of the protection to [[freedom of speech]], but also to that to [[culture]], and that to scientific and artistic production.&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main|The Juice Media#Controversy}}
In September 2017 [[The Juice Media]] received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the "Coat of Harms" based on the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]], no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the [[Australian Senate]] with the [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] moved 10 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973#|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and criticism==
Descriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging',&lt;ref name="Kinservik2002p21"&gt;Kinservik, Matthew J. (2002) ''Disciplining Satire: The Censorship of Satiric Comedy on the Eighteenth...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUcp4-01DMC&amp;pg=PA21 p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p10"/&gt;

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that "it's just not funny" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the "target" of its attacks. The "Make a Realistic Wish Foundation" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team "should hang their heads in shame". He went on to say that "I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&amp;pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice. Most introductory textbooks do not even list humor as a significant characteristic of cultural systems together with kinship, social roles, behavioral patterns, religion, language, economic transactions, political institutions, values, and material culture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
[[File:Emergency Twitter Was Down.jpg|thumb|right|Satire on [[internet culture]]]]
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes [[censorship]] in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554–1640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | place = London | year = 1875–94 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].

In 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a "[[mockumentary]]" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006. In February 2009, the [[SABC|South African Broadcasting Corporation]], viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ | work = Mail and Guardian | format = interview | title = Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille| accessdate = August 2005 | location = ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |work=Dispatch |location=ZA |title=ZNews: Zapiro's puppet show |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326004224/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-05-26-sabc-pulls-zapiro-doccie-again| work = Mail and Guardian | date = September 26, 2009 | location = ZA | title=SABC pulls Zapiro doccie, again}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apartheid South Africa]] also had a long history of censorship.

On April 29, 2015, the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) requested [[Kent Police]] investigate the [[BBC]], claiming that comments made about Party leader [[Nigel Farage]] by a panelist on the comedy show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act.&lt;ref name="UKIP"/&gt; Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, "Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on ''Have I Got News for You'' regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties."&lt;ref name="UKIP"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-29/ukip-asks-police-to-investigate-the-bbc-over-have-i-got-news-for-you/ "Ukip asks police to investigate the BBC over Have I Got News for You"].

* The 1784 presaging of modern [[daylight saving time]], later actually proposed in 1907. While an American envoy to France, [[Benjamin Franklin]] anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that [[Paris]]ians economise on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight.&lt;ref name='Franklin'&gt;{{cite journal|author-link = Benjamin Franklin | first = Benjamin | last = Franklin |title=Aux auteurs du Journal|journal=[[Journal de Paris]]|date=April 26, 1784|issue= 117|language = French}}  Wrote [[anonymously]].

*In the 1920s, an English [[cartoonist]] imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a [[multi-story car park]].&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic" /&gt;
*The second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which debuted in 1969, featured a ''[[Sketch comedy|skit]]'' entitled "[[The Mouse Problem]]" (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern [[furry fandom]] (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the skit was first aired).
* The comedy film ''[[Americathon]]'', released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese [[capitalism]], the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[terrorism]] aimed at the civilian population, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of [[reality shows]].
*In January 2001, a satirical news article in ''[[The Onion]]'', entitled "Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784 |title=Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over' | publisher= The Onion |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to "develop new and expensive weapons technologies" and to "engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years". Furthermore, he would "bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession". This prophesied the [[Iraq War]] and to the [[Bush tax cuts]].
*In 1975, the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] introduced the Mach3. In 2004, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and Gillette's marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930 |title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades |publisher=The Onion |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gillette released the [[Gillette Fusion]], a five-blade razor.
*After the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]] in 2015, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran an article with the headline "U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles". Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666977 |title=Where Satire Meets Truth: Did The Onion Just Predict a Real Israeli Headline? |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2016, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential ''[[Donald Trump]]'' presidency. Other media sources, including the popular film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' have also made similar satirical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future |title=Back to the future: how the Simpsons and others predicted President Trump |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satire rose the daunting question of what role public opinion would play in government.

Government officials cracked down on their humorous public criticism that challenged state authority through both its form and content. Satire had been a political resource in France for a long time, but the anxious political context of the July Monarchy had unlocked its political power.
Satire also taught lessons in democracy. It fit into the July Monarchy's tense political context as a voice in favor of public political debate. Satiric expression took place in the public sphere and spoke from a position of public opinion-that is, from a position of the nation’s expressing a political voice and making claims on its government representatives and leadership. Beyond mere entertainment, satire's humor appealed to and exercised public opinion, drawing audiences into new practices of representative government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPRU’s research today addresses pressing global policy agendas, including the future of industrial policy, inclusive economic growth; the politics of scientific expertise, energy policy, security issues, entrepreneurship, and pathways to a more sustainable future. It aims to tackle real-world questions whilst also contributing to theoretical knowledge on innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/campus-close-up-university-of-sussex/2019748.article|title=Times Higher Education: Interview with Johan Schot|author=Holly Else|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, SPRU ranked 3rd in the world for top science and technology think tanks on the Global Go ToThink Tank Index Report which was put together by the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=think_tanks&lt;/ref&gt;

SPRU has 70 plus faculty members and more than 180 MSc and 80 doctoral students. With an extensive global alumni network among senior science and technology policy makers, SPRU is committed to engagement and generating impact at all stages of research. Members of SPRU work closely with government and parliament, think tanks, media, business and the third sector, and are experienced in disseminating and applying their latest research findings.

==Organization==
The Science Policy Research Unit is located within the School of Business, Management and Economics at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. SPRU’s current Director is [[:nl:Johan Schot|Professor Johan Schot]], formerly Professor of History of Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology. He took over from Professor Gordon Mackerron in January 2014, and launched a new strategy in October 2014 with a focus on long-term transformative change.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/oct/24/transforming-innovation-policy|author=Johan Schot|title=Transforming innovation policy|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Jubilee Building.jpg|thumb|The Jubilee Building, where SPRU is currently based]]

SPRU is also home to a number of specialist research centres including:
*Sussex Energy Group
*Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (in partnership with the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Manchester|Manchester]])
*The STEPS Centre (Co-hosted with the Institute of Development Studies)
*The Nexus Network (with the universities of [[University of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]), 
*Harvard Sussex Program (a long-standing partnership with [[Harvard University]] in the field of biological and chemical weapons)

==History==
SPRU was founded in 1966 by Professor [[Christopher Freeman]], a pioneer of what is known as innovation studies today. Professor Freeman ‘embraced an ‘economics of hope’ which embodied a positive view of our potential to direct innovation, creativity and new technologies towards more sustainable and inclusive futures’.&lt;ref name=theguardian/&gt;

Since its foundation SPRU has had (and continues to have) a long list of highly regarded scholars among its faculty including [[Daniele Archibugi]], [[Giovanni Dosi]], [[Marie Jahoda]], [[Carlota Perez]], [[Keith Pavitt]], [[Mary Kaldor]], [[Richard R. Nelson]], [[Giorgio Sirilli]] and [[Luc Soete]], former Rector Magnificus of [[Maastricht University]]. Current faculty members include prize-winning economist [[Mariana Mazzucato]], author of the Entrepreneurial State and winner of the 2014 New Statesman SPERI Prize;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2014/10/mariana-mazzucato-wins-new-statesman-speri-prize-political-economy|title=2014 New Statesman SPERI Prize|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Johan Schot (SPRU Director), series editor of Making Europe; James Wilsdon, Guardian writer and former Director of Science Policy at the [[Royal Society]]; Ben Martin, editor of [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/research-policy/ Research Policy] and Associate Fellow of Cambridge’s [[Centre for Science and Policy]].

==Current Research Priorities==
SPRU Research activities are extremely diverse, and are grouped into four main research themes:

1, Science, Politics and Decision Making: Researchers at SPRU apply a deep historical understanding to how the choices made about science and technology shape our societies. They also work on the politics of expertise, and on issues of foresight, research assessment, metrics and impact in today’s research environment.

2, Energy, Sustainability and Development: Since the 1970s SPRU has been at the heart of international debates about the role of science, technology and innovation in fostering sustainability and development. SPRU’s aim is to help organisations, industries and policy makers ensure that appropriate technologies and innovations are developed and deployed to produce positive effects.

3, Economics of Innovation and Industrial Policy: Researchers at SPRU seek to understand the structure and dynamics of innovating firms and industrial systems and how to manage innovation capabilities in firms, including research and technology change in high-tech industries and managing uncertainty in complex systems.

4, Technology and Innovation Management: SPRU’s work includes analysis of technology strategy, new technology based firms, complex systems and products, high-growth new ventures, as well as looking at innovation in different business models and sectors, including infrastructure, healthcare, biopharmaceuticals and services.

==Studying at SPRU/Teaching==
From technology policy and managing innovation, to fostering sustainability, international development and understanding complex energy systems, students at SPRU benefit from working at the frontier of new knowledge on some of today’s most pressing global policy agendas. SPRU offers problem-led, rather than discipline-based teaching.

==Harvard Sussex Program==
The '''Harvard Sussex Program''' (HSP) is a collaborative effort on chemical biological weapons disarmament between [[Harvard University]] and Science and Technology Policy Research (SPRU) at [[Sussex University]]. It was formed by its two directors, [[Matthew Meselson]] and [[Julian Perry Robinson]] to provide research, training, seminars, and information work on chemical biological warfare and its disarmament.

The program publishes a quarterly newsletter ''The CBW Conventions Bulletin''.

The program is well known for its unique large archival collection of CBW related documents at Sussex (SHIB - Sussex Harvard Information Bank).

HSP is an academic Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that has influenced policy creation from within the United States and [[Great Britain]] on the formation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and reviews of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).

[[File:Nuclear reactor in dimona (israel).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center as viewed from a [[Corona (satellite)|Corona satellite]] in the late 1960s]]
The '''Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center''' ({{lang-he|קריה למחקר גרעיני – נגב צ"ש שמעון פרס}}, formerly the ''Negev Nuclear Research Center'', unofficially sometimes referred to as the ''Dimona reactor'') is an [[Israel]]i [[nuclear power|nuclear]] installation located in the [[Negev]] [[desert]], about thirteen kilometers south-east of the city of [[Dimona]]. In August 2018, it was renamed after the late [[President of Israel|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-nuclear-facility-netanyahu-lobs-stark-warning-at-iran/ At nuclear facility, Netanyahu lobs stark warning at Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the facility began in 1958 and its [[heavy-water]] [[nuclear reactor]] went active sometime between 1962-1964. Israel claims that the nuclear reactor and research facility is for research purposes into atomic science.{{sfn|Nuclear Research Center}} However, the purpose of the reactor is believed to be the production of nuclear materials that may be used in [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|William|2013}} Information about the facility remains highly [[classified information|classified]] and with respect to nuclear weapons the country maintains a policy known as [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|nuclear ambiguity]]—refusing either to confirm or deny their possession. Israel had produced its first nuclear weapons by 1967 and it has been estimated to possess anywhere between 80-400 nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Cohen|2010|pp = xxvii, 82}}

The airspace over the Dimona facility is closed to all aircraft, and the area around it is heavily guarded and fenced off. During the [[Six-Day War]], an Israeli missile shot down an Israeli Air Force [[Dassault Ouragan]] fighter that inadvertently flew over Dimona.{{sfn|Mahnaimi|2007}}{{sfn|Time|1976}}

== History ==

=== Construction ===
Construction commenced in 1958, with [[France|French]] assistance according to the [[Protocol of Sèvres]] agreements.{{sfn|Fox News|2001}} The complex was constructed in secret, and outside the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] inspection regime.{{sfn|Ben-Gedalyahu|2013}} To maintain secrecy, French customs officials were told that the largest of the [[Nuclear reactor|reactor]] components, such as the reactor tank, were part of a [[desalination plant]] bound for Latin America.{{sfn|Aftergood, Kristensen|2007}} Estimates of the cost of construction vary; the only reliable figure is from [[Shimon Peres]], who wrote in his 1995 memoir that he and [[David Ben-Gurion]] collected US $40 million, "half the price of a reactor ... [from] Israel's friends around the world."{{sfn|Pinkus|2002}}

The Dimona reactor became [[criticality (status)|critical]] sometime between 1962 and 1964, and with the [[plutonium]] produced there the [[Israel Defense Forces]] most probably had their first nuclear weapons ready before the Six-Day War.

=== Inspections ===
When the [[United States]] intelligence community discovered the purpose of the site in the early 1960s, the U.S. government demanded that Israel agree to international inspections. Israel agreed, but on the condition that U.S., rather than [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], inspectors be used, and that Israel would receive advance notice of all inspections. Israel is one of three nations not to have signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] (others are [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]] and [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], both of which have acknowledged having nuclear weapons), and alongside [[North Korea]] which left the NPT.{{sfn|UN|2005}}

Some claim that because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors' visits, it was able to hide the illegal manufacture of nuclear weapons, thereby deceiving the inspectors, by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection.{{sfn|Kintner}} The inspectors eventually informed the U.S. government that their inspections were useless, due to Israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect. By 1969 the U.S. believed that Israel might have a nuclear weapon,{{sfn|Burr|2006}} and terminated inspections that year.

=== Jet aircraft take-down ===
The Dimona reactor was overflown by unidentified jet aircraft before the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. These planes were thought at the time to be [[Egyptian Air Force]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s, although a controversial 2007 book argues that they were actually [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|Soviet MiG-25s]].{{sfn|Ginor, Remez|2007}} During the war, an Israeli fighter jet damaged in a bombing raid over Jordan was shot down by air defenses protecting the reactor after straying over it, killing the pilot, Captain Yoram Harpaz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-how-israel-s-nuclear-reactor-was-covered-up-1.5351217&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear weapons production ===

The full-scale production of nuclear warheads is believed to have commenced by 1966, with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] believed to be in possession of up to 13 operational nuclear warheads by 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', April 12, 1976, quoted in Weissman and Krosney, op. cit., 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mordechai Vanunu revelations ===
[[File:Vanunu-glove-box-bomb-components.jpg|thumb|Vanunu's photograph of a Negev Nuclear Research Center glove box containing nuclear materials in a model bomb assembly, one of about 60 photographs he later gave to the British press.]]
In 1986, [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a former technician at Dimona, fled to the [[United Kingdom]] and revealed to the media some evidence of Israel's nuclear program and explained the purposes of each building, also revealing a top-secret underground facility directly below the installation. The [[Mossad]], Israel's secret service, sent a female agent named [[Cheryl Bentov]] (née Hanin) who lured Vanunu to [[Italy]], where he was kidnapped by Mossad agents and smuggled to Israel aboard a freighter. An Israeli court then tried him in secret on charges of [[treason]] and [[espionage]], and sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment. At the time of Vanunu's kidnapping, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Israel had material for approximately 20 [[hydrogen bombs]] and 200 [[fission bomb]]s by 1986. In the spring of 2004, Vanunu was released from prison, and placed under several strict restrictions, such as the denial of a passport, freedom of movement limitations and restrictions on communications with the press. Since his release, he has been rearrested and charged multiple times for violations of the terms of his release.{{sfn|Timms|2004}}{{sfn|AFP|2015}}

=== Safety concerns ===
Safety concerns about the 55+ year-old reactor have been reported. In 2004, as a preventive measure, Israeli authorities distributed [[potassium iodide]] anti-radiation tablets to thousands of residents living nearby.{{sfn|AFP|2004}}

In 2006 a group of local residents was formed{{Who|date=January 2012}} due to concerns regarding serious threats to health and safety from living near the reactor.

==== Human experimentation ====
According to a lawsuit filed in Be'er Sheva Labor Tribunal, workers at the center were subjected to [[Human subject research|human experimentation]] in 1998. According to Julius Malick, the worker who submitted the lawsuit, they were given drinks containing [[uranium]] without medical supervision and without obtaining written consent or warning them about risks of side effects.{{sfn|Melman|2009}}
The lawsuit was rejected by the court and the worker's claims were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=גולן |first1=גדי |title=נדחתה תביעת עובד הכור שטען: "אולצתי לשתות אורניום" |url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/130169 |accessdate=20 November 2018 |work=ישראל היום |date=6 November 2013 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attacks ====
In January 2012, media reports indicated that the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] had decided to temporarily shut down the reactor. The site's vulnerability to attack from Iran was cited as the main reason for the decision.{{sfn|Mahnaimi|2012}} In October and November 2012, it was reported that [[Hamas]] had fired rockets at Dimona and/or Negev Nuclear Research Center.{{sfn|Debka|2012}}{{sfn|Arutz Sheva|2012}} In July 2014 Hamas again fired rockets towards the area surrounding the reactor. The facility was not harmed or damaged in any of the attempted strikes.{{sfn|Big News Network|2014}}

=== Declassified documents ===
In April 2016  the U.S. [[National Security Archive]] declassified dozens of documents from 1960 to 1970, which detail what American intelligence viewed as Israel’s attempts to obfuscate the purpose and details of its nuclear program. The Americans involved in discussions with Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and other Israelis believed the country was providing “untruthful cover” about intentions to build nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Adaret|2016}}

== Conspiracy theories ==

=== John F. Kennedy ===
In 2004, Mordechai Vanunu stated that the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] was Israel's response to "pressure [Kennedy] exerted on...Ben-Gurion, to shed light on Dimona's nuclear reactor in Israel".{{sfn|SMH|2004}} The [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] claimed during a [[United Nations]] General Assembly speech in 2009 that [[Israel]] had ordered the killing of [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] because Kennedy had wanted to investigate the Negev Nuclear Plant.{{sfn|JTA|2009}}{{sfn|Lynfield|2011|p=}}

==Spectrophilia as a fetish==
Spectrophilia is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] that is classified as the [[paraphilia]] in which one is attracted to ghosts or spirits. Spectrophiliacs fantasize about ghosts and often imagine scenarios involving sexual events between themselves or others and spirits.

==Succubus and Incubus==
In western folklore, the [[succubus]] is a demon or evil spirit who takes on a female human form to seduce men. The succubus most commonly seduces men through intercourse. The succubus is said to take semen from the male for use in impregnating a woman. 

The counterpart of the succubus is the [[incubus]]. The incubus is a demon that is said to take on a male human form. The incubus, much like the succubus, is said to seduce women into sex with the objective of impregnating the woman with its semen.&lt;ref name="csicop1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Stollznow|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/paranormal_paramours |title=CSI &amp;#124; Paranormal Paramours |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that succubi and incubi are spirits or ghosts that have sexual intercourse with men and women classifies the phenomenon as spectrophilia.

==Spectrophilia in folklore==
Many cultures have [[folklore]] involving spirits having sexual relations with humans, including [[Arab culture|Arabic]], [[Greek culture|Greek]], [[Hindu culture|Hindu]], and [[Celts|Celtic]] culture.

==Evidence==
No scientific evidence has been documented on the phenomenon of spectrophilia, though it has become a frequently talked-about subject among [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], including [[Ghost Adventures]] and the [[Travel Channel]]'s show titled ‘Ghostly Lovers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/who-are-these-ghostly-lovers-11635 |title=Who are these ghostly lovers? : Video |publisher=Travel Channel |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fiction==
Several films have dealt with the concept, among them ''[[The Entity]]'' (1981), ''[[Ghost_(1990_film)|Ghost]]'' (1990) , Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia (2008) and ''[[It Follows]]'' (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35602">{{Statistical mechanics}}

'''Statistical mechanics''' is one of the pillars of modern physics.  It is necessary for the fundamental study of any physical system that has a large number of degrees of freedom. The approach is based on statistical methods, [[probability theory]] and the microscopic physical laws. &lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The term ''statistical mechanics'' is sometimes used to refer to only ''statistical thermodynamics''. This article takes the broader view. By some definitions, ''[[statistical physics]]'' is an even broader term which statistically studies any type of physical system, but is often taken to be synonymous with statistical mechanics.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used to explain the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behaviour of large systems. This branch of statistical mechanics, which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as '''statistical thermodynamics''' or '''equilibrium statistical mechanics'''. 

Statistical mechanics shows how the concepts from macroscopic observations (such as temperature and pressure) are related to the description of microscopic state that fluctuates around an average state. It connects thermodynamic quantities (such as [[heat capacity]]) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in [[classical thermodynamics]], the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials. &lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;

Statistical mechanics can also be used to study systems that are out of equilibrium. An important subbranch known as '''non-equilibrium statistical mechanics''' deals with the issue of microscopically modelling the speed of [[irreversible process]]es that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat.  [[Fluctuation–dissipation theorem]] is the basic knowledge obtained from applying [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics]] to study the simplest non-equilibrium situation of a steady state current flow in a system of many particles.

==Principles: mechanics and ensembles==

{{main article|Mechanics|Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|l2=Statistical ensemble}}

In physics, there are two types of mechanics usually examined: [[classical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. For both types of mechanics, the standard mathematical approach is to consider two concepts:
# The complete state of the mechanical system at a given time, mathematically encoded as a [[phase space|phase point]] (classical mechanics) or a pure [[quantum state vector]] (quantum mechanics).
# An equation of motion which carries the state forward in time: [[Hamilton's equations]] (classical mechanics) or the [[time-dependent Schrödinger equation]] (quantum mechanics)
Using these two concepts, the state at any other time, past or future, can in principle be calculated.
There is however a disconnection between these laws and everyday life experiences, as we do not find it necessary (nor even theoretically possible) to know exactly at a microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities of each molecule while carrying out processes at the human scale (for example, when performing a chemical reaction). Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by adding some uncertainty about which state the system is in.

Whereas ordinary mechanics only considers the behaviour of a single state, statistical mechanics introduces the [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]], which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a [[probability distribution]] over all possible states of the system. In classical statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a [[phase space]] with [[canonical coordinates]]. In quantum statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The probabilities in quantum statistical mechanics should not be confused with [[quantum superposition]]. While a quantum ensemble can contain states with quantum superpositions, a single quantum state cannot be used to represent an ensemble.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be compactly summarized as a [[density matrix]].

As is usual for probabilities, the ensemble can be interpreted in different ways:&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;
* an ensemble can be taken to represent the various possible states that a ''single system'' could be in ([[epistemic probability]], a form of knowledge), or
* the members of the ensemble can be understood as the states of the systems in experiments repeated on independent systems which have been prepared in a similar but imperfectly controlled manner ([[empirical probability]]), in the limit of an infinite number of trials.
These two meanings are equivalent for many purposes, and will be used interchangeably in this article.

However the probability is interpreted, each state in the ensemble evolves over time according to the equation of motion. Thus, the ensemble itself (the probability distribution over states) also evolves, as the virtual systems in the ensemble continually leave one state and enter another. The ensemble evolution is given by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville equation]] (classical mechanics) or the [[von Neumann equation]] (quantum mechanics). These equations are simply derived by the application of the mechanical equation of motion separately to each virtual system contained in the ensemble, with the probability of the virtual system being conserved over time as it evolves from state to state.

One special class of ensemble is those ensembles that do not evolve over time. These ensembles are known as ''equilibrium ensembles'' and their condition is known as ''statistical equilibrium''. Statistical equilibrium occurs if, for each state in the ensemble, the ensemble also contains all of its future and past states with probabilities equal to the probability of being in that state.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Statistical equilibrium should not be confused with ''[[mechanical equilibrium]]''. The latter occurs when a mechanical system has completely ceased to evolve even on a microscopic scale, due to being in a state with a perfect balancing of forces. Statistical equilibrium generally involves states that are very far from mechanical equilibrium.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of equilibrium ensembles of isolated systems is the focus of statistical thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics addresses the more general case of ensembles that change over time, and/or ensembles of non-isolated systems.

==Statistical thermodynamics==

The primary goal of statistical thermodynamics (also known as equilibrium statistical mechanics) is to derive the [[classical thermodynamics]] of materials in terms of the properties of their constituent particles and the interactions between them. In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.

Whereas statistical mechanics proper involves dynamics, here the attention is focussed on ''statistical equilibrium'' (steady state). Statistical equilibrium does not mean that the particles have stopped moving ([[mechanical equilibrium]]), rather, only that the ensemble is not evolving.

===Fundamental postulate===

A [[sufficient condition|sufficient]] (but not necessary) condition for statistical equilibrium with an isolated system is that the probability distribution is a function only of conserved properties (total energy, total particle numbers, etc.).&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;
There are many different equilibrium ensembles that can be considered, and only some of them correspond to thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt; Additional postulates are necessary to motivate why the ensemble for a given system should have one form or another.

A common approach found in many textbooks is to take the ''equal a priori probability postulate''.&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt; This postulate states that
: ''For an isolated system with an exactly known energy and exactly known composition, the system can be found with ''equal probability'' in any [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] consistent with that knowledge.''
The equal a priori probability postulate therefore provides a motivation for the [[microcanonical ensemble]] described below. There are various arguments in favour of the equal a priori probability postulate:
* [[Ergodic hypothesis]]: An ergodic system is one that evolves over time to explore "all accessible" states: all those with the same energy and composition. In an ergodic system, the microcanonical ensemble is the only possible equilibrium ensemble with fixed energy. This approach has limited applicability, since most systems are not ergodic.
* [[Principle of indifference]]: In the absence of any further information, we can only assign equal probabilities to each compatible situation.
* [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics|Maximum information entropy]]: A more elaborate version of the principle of indifference states that the correct ensemble is the ensemble that is compatible with the known information and that has the largest [[Gibbs entropy]] ([[information entropy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jaynes| first1 = E.| authorlink1 = Edwin Thompson Jaynes| title = Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.106.620 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 620–630 | year = 1957 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1957PhRv..106..620J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other fundamental postulates for statistical mechanics have also been proposed.&lt;ref name="uffink"/&gt;

===Three thermodynamic ensembles===
{{main article|Microcanonical ensemble|Canonical ensemble|Grand canonical ensemble}}

There are three equilibrium ensembles with a simple form that can be defined for any [[isolated system]] bounded inside a finite volume.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt; These are the most often discussed ensembles in statistical thermodynamics. In the macroscopic limit (defined below) they all correspond to classical thermodynamics.
; [[Microcanonical ensemble]]
: describes a system with a precisely given energy and fixed composition (precise number of particles). The microcanonical ensemble contains with equal probability each possible state that is consistent with that energy and composition.
; [[Canonical ensemble]]
: describes a system of fixed composition that is in [[thermal equilibrium]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;The transitive thermal equilibrium (as in, "X is thermal equilibrium with Y") used here means that the ensemble for the first system is not perturbed when the system is allowed to weakly interact with the second system.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[heat bath]] of a precise [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. The canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy but identical composition; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy.
; [[Grand canonical ensemble]]
: describes a system with non-fixed composition (uncertain particle numbers) that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a thermodynamic reservoir. The reservoir has a precise temperature, and precise [[chemical potential]]s for various types of particle. The grand canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy and varying numbers of particles; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy and total particle numbers.

For systems containing many particles (the [[thermodynamic limit]]), all three of the ensembles listed above tend to give identical behaviour. It is then simply a matter of mathematical convenience which ensemble is used.&lt;ref name="Reif"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reif | first = F. | title = Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics| publisher = McGraw–Hill | year = 1965 |isbn =9780070518001|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gibbs theorem about equivalence of ensembles&lt;ref&gt;Touchette, H.

was developed into the theory of [[Concentration of measure|concentration of measure]] phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;Ledoux M. 2001 The Concentration of Measure Phenomenon. (Mathematical Surveys &amp; Monographs No. 89). Providence: AMS. {{DOI|10.1090/surv/089}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important cases where the thermodynamic ensembles ''do not'' give identical results include:
* Microscopic systems.
* Large systems at a phase transition.
* Large systems with long-range interactions.
In these cases the correct thermodynamic ensemble must be chosen as there are observable differences between these ensembles not just in the size of fluctuations, but also in average quantities such as the distribution of particles. The correct ensemble is that which corresponds to the way the system has been prepared and characterized—in other words, the ensemble that reflects the knowledge about that system.&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;

===Calculation methods===

Once the characteristic state function for an ensemble has been calculated for a given system, that system is 'solved' (macroscopic observables can be extracted from the characteristic state function). Calculating the characteristic state function of a thermodynamic ensemble is not necessarily a simple task, however, since it involves considering every possible state of the system. While some hypothetical systems have been exactly solved, the most general (and realistic) case is too complex for an exact solution. Various approaches exist to approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation of average quantities.

====Exact====

There are some cases which allow exact solutions.

* For very small microscopic systems, the ensembles can be directly computed by simply enumerating over all possible states of the system (using exact diagonalization in quantum mechanics, or integral over all phase space in classical mechanics).
* Some large systems consist of many separable microscopic systems, and each of the subsystems can be analysed independently. Notably, idealized gases of non-interacting particles have this property, allowing exact derivations of [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;
* A few large systems with interaction have been solved. By the use of subtle mathematical techniques, exact solutions have been found for a few [[toy model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780120831807 | title = Exactly solved models in statistical mechanics | last1 = Baxter | first1 = Rodney J. | year = 1982 | publisher = Academic Press Inc.  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include the [[Bethe ansatz]], [[square-lattice Ising model]] in zero field, [[hard hexagon model]].

====Monte Carlo====

{{main article|Monte Carlo method}}

One approximate approach that is particularly well suited to computers is the [[Monte Carlo method]], which examines just a few of the possible states of the system, with the states chosen randomly (with a fair weight). As long as these states form a representative sample of the whole set of states of the system, the approximate characteristic function is obtained. As more and more random samples are included, the errors are reduced to an arbitrarily low level.

* The [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm]] is a classic Monte Carlo method which was initially used to sample the canonical ensemble.
* [[Path integral Monte Carlo]], also used to sample the canonical ensemble.

====Other====

* For rarefied non-ideal gases, approaches such as the [[cluster expansion]] use [[perturbation theory]] to include the effect of weak interactions, leading to a [[virial expansion]].&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;
* For dense fluids, another approximate approach is based on reduced distribution functions, in particular the [[radial distribution function]].&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;
* [[Molecular dynamics]] computer simulations can be used to calculate [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages, in ergodic systems. With the inclusion of a connection to a stochastic heat bath, they can also model canonical and grand canonical conditions.
* Mixed methods involving non-equilibrium statistical mechanical results (see below) may be useful.

==Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics==

{{see also|Non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

There are many physical phenomena of interest that involve quasi-thermodynamic processes out of equilibrium, for example:
* [[Thermal conduction|heat transport by the internal motions in a material]], driven by a temperature imbalance,
* [[Electrical conduction|electric currents carried by the motion of charges in a conductor]], driven by a voltage imbalance,
* spontaneous [[chemical reaction]]s driven by a decrease in free energy,
* [[friction]], [[dissipation]], [[quantum decoherence]],
* systems being pumped by external forces ([[optical pumping]], etc.),
* and irreversible processes in general.
All of these processes occur over time with characteristic rates, and these rates are of importance for engineering. The field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is concerned with understanding these non-equilibrium processes at the microscopic level. (Statistical thermodynamics can only be used to calculate the final result, after the external imbalances have been removed and the ensemble has settled back down to equilibrium.)

In principle, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's equation]] or its quantum equivalent, the [[von Neumann equation]]. These equations are the result of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. Unfortunately, these ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble's [[Gibbs entropy]] is preserved). In order to make headway in modelling irreversible processes, it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.

Non-equilibrium mechanics is therefore an active area of theoretical research as the range of validity of these additional assumptions continues to be explored. A few approaches are described in the following subsections.

=== Stochastic methods ===

One approach to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate [[stochastic]] (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys information contained in the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from [[Black hole information paradox|hypothetical situations involving black holes]], a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] or [[pseudorandom]] influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.

{{unordered list
|1= ''[[Boltzmann transport equation]]'': An early form of stochastic mechanics appeared even before the term "statistical mechanics" had been coined, in studies of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had demonstrated that molecular collisions would lead to apparently chaotic motion inside a gas. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] subsequently showed that, by taking this [[molecular chaos]] for granted as a complete randomization, the motions of particles in a gas would follow a simple [[Boltzmann transport equation]] that would rapidly restore a gas to an equilibrium state (see [[H-theorem]]).

The [[Boltzmann transport equation]] and related approaches are important tools in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics due to their extreme simplicity. These approximations work well in systems where the "interesting" information is immediately (after just one collision) scrambled up into subtle correlations, which essentially restricts them to rarefied gases. The Boltzmann transport equation has been found to be very useful in simulations of electron transport in lightly doped [[semiconductor]]s (in [[transistor]]s), where the electrons are indeed analogous to a rarefied gas.

A quantum technique related in theme is the [[random phase approximation]].

|2= ''[[BBGKY hierarchy]]'':
In liquids and dense gases, it is not valid to immediately discard the correlations between particles after one collision. The [[BBGKY hierarchy]] (Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon hierarchy) gives a method for deriving Boltzmann-type equations but also extending them beyond the dilute gas case, to include correlations after a few collisions.

|3= ''[[Keldysh formalism]]'' (a.k.a. NEGF—non-equilibrium Green functions):
A quantum approach to including stochastic dynamics is found in the Keldysh formalism. This approach often used in electronic [[quantum transport]] calculations.
}}

=== Near-equilibrium methods ===

Another important class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanical models deals with systems that are only very slightly perturbed from equilibrium. With very small perturbations, the response can be analysed in [[linear response theory]]. A remarkable result, as formalized by the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], is that the response of a system when near equilibrium is precisely related to the [[Statistical fluctuations|fluctuations]] that occur when the system is in total equilibrium. Essentially, a system that is slightly away from equilibrium—whether put there by external forces or by fluctuations—relaxes towards equilibrium in the same way, since the system cannot tell the difference or "know" how it came to be away from equilibrium.&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;{{rp|664}}

This provides an indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such as [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]] by extracting results from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Since equilibrium statistical mechanics is mathematically well defined and (in some cases) more amenable for calculations, the fluctuation-dissipation connection can be a convenient shortcut for calculations in near-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

A few of the theoretical tools used to make this connection include:
* [[Fluctuation–dissipation theorem]]
* [[Onsager reciprocal relations]]
* [[Green–Kubo relations]]
* [[Ballistic conduction#Landauer-Büttiker formalism|Landauer–Büttiker formalism]]
* [[Mori–Zwanzig formalism]]

=== Hybrid methods ===

An advanced approach uses a combination of stochastic methods and linear response theory. As an example, one approach to compute quantum coherence effects ([[weak localization]], [[conductance fluctuations]]) in the conductance of an electronic system is the use of the Green-Kubo relations, with the inclusion of stochastic [[dephasing]] by interactions between various electrons by use of the Keldysh method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = B.

==Applications outside thermodynamics==

The ensemble formalism also can be used to analyze general mechanical systems with uncertainty in knowledge about the state of a system. Ensembles are also used in:
* [[propagation of uncertainty]] over time,&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;
* [[regression analysis]] of gravitational [[orbit]]s,
* [[ensemble forecasting]] of weather,
* dynamics of [[neural networks]],
* bounded-rational [[potential game]]s in game theory and economics.

==History==

In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''Hydrodynamica'' which laid the basis for the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.&lt;ref name="uffink"/&gt;

In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by [[Rudolf Clausius]], Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Statistical mechanics proper was initiated in the 1870s with the work of Boltzmann, much of which was collectively published in his 1896 ''Lectures on Gas Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Statistical Thermodynamics and Stochastic Theory of Nonequilibrium Systems |journal=Statistical Thermodynamics and Stochastic Theory of Nonequilibrium Systems.

Boltzmann introduced the concept of an equilibrium statistical ensemble and also investigated for the first time non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, with his [[H-theorem|''H''-theorem]].

The term "statistical mechanics" was coined by the American mathematical physicist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gibbs, "On the Fundamental Formula of Statistical Mechanics, with Applications to Astronomy and Thermodynamics." Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, '''33''', 57-58 (1884). Reproduced in ''The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol II'' (1906), [https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers02gibbuoft#page/16/mode/2up pp.&amp;nbsp;16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Gibbs, the term "statistical", in the context of mechanics, i.e. statistical mechanics, was first used by the Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1871. From: J. Clerk Maxwell, ''Theory of Heat'' (London, England: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1871), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DqAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA309 p. 309:] "In dealing with masses of matter, while we do not perceive the individual molecules, we are compelled to adopt what I have described as the statistical method of calculation, and to abandon the strict dynamical method, in which we follow every motion by the calculus."&lt;/ref&gt; "Probabilistic mechanics" might today seem a more appropriate term, but "statistical mechanics" is firmly entrenched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The enigma of probability and physics |last=Mayants |first=Lazar |year=1984 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-1674-3 |page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmwEfXUdBJ8C&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, Gibbs published in 1902 ''[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]]'', a book which formalized statistical mechanics as a fully general approach to address all mechanical systems—macroscopic or microscopic, gaseous or non-gaseous.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt; Gibbs' methods were initially derived in the framework [[classical mechanics]], however they were of such generality that they were found to adapt easily to the later [[quantum mechanics]], and still form the foundation of statistical mechanics to this day.&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;

It states that a class of [[control flow graph]]s (historically called [[Flowchart|charts]] in this context) can compute any [[computable function]] if it combines subprograms in only three specific ways ([[control structure]]s). These are
#Executing one subprogram, and then another subprogram (sequence)
#Executing one of two subprograms according to the value of a [[Boolean data type|boolean]] expression (selection)
#Repeatedly executing a subprogram as long as a boolean expression is true (iteration)

The structured chart subject to these constraints may however use additional variables in the form of [[bit]]s (stored in an extra integer variable in the original proof) in order to keep track of information that the original program represents by the program location. The construction was based on Böhm's programming language [[P′′]].

== Origin and variants ==
The theorem is typically credited&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|381}} to a 1966 paper by [[Corrado Böhm]] and [[Giuseppe Jacopini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohm|first=Corrado|author2=Giuseppe Jacopini |date=May 1966|title=Flow Diagrams, Turing Machines and Languages with Only Two Formation Rules|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=9|issue=5|pages=366–371|doi=10.1145/355592.365646}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harel]] wrote in 1980 that the Böhm–Jacopini paper enjoyed "universal popularity",&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|381}} particularly with proponents of structured programming. Harel also noted that "due to its rather technical style [the 1966 Böhm–Jacopini paper] is apparently more often cited than read in detail"&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|381}} and, after reviewing a large number of papers published up to 1980, Harel argued that the contents of the Böhm–Jacopini proof were usually misrepresented as a [[Mathematical folklore|folk theorem]] that essentially contains a simpler result, a result which itself can be traced to the inception of modern computing theory in the papers of von Neumann and Kleene.&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|383}}

Harel also writes that the more generic name was proposed by [[Harlan Mills|H.D. Mills]] as "The Structure Theorem" in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Harel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harel|first=David|authorlink=David Harel|year=1980|title=On Folk Theorems|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=23|issue=7|pages=379–389|doi=10.1145/358886.358892|url=http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/OnFolkTheorems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}}

=== Single-while-loop, folk version of the theorem ===
This version of the theorem replaces all the original program's control flow with a single global &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop that simulates a [[program counter]] going over all possible labels (flowchart boxes) in the original non-structured program. Harel traced the origin of this folk theorem to two papers marking the beginning of computing. One is the 1946 description of the [[von Neumann architecture]], which explains how a [[program counter]] operates in terms of a while loop. Harel notes that the single loop used by the folk version of the structured programming theorem basically just provides [[operational semantics]] for the execution of a flowchart on a von Neumann computer.&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Another, even older source that Harel traced the folk version of the theorem is [[Stephen Kleene]]'s [[Kleene's T predicate|normal form theorem]] from 1936.&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|383}}

[[Donald Knuth]] criticized this form of the proof, which results in [[pseudocode]] like the one below, by pointing out that the structure of the original program is completely lost in this transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |   doi = 10.1145/356635.356640
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|274}} Similarly, Bruce Ian Mills wrote about this approach that "The spirit of block structure is a style, not a language. By simulating a Von Neumann machine, we can produce the behavior of any spaghetti code within the confines of a block-structured language. This does not prevent it from being spaghetti."&lt;ref name="Mills2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Ian Mills|title=Theoretical Introduction to Programming|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84628-263-8|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="Pascal"&gt;
p := 1;
while p &gt; 0 do begin
  if p = 1 then begin
    perform step 1 from the flowchart;
    p := resulting successor step number of step 1 from the flowchart (0 if no successor);
  end;
  if p = 2 then begin
    perform step 2 from the flowchart;
    p := resulting successor step of step 2 from the flowchart (0 if no successor);
  end;
  ...
  if p = n then begin
    perform step n from the flowchart;
    p := resulting successor step of step n from the flowchart (0 if no successor);
  end;
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Böhm and Jacopini's proof ===
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
The proof in Böhm and Jacopini's paper proceeds by [[structural induction|induction on the structure]] of the flow chart.&lt;ref name="Harel"/&gt;{{rp|381}} Because it employed [[Subgraph isomorphism problem|pattern matching in graphs]], the proof of Böhm and Jacopini's was not really practical as a [[program transformation]] algorithm, and thus opened the door for additional research in this direction.&lt;ref name="amma92"/&gt;

== Implications and refinements ==
The Böhm-Jacopini proof did not settle the question of whether to adopt [[structured programming]] for software development, partly because the construction was more likely to obscure a program than to improve it. On the contrary, it signalled the beginning of the debate. [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s famous letter, "[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]," followed in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=Edsger|authorlink=Edsger W. Dijkstra|year=1968|title=Go To Statement Considered Harmful|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=11|issue=3|pages=147–148|doi=10.1145/362929.362947|url=http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703050443/http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/|archivedate=2007-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics took a purist approach to the Böhm-Jacopini result and argued that even instructions like &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; from the middle of loops are bad practice as they are not needed in the Böhm-Jacopini proof, and thus they advocated that all loops should have a single exit point. This purist approach is embodied in the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal programming language]] (designed in 1968–1969), which up to the mid-1990s was the preferred tool for teaching introductory programming classes in academia.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, E. [1995] "[http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/papers/SIGCSE-1995/LoopExits.pdf Loop Exits and Structured Programming: Reopening the Debate]," ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, (27)1: 268–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Yourdon]] notes that in the 1970s there was even philosophical opposition to transforming unstructured programs into structured ones by automated means, based on the argument that one needed to think in structured programming fashion from the get go. The pragmatic counterpoint was that such transformations benefited a large body of existing programs.&lt;ref name="Yourdon1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=E. N. Yourdon|title=Classics in Software Engineering|year=1979|publisher=Yourdon Press|isbn=978-0-917072-14-7|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first proposals for an automated transformation was a 1971 paper by Edward Ashcroft and [[Zohar Manna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashcroft|first=Edward|author2=Zohar Manna |year=1971|title=The translation of go to programs to 'while' programs|journal=[[Proceedings of IFIP Congress]]}} The paper, which is difficult to obtain in the original conference proceedings due to their limited distribution, was republished in Yourdon's 1979 book pp. 51-65&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct application of the Böhm-Jacopini theorem may result in additional local variables being introduced in the structured chart, and may also result in some [[code duplication]].&lt;ref name="WattFindlay2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Anthony Watt|author2=William Findlay|title=Programming language design concepts|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85320-7|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter issue is called the [[loop and a half problem]] in this context.&lt;ref name="LoudenLambert2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth C. Louden|author2=Kenneth A. Lambert|title=Programming Languages: Principles and Practices|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-52941-8|pages=422–423|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal is affected by both of these problems and according to empirical studies cited by [[Eric S. Roberts]], student programmers had difficulty formulating correct solutions in Pascal for several simple problems, including writing a function for searching an element in an array. A 1980 study by Henry Shapiro cited by Roberts found that using only the Pascal-provided control structures, the correct solution was given by only 20% of the subjects, while no subject wrote incorrect code for this problem if allowed to write a return from the middle of a loop.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt;

In 1973, [[S. Rao Kosaraju]] proved that it's possible to avoid adding additional variables in structured programming, as long as arbitrary-depth, multi-level breaks from loops are allowed.&lt;ref name="kozen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KOSARAJU, S. RAO. "Analysis of structured programs," Proc. Fifth Annual ACM Syrup.
Theory of Computing, (May 1973), 240-252; also in J. Computer and System Sciences, 9,
3 (December 1974), {{doi| 10.1016/S0022-0000(74)80043-7}} cited by {{cite journal
 |  author = [[Donald Knuth]]
 |   title = Structured Programming with go to Statements

 |  volume = 6

 |     url =
 |   pages = 261–301
 |   doi = 10.1145/356635.356640
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kosaraju proved that a strict hierarchy of programs exists, nowadays called the ''Kosaraju hierarchy'', in that for every integer ''n'', there exists a program containing a multi-level break of depth ''n'' that cannot be rewritten as program with multi-level breaks of depth less than ''n'' (without introducing additional variables).&lt;ref name="kozen"/&gt; Kosaraju cites the multi-level break construct to the [[BLISS]] programming language. The multi-level breaks, in the form a &lt;code&gt;leave ''label''&lt;/code&gt; keyword were actually introduced in the BLISS-11 version of that language; the original BLISS only had single-level breaks. The BLISS family of languages didn't provide an unrestricted goto. The [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] would later follow this approach as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/spe.470 | title=The BLISS programming language: a history | journal=Software: Practice and Experience | date=2002 | volume=32 | issue=10 | pages=955–981 | first=Ronald F. | last=Brender | url = http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/ronald-brender/bliss.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|960–965}}

A simpler result from Kosaraju's paper is that a program is reducible to a structured program (without adding variables) if and only if it does not contain a loop with two distinct exits. Reducibility was defined by Kosaraju, loosely speaking, as computing the same function and using the same "primitive actions" and predicates as the original program, but possibly using different control flow structures. (This is a narrower notion of reducibility than what Böhm-Jacopini used.) Inspired by this result, in section VI of his highly-cited paper that introduced the notion of [[cyclomatic complexity]], Thomas J. McCabe described an analogue of [[Kuratowski's theorem]] for the [[control flow graph]]s (CFG) of non-structured programs, which is to say, the minimal [[Induced subgraph|subgraphs]] that make the CFG of a program non-structured. These subgraphs have a very good description in natural language. They are:
# branching out of a loop (other than from the loop cycle test)
# branching into a loop
# branching into a decision (i.e. into an if "branch")
# branching out of a decision
McCabe actually found that these four graphs are not independent when appearing as subgraphs, meaning that a necessary and sufficient condition for a program to be non-structured is for its CFG to have as subgraph one of any subset of three of these four graphs. He also found that if a non-structured program contains one of these four sub-graphs, it must contain another distinct one from the set of four. This latter result helps explain how the control flow of non-structured program becomes entangled in what is popularly called "[[spaghetti code]]". McCabe also devised a numerical measure that, given an arbitrary program, quantifies how far off it is from the ideal of being a structured program; McCabe called his measure [[essential complexity (numerical measure of "structuredness")|essential complexity]].&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;The original paper is {{cite journal |author=Thomas J. McCabe |date=December 1976 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering |issue=4 |pages=315–318 |title=A Complexity Measure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtNWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |doi=10.1109/tse.1976.233837}} For a secondary exposition see {{cite book|author=Paul C. Jorgensen|title=Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yph_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-0809-3|pages=150–153|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCabe's characterization of the [[forbidden graph]]s for structured programming can be considered incomplete, at least if the Dijkstra's D structures are considered the building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/26.3.270 | title=Flowchart Schemata and the Problem of Nomenclature | journal=The Computer Journal | date=1983 | volume=26 | issue=3 | pages=270–276 | first=M. H. | last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|274–275}}{{clarify|date=July 2014}}

Up to 1990 there were quite a few proposed methods for eliminating gotos from existing program, while preserving most of their structure. The various approaches to this problem also proposed several notions of equivalence, which are stricter than simply Turing equivalence, in order to avoid output like the folk theorem discussed above. The strictness of the chosen notion of equivalence dictates the minimal set of control flow structures needed. The 1988 [[JACM]] paper by Lyle Ramshaw surveys the field up to that point, as well proposing its own method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/48014.48021| title = Eliminating go to's while preserving program structure| journal = Journal of the ACM| volume = 35| issue = 4| pages = 893–920| year = 1988| last1 = Ramshaw | first1 = L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramshaw's algorithm was used for example in some Java [[decompiler]]s because the [[Java virtual machine]] code has branch instructions with targets expressed as offsets, but the high-level Java language only has multi-level &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statements.&lt;ref name="Nolan2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Godfrey Nolan|title=Decompiling Java|year=2004|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0739-9|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/coots97/full_papers/proebsting2/proebsting2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openjit.org/publications/pro1999-06/decompiler-pro-199906.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ammarguellat (1992) proposed a transformation method that goes back to enforcing single-exit.&lt;ref name="amma92"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/32.126773 | title=A control-flow normalization algorithm and its complexity | journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering | date=1992 | volume=18 | issue=3 | pages=237–251 | first=Z. | last=Ammarguellat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to Cobol==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
In the 1980s [[IBM]] researcher [[Harlan Mills]] oversaw the development of the [[COBOL Structuring Facility]], which applied a structuring algorithm to [[COBOL]] code. Mills's transformation involved the following steps for each procedure.

#Identify the [[basic block]]s in the procedure.
#Assign a unique [[Label (programming language)|label]] to each block's entry path, and label each block's exit paths with the labels of the entry paths they connect to. Use 0 for return from the procedure and 1 for the procedure's entry path.
#Break the procedure into its basic blocks.
#For each block that is the destination of only one exit path, reconnect that block to that exit path.
#Declare a new variable in the procedure (called L for reference).
#On each remaining unconnected exit path, add a statement that sets L to the label value on that path.
#Combine the resulting programs into a selection statement that executes the program with the entry path label indicated by L
#Construct a loop that executes this selection statement as long as L is not 0.
#Construct a sequence that initializes L to 1 and executes the loop.

Note that this construction can be improved by converting some cases of the selection statement into subprocedures.

Others&lt;ref name='Hewitt'&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hewitt, Paul G.|year=2001 |title=Conceptual Physics|location=USA|publisher=Addison–Wesley |isbn=0-321-05202-1 |pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; define it as the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that keep it in place: the weight is the quantity that is measured by, for example, a spring scale. Thus, in a state of [[free fall]], the weight would be zero. In this sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless: ignoring [[Drag (physics)|air resistance]], the famous apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near [[Isaac Newton]], would be weightless.

The [[unit of measurement]] for weight is that of [[force]], which in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[newton (unit)|newton]]. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the [[Moon]]. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;The National Standard of Canada, CAN/CSA-Z234.1-89 Canadian Metric Practice Guide, January 1989:
*'''5.7.3''' Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term "weight". In commercial and everyday use, the term "weight" nearly always means mass. In science and technology "weight" has primarily meant a force due to gravity. In scientific and technical work, the term "weight" should be replaced by the term "mass" or "force", depending on the application.
*'''5.7.4''' The use of the verb "to weigh" meaning "to determine the mass of", e.g., "I weighed this object and determined its mass to be 5&amp;nbsp;kg," is correct.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do with the [[theory of relativity]] according to which gravity is modelled as a consequence of the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]]. In the teaching community, a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students. The current situation is that a multiple set of concepts co-exist and find use in their various contexts.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

==History==

Discussion of the concepts of heaviness (weight) and lightness (levity) date back to the [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects. [[Plato]] described weight as the natural tendency of objects to seek their kin. To [[Aristotle]], weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic elements: air, earth, fire and water. He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire. [[Archimedes]] saw weight as a quality opposed to [[buoyancy]], with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats. The first operational definition of weight was given by [[Euclid]], who defined weight as: "weight is the heaviness or lightness of one thing, compared to another, as measured by a balance."&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt; Operational balances (rather than definitions) had, however, been around much longer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/museum accessed 29 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, weight was the direct cause of the falling motion of an object, the speed of the falling object was supposed to be directly proportionate to the weight of the object. As medieval scholars discovered that in practice the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this cause effect relationship. Weight was split into a "still weight" or ''pondus'', which remained constant, and the actual gravity or ''gravitas'', which changed as the object fell. The concept of ''gravitas'' was eventually replaced by [[Jean Buridan]]'s [[theory of impetus|impetus]], a precursor to [[momentum]].&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

The rise of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican view of the world]] led to the resurgence of the Platonic idea that like objects attract but in the context of heavenly bodies. In the 17th century, [[Galileo]] made significant advances in the concept of weight. He proposed a way to measure the difference between the weight of a moving object and an object at rest. Ultimately, he concluded weight was proportionate to the amount of matter of an object, and not the speed of motion as supposed by the Aristotelean view of physics.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

===Newton===
The introduction of [[Newton's laws of motion]] and the development of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] led to considerable further development of the concept of weight. Weight became fundamentally separate from [[mass]]. Mass was identified as a fundamental property of objects connected to their [[inertia]], while weight became identified with the force of gravity on an object and therefore dependent on the context of the object. In particular, Newton considered weight to be relative to another object causing the gravitational pull, e.g. the weight of the Earth towards the Sun.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

Newton considered time and space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider concepts as true position and true velocity.{{Clarify| reason = broken sentence; not sure if it should say "*such* concepts as", or if there is something else missing|date=June 2011}} Newton also recognized that weight as measured by the action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy. He considered this a false weight induced by imperfect measurement conditions, for which he introduced the term ''apparent weight'' as compared to the ''true weight'' defined by gravity.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

Although Newtonian physics made a clear distinction between weight and mass, the term weight continued to be commonly used when people meant mass. This led the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) of 1901 to officially declare "The word ''weight'' denotes a quantity of the same nature as a ''force'': the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity", thus distinguishing it from mass for official usage.

===Relativity===
In the 20th century, the Newtonian concepts of absolute time and space were challenged by relativity. Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant by the force of gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:Nitrolympics TopFuel 2005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This [[top fuel|top-fuel dragster]] can accelerate from zero to {{convert|160|km/h|0}} in 0.86 seconds. This is a horizontal acceleration of 5.3&amp;nbsp;g. Combined with the vertical g-force in the stationary case the [[Pythagorean theorem]] yields a g-force of 5.4&amp;nbsp;g. It is this g-force that causes the driver's weight if one uses the operational definition. If one uses the gravitational definition, the driver's weight is unchanged by the motion of the car.]]
Several definitions exist for ''weight'', not all of which are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Gat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal

===Gravitational definition===
The most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galili-Lehavi"/&gt; This is often expressed in the formula {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}, where ''W'' is the weight, ''m'' the mass of the object, and ''g'' [[gravitational acceleration]].

In 1901, the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) established this as their official definition of ''weight'':
{{quotation|"The word ''weight'' denotes a quantity of the same nature{{#tag:ref
 |The phrase "quantity of the same nature" is a literal translation of the [[French (language)|French]] phrase ''grandeur de la même nature''.

This resolution defines weight as a vector, since force is a vector quantity. However, some textbooks also take weight to be a scalar by defining:
{{quotation|"The weight ''W'' of a body is equal to the magnitude ''F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the gravitational force on the body."&lt;ref name="Halliday 2007 95"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Physics |volume=1 |first=David |last=Halliday |first2=Robert |last2=Resnick |first3=Jearl |last3=Walker |publisher= Wiley |date=2007 |edition=8th |page=95 |isbn= 978-0-470-04473-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The gravitational acceleration varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to have a [[standard gravity|standard value]] of {{nowrap|9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which gives the [[standard weight]].&lt;ref name="3rdCGPM"&gt;{{cite web

The force whose magnitude is equal to ''mg'' newtons is also known as the '''m kilogram weight''' (which term is abbreviated to '''kg-wt''')&lt;ref&gt;Chester, W. Mechanics. George Allen &amp; Unwin. London. 1979. {{ISBN|0-04-510059-4}}. Section 3.2 at page 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has the secondary effect of comparing masses because weight is proportional to mass. --&gt; by comparing an object to references. On the Moon, an object would give the same reading, because the object and references would ''both'' become lighter.}}

===Operational definition===
In the operational definition, the weight of an object is the [[force]] measured by the operation of weighing it, which is '''the force it exerts on its support'''.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; 
Since, W=downward force on the body by the centre of earth, and there is no acceleration in the body. So, there exists opposite and equal force by the support on the body. Also it is equal to the force exerted by the body on its support because action and reaction have same numerical value and opposite direction.
This can make a considerable difference, depending on the details; for example, an object in [[free fall]] exerts little if any force on its support, a situation that is commonly referred to as [[weightlessness]]. However, being in free fall does not affect the weight according to the gravitational definition. Therefore, the operational definition is sometimes refined by requiring that the object be at rest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, this raises the issue of defining "at rest" (usually being at rest with respect to the Earth is implied by using [[standard gravity]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}). In the operational definition, the weight of an object at rest on the surface of the Earth is lessened by the effect of the centrifugal force from the Earth's rotation.

The operational definition, as usually given, does not explicitly exclude the effects of [[buoyancy]], which reduces the measured weight of an object when it is immersed in a fluid such as air or water. As a result, a floating [[balloon]] or an object floating in water might be said to have zero weight.

===ISO definition===
In the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] International standard ISO 80000-4(2006),&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-4:2006, Quantities and units - Part 4: Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt; describing the basic physical quantities and units in mechanics as a part of the International standard [[ISO/IEC 80000]], the definition of ''weight'' is given as:
{{quotation|
'''Definition'''
:&lt;math&gt;F_g = m g \, &lt;/math&gt;,
:where ''m'' is mass and ''g'' is local acceleration of free fall.

'''Remarks'''
*When the reference frame is Earth, this quantity comprises not only the local gravitational force, but also the local centrifugal force due to the rotation of the Earth, a force which varies with latitude.
*The effect of atmospheric buoyancy is excluded in the weight.
*In common parlance, the name "weight" continues to be used where "mass" is meant, but this practice is deprecated.
|ISO 80000-4 (2006)}}

The definition is dependent on the chosen [[frame of reference]]. When the chosen frame is co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; If the specified frame is the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.

=== Apparent weight ===
{{Main|Apparent weight}}
In many real world situations the act of weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually referred to as the apparent weight of the object. A common example of this is the effect of [[buoyancy]], when an object is immersed in a [[fluid]] the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent weight may be similarly affected by [[levitation]] and mechanical suspension. When the gravitational definition of weight is used, the operational weight measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Mass==

Notice that the amount of force that the table is pushing upward on the object (the N vector) is equal to the downward force of the object's weight (shown here as ''mg'', as weight is equal to the object's mass multiplied with the acceleration due to gravity): because these forces are equal, the object is in a state of [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] (all the forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on it sum to zero).]]
{{Main|Mass versus weight}}
In modern scientific usage, weight and [[mass]] are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] property of [[matter]], whereas weight is a ''force'' that results from the action of [[gravity]] on matter: it measures how strongly the force of gravity pulls on that matter. However, in most practical everyday situations the word "weight" is used when, strictly, "mass" is meant.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST811wt"&gt;{{cite web |author=A.

The distinction between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because the strength of gravity does not vary too much on the surface of the Earth. In a uniform gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|directly proportional]] to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object's mass can be measured indirectly by its weight, and so, for everyday purposes, [[weighing]] (using a [[weighing scale]]) is an entirely acceptable way of measuring mass. Similarly, a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]] measures mass indirectly by comparing the weight of the measured item to that of an object(s) of known mass. Since the measured item and the comparison mass are in virtually the same location, so experiencing the same [[gravity|gravitational field]], the effect of varying gravity does not affect the comparison or the resulting measurement.

The Earth's [[gravity|gravitational field]] is not uniform but can vary by as much as 0.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and must be taken into account in high precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. [[Spring scale]]s, which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010|reason=Doesn't this depend on the jurisdiction?}}

The historic use of "weight" for "mass" also persists in some scientific terminology – for example, the [[chemistry|chemical]] terms "atomic weight", "molecular weight", and "formula weight", can still be found rather than the preferred "[[atomic mass]]" etc.

In a different gravitational field, for example, on the surface of the [[Moon]], an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity on the surface of the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as on the surface of the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an intrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] weighs only about 30 [[pound-force|pounds-force]] when visiting the Moon.

===SI units===
In most modern scientific work, physical quantities are measured in [[International System of Units|SI]] units. The SI unit of weight is the same as that of force: the [[newton (unit)|newton]] (N) – a derived unit which can also be expressed in [[SI base unit]]s as kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (kilograms times meters per second squared).&lt;ref name=NIST811wt/&gt;

In commercial and everyday use, the term "weight" is usually used to mean mass, and the verb "to weigh" means "to determine the mass of" or "to have a mass of". Used in this sense, the proper SI unit is the [[kilogram]] (kg).&lt;ref name=NIST811wt/&gt;

===Pound and other non-SI units===
In [[United States customary units]], the pound can be either a unit of force or a unit of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/common-conversion-b.cfm
| title = Common Conversion Factors, Approximate Conversions from U.S. Customary Measures to Metric

| accessdate = 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related units used in some distinct, separate subsystems of units include the [[poundal]] and the [[slug (unit)|slug]]. The poundal is defined as the force necessary to accelerate an object of one-pound ''mass'' at 1&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is equivalent to about 1/32.2 of a pound-''force''. The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass).

The [[kilogram-force]] is a non-SI unit of force, defined as the force exerted by a one kilogram mass in standard Earth gravity (equal to 9.80665 newtons exactly).  The [[dyne]] is the [[centimetre-gram-second|cgs]] unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI.

==Sensation==
{{See also|Apparent weight}}
The sensation of weight is caused by the force exerted by fluids in the [[vestibular system]], a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner [[ear]].{{Dubious|Sensation of Weight|date=June 2010}} It is actually the sensation of [[g-force]], regardless of whether this is due to being stationary in the presence of gravity, or, if the person is in motion, the result of any other forces acting on the body such as in the case of acceleration or deceleration of a lift, or centrifugal forces when turning sharply.

Weight is commonly measured using one of two methods. A [[Weighing scale#Spring scales|spring scale]] or [[Weighing scale#Hydraulic or pneumatic scale|hydraulic or pneumatic scale]] measures local weight, the local [[force]] of [[gravity]] on the object (strictly [[apparent weight|''apparent'' weight force]]). Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal [[standard gravity]] of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (approx. 32.174&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). However, this calibration is done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, the force of gravity will be different, causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate, and legal for commerce, [[spring scale]]s must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.

A ''[[Weighing scale#balance|balance]]'' on the other hand, compares the weight of an unknown object in one scale pan to the weight of standard masses in the other, using a [[lever]] mechanism – a lever-balance. The standard masses are often referred to, non-technically, as ''"weights"''. Since any variations in gravity will act equally on the unknown and the known weights, a lever-balance will indicate the same value at any location on Earth. Therefore, balance ''"weights"'' are usually calibrated and marked in [[mass]] units, so the lever-balance measures mass by comparing the Earth's attraction on the unknown object and standard masses in the scale pans. In the absence of a gravitational field, away from planetary bodies (e.g. space), a lever-balance would not work, but on the Moon, for example, it would give the same reading as on Earth. Some balances can be marked in weight units, but since the weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object.

If the actual force of gravity on the object is needed, this can be calculated by multiplying the mass measured by the balance by the acceleration due to gravity – either standard gravity (for everyday work) or the precise local gravity (for precision work). Tables of the gravitational acceleration at different locations can be found on the web.

'''Gross weight''' is a term that is generally found in commerce or trade applications, and refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging. Conversely, '''net weight''' refers to the weight of the product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging; and '''[[tare weight]]''' is the weight of the packaging alone.

==Relative weights on the Earth and other celestial bodies==
{{Main|Earth's gravity|Surface gravity}}
The table below shows comparative [[Surface gravity|gravitational accelerations at the surface]] of the Sun, the Earth's moon, each of the planets in the solar system. The “surface” is taken to mean the cloud tops of the [[gas giants]] (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken to mean the [[photosphere]]. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the gas giants) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.
