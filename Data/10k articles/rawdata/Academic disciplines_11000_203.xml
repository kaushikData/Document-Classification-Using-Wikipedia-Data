[[File:Riziere terrasses.JPG|thumb|right|Rice cultivation has great importance for both subsistence and cash-crop farming in Madagascar.]]

Agriculture employs the majority of [[Madagascar]]'s population. Mainly involving [[smallholder]]s, agriculture has seen different levels of state organisation, shifting from state control to a [[liberalization|liberalized]] sector.

[[Rice]] is the main produce and main export crop of Madagascar. It is mainly planted in a terraced paddy system in the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central highlands]]. Other major subsistence crops include [[cassava]], [[corn]], and [[sweet potato]], while [[coffee]], [[cloves]], [[vanilla]] and other [[cash crops]] are exported.

Among livestock, [[zebu]] account for most of the cattle, while [[pigs]], [[sheep]] and [[poultry]] are also raised. Fishing is popular, and [[aquaculture]] has grown in importance.

Madagascar has seen high rates of [[deforestation]], and the illegal extraction of highly valued timber species such as [[mahogany]], [[ebony]], and [[rosewood]] threatens native stands. The traditional [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture (''tavy'') together with population growth put increasing pressure on the native and very diverse [[flora of Madagascar]].

==Seasons and geography==

Agriculture in Madagascar is heavily influenced by the island's rainfall, which is generally abundant on the whole East coast, decreases sharply on the highlands, and falls to less than 500&amp;nbsp;mm per year in the South and South-West. The main growing season starts with the first rains in October – November. The cropping calendar greatly varies from region to region, according to the very different climatic conditions, soils and altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Agriculture of Madagascar website. http://www.agriculture.gov.mg/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=160&amp;lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farming statistics==

[[File:Madagascar74.031.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Sisal planted in the row|[[Sisal]] plantation in Madagascar's south, in the 1970s]]

There are 2,4 million farms&lt;ref&gt;FAO. The state of food and agriculture 2010–11 Annex 3, Table A5. http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of which the large majority are smallholders. This sector is characterized by farms not exceeding 1,3  hectares on average, fragmented (which hampers mechanization), with a large variety of crops, extensive practices, traditional varieties, limited equipment and  infrastructures and poor water control, producing barely enough to feed their families.

Agricultural production is not constrained by lack of cultivable land. In fact, out of the 41 million hectares of agricultural land, only 3.5 million hectares are cultivated annually. The remainder of the area is under [[pastures]] (37.3 million ha)&lt;ref&gt;FAO. Statistical Yearbook 2010, Resources Table 4 Land Use. http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010-reources/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[forest]] (13 million ha).&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;Evaluation des ressources forestières mondiales 2010. Rapport national Madagascar, Rome 2010. http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al556F/al556F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Irrigation would be possible over 1.5 million hectares of which about 1.1 million are somehow irrigated, with wide areas needing [[Land rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and investments&lt;ref&gt;FAO Aquastat. http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/madagascar/indexfra.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Food crop production is the most important agriculture sub-sector accounting for around 75 percent of the cultivated area (2009).&lt;ref&gt;FAO. Statistical Yearbook 2010, Agricultural Production Tables 1 to 9. http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010/en/&lt;/ref&gt;  Rice is the staple food, covering 1.34 million hectares throughout the country – with the exception of some semi-arid areas in the South and in the South-West – under both rain-fed and irrigated systems. Other food crops include maize (mainly grown in the South and Central-East regions), [[cassava]], [[sorghum]] (in the South), [[beans]], [[Peanut|groundnut]], [[sweet potato]]es and a wide variety of vegetables. Cassava is an important component of the smallholder’s risk reduction strategy because it is drought tolerant and resistant to disease. Cassava, sweet potato and maize are the main source of calories in the lean season (from September to January). Groundnut is cultivated on sandy soils in most locations and makes an important contribution to household [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[income]]. The main [[cash crops]] are cotton, vanilla, coffee, litchi, pepper, tobacco, groundnut, sugar cane, sisal, clove and ylang-ylang.

In general, levels of production and revenue of smallholders remain low due to a combination of multiple negative factors including land tenure insecurity, weak organisation of the agricultural filières, low intensity inputs use, no mechanization, and low soil productivity due to [[land degradation]]  (especially erosion in the highlands).&lt;ref&gt;UNDP. Plan Cadre des Nations Unies pour l’Assistance au Développement UNDAF Madagascar 2008–2011, Juin 2007. http://www.snu.mg/new/sites/pnud/article.php?article_id=748&amp;lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, rice production has increased from 2.4 million tons in 1990 to 4.0 million tons in 2009 thanks to the increase of both cultivated area (15 percent) and yields (40 percent).

==Shifting cultivation==

Traditional farming methods vary from one ethnic group or location to another, according to [[population density]], [[climate]], [[water supply]]. The most intensive form of cultivation is practiced among the [[Betsileo]] and [[Merina]] groups of the central highlands, where population densities are the highest. At the other extreme are the extensive [[slash-and-burn]] methods of brush clearing and [[shifting cultivation]] in the south and the east.

In the forested areas of the eastern coast, the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] and Tanala peoples also practice irrigated rice culture where possible. The dominant form of land use, however, is shifting cultivation by the slash-and-burn method, known as tavy. The smaller trees and brush are cut down and left to dry, then burned just before the rainy season. The cleared area is usually planted with mountain rice and corn. After two or three years of cultivation, the fields are usually left fallow and are gradually covered by secondary vegetation known as savoka. After ten or twenty years, the area may be cultivated again.

Because the slash-and-burn method destroys the [[forest]] and other vegetation cover, and promotes [[erosion]], it has been declared illegal. Government assistance is offered to those cultivators who prepare rice paddies instead, and those practicing tavy are fined or, in extreme cases, imprisoned. Despite the penalties, and much to the chagrin of forestry agents, tavy continues to be practiced. Even those who cultivate wet paddies often practice tavy on the side. The [[crop cycle]] for tavy is shorter than for irrigated rice, and generations of experience have taught that it is one of the few forms of insurance against the [[drought]]s that occur about every three years. Moreover, the precipitous slopes and heavy, irregular rains make it difficult to maintain affordable and controllable irrigation systems.

A similar system of shifting cultivation is practiced in the arid, sparsely populated regions of the extreme south and southwest. The dry brush or grassland is burned off, and drought-resistant [[sorghum]] or [[maize|corn]] is sown in the ashes. In the [[Antandroy]] and some [[Mahafaly]] areas, however, the main staples of subsistence--[[cassava]], corn, [[beans]], and sorghum—are also grown around the villages in permanent fields enclosed by hedges.

Dry-season cultivation in empty [[streambed]]s is practiced largely on the western coast and in the southwest and is called ''baiboho''. The crops are sown after the last rising of the waters during the rainy seasons, and after the harvest fresh alluvial deposits naturally replenish the soil. [[Lima beans]] (also known as Cape peas) are raised by this system on the [[Mangoky River]] system delta, along with [[tobacco]] and a number of newer crops.

==Types of produce==

===Rice===
The [[Betsileo]] are probably the most efficient traditional rice farmers. They construct [[rice paddies]] on narrow terraces ascending the sides of steep valleys in the southern portion of the central highlands, creating an intricate landscape reminiscent of [[Indonesia]] or the [[Philippines]]. The irrigation systems use all available water, which flows through narrow canals for considerable distances. Some rice paddies cover no more than a few square meters. Only those surfaces that cannot be irrigated are planted in dryland crops.

{{wide image|Landscape Madagascar 08.jpg|900px|alt=Panoramic view of green, irrigated rice paddies in a floodplain between hills|Irrigated rice fields characterise much of the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central highlands]] of Madagascar.}}

In parts of the central highlands two rice crops a year can be grown, but not on the same plot. The Betsileo use a variety of local species that can be sown at different times, employing [[irrigation]] to grow some varieties in the dry season and waiting for the rainy season to plant others. The fields surrounding the typical Betsileo village often represent a checkerboard of tiny plots in different stages of the crop cycle.

The cultivation cycle begins with the repair of irrigation and drainage canals and [[plowing]], which is performed with a longhandled [[spade]] or [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]]. [[Manure]] or [[fertilizer]] is then spread over the field. If the supply of manure or artificial fertilizer is limited, only the seedbeds are fertilized. After fertilizing, family and neighbors join in a festive trampling of the fields, using [[cattle]] if available. Occasionally, trampling takes the place of plowing altogether. If the rice is to be sown broadcast, it may be done on the same day as trampling. In the more advanced areas, the seedlings are raised in protected seedbeds and transplanted later.

Rice-farming techniques among the Merina resemble those of the Betsileo but are usually less advanced and intensive. The Merina territory includes some areas where land is more plentiful, and broader areas permit less laborious means of irrigation and terracing. Although rice is still the dominant crop, more dryland species are grown than in the Betsileo region, and greater use is made of the hillsides and grasslands.

===Livestock and fishing===

[[File:Zébus de Madagascar 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zebu]]s at the market of [[Ambatolampy]]]]

[[Livestock]] is widespread, with about 60 percent of rural families depending on it for their income. Animal production is dominated by extensive livestock rearing, [[pigs]] and [[poultry]]. There is also a growing modern poultry industry around the main cities. In 2008, livestock accounted for 9.7 million of head of cattle, 2 million sheep and goats, 1.4 million pigs, and 26 million poultry. Overall, meat production was estimated at 251,000 tons; milk, 530,000 tons; and hen eggs, 19,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. Statistical Yearbook 2010, Resources Tables 9 and 19 and Agricultural Production Tables 10, 11 and 12. http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010/en/&lt;/ref&gt;  Zebus are also used for agricultural work for [[puddling (agriculture)|puddling]] rice fields as well as for [[ploughing]] and pulling carts. The high prevalence of disease is the main constraint undermining an increase of production. For example, [[Newcastle disease]] is a major ubiquitous problem for poultry, [[Anthrax]] affects cattle, and Classical and African swine fever affect pigs.&lt;ref&gt;FAO  Country Brief for Madagascar. http://www.fao.org/countries/55528/en/mdg/&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the performances of this sub-sector are poor, with the exception of some filières (milk, small animals).

Both on the highlands and on the coasts, many farmers use fishing as a complement to agriculture and livestock, but it remains characterized by the use of rudimentary tools and materials and inadequate conservation. Madagascar has enormous potential in the fisheries sector (notably along its western coast in the province of Toliara). There is also a good potential for the development of shrimps and prawns rising and for freshwater aquaculture (mainly for common carp and tilapia) in paddy fields, ponds and cages.&lt;ref&gt;FAO National Aquaculture Sector Overview Madagascar http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/naso_madagascar/en&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, captures of fishery and aquaculture production totalled 130,000 tons&lt;ref&gt;FAO. Statistical Yearbook 2010, Agricultural Production Table 14. http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010/en/&lt;/ref&gt; About 35,000 tons of fishery products are exported every year. More than 50 percent are exported toward the European countries, the rest, toward Japan, Mauritius and some Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery of Madagascar website. http://www.maep.gov.mg/eg/actuaqua.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[livestock]]-raising peoples are the Bara, Sakalava, and other groups of the south and the west, where almost every family owns some [[zebu]] cattle. The common practice is to allow the animals to graze almost at will, and the farmers take few precautions against the popular custom of cattle stealing. These farmers are also accustomed to burning off the dry grass to promote the growth of new vegetation for animal feed. The cattle generally are slaughtered only for ceremonial occasions, but these are so frequent that the per capita meat consumption among the cattle herders is very high.

[[Fishing]] is popular as a sideline by farmers who supplement their farm produce with fish from [[freshwater]] rivers, lakes, and ponds. Perhaps two-thirds of the total yearly catch is consumed for [[subsistence]]; transportation costs to the capital make the price of marketed fish prohibitively expensive to other domestic consumers. The introduction of [[tilapia]] fish from the African mainland in the 1950s increased inland [[aquaculture]]. Many families, particularly in the central highlands, have established fish ponds to raise [[carp]], black [[Bass (fish)|bass]], or [[trout]]. The breeding of fish in rice fields, however, requires sophisticated water control and a strong guard against dynamiting, poisoning, and [[poaching]], which remain chronic problems.

===Timber===
Extensive stands of  [[ebony]], [[rosewood]] and [[mahogany]] flourish on the East coast. In 2009, the [[timber]] cut was approximately {{convert|25|e6m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. Statistical Yearbook 2010, Agricultural Production Table 15. http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Wood production is from natural forests and is almost entirely consumed locally for fuel and construction. [[Bush fire]]s and [[illegal logging]] further exacerbate the loss of forest areas, which is estimated at the rate of {{convert|330000|ha}} per year.&lt;ref name="fao" /&gt;

==Policy and development==

The 1984–85 agricultural [[census]] estimated that 8.7 million people live in the rural areas and that 65 percent of the active poption within these areas lives at the subsistence level. The census also noted that average farm size was 1.2 hectares, although irrigated rice plots in the central highlands were often 0.5 hectares. Only 5.2 percent (3 million hectares) of the country's total land area of 58.2 million hectares is under [[Tillage|cultivation]]; of this hectarage, less than 2 million hectares are permanently cultivated. Agriculture is critical to Madagascar's economy in that it provides nearly 80 percent of [[export]]s, constituting 33 percent of [[GDP]] in 1993, and in 1992 employed almost 80 percent of the [[labor force]]. Moreover, 50.7 percent (300,000 square kilometers) of the total landmass of 592,000 square kilometers supports livestock rearing, while 16 percent (484,000 hectares) of land under cultivation is irrigated.

===State control of production===

The government significantly reorganized the agricultural sector of the economy beginning in 1972. Shortly after [[Ratsiraka]] assumed power, the government announced that holdings in excess of 500 hectares would be turned over to landless families, and in 1975 it reported that 500,000 hectares of land had been processed under the program. The long-range strategy of the Ratsiraka regime was to create collective forms of farm management, but not necessarily of ownership. By the year 2000, some 72 percent of agricultural output was to come from farm cooperatives, 17 percent from state farms, and only 10 percent from privately managed farms. Toward this end, the Ministry of Agricultural Production coordinated with more than seventy parastatal agencies in the areas of land development, agricultural extension, research, and marketing activities. However, these socialist-inspired rural development policies, which led to a severe decline in per capita agricultural output during the 1970s, were at the center of the liberalization policies of the 1980s and the structural adjustment demands of the IMF and the [[World Bank]].

The evolution of [[rice]] production—the main staple food and the dominant crop—offers insight into some problems associated with agricultural production that were compounded by the Ratsiraka years. Rice production grew by less than 1 percent per year during the 1970–79 period, despite the expansion of the cultivated paddy area by more than 3 percent per year. Moreover, the share of rice available for marketing in the rapidly growing urban areas declined from 16 or 17 percent of the total crop in the early 1970s to about 11 or 12 percent during the latter part of the decade. As a result, Madagascar became a net [[import]]er of rice beginning in 1972, and by 1982 was importing nearly 200,000 tons per year—about 10 percent of the total domestic crop and about equal to the demand from urban customers.

The inefficient system of [[agricultural supply store|agricultural supply]] and [[marketing]], which since 1972 increasingly had been placed under direct state control, was a major factor inhibiting more efficient and expanded rice production. From 1973 to 1977, one major parastatal agency, the Association for the National Interest in Agricultural Products (Société d'Intérêt National des Produits Agricoles-- SINPA), had a [[monopoly]] in collecting, importing, processing, and distributing a number of commodities, most notably rice. [[Political corruption|Corruption]] leading to shortages of rice in a number of areas caused a scandal in 1977, and the government was forced to take over direct responsibility for rice marketing. In 1982 SINPA maintained a large share in the distribution system for agricultural commodities; it subcontracted many smaller parastatal agencies to handle distribution in certain areas. The decreasing commercialization of rice and other commodities continued, however, suggesting that transportation bottlenecks and producer prices were undermining official distribution channels.

===Liberalization===

To promote domestic production and reduce foreign [[imports]] of rice, the Ratsiraka regime enacted a series of structural adjustment reforms during the 1980s. These included the removal of government subsidies on the consumer purchase price of rice in 1984 and the disbanding of the state marketing monopoly controlled by SINPA in 1985. Rice growers responded by moderately expanding production by 9.3 percent during the latter half of the 1980s from 2.18 million tons in 1985 to 2.38 million tons in 1989, and rice imports declined dramatically by 70 percent between 1985 and 1989. However, the Ratsiraka regime failed to restore self-sufficiency in rice production (estimated at between 2.8 million to 3.0 million tons), and rice imports rose again in 1990. In 1992 rice production occupied about two-thirds of the cultivated area and produced 40 percent of total agricultural income, including [[fishing]], which was next with 19 percent, livestock raising, and [[forestry]].

In February 1994, [[Cyclone Geralda]] hit Madagascar just as the rice harvesting was to start and had a serious impact on the self-sufficiency goal. In addition, the southern tip of Madagascar suffered from severe [[drought]] in late 1993, resulting in emergency assistance to 1 million people from the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[World Food Program]] (WFP). This WFP aid was later transformed into a food-for-work program to encourage development.

Other food crops have witnessed small increases in production from 1985 to 1992. [[Cassava]], the second major food crop in terms of area planted (almost everywhere on the island) and probably in quantity consumed, increased in production from 2.14 million tons in 1985 to 2.32 million tons in 1992. During this same period, [[maize|corn]] production increased from 140,000 tons to 165,000 tons, [[sweet potato]] production increased from 450,000 tons to 487,000 tons, and [[banana]]s dropped slightly from 255,000 tons to 220,000 tons.

===Export crops===

[[File:Woman sorting vanilla in Sambava Madagascar.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A Malagasy woman sorts vanilla pods heaped on a wooden table outdoors |[[Vanilla]] is one of Madagascar's main export crops.]]

Several export crops are also important to Madagascar's economy. [[Coffee]] prices witnessed a boom during the 1980s, making coffee the leading export crop of the decade; in 1986 coffee earned a record profit of US$151 million. Prices within the coffee market gradually declined during the remainder of the 1980s, and earnings reached a low of US$28 million in 1991 although they rebounded to US$58 million in 1992. [[Cotton]] traditionally has been the second major export crop, but most output during the early 1980s was absorbed by the local [[textile]] industry. Although cotton output rose from 27,000 tons in 1987 to 46,000 tons in 1988, once again raising the possibility of significant export earnings, the combination of drought and a faltering agricultural extension service in the southwest contributed to a gradual decline in output to only 20,000 tons in 1992.

Two other export crops--[[cloves]] and [[vanilla]]--have also declined in importance from the 1980s to the 1990s. [[Indonesia]], the primary importer of Malagasy cloves, temporarily halted purchases in 1983 as a result of sufficient domestic production, and left Madagascar with a huge surplus. A collapse in international prices for cloves in 1987, compounded by uncertain future markets and the normal cyclical nature of the crop, has led to a gradual decline in production from a high of 14,600 tons in 1991 to 7,500 tons in 1993. Similarly, the still state-regulated vanilla industry (state-regulated prices for coffee and cloves were abolished in 1988–89) found itself under considerable financial pressure after 1987 because Indonesia reentered the international market as a major producer and synthetic competitors emerged in the two major markets of the [[United States]] and [[France]]. As a result, vanilla production has declined from a high of 1,500 tons in 1988 and 1989 to only 700 tons in 1993.

===Fisheries and livestock===

[[File:Fish drying in the sun poisson seche Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rows of fish hang from string, drying in the sun|Fish being dried in the sun.]]

The fisheries sector, especially the export of [[shrimp]], is the most rapidly growing area of the agricultural economy. This production is making up for lost revenues and potential structural decline within the ailing coffee, vanilla, and clove trade. Since 1988 total fish production has expanded nearly 23 percent from 92,966 tons to 114,370 tons in 1993. The export of shrimp constituted an extremely important portion of this production, providing export earnings of US$48 million in 1993. It is estimated by Aqualma, the major multinational corporation in the shrimp industry, that expansion into roughly 35,000 hectares of swampland on the country's west coast may allow for the expansion of production from the current 6,500 tons and US$40 million in revenues to nearly 75,000 tons and US$400 million in revenues by the end of the 1990s. The prospects are also good for promoting greater levels of fish cultivation in the rice paddies, and exports of other fish products, most notably [[crab]], [[tuna]], and [[lobster]], have been rising.

[[Livestock]] production is limited in part because of traditional patterns of livestock ownership that have hampered commercialization. [[Beef]] exports in the early 1990s decreased because of poor government marketing practices, rundown slaughtering facilities, and inadequate veterinary services. Approximately 99 percent of cattle are zebu cattle. In 1990 the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN estimated that Madagascar had 10.3 million cattle, 1.7 million [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s, and some 21 million [[chicken]]s.

==Environmental impact==

[[File:Manantenina bushfire.jpg|thumb|left|Slash-and-burn in the region west of [[Manantenina]].]]

Most of the historical farming in [[Madagascar]] has been conducted by indigenous peoples. The French [[Colonialism|colonial]] period disturbed a very small percentage of land area, and even included some useful experiments in [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable]] [[forestry]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems have been practised by the inhabitants of Madagascar for centuries. As of 2006 some of the major agricultural products from slash-and-burn methods are [[wood]], [[charcoal]] and [[grass]] for [[Zebu]] grazing. These practises have taken perhaps the greatest toll on land fertility since the end of French rule, mainly due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

The [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] have been preserved generally better than the eastern rainforests or the high central plateau, presumably due to historically less [[Human overpopulation|population density]] and [[water crisis|scarcity of water]]; moreover, the present day lack of road access further limits human access. There has been some slash-and-burn activity in the western dry forests, reducing forest cover and the [[soil]] [[nutrient]] content. Slash-and-burn is a method sometimes used by shifting cultivators to create short term yields from marginal soils. When practiced repeatedly, or without intervening fallow periods, the nutrient poor soils may be exhausted or eroded to an unproductive state. Further protection of Madagascar's forests would assist in preservation of these diverse ecosystems, which have a very high ratio of endemic organisms to total species.
A switch to slash-and-char would considerably advance preservation, while the ensuing [[biochar]] would also greatly benefit the soil if returned to it while mixed with compostable [[biomass]] such as crop residues. This would lead to the creation of [[terra preta]], a soil among the richest on the planet and the only one known to regenerate itself (although how this happens exactly is still a mystery). The nascent [[emissions trading|carbon trading market]] may further bring direct economical benefits for the operators, since charcoal is a prime sequester of carbon and burying it spread in small pieces, as terra preta requires, is a most efficient guarantee that it will remain harmless for many thousands of years.

'''The Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC)''' is an American national membership organization of approximately 70 major [[Academic health science centre|academic medical centers]] and health systems committed to quality [[patient care]], [[medical education]] and [[research]].  AIAMC members regard medical education and research as strategic assets in providing [[patient-centered care]]; operate independently of [[medical school]] ownership or governance while maintaining major medical school affiliations; care for a patient population that mirrors their local communities; and provide teaching and research that is innovative, applicable to practice and community responsive.

==History ==
The AIAMC was formed in 1989 to provide a forum for those institutions whose governance and academic leadership were distinct from that of their associated medical schools.  Since that time, the organization’s prestige and influence have grown progressively.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Meetings. [http://meetingsnet.com/medicalmeetings/news/3-ways-aiamc-changed-up-its-annual-conference-0419/.] "3 Ways AIAMC Changed Up Its Annual Conference."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered a national resource, with Alliance members participating in leadership and governance roles in key groups as the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]], [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|ACCME]], [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], [[American Hospital Association|AHA]], [[American Medical Association|AMA]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/history.php AIAMC History.] "AIAMC."&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Initiative to Improve Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education ==
===National Initiative I===
In early 2007, the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC) launched Improving Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education: A National Initiative of Independent Academic Medical Centers. Nineteen AIAMC-member institutions participated in this charter effort. The National Initiative (NI) featured five meetings over the course of 18 months which served as touchstones for ongoing quality improvement in AIAMC participating organizations. These meetings, as well as the monthly collaborative calls held in-between, provided structure, discussion and networking opportunities around specific quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;ACGME. [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928070626/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} ''ACGME Bulletin.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This 18-month "NI-I" was supported by a grant from the foundation of [[HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education]], an AIAMC member institution located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/ni-overview.php National Initiative Overview.] ''AIAMC.''&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Carl Patow, MD, Executive Director of HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education. 

As a result of these efforts, AIAMC has initial findings that demonstrate the efficacy of integrating GME into patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. These findings have been organized into a series of articles that were published in the December 2009 issue of Academic Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1749–56 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf686f |title=Integrating Quality Improvement and Residency Education: Insights from the AIAMC National Initiative About the Roles of the Designated Institutional Official and Program Director |year=2009 |last1=Jenson |first1=Hal B. |last2=Dorner |first2=Douglas |last3=Hinchey |first3=Kevin |last4=Ankel |first4=Felix |last5=Goldman |first5=Stuart |last6=Patow |first6=Carl |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=19940584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative II===
In 2009, AIAMC launched the second National Initiative and expanded participation to 35 AIAMC-member teaching hospitals from Seattle to Maine.  Each participating hospital developed a quality improvement team led by a resident or faculty member, and included their respective quality improvement leader. These teams met four times and participated in monthly conference calls over an 18-month period. Quality improvement projects focused on the following areas: Communication, Hand Offs, Infection Control, Readmissions and Transitions of Care. The objectives of this second phase were: 
* to align and integrate academic programs with quality initiatives to accelerate the efforts of quality and patient safety;
* assist residency program directors and house staff in the teaching, learning and assessment of the core competencies focused on Practice-Based Learning and Systems Based Practice;
* inform hospital and policy leaders about the contributions that can be made by faculty and house staff in expediting patient safety; and
* integrate house staff into multidisciplinary team-based safety initiatives as a national priority.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Harris. [https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb11/174758/residents_quality_improvement.html] "Residents Help Drive Quality Improvement". 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative III===
National Initiative III launched in the fall of 2011, and will directly address the ACGME Common Program Requirements for Professionalism, Personal Responsibility and Patient Safety by educating program directors, faculty members and residents in a train-the-trainer approach. The structure and content of NI III will also meet directives for Teamwork by providing training in effective communication as part of inter-professional teams. The structure of the National Initiative III will resemble the previous two initiatives, with quarterly meetings for quality improvement didactics and leadership training, conference calls to assess progress, and local hospital team initiatives to improve patient care.

===National Initiative IV===
The fourth National Initiative recognized the importance of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education initiative entitled the "Clinical Learning Environment Review".  Teams from over 35 teaching hospitals across the United States participated in a two year learning collaborative to improve performance in six focus areas: patient safety, quality imrpvoement, transitions of care, supervision, fatigue management and professionalism. 

===National Initiative V===
National Initiative V began in 2015, and focused on the role of teaching hospitals' response to health care disparities. Findings from the National Initiatives are published in the Oschner Journal.

'''Artificial muscle''' is a generic term used for actuators, materials or devices that mimic natural [[muscle]] and can reversibly contract, expand, or rotate within one component due to an external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure or temperature).&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=M.A.Sc |first=Seyed M. |last=Mirvakili |title=Niobium Nanowire Yarns and Their Application as Artificial Muscle |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |date=2013 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/2429/44257|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three basic actuation responses – contraction, expansion, and rotation – can be combined together within a single component to produce other types of motions (e.g. bending, by contracting one side of the material while expanding the other side). Conventional motors and [[pneumatic]] linear or rotary actuators do not qualify as artificial muscles, because there is more than one component involved in the actuation.

Due to their high flexibility, versatility and power-to-weight ratio compared with traditional rigid actuators, artificial muscles have the potential to be a highly disruptive [[emerging technology]]. Though currently in limited use, the technology may have wide future applications in industry, medicine, robotics and many other fields.&lt;ref name=MuscleApps/&gt;&lt;ref name=Apps2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2018"&gt;{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with natural muscles==
While there is no general theory that allows for actuators to be compared, there are "power criteria" for artificial muscle technologies that allow for specification of new actuator technologies in comparison with natural muscular properties. In summary, the criteria include [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], [[strain rate]], cycle life, and [[elastic modulus]]. Some authors have considered other criteria (Huber et al., 1997), such as actuator density and strain resolution.&lt;ref name="Tondu2007"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Artificial Muscles for Humanoid Robots, Humanoid Robots, Human-like Machines |chapter-url=http://www.intechopen.com/download/pdf/163 |first=Bertrand |last=Tondu |pages=89–122 |title=Humanoid Robots: Human-like Machines |editor-first=Matthias |editor-last=Hackel |publisher=InTech |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-902613-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the most powerful artificial muscle fibers in existence can offer a hundredfold increase in power over equivalent lengths of natural muscle fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/scientists-just-created-some-of-the-most-powerful-muscl-1526957560|title=Scientists just created some of the most powerful muscles in existence|publisher=[[io9]]|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers measure the speed, [[energy density]], power, and efficiency of artificial muscles; no one type of artificial muscle is the best in all areas.&lt;ref name="Herkewitz"/&gt;

==Types==
Artificial muscles can be divided into three major groups based on their actuation mechanism.&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"/&gt;

===Electric field actuation===
{{main|Electroactive polymers}}
Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are polymers that can be actuated through the application of electric fields. Currently, the most prominent EAPs include piezoelectric polymers, dielectric actuators (DEAs), electrostrictive graft [[elastomers]], [[liquid crystal]] elastomers (LCE) and ferroelectric polymers. While these EAPs can be made to bend, their low capacities for torque motion currently limit their usefulness as artificial muscles. Moreover, without an accepted standard material for creating EAP devices, commercialization has remained impractical. However, significant progress has been made in EAP technology since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Yoseph|title=Electroactive Polymers (EAPs)|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ion-based actuation====
Ionic EAPs are polymers that can be actuated through the diffusion of ions in an electrolyte solution (in addition to the application of electric fields). Current examples of ionic electroactive polymers include polyelectrode gels, ionomeric polymer metallic composites (IPMC), conductive polymers and electrorheological fluids (ERF). In 2011, it was demonstrated that twisted [[carbon nanotube]]s could also be actuated by applying an electric field.&lt;ref name="Foroughi2011"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author= Foroughi, J.| title= Torsional Carbon Nanotube Artificial Muscles
 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]
 | date=2011 | volume=334 | issue= 6055 | pages= 494–497
 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211220
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric power actuation===
Twisted and coiled [[polymer]] (TCP) muscles also known as supercoiled polymer (SCP) are coiled polymer that can be actuated by [[electric power]] &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarzadeh |first1=Mohsen |last2=Gans |first2=Nicholas |last3=Tadesse |first3=Yonas |title=Control of TCP muscles using Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system |journal=Mechatronics |date=August 2018 |volume=53 |page= |pages=124–139 |doi=10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.06.007 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415818300965}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A TCP muscle look like a [[Helix|helical]] [[Spring (device)|spring]]. TCP muscles are usually made from [[silver]] coated [[Nylon]]. TCP muscle can also made from other [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical conductance]] coat such as gold. TCP muscles should be under a load to keep the muscle extended. The electrical energy transforms to thermal energy due to electrical resistance, which also known as [[Joule heating]], Ohmic heating, and resistive heating. As the temperature of the TCP muscle increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the muscle contraction. &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;.

===Pneumatic actuation===
{{main|Pneumatic artificial muscles}}
Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) operate by filling a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas pressure to the bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. PAMs can be classified by their operation and design; namely, PAMs feature pneumatic or hydraulic operation, overpressure or underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes. Among the most commonly used PAMs today is a cylindrically braided muscle known as the McKibben Muscle, which was first developed by J. L. McKibben in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brl.ee.washington.edu/BRL_Pubs/Pdfs/Th024.pdf|title=Artificial Muscles: Actuators for Biorobotic Systems|date=1999|publisher=University of Washington|format=PDF|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal actuation===

====Fishing line====
Artificial muscles constructed from ordinary [[fishing line]] and sewing thread can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times more power than a human muscle of the same length and weight.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/fishing-line-thread-artificial-muscles/30960 |title=Powerful artificial muscles made from ... fishing line? |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=26 February 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial muscles based on fishing line already cost orders of magnitude less (per pound) than shape-memory alloy or carbon nanotube yarn; but currently have relatively poor efficiency.&lt;ref name="Herkewitz"&gt;
William Herkewitz.
[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a3088/synthetic-muscle-made-of-fishing-line-is-100-times-stronger-than-the-real-thing-16514805/ "Synthetic Muscle Made of Fishing Line is 100 Times Stronger Than the Real Thing"].
2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual [[macromolecule]]s are aligned with the fiber in commercially available [[polymer]] fibers. By winding them into coils, researchers make artificial muscles that contract at speeds similar to human muscles.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;
Dani Cooper.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A (untwisted) polymer fiber, such as polyethelene fishing line or nylon sewing thread, unlike most materials, shortens when heated—up to about 4% for a 250 K increase in temperature. By twisting the fiber and winding the twisted fiber into a coil,
heating causes the coil to tighten up and shorten by up to 49%. Researchers found another way to wind the coil such that heating causes the coil to lengthen by 69%.&lt;ref&gt;
Tim Wogan.

&lt;/ref&gt;

One application of thermally-activated artificial muscles is to automatically open and close windows, responding to temperature without using any power.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

Tiny artificial muscles composed of twisted [[carbon nanotube]]s filled with [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] are 200 times stronger than human muscle.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shape-memory alloys====
{{main|Shape-memory alloy}}
Shape-memory alloys (SMAs), liquid crystalline elastomers, and metallic alloys that can be deformed and then returned to their original shape when exposed to heat, can function as artificial muscles. Thermal actuator-based artificial muscles offer heat resistance, impact resistance, low density, high fatigue strength, and large force generation during shape changes. In 2012, a new class of electric field-activated, [[electrolyte]]-free artificial muscles called "twisted yarn actuators" were demonstrated, based on the thermal expansion of a secondary material within the muscle's conductive twisted structure.&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lima2012"&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226762
|display-authors=etal | pmid=23161994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been demonstrated that a coiled [[vanadium dioxide]] ribbon can twist and untwist at a peak torsional speed of 200,000 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/vanadium-dioxide-micromuscle/30217/ |title=Scientists demonstrate a robotic muscle 1,000 times more powerful than a human's |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=23 December 2013 |accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control systems==
{{main|Control theory}}
The three types of artificial muscles have different constraints that affect the type of control system they require for actuation. It is important to note, however, that control systems are often designed to meet the specifications of a given experiment, with some experiments calling for the combined use of a variety of different actuators or a hybrid control schema. As such, the following examples should not be treated as an exhaustive list of the variety of control systems that may be employed to actuate a given artificial muscle.

===Voltage control===
The twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) muscles can be modeled by [[first-order]] [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant]] [[State-space representation|state spaces]] when input is electrical voltage, with accuracy more than 85%. Therefore, A TCP muscles can be easily controlled by a digital [[PID controller]]&lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;. A fuzzy controller can be used to speed up the PID controller &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;.

===EAP control===
EAPs offer lower weight, faster response, higher power density and quieter operation when compared to traditional actuators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavroidis|first=Constantinos|title=Nonlinear Force Control of Dielectric Electroactive Polymer Actuators|url=http://www.coe.neu.edu/Research/robots/papers/SPIE2010_2.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both electric and ionic EAPs are primarily actuated using feedback control loops, better known as closed-loop control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Baohua Qi ; Wen Lu and Benjamin R. Mattes

===Pneumatic control===
Currently there are two types of pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). The first type has a single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve and the second type has a double bladder.

====Single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve====
Pneumatic artificial muscles, while lightweight and inexpensive, pose a particularly difficult control problem as they are both highly nonlinear and have properties, such as temperature, that fluctuate significantly over time. PAMs generally consist of rubber and plastic components. As these parts come into contact with each other during actuation, the PAM's temperature increases, ultimately leading to permanent changes in the structure of the artificial muscle over time. This problem has led to a variety of experimental approaches. In summary (provided by Ahn et al.), viable experimental control systems include PID control, adaptive control (Lilly, 2003), nonlinear optimal predictive control (Reynolds et al., 2003), variable structure control (Repperger et al., 1998; Medrano-Cerda et al.,1995), gain scheduling (Repperger et al.,1999), and various soft computing approaches including neural network Kohonen training algorithm control (Hesselroth et al.,1994), neural network/nonlinear PID control (Ahn and Thanh, 2005), and neuro-fuzzy/genetic control (Chan et al., 2003; Lilly et al., 2003).

Control problems regarding highly nonlinear systems have generally been addressed through a trial-and-error approach through which "fuzzy models" (Chan et al., 2003) of the system's behavioral capacities could be teased out (from the experimental results of the specific system being tested) by a knowledgeable human expert. However, some research has employed "real data" (Nelles O., 2000) to train up the accuracy of a given fuzzy model while simultaneously avoiding the mathematical complexities of previous models. Ahn et al.'s experiment is simply one example of recent experiments that use modified genetic algorithms (MGAs) to train up fuzzy models using experimental input-output data from a PAM robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahn|first=Kyoung|title=Hybrid Control of a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) Robot Arm Using an Inverse NARX Fuzzy Model|url=http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~hphanh/paper8.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double bladder====
This actuator consists of an external membrane with an internal flexible membrane dividing the interior of the muscle into two portions. A tendon is secured to the membrane, and exits the muscle through a sleeve so that the tendon can contract into the muscle. A tube allows air into the internal bladder, which then rolls out into the external bladder. A key advantage of this type of pneumatic muscle is that there is no potentially frictive movement of the bladder against an outer sleeve.

===Thermal control===
SMA artificial muscles, while lightweight and useful in applications that require large force and displacement, also present specific control challenges; namely, SMA artificial muscles are limited by their hysteretic input-output relationships and bandwidth limitations. As Wen et al. discuss, the SMA phase transformation phenomenon is "hysteretic" in that the resulting output SMA strand is dependent on the history of its heat input. As for bandwidth limitations, the dynamic response of an SMA actuator during hysteretic phase transformations is very slow due to the amount of time required for the heat to transfer to the SMA artificial muscle. Very little research has been conducted regarding SMA control due to assumptions that regard SMA applications as static devices; nevertheless, a variety of control approaches have been tested to address the control problem of hysteretic nonlinearity.

Generally, this problem has required the application of either open-loop compensation or closed-loop feedback control. Regarding [[open-loop control]], the [[Preisach model]] has often been used for its simple structure and ability for easy simulation and control (Hughes and Wen, 1995). As for [[closed-loop control]], a passivity-based approach analyzing SMA closed loop stability has been used (Madill and Wen, 1994). Wen et al.'s study provides another example of closed-loop feedback control, demonstrating the stability of closed-loop control in SMA applications through applying a combination of force feedback control and position control on a flexible aluminum beam actuated by an SMA made from [[Nitinol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wen|first=John|title=Feedback Control Using Shape Memory Alloy Actuators|url=http://cats-fs.rpi.edu/~wenj/papers/sma_98.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Artificial muscle technologies have wide potential applications in [[biomimetic]] machines, including robots, industrial actuators and [[powered exoskeleton]]s. EAP-based artificial muscles offer a combination of light weight, low power requirements, resilience and agility for locomotion and manipulation.&lt;ref name=MuscleApps&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ebooks.spiedigitallibrary.org/mobile/content.aspx?bookid=146&amp;sectionid=31570721|title=Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Actuators as Artificial Muscles: Reality, Potential, and Challenges (Second Edition)|chapter=EAP Applications, Potential, and Challenges|editor=Bar-Cohen, Yoseph|date=2004|publisher=SPIE Digital Library|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future EAP devices will have applications in aerospace, automotive industry, medicine, robotics, articulation mechanisms, entertainment, animation, toys, clothing, haptic and tactile interfaces, noise control, transducers, power generators, and smart structures.&lt;ref name=Apps2&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Yoseph|title=Electroactive Polymers (EAP's)|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pneumatic artificial muscles also offer greater flexibility, controllability and lightness compared to conventional pneumatic cylinders.&lt;ref name="PAM-Daerden-Lefeber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucy.vub.ac.be/publications/Daerden_Lefeber_EJMEE.pdf|title=Pneumatic Artificial Muscles: actuators for robotics and automation|format=PDF|author=Frank Daerden|author2=Dirk Lefeber|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], Department of Mechanical Engineering|date=2002|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most PAM applications involve the utilization of McKibben-like muscles.&lt;ref name="PAM-Daerden-Lefeber"/&gt; Thermal actuators such as SMAs have various military, medical, safety, and robotic applications, and could furthermore be used to generate energy through mechanical shape changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Richard|title=Shape Memory Alloys|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~richlin1/sma/sma.html|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

==Mathematics==

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), Section 5.5 More about biological significance of chirality&lt;/ref&gt; due to different biochemical interactions at human nose.

Also, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanganyado|first=Edmond|last2=Lu|first2=Zhijiang|last3=Fu|first3=Qiuguo|last4=Schlenk|first4=Daniel|last5=Gan|first5=Jay|date=2017|title=Chiral pharmaceuticals: A review on their environmental occurrence and fate processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0043135417306565|journal=Water Research|volume=124|pages=527–542|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.003|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvon ([[Dextropropoxyphene]]) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad ([[Levopropoxyphene]]) is an anti-cough agent.

[[File:DirkvdM natural spiral.jpg|thumb|A natural left-handed helix, made by a certain climber plant's [[tendril]]. |171x171px]]
Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

The '''coding region''' of a [[gene]], also known as the '''CDS''' (from ''coding sequence''), is that portion of a gene's [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that codes for protein. The region usually begins at the [[directionality (molecular biology)#5′-end|5' end]] by a [[start codon]] and ends at the [[directionality (molecular biology)#3′-end|3' end]] with a [[stop codon]].

== Structure ==
The coding region in a [[mRNA]] is flanked by the [[five prime untranslated region]] (5'-UTR) and the [[three prime untranslated region]] (3'-UTR). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020755.html|title=Gene Structure|last=Twyman|first=Richard|date=1 August 2003|publisher=The Wellcome Trust|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328214808/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020755.html|archivedate=28 March 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 April 2003|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The CDS is that portion of an mRNA transcript that is translated by a [[ribosome]]. CDS is a keyword (feature-key) used to denote the 'protein-coding sequence' in a gene [http://www.insdc.org/files/feature_table.html feature table] by the major sequence databases [[INSDC]]. They also read CDS as both coding sequence and [https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tag/cds/ coding region].

== Difference with cDNA ==
A [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] sequence is derived from the transcript by reverse transcription, but in this case it also contains the 5' and 3' [[Untranslated region|UTR]]s, which are not part of the CDS (they are transcribed, but not translated). A CDS will ''almost'' always start with an [[Start codon|AUG initiation codon]] in [[eukaryotes]] and stop at one of the three [[stop codon]]s (UAA, UGA, UAG).

== Coding sequence annotation ==
While identification of [[open reading frames]] within a DNA sequence is straightforward, identifying coding sequences is not, because the cell translates only a subset of all open reading frames to proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently CDS prediction uses sampling and sequencing of mRNA from cells, although there is still the problem of determining which parts of a given mRNA are actually translated to protein.  CDS prediction is a subset of [[gene prediction]], the latter also including prediction of DNA sequences that code not only for protein but also for other functional elements such as RNA genes and regulatory sequences.

In [[zoology]], '''copulation''' is [[animal sexual behavior]] in which a male introduces [[sperm]] into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{Cite book| author =Michael Kent|title = Advanced biology| isbn = 0199141959| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2000 |pages =250–253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aw4ZWLABQkC&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copulation1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Copulation|publisher=''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers]]'', 2007/[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] for various dictionary definitions|accessdate=September 6, 2012|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an aspect of [[mating]]. Many animals that live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation, known as cloacal kiss (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate [[vagina]]lly, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book| author =Cecie Starr| author2 =Christine Evers| author3 =Lisa Starr|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Biology: A Human Emphasis|publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2010 | pages = 630–631| accessdate = December 9, 2010 |isbn =1133170056| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denecke"&gt;{{cite book| author =Edward J.

In non-primate mammals ([[rodent]]s, [[canidae|canines]], [[felidae|felines]], [[bovine]]s, and [[equine]]s), the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation.&lt;ref name="Knobil"&gt;Knobil E., Neill J.D.

==In spiders and insects==
[[Spider]]s are often confused with [[insect]]s, but they are not insects; instead, they are [[arachnid]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna M.

Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large [[pedipalp]]s, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can [[female sperm storage|store sperm indefinitely]].&lt;ref name="RFB2004Spiders"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E. | author2=Fox, R.S. | author3=Barnes, R.D. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571–584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For primitive insects, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book| author =M.

Particularly in the female, copulation is controlled by several innate neurobiological processes, including the motor sexual reflex of [[lordosis behaviour|lordosis]]&lt;ref name="pfaff1994"/&gt; (see diagram below).

[[File:Simplified diagram of the neurobiological circuits of the lordosis sexual reflex.png|thumb|700px|left|Simplified diagram of the neurobiological circuits of the lordosis reflex, specific to female mammals, and indispensable to the realization of copulation.

NB: The neural circuit is bilateral. The diagram is simplified for greater clarity.]] {{clear}}

By simplifying, the female can not have any other sexual activity than [[lordosis behaviour|lordosis]].

In the male, the realization of copulation is more complex, because some learning is necessary. Nevertheless, the innate processes (retrocontrol of penis intromission in the vagina, rhythmic movement of the pelvis, detection of female pheromones ...) are specific to copulation. These innate processes direct learning to heterosexual copulation.&lt;ref name="meisel"&gt;MEISEL Robert L. , SACHS Benjamin D. : The physiology of male sexual behavior. in KNOBIL Ernest, NEILL Jimmy D. The physiology of reproduction, Raven Press, 2nd edition, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, through the coordination of [[hormone]]s, [[pheromone]]s and sexual reflexes, there is a true reproductive behavior in non-primate mammals.

=== Evolution of copulation control in hominids ===
[[File:Evolution of the biological factors of sexual behavior.png|thumb|600px|left|Evolution of the main neurobiological factors that control the sexual behavior of mammals.&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;]] {{clear}}

In the case of mammals with a highly developed [[brain]] ([[chimpanzee]], [[bonobo]], [[Orangutan]]s, and [[dolphin]]s), the cerebral structure has evolved. As a result of these evolved differences, the human intercourse depends on another type of neurobiological control:&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;
* Female [[lordosis behaviour]] became secondary in [[hominidae]] and is apparently non-functional in humans.&lt;ref name="Dixson2012"/&gt; Sexual stimuli no longer trigger immobilization or reflex arching of the back. If a woman gets onto all fours, curves her back and remains still, it is no longer a reflex movement triggered by sexual stimuli, but a voluntary movement.&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;
* [[Pheromone]]s become secondary. 90% of [[sex pheromone]] receptor genes become pseudogens,&lt;ref name="nei2008"&gt;Nei M., Niimura Y., Nozawa M. (2008) [http://www.niimura.sakura.ne.jp/papers/Nei_et_al_2008.pdf The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity]. ''Nat. Rev. Genet.'', 9(12):951-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the vomeronasal organ is altered.&lt;ref name="Zhang2003"&gt;Zhang J., Webb D.M.

* The sexual activities are gradually dissociated from the hormonal cycles,&lt;ref name="Dixson2012"&gt;Dixson A.F. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9N_BokMAMkC Primate sexuality: Comparative studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings].

* Sexual learning, induced by sexual rewards and the [[reward system]], become a major factor in hominids.&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="georgiadis2012"&gt;Georgiadis J.R., Kringelbach M.L., Pfaus J.G.

* The major development of the cortex in hominids leads to the gradual emergence of complex cognitive abilities, which have enabled the human species to develop culture.&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga2002"&gt;Gazzaniga M.S., Ivry R.B., Mangun G.R. Cognitive neuroscience. The biology of the mind. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2e edition, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the functional dynamics of the copulation behavior has been modified in hominids: the reproductive behavior becomes an erotic behavior.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"&gt;Wunsch S. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312407857_Phylogenesis_of_mammal_sexuality_Analysis_of_the_evolution_of_proximal_factors Phylogenesis of mammal sexuality.

Sexologies 26(1):e1-e10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal coitus is still practiced in humans, but it is no longer a reflex motor activity, guided by pheromones and controlled by hormones. It is rather an erotic activity, among others, carried out voluntarily to obtain [[reward system|cerebral reward]] (sexual pleasure &lt;ref name="georgiadis2012"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;

'''Cultural relativism''' is the view that [[culture]]s are merely different, not deficient, and each culture’s norms and practices should be assessed only from the perspective of the culture itself, not by standards embraced by another culture.  It is the idea that one cannot make judgments about a culture just because they are not a part of [[one's own]].  Outsiders should be able to see the cultural from a neutral perspective and not judge the culture before understanding it.  Each culture should be viewed with [[respect]] and as an equal because no one culture is better than any other. They should be allowed to practice their own '''beliefs''', what a cultures believes to be true, and '''values''', a shared view about what is right.  Cultural relativism emphasizes that '''[[ethnocentrism]]''', which is the belief that one’s culture is superior to everyone else’s, should not be forced upon cultures, and cultures should remain unprejudiced toward each other.  Cultural relativism is the moral and ethical way to look at different cultures.

==Overview==
'''Intracultural miscommunication''' draws on the fact that all humans subconsciously reflect their cultural backgrounds in day to day [[communication]].  Culture does not just lie in the way one eats or dresses, but in the manner in which [[people]] present themselves as an entity to the outside world.  [[Language]] is a huge proponent of communication, as well as a large representation of one's cultural background.  '''Cultural [[miscommunication]]''' often stems from different and conflicting styles of speech and messages.  A perfectly normal intonation pattern for a native German speaker may seem angry and aggressive to a foreign listener.  Connotations of words, as well as meanings of [[slang]] phrases[[,]] vary greatly across cultural lines, and a lack of tolerance and understanding of this fact often results in misinterpretations.

[[Non-verbal communication]] greatly varies across cultural lines.  One must take the time to study different cultures so as to fully understand messages being transmitted.  There are many aspects of non-verbal communication, such as [[gesture]], [[facial expression]] and [[inter-personal]] space, that affect the way a message is construed.

'''High- and low-power distance:''' 
'''[[Power distance]]''' is the degree of equality, or inequality, between people in a particular society. The lower the power distance of a country, the more dominant individuality and individual rights are. When power distance is low, society does not emphasize people’s status, power, or wealth. In other words, individualistic cultures have low power distance and collectivist cultures have high power distance. Examples of countries with high power distance include [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], and [[Romania]] while countries with low power distance include [[Austria]], [[Israel]], and [[Denmark]].

'''Individualism–collectivism (the Me–We dimension):'''The '''[[individualism]]-[[collectivism]] dimension''' is thought to be the most important of all value dimensions that distinguish cultures.
The '''individualist culture''' has a “me” consciousness.  Individuals are loosely linked to each other, but largely independent of group identification.  Emphasis is placed on the self; they are motivated by their own preferences, needs, and goals, and personal achievement and initiative are stressed.  Words such as “independence,” “self,” “privacy,” and “rights” are common in individualistic cultural conversations.  Examples of individualistic societies would be the [[United States]], or [[Western Europe]] countries.

The '''collectivist culture''' has a “we” consciousness.  Individuals are closely linked to one or more groups.  Commitment to these valued groups is a primary goal of collectivists, and they tend to look to the goals and successes of the group rather than to the individuals.  Words such as “loyalty,” “responsibility,” and “community” permeate collectivist cultural conversations.  Examples of collectivist societies are many [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n, and [[South America]]n cultures.

A '''double bass array''' (DBA) is a specific layout of [[Subwoofer|subwoofers]] within a rectangular listening space. It removes unwanted room related resonances ([[Room modes|modes]]) over a wide listening area.

== Preface ==
A DBA requires at least two subwoofers (preferably same make and model) that are placed at opposing walls in a specific layout. The subwoofer array on the back wall is inverted and delayed based on the distance to the frontal subwoofer array. This will actively "absorb" any reflected sound.

== Design ==
=== Array layout ===
[[File:DBA4.PNG|thumb|Common configuration with 4 subwoofer]]
Modes between side walls, floor and ceiling are suppressed by arranging the subwoofer in a specific grid:

&lt;math&gt;p_x {=} \frac{(2 \cdot n + 1) \cdot w_x}{2 \cdot a_x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_y {=} \frac{(2 \cdot n + 1) \cdot w_y}{2 \cdot a_y}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;w_x&lt;/math&gt;: Wall width

&lt;math&gt;w_y&lt;/math&gt;: Wall height

&lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;: Horizontal distance from wall (&lt;math&gt;d_x/2&lt;/math&gt; for n=0 in picture)

&lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt;: Vertical distance from wall (&lt;math&gt;d_y/2&lt;/math&gt; for n=0 in picture)

&lt;math&gt;a_x&lt;/math&gt;: Number of subwoofers horizontally

&lt;math&gt;a_y&lt;/math&gt;: Number of subwoofers vertically

Counter &lt;math&gt;n = {0, 1, 2, 3,..., (a - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:DBA Wellenfront.png|thumb|Top view of an array with 2 subwoofer. The walls create mirror sources which results in a plane wave.]]
With this specific grid layout reflections from the walls act as mirror sources. Interference of the subwoofers and mirror sources create a plane wave up to a certain frequency. The more sources the higher the frequency. This cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated for each dimension as follows:

&lt;math&gt;f_c {=} \frac{c}{2 \cdot d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;: [[Speed of sound]]

&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;: Distance between subwoofers

Example: A 4 × 4 array on a wall measuring 4 × 3 m would work up to 86Hz horizontally and up to 114Hz vertically.

=== Active Absorption ===
[[File:DBA Wellenfront2.png|thumb|Schematic of active absorption. The bass signal is shown as a  transversal wave. The frontal wave is reflected at the back wall. At the same time the back array sends out an inverted wave which cancels the reflection.]]
Due to the specific grid layout of the subwoofer array most modal effects are suppressed. The length modes on the other hand get fully excited. The array on the back wall will emit a polarity inverted wave at the very same moment the wave from the front wall hits the back wall. Reflection and inverted wave will interfere with each other destructively so the reflection is canceled. This is also known as "active absorption".

The necessary delay &lt;math&gt;t_d&lt;/math&gt; of the back array is based on the length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of the room:

&lt;math&gt;t_d {=} \frac{l}{c} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;: [[Speed of sound]]

The necessary delay required for a DBA is available in most digital equalizers or digital crossovers. Polarity of the back array can easily be achieved by inverting the signal coming from the amps or by swapping the cables going to the driver. Most active subwoofers also offer a polarity switch.

== Pros ==
* Sound pressure level throughout the room is very even.
* Modal resonances are reduced to a minimum.
* Subwoofers should be placed as close as possible on the wall where they easily can be made invisible.
* No bulky acoustic room treatments or even structural modifications necessary.
* Simple setup.

== Cons ==
* Rooms properties and furniture can interfere with the propagation of the plane wave.
* Frequency range of the plane wave depends on the number of drivers which can be quite high in large rooms.
* As the back wall array is only used to cancel the energy of the frontal array the overall efficiency isn't good.
* SPL throughout the room is virtually constant which might affect tonal balance with satellite speakers that fall off with listening distance.

== Notes ==
A DBA just requires two opposing walls so it's possible to have one array on the floor and the other on the ceiling or one on the left wall and the other on the right. Low frequencies become localizable at a specific frequency though so in most cases it's probably a good idea to use the front wall and the back wall.

It largely depends on the room how good a DBA will work.
* The room should be rectangular
* Walls should be rigid
* Measuring equipment helps to dial in the necessary delay

'''Electroreception''' or '''electroception''' is the biological ability to perceive natural [[electrical]] stimuli.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electroreception|date=2005|publisher=Springer|others=Bullock, Theodore Holmes.|isbn=978-0387231921|location=New York|oclc=77005918}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed almost exclusively in aquatic or amphibious animals, because water is a much better [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] than air. The known exceptions are the [[monotremes]]
([[echidnas]] and [[platypus]]es), [[cockroaches]] and [[bees]]. Electroreception is used in electrolocation (detecting objects) and for [[electrocommunication]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Active electro.png|thumb|right|Active electrolocation. Conductive objects concentrate the field and resistive objects spread the field.]]
[[File:Scene analysis in electroreception.jpg|thumb|For the [[Mormyridae|elephantfish]] (here ''[[Gnathonemus]]'') the electric field emanates from an electric organ in the tail region (gray rectangle). It is sensed by the electroreceptive skin areas, using two electric pits (foveas) to actively search and inspect objects. Shown are the field distortions created by two different types of objects: a plant that conducts better than water, above (green) and a non-conducting stone, below (gray).&lt;ref&gt;Heiligenberg, Walter (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cKpqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Principles+of+Electrolocation+and+Jamming+Avoidance+in+Electric+Fish%22&amp;dq=%22Principles+of+Electrolocation+and+Jamming+Avoidance+in+Electric+Fish%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=By8SVc_pAsbUmAWZ2oDoCg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA ''Principles of Electrolocation and Jamming Avoidance in Electric Fish: A Neuroethological Approach''] Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|9780387083674}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewicki, M.

{{further|Electric fish}}

Until recently, electroreception was known only in [[vertebrate]]s. Recent research has shown that bees can detect the presence and pattern of a static charge on flowers.&lt;ref name=Clarke2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = D. | last2 = Whitney | first2 = H. | last3 = Sutton | first3 = G. | last4 = Robert | first4 = D. | title = Detection and Learning of Floral Electric Fields by Bumblebees | doi = 10.1126/science.1230883 | journal = Science | year = 2013 | volume = 340 | issue = 6128 | pages = 66–69 | pmid =  23429701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In vertebrates, electroreception is an ancestral trait, that is to say that it was present in the last common ancestor of all vertebrates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bullock |first=T.

This form of ancestral electroreception is called ampullary electroreception, with the receptive organs themselves called [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Not all vertebrates that possess electroreception have Ampullae of Lorenzini. Ampullae of Lorenzini exist in [[cartilaginous fish]]es ([[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[chimaera]]s), [[lungfish]]es, [[bichir]]s, [[coelacanth]]s, [[sturgeon]]s, [[paddlefish]], aquatic [[Salamander|salamanders]], and [[Caecilian|caecilians]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=King |first=Benedict |last2=Hu |first2=Yuzhi |last3=Long |first3=John A. |date=2018-02-11 |title=Electroreception in early vertebrates: survey, evidence and new information |journal=Palaeontology |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=325–358 |doi=10.1111/pala.12346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vertebrates that have electroreception such as [[catfish]], [[gymnotiformes]], [[Mormyridae|Mormyridiformes]], [[monotreme]]s, and at least one species of [[cetacean]] all have different secondarily derived forms of electroreception&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lavoué |first=Sébastien |last2=Miya |first2=Masaki |last3=Arnegard |first3=Matthew E. |last4=Sullivan |first4=John P. |last5=Hopkins |first5=Carl D. |last6=Nishida |first6=Mutsumi|date=2012-05-14 |title=Comparable Ages for the Independent Origins of Electrogenesis in African and South American Weakly Electric Fishes|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e36287 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036287 |pmc=3351409 |pmid=22606250}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Two groups of [[teleost]] fishes are weakly electric and engage in ''active'' electroreception; the Neotropical knifefishes ([[Gymnotiformes]]) and the African elephantfishes ([[Notopteroidei]]). A rare terrestrial exception is the [[Western long-beaked echidna]] which has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill, compared to 40,000 for its semi-aquatic monotreme relative, the [[duck-billed platypus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electroreception in fish, amphibians and monotremes |url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_41_Electroreception-in-fish-amphibians-and-monotremes/|publisher=Map of Life|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrolocation==
Electroreceptive animals use this sense to locate objects around them. This is important in [[ecological niche]]s where the animal cannot depend on vision: for example in caves, in murky water and at night. Many fish use electric fields to detect buried prey. Some shark embryos and pups "freeze" when they detect the characteristic electric signal of their predators.&lt;ref name=Coplin2004&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Coplin, S. P. |author2=Whitehead, D. | title = The functional roles of passive electroreception in non-electric fishes | journal = Animal Biology | year = 2004 | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–25 | doi = 10.1163/157075604323010024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that sharks can use their acute electric sense to detect the earth's magnetic field by detecting the weak electric currents induced by their swimming or by the flow of ocean currents.  The walking behaviour of cockroaches can be affected by the presence of a static electric field: they like to avoid the electric field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Jackson, C. W. |author2=Hunt, E. |author3=Sharkh, S. |author4=Newland, P. L. | year = 2011 | title = Static electric fields modify the locomotory behaviour of cockroaches | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 214 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 2020–2026 | pmid = 21613518 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2020.full.pdf | doi=10.1242/jeb.053470}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabbage loopers are also known to avoid electric fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Active electrolocation===
In active electrolocation,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Albert, J. S. |author2=Crampton, W. G. | year = 2006 | chapter = Electroreception and Electrogenesis | pages = 429–470 | editor = Lutz, P. L. | title = The Physiology of Fishes | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 9780849320224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the animal senses its surrounding environment by generating [[electric fields]] and detecting distortions in these fields using electroreceptor organs.  This electric field is generated by means of a specialised [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ]] consisting of modified muscle or nerves. This field may be modulated so that its frequency and wave form are unique to the species and sometimes, the individual (see [[Jamming avoidance response]]). Animals that use active electroreception include the [[weakly electric fish]], which either generate small electrical pulses (termed "pulse-type") or produce a quasi-sinusoidal discharge from the electric organ (termed "wave-type").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Babineau, D. |author2=Longtin, A. |author3=Lewis, J. E. | title = Modeling the Electric Field of Weakly Electric Fish | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 2006 | volume = 209 | issue = Pt 18 | pages = 3636–3651 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.02403 | pmid = 16943504 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fish create a potential which is usually smaller than one volt. Weakly electric fish can discriminate between objects with different [[resistance (physics)|resistance]] and [[capacitance]] values, which may help in identifying the object. Active electroreception typically has a range of about one body length, though objects with an [[electrical impedance]] similar to that of the surrounding water are nearly undetectable.

===Passive electrolocation===
{{see also|Passive electrolocation in fish}}

In passive electrolocation, the animal senses the weak [[bioelectromagnetism|bioelectric fields]] generated by other animals and uses it to locate them. These electric fields are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles. A second source of electric fields in fish is the ion pumps associated with [[osmoregulation]] at the gill membrane. This field is modulated by the opening and closing of the mouth and gill slits.&lt;ref name=Coplin2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bodznick, D. |author2=Montgomery, J. C. |author3=Bradley, D. J. | title = Suppression of Common Mode Signals Within the Electrosensory System of the Little Skate ''Raja erinacea'' | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 1992 | volume = 171 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 107–125 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/171/1/107.full.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fish that prey on [[electric fish|electrogenic fish]] use the discharges of their prey to detect them. This has driven the prey to evolve more complex or higher frequency signals that are harder to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stoddard, P. K. | title = The evolutionary origins of electric signal complexity | journal = Journal of Physiology - Paris | year = 2002 | volume = 96 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 485–491 | doi = 10.1016/S0928-4257(03)00004-4 | pmid = 14692496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive electroreception is carried out solely by ampullary electroreceptors in fish. It is tuned to low frequency signals (below one up to tens of Hertz).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Fish use passive electroreception to supplement or replace their other senses when detecting prey and predators. In sharks, sensing an electric dipole alone is sufficient to cause them to try to eat it.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Electrocommunication==

Weakly electric fish can also communicate by modulating the electrical [[waveform]] they generate, an ability known as electrocommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hopkins, C. D. | title = Design features for electric communication | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 1999 | volume = 202 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 1217–1228 | pmid = 10210663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They may use this for mate attraction and territorial displays. Some species of catfish use their electric discharges only in [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] displays.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}

In one species of ''[[Brachyhypopomus]]'' (a genus of South American river fish belonging to the family [[Hypopomidae]], commonly known as ''bluntnose knifefishes''), the electric discharge pattern is similar to the low voltage electrolocative discharge of the [[electric eel]]. This is hypothesised to be a form of [[Batesian mimicry]] of the powerfully-protected electric eel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | author = Stoddard, P. K. | title = Predation enhances complexity in the evolution of electric fish signals | journal = Nature | year = 1999 | volume = 400 | issue = 6741 | pages = 254–256 | doi = 10.1038/22301 | pmid = 10421365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensory mechanism==
Active electroreception relies upon tuberous electroreceptors which are sensitive to high frequency (20-20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz) stimuli. These receptors have a loose plug of [[epithelial]] cells which [[Capacitance|capacitively]] couples the sensory receptor cells to the external environment. Passive electroreception however, relies upon [[ampulla]]ry receptors which are sensitive to low frequency stimuli (below 50&amp;nbsp;Hz). These receptors have a jelly-filled canal leading from the sensory receptors to the skin surface. [[Mormyridae|Mormyrid]] electric fish from Africa use tuberous receptors known as [[Knollenorgans]] to sense electric communication signals.

==Examples==

=== Sharks and rays ===
Sharks and rays (members of the subclass ''[[Elasmobranchii]]''), such as the [[lemon shark]], rely heavily on electrolocation in the final stages of their attacks, as can be demonstrated by the robust feeding response elicited by electric fields similar to those of their prey.&lt;ref name="shark sense"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=R. Douglas|title=The Shark's Electric Sense|journal=Scientific American|date=August 2007|url=http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/the%20ocean%20project/shark's%20electric%20sense.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharks are the most electrically sensitive animals known, responding to [[Direct current|DC]] fields as low as 5 nV/cm.

The electric field sensors of sharks are called the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]]. They consist of electroreceptor cells connected to the seawater by pores on their snouts and other zones of the head. A problem with the early [[submarine telegraph cable]]s was the damage caused by sharks who sensed the electric fields produced by these cables. It is possible that sharks may use Earth's [[magnetic field]] to navigate the oceans using this sense.

=== Bony fish ===
The [[electric eel]] (actually a [[Gymnotidae|knifefish]], not an [[eel]]), besides its ability to generate high voltage electric shocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Catania |first1=Kenneth C. |title=Electric Eels Concentrate Their Electric Field to Induce Involuntary Fatigue in Struggling Prey |journal=Current Biology |date=October 2015 |volume=25 |issue=22 |pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.036 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2901147-1# |pmid=26521183}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses lower voltage pulses for navigation and prey detection in its turbid habitat.&lt;ref name=Fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Electrophorus|species=electricus|year=2005|month=December}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability is shared with other [[gymnotiformes]].

=== Monotremes ===
[[File:Platypus.jpg|left|thumb|The [[platypus]] is a [[monotreme]] mammal that uses electroreception.]]

The monotremes are the only group of land mammals known to have evolved electroreception.  While the electroreceptors in fish and amphibians evolved from mechanosensory lateral line organs, those of monotremes are based on cutaneous glands innervated by trigeminal nerves.  The electroreceptors of monotremes consist of free nerve endings located in the mucous glands of the snout. Among the monotremes, the [[platypus]] (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'') has the most acute electric sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scheich, H. |author2=Langner, G. |author3=Tidemann, C. |author4=Coles, R.

By making short-latency head movements called "[[saccades]]" when swimming, platypuses constantly expose the most sensitive part of their bill to the stimulus to localise prey as accurately as possible.  The platypus appears to use electroreception along with [[mechanoreception|pressure sensors]] to determine the distance to prey from the delay between the arrival of electrical signals and pressure changes in the water.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1999" /&gt;

The electroreceptive capabilities of the two species of [[echidna]] (which are terrestrial) are much more simple. [[Long-beaked echidna]]s (genus ''Zaglossus'') possess only 2,000 receptors and [[short-beaked echidna]]s (''Tachyglossus aculeatus'') have merely 400 concentrated in the tip of the snout.&lt;ref name="Map Of Life" /&gt; This difference can be attributed to their habitat and feeding methods.  Western long-beaked echidnas live in wet tropical forests where they feed on earthworms in damp leaf litter, so their habitat is probably favourable to the reception of electrical signals.  Contrary to this is the varied but generally more arid habitat of their short-beaked relative which feeds primarily on termites and ants in nests; the humidity in these nests presumably allows electroreception to be used in hunting for buried prey, particularly after rains.&lt;ref name=Proske1998&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Proske, U. |author2=Gregory, J.

The electric sense of the echidna is hypothesised to be an evolutionary remnant from a platypus-like ancestor.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1999"/&gt;

=== Dolphins ===
Dolphins have evolved electroreception in structures different from those of fish, amphibians and monotremes. The hairless [[whiskers|vibrissal]] crypts on the [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] of the [[Sotalia (genus)|Guiana dolphin]] (''Sotalia guianensis''), originally associated with mammalian whiskers, are capable of electroreception as low as 4.8 μV/cm, sufficient to detect small fish. This is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in the platypus.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Czech-Damal, N.

===Bees===
Bees collect a [[Atmospheric electricity|positive static charge while flying]] through the air. When a bee visits a flower, the charge deposited on the flower takes a while to leak away into the ground. Bees can detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, and use this information to know if a flower has been recently visited by another bee and is therefore likely to have a reduced concentration of [[nectar]].&lt;ref name=Clarke2013/&gt;
Animals detect electric fields through insulating air by mechano-reception, not electroreception. Bees sense the electric field changes via the [[Johnston's organ]]s in their [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and possibly other mechano-receptors. They distinguish different temporal patterns and learn them. During the [[waggle dance]], [[honeybee]]s appear to use the electric field emanating from the dancing bee for distance communication.&lt;ref name=Greggers&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greggers, U. |author2=Koch, G. |author3=Schmidt, V. |author4=Dürr, A. |author5=Floriou-Servou, A. |author6=Piepenbrock, D. |author7=Göpfert, M.

'''Emotional and behavioral disorders''' ('''EBD'''; also known as '''behavioural and emotional disorders''' ([[ICD-10]]);&lt;ref name="ICD-10-web-EN"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98) |date=2016 |access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10-Clinical"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines |place=[[Geneva]] |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''emotional disturbance''' or '''serious emotional disturbance''') refer to a disability classification used in educational settings that allows educational institutions to provide [[special education]] and related services to students that have poor social or academic adjustment that cannot be better explained by biological abnormalities or a [[developmental disability]]. 

The classification is often given to students, after conducting a Functional Behavior Analysis. These students need individualized [[classroom management|behavior supports]] such as a Behavior Intervention Plan, to receive a [[free and appropriate public education]]. They would not be eligible for an [[individualized education program]] under another disability category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA).

==Criteria==
The IDEA requires that a student must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long duration, and to a marked degree that adversely affects their educational performance, to receive an EBD classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA|work=parentcenterhub.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.
* Difficulty to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
* Inappropriate types of behavior (acting out against self or others) or feelings (expresses the need to harm self or others, low self-worth, etc.) under normal circumstances.
* A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
* A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

The term "EBD" includes students diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but does not apply to students who are "socially maladjusted", unless it is determined that they also meet the criteria for an EBD classification.

===Criticisms===
Providing or failing to provide an EBD classification to a student may be controversial, as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] does not clarify which children would be considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an [[individualized education program]] under an EBD classification. Some states do not allow students with a psychiatric diagnosis of [[conduct disorder]] to receive additional educational services under an EBD classification,&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp/ |title=Students with Emotional Disturbance: Eligibility and Characteristics |work=cecp.air.org |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115029/http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although many students with an EBD classification do meet the diagnostic criteria for various [[disruptive behavior disorder]]s, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or [[conduct disorder]] (CD).&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Additionally, students considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an EBD classification (i.e., students diagnosed with [[conduct disorder]]), often receive better educational services in special education classrooms or alternative schools with high structure, clear rules, and consistent consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavior-consultant.com/social.htm|title=Social Maladjustment|work=behavior-consultant.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they would not receive in general education settings. The ambiguous guidelines for determining what students are "socially maladjusted", but without EBD, may cause many students that would benefit from special education services to receive less effective educational services.

==Student characteristics==
Students with EBD are a diverse population, and have a wide range of intellectual and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehby|first1=Joseph|last2=Symons|first2=F.|last3=Shores|first3=R. E.|title=A descriptive analysis of aggressive behavior in classrooms for children with emotional and behavioral disorders|journal=Behavioral Disorders|date=1995|volume=20|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Students with EBD are often categorized as [[internalizing disorder|"internalizers"]] (e.g., have poor [[self-esteem]], or are diagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[mood disorder]]) or [[Emotional and behavioral disorders#Internalizing and externalizing behavior|"externalizers"]] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with [[disruptive behavior disorders]] such as [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction;&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for [[learning disabilities]], [[school dropout]], [[substance abuse]], and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

==Internalizing and externalizing behavior==
A person with EBD with [[internalizing disorder|"internalizing" behavior]] may have poor [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], experience [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in social, academic, and other life activities, and may exhibit [[non-suicidal self-injury]] or [[substance abuse]]. Students with internalizing behavior may also have a diagnosis of [[separation anxiety]] or another [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[specific phobia|specific]] or [[social phobia]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[panic disorder]], and/or an [[eating disorder]]. Some research suggests students with EBD with internalizing behavior are underdiagnosed; teachers are more likely to write referrals for students that are overtly disruptive, and screening tools to detect students with high levels of internalizing behavior are not sensitive and are rarely used in practice.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

Students with EBD with "[[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing]]" behavior may be aggressive, noncompliant, extroverted, or disruptive, and generally "act out" inappropriately. Students with EBD that show externalizing behavior are often diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]; however, this population can also include typically developing children that have [[operant conditioning|learned]] to exhibit externalizing behavior for various reasons (e.g., [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|escape from academic demands]] or [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|access to attention]]). These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students with EBD exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Heat]], a form of energy, is partly [[potential energy]] and partly [[kinetic energy]]]]

'''Energy quality''' is the contrast between different [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], the different [[trophic level]]s in [[ecology|ecological]] systems and the propensity of [[energy]] to convert from one form to another. The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or [[qualia]], of different energy forms as they [[Energy flow (ecology)|flow]] and transform. It appeals to our common [[perception]] of the [[heat]] value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy [[physical state]] and energy. For example the transition from a [[solid]] state to [[liquid]] may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.

==Introduction==
Since before [[ancient history|antiquity]] there has been deep [[philosophical]], [[aesthetic]] and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with [[quantity]]. In some respects the history of [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] thought can be characterized by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no "rational quality", or [[quale]] ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, [[spirituality]], and [[astrology]] to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by [[scientific methods]], and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand.

At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their [[opposable thumb]]. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and [[genome]] [[structure]], while others chose [[energetics|energetic]] function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide.

==Ohta==

According to Ohta (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] under the concept of "availability". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, "die Exergie" (the [[exergy]]). It was later continued and standardised in [[Japan]]. [[Exergy]] analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in [[steam power]] [[engineering]] industry. Here the "quality index" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of [[Value theory|value]] – for example A. Thumann wrote, "The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'" (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;113) – which brings into play the question of [[teleology]] and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy "with a built-in measure of quality like energy" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;392).

==Energy quality evaluation methods==
There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process.

'''Receiver methods:''' view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Transition_in_Energy_Use/transitions-euse-ene_encyclop_2004.pdf] used two types of indicators of energetic quality ''pars pro toto'': the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the [[carbon intensity]] of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a [[hydrogen production]] system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;125).

'''Donor methods:''' view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality ''is'' upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the ''usefulness'' of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy.

==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) ==
===Constant energy form but variable energy flow===
T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the [[Energy#Forms of energy|form of energy]] remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of  energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.

===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow===
The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the '''transformation''' of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the '''relative ease''' with which the energy transforms, from form to form.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nomenclature:''' Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing "energy A", like Ohta above, Culp referred to "J&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;", to specify electrical form of energy, where" J" refers to "energy", and the "''e''"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript.

==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)==
The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of [[biophysical economics]] energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with [[embodied energy]] methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the "Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator." (2006; p.&amp;nbsp;10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input.

==Ranking energy quality==
===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position===

Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p.&amp;nbsp;90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of "relative ease" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, "the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, "the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist." (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in [http://www.exergy.se/ftp/japan85.pdf Wall's article] for another example ranking of energy quality).

===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank===

Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodyanmics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called [[transformity]]: "the [[Emergy|EMERGY]] per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule" (H.T.Odum 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;1135).

'''Environmental flows''' describe the quantity, timing, and quality of '''water flows''' required to sustain [[freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]] and [[estuarine]] [[ecosystem]]s and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems. In the [[India]]n context [[river]] flows required for [[Culture|cultural]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] needs assumes significance.&lt;ref&gt;http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/exec_summary_mail_1_28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eflownet.org/viewinfo.cfm?linkcategoryid=4&amp;linkid=64&amp;siteid=1&amp;FuseAction=display&lt;/ref&gt;  Through implementation of environmental flows, water managers strive to achieve a flow regime, or pattern, that provides for human uses and maintains the essential processes required to support healthy [[river ecosystem]]s. Environmental flows do not necessarily require restoring the natural, pristine flow patterns that would occur absent human development, use, and diversion but, instead, are intended to produce a broader set of values and benefits from rivers than from management focused strictly on water supply, energy, recreation, or [[flood control]].

Rivers are parts of integrated systems that include [[floodplains]] and [[riparian corridor]]s.  Collectively these systems provide a large suite of benefits.  However, the world's rivers are increasingly being altered through the construction of dams, diversions, and [[levee]]s. More than half of the world's large rivers are dammed,&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, C., Reidy, C. A., Dynesius, M., and Revenga, C. 2005. Fragmentation and flow regulation of the world's large river systems.  Science 308:405-408.&lt;/ref&gt; a figure that continues to increase.  Almost 1,000 dams are planned or under construction in South America and 50 new dams are planned on China's Yangtze River alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/riverslakes/reducing-the-ecological-impact-of-dams.xml Rivers and Lakes: Reducing the Ecological Impact of Dams]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dams and other river structures change the downstream flow patterns and consequently affect water quality, temperature, sediment movement and deposition, fish and wildlife, and the livelihoods of people who depend on healthy river ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Postel, S., and Richter, B. 2003. Rivers for Life: Managing Water for People and Nature. Island Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental flows seek to maintain these river functions while at the same time providing for traditional offstream benefits.

==Evolution of environmental flow concepts and recognition==
From the turn of the 20th century through the 1960s, [[water management]] in [[developed nations]] focused largely on maximizing [[flood protection]], [[water supplies]], and [[hydropower]] generation.  During the 1970s, the ecological and economic effects of these projects prompted scientists to seek ways to modify [[dam]] operations to maintain certain fish species.  The initial focus was on determining the minimum flow necessary to preserve an individual species, such as [[trout]], in a river. Environmental flows evolved from this concept of "minimum flows" and, later, "instream flows", which emphasized the need to keep water within waterways.

By the 1990s, scientists came to realize that the biological and social systems supported by rivers are too complicated to be summarized by a single minimum flow requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, S. E., and Arthington, A. H. 2002. Basic principles and ecological consequences of altered flow regimes for aquatic [[biodiversity]].

In a global survey of water specialists undertaken in 2003 to gauge perceptions of environmental flow, 88% of the 272 respondents agreed that the concept is essential for sustainably managing [[water resource]]s and meeting the long-term needs of people.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. 2004.

By 2010, many countries throughout the world had adopted environmental flow policies, although their implementation remains a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Le Quesne, T., Kendy, E., and Weston, D. 2010.

==Examples==
{{See also|Stream restoration}}
One effort currently underway to restore environmental flows is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321045053/http://www.conservationgateway.org/content/sustainable-rivers Sustainable Rivers Project], a collaboration between [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) and [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE), which is the largest water manager in the United States.  Since 2002, TNC and the USACE have been working to define and implement environmental flows by altering the operations of USACE dams in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321045155/http://www.conservationgateway.org/file/sustainable-rivers-project-current-sites 8 rivers] across 12 states.  Dam reoperation to release environmental flows, in combination with floodplain restoration, has in some instances increased the water available for [[hydropower]] production while reducing flood risk.

[[Arizona]]'s [[Bill Williams River]], flowing downstream of [[Alamo Dam]], is one of the rivers featured in the Sustainable Rivers Project.  Having discussed modifying dam operations since the early 1990s, local stakeholders began to work with TNC and USACE in 2005 to identify specific strategies for improving the ecological health and biodiversity of the river basin downstream from the dam.  Scientists compiled the best available information and worked together to define [http://www.fort.usgs.gov/products/publications/21745/21745.pdf environmental flows for the Bill Williams River].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey, 2006. Defining Ecosystem Flow Requirements for the Bill Williams River, Arizona. Open-File Report 2006-1314. Edited by Shafroth, P.B. and V.B. Beauchamp.&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all of the recommended environmental flow components could be implemented immediately, the USACE has changed its operations of Alamo Dam to incorporate more natural low flows and controlled floods. Ongoing monitoring is capturing resulting ecological responses such as rejuvenation of native willow-cottonwood forest, suppression of invasive and non-native tamarisk, restoration of more natural densities of beaver dams and associated lotic-lentic habitat, changes in aquatic insect populations, and enhanced [[groundwater recharge]]. USACE engineers continue to consult with scientists on a regular basis and use the monitoring results to further refine operations of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;Shafroth, P., Wilcox, A., Lytle, D., Hickey, J., Andersen, D., Beauchamp, V., Hautzinger, A., McMullen, L., and Warner, A. 2010.  Ecosystem effects of environmental flows: modeling and experimental floods in a dryland river.  Freshwater Biology 55: 68-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case in which stakeholders developed environmental flow recommendations is [[Honduras]]' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321045259/http://www.conservationgateway.org/file/sustainable-waters-patuca-river-honduras Patuca III Hydropower Project].  The Patuca River, the second longest river in Central America, has supported fish populations, nourished crops, and enabled navigation for many indigenous communities, including the Tawahka, Pech, and Miskito Indians, for hundreds of years.  To protect the ecological health of the largest undisturbed rainforest north of the Amazon and its inhabitants, TNC and [[Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica]] (ENEE, the agency responsible for the project) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321045259/http://www.conservationgateway.org/file/sustainable-waters-patuca-river-honduras agreed to study] and determine flows necessary to sustain the health of human and natural communities along the river.  Due to very limited available data, innovative approaches were developed for estimating flow needs based on experiences and observations of the local people who depend on this nearly pristine river reach.&lt;ref&gt;Esselman, P. C., and Opperman, J. J. 2010.

Ecology and Society 15(1):6 (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods, tools, and models==
More than 200 methods are used worldwide to prescribe river flows needed to maintain healthy rivers.  However, very few of these are comprehensive and holistic, accounting for seasonal and inter-annual flow variation needed to support the whole range of [[ecosystem services]] that healthy rivers provide.&lt;ref&gt;Tharme, R. E. 2003. A global perspective on environmental flow assessment: emerging trends in the development and application of environmental flow methodologies for rivers.

To facilitate environmental flow prescriptions, a number of computer models and tools have been developed by groups such as the USACE's [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/ Hydrologic Engineering Center] to capture flow requirements defined in a workshop setting (e.g., [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-rpt/ HEC-RPT]) or to evaluate the implications of environmental flow implementation (e.g., [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ressim/ HEC-ResSim], [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/ HEC-RAS], and [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-efm/index.html HEC-EFM]).
Additionally, a [[2D geometric model|2D]] model is developed from a [[3D modeling|3D]] turbulence model based on Smagorinsky large eddy closure to more appropriately model environmental large scale flows.&lt;ref&gt;Cao, M. and Roberts, A. J. 2012. Modelling 3D turbulent floods based upon the Smagorinski large eddy closure. Proceedings of the 18th Australasian Fluid Mechanics Conference Published by the Australasian Fluid Mechanics Society.&lt;/ref&gt; This model is based on a [[slow manifold]] of the turbulent Smagorinsky large eddy closure instead of conventional depth-averaging flow equations.

Other tried and tested environmental flow assessment methods include DRIFT (King et al. 2003), which was recently used in the Kishenganga HPP dispute between Pakistan and India at the International Court of Arbitration.

==In India==

In [[India]], the need for environmental flows has emerged from the hundreds of large [[dams]] being planned in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] rivers for hydro power generation. The cascades of dams planned across the [[Lohit district|Lohit]], [[Dibang River]] in the [[Brahmaputra River]] , the [[Alaknanda River|Alaknanda]] and [[Bhagirathi River]] in the [[Ganga river|Ganga]] basin and the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] in [[Sikkim]] for example, would end up in the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert Appraisal Committee of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]]) on releasing e-flows from dams. However, these recommendations have never been backed by strong objectives about why certain e-flow releases are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/eflows_primer_062012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710223754/http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/eflows_primer_062012.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnoecology''' is the [[scientific method|scientific]] study of how different groups of people living in different locations understand the [[ecosystem]]s around them, and their relationships with surrounding environments.

It seeks valid, reliable understanding of how we as humans have interacted with the environment and how these intricate relationships have been sustained over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mHj3RfaLCFYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ethnoecology&amp;ots=xsl7-Ob-kj&amp;sig=gkKc38x93_fuB0S3Bo9IDTKwRvw#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnoecology&amp;f=false|title=Ethnoecology: Situated Knowledge/located Lives|last=Nazarea|first=Virginia D.|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=9780816523641|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ethno" (see [[ethnology]]) prefix in ethnoecology indicates a localized study of a people, and in conjunction with [[ecology]], signifies people's understanding and experience of environments around them. Ecology is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment; enthnoecology applies a human focused approach to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IryOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=latin+morpeme+ethno&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nRnF23dRA&amp;sig=LqE5uvdEmUIlTDLCpYAogk8yOo0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRxMjZk7TeAhWaHzQIHawABSMQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20morpeme%20ethno&amp;f=false|title=General Linguistics|last=Robins|first=R. H.|date=2014-05-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317887638|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the field lies in applying indigenous knowledge of [[botany]] and placing it in a global context.

== History ==
Ethnoecology began with some of the early works of Dr. [[Hugh Popenoe]], an agronomist and tropical soil scientist who has worked with the University of Florida, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council. Popenoe has also worked with Dr [[Harold Conklin]], a cognitive anthropologist who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In his 1954 dissertation "The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture to the Plant World", Harold Conklin coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as "ethnoecological". After earning his PhD, he began teaching at Columbia University while continuing his research among the Hanunoo.

In 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His "Hanunoo Color Categories" study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin discovered that people in various cultures recognize colors differently due to their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors:; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. While, the second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications such as: texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects.

Other anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria to those of the Hanunoo. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, which helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to [[Taxonomy (biology)|Western scientific taxonomies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prado|first=Helbert Medeiros|last2=Murrieta|first2=Rui Sérgio Sereni|last3=Prado|first3=Helbert Medeiros|last4=Murrieta|first4=Rui Sérgio Sereni|date=2015-12|title=ETHNOECOLOGY IN PERSPECTIVE: THE ORIGINS, INTERFACES AND CURRENT TRENDS OF A GROWING FIELD|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1414-753X2015000400009&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Ambiente &amp;amp; Sociedade|volume=18|issue=4|pages=139–160|doi=10.1590/1809-4422ASOC986V1842015|issn=1414-753X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

[[Ethnoscience]] emphasizes the importance of how societies make sense of their own reality. In order to understand how cultures perceive the world around them, like the classification and organization of the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001/acref-9780199754670|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9780199754670|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ethnoecology borrows methods from linguistics and cultural anthropology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lehigh.edu/~dac511/pages/research/ethnoecol.html|title=Ethnoecology, David Casagrande|website=www.lehigh.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ethnoecology is a major part of an anthropologist’s toolkit;  it helps researchers understand how the society conceptualizes their surrounding environment i and that it can determine what the society considers "worth attending to" in their ecological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864107613|title=An ethnoecological approach to the study of a village Himachal Pradesh|last=Anindita.|first=Ghosh,|date=2012|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing|isbn=9783659305320|edition=1. Aufl|location=Saarbrücken|oclc=864107613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can ultimately be useful for other approaches used in [[environmental anthropology]].

Ethnoecology is a field of [[environmental anthropology]], and has derived much of its characteristics from classic as well as more modern theorists. [[Franz Boas]] was one of the first anthropologists to question [[unilineal evolution]], the belief that all societies follow the same, unavoidable path towards [[Western civilization]]. Boas strongly urged anthropologists to gather detailed ethnographic data from an [[emic]] standpoint in order to understand different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Irving|date=1959|title=Evolution and Anthropology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3825587|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=55–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Steward]] was another anthropologist whose ideas and theories influenced the use of ethnoecology. Steward coined the term [[cultural ecology]], the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments, and focused on how evolutionary paths in similar societies result in different trajectories instead of the classic global trends in evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Ecological%20Anthropology|title=Ecological Anthropology - Anthropological Theories - Department of Anthropology - The University of Alabama|website=anthropology.ua.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new perspective on [[cultural evolution]] was  later named [[multilineal evolution]]. Both Boas and Steward believed that a researcher must use an emic standpoint and that cultural adaptation to an environment is not the same for each society. Furthermore, Steward's cultural ecology provides an important theoretical antecedent for ethnoecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another contributor to the framework of ethnoecology was anthropologist [[Leslie White]].  White emphasized the interpretation of cultures as [[System|systems]] and laid the foundations for interpreting the intersection of [[Cultural system|cultural systems]] with [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] as well as their integration into a coherent whole. Altogether, these anthropologists, established the foundations of ethnoecology we see today.

== Traditional ecological knowledge ==

[[Traditional Ecological Knowledge]] (TEK), also known as [[Indigenous Knowledge]], "refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous and local peoples over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/traditional-knowledge.html|title=Fish and Wildlife Service - Native American Liaison|last=Service|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|website=www.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the accumulated knowledge, beliefs, and practices widely held by a specific community through their relationship with the environment. In this context, TEK consists of a community’s shared ideas when considering subjects such as the acceptable uses of plants and animals, the best approach to maximizing the potential uses of land, the social institutions in which members of society are expected to navigate, and holistically, their [[worldview]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|last2=Folke|first2=Mina Kislalioglu, Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav|date=1998-09-01|title=Minireviews: Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100219900034|journal=Ecosystems|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=409–415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034|issn=1432-9840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of TEK frequently includes critiques of the theoretical division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans as an integral part of the whole.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Humans, for example, can represent a [[keystone species]] in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it . They can contribute to processes such as [[pedogenesis]], [[seed dispersal]], and fluctuations in [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Biodiversity, Resilience and Sustainability|date=1994|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|work=Biodiversity Conservation: Problems and Policies|pages=269–287|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|isbn=9780792331407|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Folke|first2=Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also modify and condition [[Ethology|animal behavior]] in either wild or domesticated species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional Ecological Knowledge has traditionally focused on what Western science can learn from these communities and how closely their cultural knowledge mirrors scientific structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been argued that this previous understanding of ecological adaptation could have major influences on our ecological actions in the future. 

==Local knowledge in western society==

Within the discipline of Ethnoecology, there is a clear emphasis on those societies that are deemed "[[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]," "[[traditional]]," or "[[Noble savage|savage]]," a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | first = Nora

 | title = Biodiversity Is Diversity in Use: Community-Based Conservation in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve
 | journal = America Verde Working Papers
 | volume = 7
 | pages = 5
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, societies exist within a wide range of biomes, and have needs to know and understand clear and present dangers beyond those of harmful plants or how to get the best crop.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul" /&gt;  Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a "static, timeless, and hermetically sealed" notion.&lt;ref name="cruikshank_glaciers"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Glaciers Listen? : Local Knowledge, Colonial Encounters, and Social Imagination|last=Cruikshank|first=Julie|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2005|location=Seattle|pages=9}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;  Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a [[post-industrial society]], such as that of the United States.

In this way, ethnoecologies may exist without the bounded notion of the ''other''.  For example, social scientists have attempted to understand the markers inner-city youth use to identify a threat to their livelihood, including the wearing of gang colors, tattoos, or protrusions through clothes that may represent or be a weapon.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | publisher = College of Human Ecology
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, concepts are spread about the health and needs of the community as they are related to the area around them.  Instilled with recognizing dangers at an early age, and who these threats come from, a set of beliefs are held by the members of the society on how to live in their country, city, or neighborhood.  This broadening of the discipline (bordering on [[human ecology]]) is important because it identifies the environment as not just the plants and animals, but also the humans and technologies a group of people have access to.

Similarly, social scientists have begun to use ethnoecological surveys in ethnographic studies in attempts to understand and address topics relevant in Western society as well as prevalent around the world.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty" /&gt; This includes researching the ways in which people view their choices and abilities in manipulating the world around them, especially in their ability to subsist.

== Traditional Medicine ==
Traditional societies often treat medical issues through the utilization of their local environment. For example, in Chinese herbal medicine people consider how to utilize native plants for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine: In Depth|website=NCCIH|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 80% of the world’s population utilizes ethnobotanical methods as a main source of treatment for illnesses, according to WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Norman R.|last2=Akerele|first2=Olayiwola|last3=Bingel|first3=Audrey S.|last4=Soejarto|first4=Djaja D.|last5=Guo|first5=Zhengang|date=1985|title=Medicinal plants in therapy |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=63|issue=6|pages=965–981 |pmc=2536466|pmid=3879679}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the face of modern climate change, many traditional medicinal practices have been promoted for their environmental sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-02-01|title=Ecology and ethnomedicine: Exploring links between current environmental crisis and indigenous medical practices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0277953694E0098D|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)E0098-D|issn=0277-9536}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as Ayurveda from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rastogi|first=Sanjeev|last2=Kaphle|first2=Krishna|date=2011|title=Sustainable Traditional Medicine: Taking the Inspirations from Ancient Veterinary Science|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/151435/|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|language=en|volume=2011|pages=1–6|doi=10.1093/ecam/nen071|issn=1741-427X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological concerns==

According to Dove and Carpenter, "environmental anthropology sits astride the [[dichotomy]] between nature and culture, a conceptual separation between categories of nature, like wilderness and parks, and those of culture, like farms and cities.".&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inherent in this ideology that humans are a polluting factor violating a previously pristine locale.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

This is especially relevant due to the role in which scientists have long understood how humans have worked for and against their environmental surroundings as a whole.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|year=1998|title=Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|journal=Ecosystems|volume=1|issue=4|pages=409–415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the idea of a corresponding, but not adversarial, relationship between society and culture was once in itself baffling and defiant to the generally accepted modes of understanding in the earlier half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit" /&gt;  As time went on, the understood dichotomy of nature and culture continued to be challenged by ethnographers such as [[Darrell A. Posey]], John Eddins, Peter Macbeth and Debbie Myers.&lt;ref name="posey_amazonian"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the recognition of indigenous knowledge in the intersection of Western science is the way in which it is incorporated, if at all.  Dove and Carpenter contend that some anthropologists have sought to reconcile the two through a "translation," bringing the ethnological understandings and framing them in a modern dialogue.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

In opposition to this paradigm is an attribution to the linguistic and ideological distinctiveness found in the nomenclature and epistemologies.&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology"&gt;{{Cite book

It is simply placing a different understanding of a long-held tradition in ethnology, discovering the terms in which different peoples use to describe their world and worldviews.&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology" /&gt;  It is worth noting that those who seek to use and understand this knowledge have actively worked to both enfranchise and disenfranchise the societies in which the information was held.&lt;ref name="haenn_conservatism"&gt;{{Cite journal

In [[astronomy]], '''extinction''' is the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[light scattering|scattering]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by dust and gas between an emitting [[astronomical object]] and the [[observation|observer]]. Interstellar extinction was first documented as such in 1930 by [[Robert Julius Trumpler]].&lt;ref&gt;

For stars that lie near the plane of the [[Milky Way]] and are within a few thousand [[parsec]]s of the Earth, extinction in the visual band of frequencies ([[photometric system]]) is [[Order of magnitude|on the order]] of 1.8&amp;nbsp;[[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] per kiloparsec.&lt;ref&gt;

For [[Earth]]-bound observers, extinction arises both from the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[Earth's atmosphere]]; it may also arise from [[circumstellar dust]] around an observed object. Strong extinction in earth's atmosphere of some [[wavelength]] regions (such as [[X-ray]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[infrared]]) is overcome by the use of space-based observatories. Since [[blue]] light is much more strongly [[Attenuation|attenuated]] than [[red]] light, extinction causes objects to appear redder than expected, a phenomenon referred to as '''interstellar reddening'''.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy&gt;See Binney and Merrifeld, Section 3.7 (1998, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02565-0}}), Carroll and Ostlie, Section 12.1 (2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8053-0402-2}}), and Kutner (2003, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52927-3}}) for applications in astronomy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interstellar reddening==

In [[astronomy]], interstellar reddening is a phenomenon associated with interstellar extinction where the [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] from a [[astronomical object|radiation source]] changes characteristics from that which the object originally [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emitted]]. Reddening occurs due to the [[light]] [[scattering]] off [[Cosmic dust|dust]] and other [[matter]] in the [[interstellar medium]]. Interstellar reddening is a different phenomenon from [[redshift]], which is the proportional [[Doppler shift|frequency shifts]] of spectra without distortion. Reddening preferentially removes shorter [[wavelength]] [[photons]] from a radiated spectrum while leaving behind the longer wavelength photons (in the [[visible spectrum|optical]], light that is [[red]]der), leaving the [[atomic spectral line|spectroscopic lines]] unchanged.

In most [[photometric system]]s filters (passbands) are used from which readings of magnitude of light may account of latitude and humidity among terrestrial factors. Interstellar reddening equates to the "color excess", defined as the difference between an object's observed color index and its intrinsic color index (sometimes referred to as its normal color index). The latter is the theoretical value which it would have if unaffected by extinction. In the first system, the [[UBV photometric system]] devised in the 1950s and its most closely related successors, the object's color excess &lt;math&gt;E_{B-V}&lt;/math&gt; is related to the object's [[B−V color]] (calibrated blue minus calibrated visible) by:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;E_{B-V} = (B-V)_{\textrm{observed}} - (B-V)_{\textrm{intrinsic}}\,&lt;/math&gt;}}

For an A0-type main sequence star (these have median wavelength and heat among the main sequence) the color indices are calibrated at 0 based on an intrinsic reading of such a star (± exactly 0.02 depending on which spectral point, i.e. precise passband within the abbreviated color name is in question, see [[color index]]). At least two and up to five measured passbands in magnitude are then compared by subtraction: U,B,V,I or R during which the color excess from extinction is calculated and deducted. The name of the four sub-indices (R minus I etc.) and order of the subtraction of recalibrated magnitudes is from right to immediate left within this sequence.

==General characteristics==
Interstellar reddening occurs because [[Interstellar medium|interstellar dust]] absorbs and scatters blue light waves more than red light waves, making stars appear redder than they are. This is similar to the effect seen when dust particles in the atmosphere of Earth contribute to red sunsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/skrutskie/ASTR1210/notes/redden.html | title=Interstellar Reddening, Extinction, and Red Sunsets | publisher=Astro.virginia.edu | date=2002-04-22 | accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, interstellar extinction is strongest at short wavelengths, generally observed by using techniques from [[spectroscopy]]. Extinction results in a change in the shape of an observed spectrum. Superimposed on this general shape are absorption features (wavelength bands where the intensity is lowered) that have a variety of origins and can give clues as to the chemical composition of the interstellar material, e.g. [[Cosmic dust|dust grains]]. Known absorption features include the 2175 [[Angstrom|Å]] bump, the [[diffuse interstellar band]]s, the 3.1 [[μm]] water ice feature, and the 10 and 18 μm [[silicate]] features.

In the solar neighborhood, the rate of interstellar extinction in the [[UBV photometric system|Johnson-Cousins V-band (visual filter)]] averaged at a wavelength of 540 nm is usually taken to be 0.7-1.0 mag/kpc−simply an average due to the ''clumpiness'' of interstellar dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, this means that a star will have its brightness reduced by about a factor of 2 in the V-band viewed from a good night sky vantage point on earth for every [[Parsec|kiloparsec]] (3,260 light years) it is farther away from us.

The amount of extinction can be significantly higher than this in specific directions. For example, some regions of the [[Galactic Center]] are awash with obvious intervening dark dust from our spiral arm (and perhaps others) and themselves in a bulge of dense matter, causing as much as more than 30 magnitudes of extinction in the optical, meaning that less than 1 optical photon in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The general shape of the ultraviolet through near-infrared (0.125 to 3.5 μm) extinction curve (plotting extinction in magnitude against wavelength, often inverted) looking from our vantage point at other objects in the [[Milky Way]], is fairly well characterized by the stand-alone parameter of relative visiblity (of such visible light) R(V) (which is different along different lines of sight),&lt;ref name="ca89"&gt;{{Cite journal

R(V) compares aggregate and particular extinctions. It is {{math|A(V)/E(B-V)}}. Restated, it is the total extinction, A(V) divided by the selective total extinction (A(B)-A(V)) of those two wavelengths (bands). A(B) and A(V) are the '''total extinction''' at the [[UBV photometric system|B and V]] filter bands. Another measure used in the literature is the '''absolute extinction''' A(λ)/A(V) at wavelength λ, comparing the total extinction at that wavelength to that at the V band.

R(V) is known to be correlated with the average size of the dust grains causing the extinction. For our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the typical value for R(V) is 3.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to use a theoretical spectrum instead of the observed spectrum for the comparison, but this is less common.  In the case of [[emission nebula]]e, it is common to look at the ratio of two [[emission line]]s which should not be affected by the [[temperature]] and [[density]] in the nebula.  For example, the ratio of [[H-alpha|hydrogen alpha]] to [[H-alpha|hydrogen beta]] emission is always around 2.85 under a wide range of conditions prevailing in nebulae.  A ratio other than 2.85 must therefore be due to extinction, and the amount of extinction can thus be calculated.

==The 2175-angstrom feature==

One prominent feature in measured extinction curves of many objects within the Milky Way is a broad 'bump' at about 2175 [[Angstrom|Å]], well into the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This feature was first observed in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The form of the standard extinction curve depends on the composition of the ISM, which varies from [[galaxy]] to galaxy.  In the [[Local Group]], the best-determined extinction curves are those of the Milky Way, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (SMC) and the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC).

In the LMC, there is significant variation in the characteristics of the ultraviolet extinction with a weaker 2175 Å bump and stronger far-UV extinction in the region associated with the LMC2 supershell (near the 30 Doradus starbursting region) than seen elsewhere in the LMC and in the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Atmospheric extinction==
Atmospheric extinction gives the [[sunrise|rising]] or [[sunset|setting]] Sun an orange hue and varies with location and [[altitude]]. Astronomical [[observatory|observatories]] generally are able to characterise the local extinction curve very accurately, to allow observations to be corrected for the effect. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is completely opaque to many wavelengths requiring the use of [[satellite]]s to make observations.

This extinction has three main components: [[Rayleigh scattering]] by air molecules, [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] by [[particulates]], and molecular [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. Molecular absorption is often referred to as [[telluric contamination|telluric absorption]], as it is caused by the [[Earth]] (''telluric'' is a [[synonym]] for ''terrestrial''). The most important sources of telluric absorption are [[oxygen|molecular oxygen]] and [[ozone]], which strongly absorb radiation near [[ultraviolet]], and [[water]], which strongly absorbs [[infrared]].

The amount of such extinction is lowest at the observer's [[zenith]] and highest near the [[horizon]]. A given star reaches its greatest [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial altitude]] and optimal time for observation when the star is near the local [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] around solar [[midnight]] and if the star has a favorable [[declination]] (i.e. similar to the observer's [[latitude]]); thus, the seasonal time due to [[axial tilt]] is key. Extinction is approximated by multiplying the standard atmospheric extinction curve (plotted against each wavelength) by the mean [[air mass (astronomy)|air mass]] calculated over the duration of the observation. A dry atmosphere reduces infrared extinction significantly.

'''Field recording''' is the term used for an [[Sound recording|audio recording]] produced outside a [[recording studio]], and the term applies to recordings of both natural and human-produced sounds.

Field recording of natural sounds, also called '''phonography''' (a term chosen to illustrate its similarities to [[photography]]), was originally developed as a documentary adjunct to research work [[field work|in the field]], and [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]] work for film.  With the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, it has subsequently become an evocative artform in itself.  In the 1970s, both processed and natural phonographic recordings, (pioneered by Irv Teibel's [[Environments (series)|''Environments'' series]]), became popular.

"Field recordings" may also refer to simple monaural or stereo recordings taken of musicians in familiar and casual surroundings, such as the [[ethnomusicology]] recordings pioneered by [[John Lomax]], [[Nonesuch Records]], and [[Vanguard Records]].

==Techniques==

[[File:Ecoacoustics recording in Rural Illinois, USA.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Two individuals recording [[ecoacoustics]] in the field. ]]

Field recording often involves the capture of ambient noises that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits of recording equipment, that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a portable, battery-powered unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone [[pre-amplifiers]]. The history of the equipment used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology.

Field recording is typically recorded in the same channel format as the desired result, for instance, stereo recording equipment will yield a stereo product. In contrast, a [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] [[remote recording]] captures many microphones on multiple channels, later to be creatively modified, augmented, and mixed down to a specific consumer format.

Field recording experienced a rapid increase in popularity during the early 1960s, with the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, (e.g., the [[Uher (brand)|Uher]], and [[Nagra]] portable reel-to-reel decks). The arrival of the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] (Digital Audio Tape) in the 1980s introduced a new level of audio recording [[Fidelity#Audio|fidelity]] with extended frequency response and low [[Microphone#Measurements and specifications|self-noise]]. In addition to these technologies, other popular means for field recording have included the [[compact audio cassette|analog cassette]] (CAC), the [[Digital Compact Cassette|DCC]] (Digital Compact Cassette), and the [[MiniDisc]]. The latest generation of recorders are completely digital-based (hard disk/[[Flash Memory|Flash]]). It is also possible to use personal electronic devices, (e.g., a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]]), with software, to do field recording and editing.

Newly developed techniques include the creative placement of microphones, (including [[contact microphones]] and [[hydrophones]], for example), the diffusion of captured sounds, and individual approaches.

==Research==

===Ethnomusicology===
Field recording was originally a way to document oral presentations, and [[ethnomusicology]] projects (pioneered by [[Charles Seeger]], [[John Lomax]] and [[Béla Bartók]]).

===Bioacoustics===
Field recording is an important tool in [[bioacoustics]] and [[biomusicology]], most commonly in research on [[bird song]].  Animals in the wild can display very different vocalizations from those in captivity.

==Art==

===Music===
The use of field recordings in [[avant-garde]], [[musique concrète]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], and, more recently, [[ambient music]] was evident almost from the birth of recording technology. Most noteworthy for pioneering the conceptual and theoretical framework with art music that most openly embraced the use of raw sound material and field recordings was [[Pierre Schaeffer]], who was developing musique concrète as early as 1940. Further impetus was provided by the [[World Soundscape Project]], initiated by Canadian composer [[R. Murray Schafer]] in the 1970s; this work involved studying the [[acoustic ecology]] of a particular location by the use of field recordings.

Field recordings are now a common source material for a range of musical results, from contemporary musique concrète compositions to film soundtracks, video game soundtracks, and effects. [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]], formerly of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], is now perhaps the world's leading exponent of this art, with his recordings used for [[David Attenborough filmography|David Attenborough's series]] for the [[BBC]], programmes for [[BBC Radio]], and many other outlets. Another notable application of field recordings as of contemporary music is its inclusion in some [[vaporwave]] tracks, commonly recordings of public areas such as malls or grocery stores to add atmosphere.

The sounds recorded by any device, and then transferred to digital format, are used by some musicians through their performance with [[MIDI]]-interfaced instruments. A contemporary artist with great success for his compositions is [[Christian Fennesz]]. In addition, electronic musicians, such as DJ Throwing Shade, have been using field recordings to create music that has "someone actually playing an instrument in real life, something which cannot be re-created in the same way through synthesised sounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/between-worlds-how-field-recordings-can-challenge-our-perceptions-of-electronic-music|title=Between Worlds: How Field Recordings Can Challenge Our Perceptions of Electronic Music {{!}} Thump|last=Darton|first=James|date=January 19, 2017|work=|newspaper=Thump|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier innovators who are noted for the importance and boldness of their projects are [[Luigi Russolo]], who, in 1913, with his manifesto, ''L'arte dei rumori'' (''[[The Art of Noises]]''), gave musical value to [[environmental noise]]. He also designed and built the [[Intonarumori]]—the first instruments for making noise. [[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] utilized the Intonarumori in his opera, ''L'aviatore Dro'', which was written in close collaboration with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], (the founder of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement).

===Radio documentary===
[[Radio documentary|Radio documentaries]] often use recordings from the field, e.g., a locomotive engine running, for evocative effect.  This type of sound functions as the non-fictional counterpart to the [[sound effect]].

===Politics===
During the early years of commercial recordings, the speeches of politicians sold well, since few people had radios. The [http://www.worldcat.org/title/gramophone-records-of-the-first-world-war-an-hmv-catalogue-1914-1918/oclc/1938531 HMV ("His Master's Voice") catalogue for 1914–1918] lists over a dozen such records. Probably the last time such records sold well was in 1965, when the [[LP record|LP]], ''The Voice of Churchill'', reached number 7 in the UK album charts. This was immediately after [[Winston Churchill|Churchill's]] death.

The term 'bourgeois' is used derogatorily to describe anything considered humdrum, unimaginative and/or selfishly materialistic
* '''[[Bronze Age]]''' – In Britain, this was the period – from about 2300 to 700 BC – when metal first began to be widely used, possibly as a result of the increase in contact with Europe. However, various types of stone, particularly flint, remained very important for long after metal became available. The Bronze Age saw the introduction of cremation of the dead and burials in round barrows. The later (and best known) phases of construction at Stonehenge also date from this period

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">A HRG [[gyrocompass]] is a [[compass]] and instrument of [[navigation]]. It is the latest generation of maintenance free instrument.

The HRG gyrocompass is a complete unit, which unlike a conventional compass, has no rotating or other moving parts. It uses [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope|Hemispherical Resonant gyroscope]], accelerometers and computers to compute [[True north]]. It has an outstanding reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/project/HRG-by-SAFRAN-The-game-changing-technology|title=HRG by SAFRAN The game-changing technology|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its operational [[Mean Time Between Failure]] (MTBF) values are improved over a [[Fibre optic gyrocompass|Fiber Optic Gyrocompass]] and also conventional mechanical gyrocompass. 
The HRG gyrocompass is also immune to several environmental conditions.

== Ancient Near East ==
{{see also|Sacred prostitution}}
The [[Ancient Near East]] was home to many shrines, temples or "houses of heaven," which were dedicated to various deities. These shrines and temples were documented by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0016%2C001&amp;query=book%3D1%3Achapter%3D199%3Asection%3D1 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; where [[sacred prostitution]] was a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  [[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sumeria]]n records dating back to ca. 2400 [[Common Era|BCE]] are the earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation. These describe a [[temple]]-[[brothel]] operated by Sumerian priests in the city of [[Uruk]]. This ''kakum'' or temple was dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] and was the home to three grades of women. The first grade of women were only permitted to perform sexual rituals in the temple, the second group had access to the grounds and catered to visitors, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds. The third class was also free to find customers in the streets.

During the region of [[Canaan]], a significant portion of temple prostitutes were male. This was also widely practiced in [[Sardinia]] and in some of the [[Phoenicia]]n cultures, usually in honor of the goddess [[`Ashtart|Ashtart]]. Presumably under the influence of the Phoenicians,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} this practice was developed in other ports of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], such as [[Erice]] ([[Sicily]]), [[Locri|Locri Epizephiri]], [[Crotone|Croton]], Rossano Vaglio and Sicca Veneria. Other hypotheses include [[Asia Minor]], [[Lydia]], [[Syria]] and the Etruscans.

In later years sacred prostitution and similar classifications for females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983|}} Such practices came to an end when the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the fourth century AD destroyed the [[goddess]] temples and replaced the religious practices with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical references ==
Prostitution was commonplace in [[ancient Israel]]. There are a number of references to prostitution in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Biblical story of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|38:14-26|HE}}) provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway where she waits for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have afforded to pay for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period.

In a later Biblical story, found in the [[Book of Joshua]], a prostitute in [[Jericho]] named [[Rahab]] assisted Israelite spies by providing them with information regarding the current socio-cultural and military situation. [[Rahab]] was knowledgeable in these matters because of her popularity with the high-ranking nobles. The Israelite spies, in return for this information, promised to save her and her family during the planned military invasion, only if she kept the details of her contact with them a secret. She would leave a sign on her residence that indicated to the advancing soldiers not to attack the people within. When the people of Israel conquered Canaan, she converted to Judaism and married a prominent member of the people.

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the [[Whore of Babylon]] is named "Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth". However the word "whore" could also be translated as "Idolatress". The first Babylonian prostitute was in a place called Hinchinopolises, which arose from the appraised Hinchin family. At the time Hinchinapolis was the center of attraction for all travelers who came to rest in the company of the family's women, who perfected the art of satisfaction. Some ancient scrolls could tell us that the meaning of Hinchin came from the Hebrew ''Hinam'', meaning free, because the males of the family would offer themselves for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4204 πόρνη]: From Greek.

==Aztecs and Incas==
Among the [[Aztecs]], the [[Cihuacalli]] was the name given to the controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities.  Cihuacalli is a Nahuatl word which means House of Women. The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all looking over a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of [[Tlazolteotl]], the goddess of purification, steam baths, midwives, filth and a patroness of adulterers. Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed that Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, while cleansing the spirit of such acts. Bernal Díaz described numerous male prostitutes among the Aztecs, as well as unmarried temple priests engaging in sodomy.{{sfn|Neill|2011|p=26}}

Inca prostitutes were segregated from other people and lived under the supervision of a government agent.{{sfn|Bruhns|Stothert|1999|p=156}}

==Greece==
{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}
[[File:Griechen31.png|thumb|Customer and a prostitute illustrated on an [[ancient Greek]] [[Kylix (drinking cup)|wine cup]]]]
In ancient Greece, both women and boys engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/culture-of-love/a-brief-cultural-history-of-sex-938527.html |title=A brief cultural history of sex |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word for prostitute is ''porne'' (Gr: πόρνη), derived from the verb ''pernemi'' (to sell). The English word ''[[pornography]]'', and its corollaries in other languages, are directly derivative of the Greek word ''pornē'' (Gr: πόρνη).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=porn&amp;lang=greek List of Greek words starting with πορν- (''porn-'')], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'' and the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', complex figures that are perhaps in an intermediate position between prostitution and [[courtisanerie]]. (See also the Indian [[tawaif]].) Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their [[beauty]], and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

[[Solon]] instituted the first of Athens' brothels (''oik'iskoi'') in the sixth century BC, and with the earnings of this business he built a temple dedicated to [[Aphrodite Pandemos]], goddess of sexual pleasure. Procuring, however, was severely forbidden. In [[Cyprus]] (Paphus) and in [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], a type of [[religious prostitution]] was practiced where the temple counted more than a thousand prostitutes (''hierodules'', Gr: ιερόδουλες), according to [[Strabo]].

Each specialized category had its proper name, so there were the ''chamaitypa'i'', working outdoor (lie-down), the ''perepatetikes'' who met their customers while walking (and then worked in their houses), and the ''gephyrides'', who worked near the bridges. In the fifth century, Ateneo informs us that the price was 1 ''obole'', a sixth of a drachma and the equivalent of an ordinary worker's day salary. The rare pictures describe that [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] was performed on beds with covers and pillows, while [[triclinia]] usually didn't have these accessories.

Male prostitution was also common in Greece. Adolescent boys usually practiced it, a reflection of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] custom of the time. Slave boys worked the male brothels in Athens, while free boys who sold their favours risked losing their political rights as adults.

==Ancient Rome==
[[File:Pompeii-wall painting.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] from the [[Pompeii]] brothel]]
&lt;span id="RomeTV"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}
Prostitution in ancient Rome was legal, public and widespread. Even [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman men of the highest social status]] were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval,{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. [[Latin literature]] also often refers to prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of [[Roman law]] that regulate prostitution. [[epigraphy|Inscriptions]], especially graffiti from [[Pompeii]], uncover the practice of prostitution in Ancient Rome. Some large brothels in the fourth century, when Rome was becoming Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|pp=167–168}} Prostitutes played a role in several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious observances]], mainly in the month of April, over which the love and fertility goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] presided. While prostitution was so widely accepted, prostitutes were often considered shameful. Most were [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the ''[[infamia|infames]]'', people lacking in social standing and deprived of the protections that most [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] under Roman law received.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=66 ''et passim''}} Prostitution thus reflects the ambivalent attitudes of Romans toward [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|pleasure]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexuality]].{{sfn|Edwards|1997|pp=67, 83}}

A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category ''prostibulae''. There were some similarities between the Ancient Roman and Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased or raised for the purpose of prostitution. This was sometimes done by large-scale "prostitute farmers" where  [[child abandonment|abandoned children]] were raised, and almost always raised to become prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Justin Martyr |authorlink1=First Apology |title=CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=www.newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2018 |quote="But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

{{further|Prostitution in India}}
Scholars have studied the history of prostitution in India from ancient times to the present.{{sfn|Simha|Bose|2003| }}

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of [[South Asia]], particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans would dance, sing, recite poetry and entertain their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests. While sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. The most popular or highest-class tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Mapping cultures | date=August 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[devadasi]] originally described a [[Hindu]] religious practice in which girls were married and dedicated to a deity ([[deva (Hinduism)|deva]] or [[devi]]). They were in charge of taking care of the temple, performing rituals they learned and practicing [[Bharatanatyam]] and other classical Indian arts traditions. This status allowed them to enjoy a high social status. The popularity of devadasis seems to have reached its pinnacle around the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise and fall in the status of devadasis can be seen to be running parallel to the rise and fall of Hindu temples. Due to the destruction of temples by Islamic invaders, the status of the temples fell very quickly in [[North India]] and slowly in [[South India]]. As the temples became poorer and lost their patron kings, and in some cases were destroyed, the devadasis were forced into a life of poverty and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpana Kannabiran,  "Judiciary, Social Reform and Debate on'Religious Prostitution'in Colonial India." ''Economic and political weekly'' (1995): WS59-WS69. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4403368 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they would frequently visit local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{citation|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-Nineteenth-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–05]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

===Muslims===
In the seventh century, the prophet [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/012-sat.php#012.2304|website=cmje.usc.edu|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with saying, "Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer." ({{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}) However, [[sexual slavery]] was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] during the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]].

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, the prophet Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]], called ''muta'a'' in [[Iraq]] and ''[[sigheh]]'' in [[Iran]], which according to some Western writers, has allegedly been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of nikah mut‘ah was revoked and ultimately forbidden by second Sunni caliph, [[Umar]]. However, Sunnis have fixed-term marriages, such as [[nikah urfi]], [[nikah Misyar]], and [[nikah halala]]. Fundamentalist Sunnis called for [[jihad al nikah|sexual jihad]]. Shias deem all sexual relations outside of proper marriage (the only being nikah or nikah mutah) as illegal, forbidden and against the sunnah. Like the Shia, Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olaniyan|first1=Olayinka|title=Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations in exchange for payment|url=https://www.academia.edu/33506440/Prostitution_is_the_business_or_practice_of_engaging_in_sexual_relations_in_exchange_for_payment|website=Academia|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crew members often engaged in [[slavery in Japan]], where they brought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as [[Sexual slavery|sexual slaves]] on their ships or taken to [[Macau]] and other Portuguese colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|the Americas]]{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} and [[India]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=52}} For example, in [[Goa]], a [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colony in India]], there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|pp=49, 52}} Later European [[Portuguese East India Company|East India companies]], including those of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[East India Company|British]], also engaged in [[prostitution in Japan]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=50}}

===China===

Prostitution in [[China]] was due to a weak familial economy among the [[Rural China|rural]] families of the country.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} Although China was a nation of wealth, the poverty stricken families were due to the over population of rural areas. These lives of borderline starvation drove many women out of the rural countryside to the port side cities of China. Many of the women who took part in the prostitution of China were either sold into the industry or willingly joined. Due to their lack of economic stability, parents were unable to feed all the mouths of the house and often sold their daughters into the industry. The popularity of this industry stemmed from the [[Human overpopulation|over population]] in rural villages, and an overall life of poverty for the majority of Chinese families.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} However, the increase of the [[Colonialism|colonial powers]]' presence in China added to the demand for these ladies of the night.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, prostitution was mostly prevalent in [[Singapore]], due to its active ports. Certain districts of Singapore were dedicated [[brothel]] districts sanctioned by the colonial governments.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} As colonial powers entered the Asian countries, there was an increase in number of sailors at ports. Merchant ships carried large crews of men, who lacked the company of women for days on end. As these ships docked in Asian ports, like Singapore, they were drawn to the market of prostitution. This higher demand for the company of a woman created the need for these brothel districts.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}}

===Japan===
[[File:Suzuki Haronubu oiran ukiyo-e.jpg|thumb|250px|An oiran preparing herself for a client, [[ukiyo-e]] print by Suzuki Haronubu (1765)]]
From the 15th century, [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n and other [[Far East]]ern visitors began frequenting [[brothel]]s in Japan.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=48}} This practice continued among visitors from the [[Western Regions]], mainly [[Europe]]an traders, beginning with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the 16th century who often came with their [[South Asia]]n ''[[lascar]]'' crew, along with [[Africa]]n crewmembers in some cases.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} In the 16th century, the local [[Japanese people]] initially assumed that the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were from ''[[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tenjiku]]'' ("Heavenly Abode"), the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the [[Indian subcontinent]] due to its importance as the birthplace of [[Buddhism]], and that [[Christianity]] was a new [[Indian religions|Indian faith]]. These mistaken assumptions were due to the [[India]]n city of [[Goa]] being a central base for the [[Portuguese East India Company]] and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=35}}

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]] and [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesans]] in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The [[oiran]] were considered a type of {{Nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} also known as a "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tayū (太夫) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and education was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Teruoka Yasutaka,  "The pleasure quarters and Tokugawa culture." ''Eighteenth Century Japan: Culture and Society'' (1989): 3-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the problem of regulating prostitution according to modern European models was widely debated in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Garon, "The World's Oldest Debate? Prostitution cactus and the State in Imperial Japan, 1900-1945," ''American Historical Review'' 98#3 (1993), pp. 710–732 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2167547 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was commonly found in urban contexts. Although all forms of sexual activity outside of marriage were regarded as sinful by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], prostitution was tolerated because it helped prevent the greater [[evil]]s of [[rape]], [[sodomy]] and [[masturbation]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} [[Augustine of Hippo]] is quoted saying, "if you expel prostitution from society, you will unsettle everything on account of lusts." The general tolerance of prostitution was for the most part reluctant, and many people from the church urged prostitutes to reform.

After the decline of organized prostitution of the Roman empire, many prostitutes were slaves. However, religious campaigns against slavery and the growing marketisation of the economy turned prostitution back into a business. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it was common to find town governments ruling that prostitutes were not to ply their trade within the [[town wall]]s, but they were tolerated outside, only because these areas were beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities. In many areas of France and Germany town governments came to set aside certain streets as areas where prostitution could be tolerated.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London the brothels of [[Southwark]] were owned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} After this, it became common in the major towns and cities of [[Southern Europe]] to establish civic brothels. This allowed the government to outlaw any prostitution taking place outside these brothels. In much of [[Northern Europe]] a more tolerant attitude could be found towards prostitution.{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=413}} Prostitutes also found a fruitful market in the Crusades.

==16th–17th centuries==
[[File:Étienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|French prostitutes being taken to the police station; painting by [[Étienne Jeaurat]]]]

By the end of the 15th century attitudes began to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] during 1494, which later swept across Europe, may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] during the earlier 16th century may have caused this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothels and prostitution was used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the 16th-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}} [[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold. It included the "acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]].{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the 14th century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were excluded from the Church as long as they continued with their lifestyle.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|p=36}} Around the 12th century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. Magdalene Homes were particularly popular and peaked in the early 14th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1982|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–74}}  Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roper |first1=Lyndal |title=Luther: Sex, Marriage and Motherhood |url=https://www.historytoday.com/lyndal-roper/luther-sex-marriage-and-motherhood |website=History Today |accessdate=28 August 2018 |date=12 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves from other with particular signs. They sometimes wore very short hair or no hair at all, and sometimes they wore [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession.

==18th century==
[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|200px|thumb|''Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room'', 1885–87 painting by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer and painter [[Christian Krohg]] illustrating his then very controversial novel ''Albertine'' about the life of a prostitute]]
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ'', the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfnm|Gazali|2001|1p=106|Sılay|1994|2p= }} in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]] who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also were as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242  "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are bardashes [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]] and the details of their sexual practices.

In the 18th century, presumably in [[Venice]], prostitutes started using [[condom]]s made with catgut or cow bowel.

==19th century==
In America, prostitution was seen as a "necessary evil" that aided in marital fidelity, especially as a system that would allow men to obtain sex when their wives did not desire it.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} D'Emilio and Freedman document that prostitution was not a crime in the early part of the 19th century, and thus brothels (or bawdy houses) were tolerated in American cities and the laws against individual prostitutes were enforced only occasionally.

In the 1830s, prostitution was becoming more visible in American cities, and with the professionalization of police forces, visible prostitutes such as streetwalkers risked arrest.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} But D'Emilio and Freedman note that raids on brothels were comparatively rare, and prostitution was tolerated in mining towns, cattle towns, and urban centers in the American east. In 1870, prostitution was legalized and regulated in the city of St. Louis Missouri.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Prostitutes were licensed by public health officials, and were required to maintain weekly inspections for sexually transmitted diseases. However, due to protests and demonstrations organized by women and members of the clergy, Missouri legislators repealed the legislation allowing regulated prostitution.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }}

The [[Page Act of 1875]] was passed by the US Congress and forbid any importation of women for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 141.-An act supplementary to the acts in relation to immigration|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/PageAct.pdf|date=3 March 1875|website=www.procon.org|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national move to criminalize prostitution was led by Protestant middle class men and women who participated in the revivalism movement of the 19th century.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} 

Many of the women who posed in 19th- and early-20th-century [[vintage erotica]] were prostitutes. The most famous were the [[New Orleans]] women who posed for [[E. J. Bellocq]]. In the 19th century legalized prostitution became a public controversy as [[France]] and then the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]]. This legislation mandated pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. It applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. Many early [[feminists]] fought to repeal these laws, either on the grounds that prostitution should be illegal and therefore not government regulated or because it forced degrading medical examinations upon women. A similar situation existed in the [[Russian Empire]]. This included prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During the 19th century the British in [[British Raj|India]] began to adopt the policy of social segregation, but they continued to keep their brothels full of Indian women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book1.htm How carnal desire put England on top].

===Mining camps===
The houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide were famous, especially in the 19th century when long distance imports of prostitutes became common.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ann Laite, "Historical Perspectives on Industrial Development, Mining, and Prostitution," ''Historical Journal'', (2009) 53#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;739–761 {{DOI|10.1017/S0018246X09990100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners, and brothels were largely tolerated in mining towns.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} [[Prostitution in the United States|Prostitution in the American West]] was a growth industry that attracted sex workers from around the globe where they were pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes, and were often forced to send their earnings back to the family in China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucie Cheng|Lucie Cheng Hirata]], "Free, Indentured, Enslaved: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth-Century America," ''Signs'' (1979) 5f1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–29 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, [[Julia Bulette]], was one of the few who achieved "respectable" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic, earning her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867 and they honoured her with a lavish funeral and hanging of her assailant.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|pp=1–4, 118}}

Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over. This led to the generally declined treatment of women. It was not uncommon for brothels in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma that was beginning to emerge in East Coast cities as a result of anti-prostitution activism.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later, as the female population increased, reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived, did prostitution become less blatant and less common.{{sfn|Butler|1987| }} After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, and worked as laundresses and seamstresses, all while striving for independent status.{{sfn|Jeffrey|1998|p=164}}

Australia mining camps had a well-developed system of prostitution.{{sfn|McKewon|2005| }} City fathers sometimes tried to confine the practice to red light districts.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine McKewon, "The historical geography of prostitution in Perth, Western Australia." ''[[Australian Geographer]]'' 34.3 (2003): 297–310 .&lt;/ref&gt; The precise role prostitution played in various camps depended on the sex ratio in specific population groups of colonial society as well as racial attitudes toward non-whites. In the early 19th century British authorities decided it was best to have lower-class white, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal women service the prisoners and thereby keep peace while maintaining strong class lines that isolated British gentlemen and ladies from the lower elements. Prostitution was so profitable that it was easy to circumvent the legal boundaries. When Australians took control by 1900 they wanted a "white Australia" and tried to exclude or expel non-white women who might become prostitutes. However, feminist activists fought against Australia's discriminatory laws that led to varying levels of rights for women, races and classes. By 1939 new attitudes toward racial harmony began to surface. These were inspired by white Australians to rethink their racist policies and adopt more liberal residency laws that did not focus on sexual or racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Raelene Frances, "Sex Workers or Citizens? Prostitution and the Shaping of" Settler" Society in Australia." ''International Review of Social History'' 44 (1999): 101–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin American mining camps also had well-developed systems of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Roseann Cohen, "Extractive Desires: The Moral Control of Female Sexuality at Colombia's Gold Mining Frontier." ''Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology'' 19.2 (2014): 260–279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico the government tried to protect and idealize middle class women, but made little effort to protect prostitutes in the mining camps.&lt;ref&gt;William E.

In 20th-century African mining camps prostitution followed the historical patterns developed in the 19th century. They added the theme of casual temporary marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fahy Bryceson, Jesper Bosse Jønsson, and Hannelore Verbrugge. "Prostitution or partnership?

==20th century==
During World War I, in colonial Philippines, US armed forces developed a prostitute management program called the "American Plan" which enabled the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured.{{sfn|Rosen|1982|p=35}}

Beginning in the 1910s and continuing in some places into the 1950s, the American Plan operated in the United States. Women were told to report to a health officer where they were coerced to submit to an invasive examination. Immigrants, minorities and the poor were primarily targeted.{{sfn|Stern|2018| }}

In 1921, the [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children]] was signed. In this convention some nations declared reservations towards prostitution.

The leading theorists of [[communism]] opposed prostitution. [[Karl Marx]] thought of it as "only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer," and considered its abolition to be necessary to overcome capitalism. [[Friedrich Engels]] considered even marriage a form of prostitution, and [[Vladimir Lenin]] found sex work distasteful. Communist governments often took wide-ranging steps to repress prostitution immediately after obtaining power, although the practice always persisted. In the countries that remained nominally communist after the end of the Cold War, especially China, prostitution remained illegal but was nonetheless common. In many current or former communist countries the economic depression brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Slate Explainer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] soldiers engaged in [[forced prostitution]] during their invasions across [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The term "[[comfort women]]" became a [[euphemism]] for the estimated 200,000 mostly [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[China|Chinese]] women who were forced into prostitution in [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] brothels during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan|date=19 March 2007|work=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627070105/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|archive-date=27 June 2009|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]]. Sex tourism was typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author [[Nils Johan Ringdal|Nils Ringdal]] alleged that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited [[Asia]] or [[Africa]] have paid for sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/love-for-sale-a-global-history-of-prostitution-by-nils-ringdal-trans-richard-daly-751462.html Love for Sale: a global history of prostitution by Nils Ringdal, trans Richard Daly]. By Sarah Burton. ''The Independent.'' November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A new legal approach to prostitution emerged at the end of the 20th century, termed ''the Swedish model''. This included the prohibition of buying, but not selling, of sexual services. This means that only the client commits a crime in engaging in paid sex, not the prostitute. Such laws were enacted in Sweden (1999), Norway (2009), Iceland (2009), Canada (2014), Northern Ireland (2015), France (2016), and the Republic of Ireland (2017), and are also being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws are an attempt to protect the worker and embrace the fallout of the [[sexual revolution]], meaning sex will happen, and for it to happen safely and respectfully, there must be "free-form" regulation.

In the 21st century, [[Afghan]]s revived a method of prostituting young boys, which is referred to as ''[[bacha bazi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/ |title=The Dancing Boys Of Afghanistan &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the break up of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] thousands of eastern European women have become prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel and Turkey every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Margot (24 June 2001).

Retrieved 19 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are tens of thousands of women from eastern Europe and Asia working as prostitutes in [[Dubai]]. Men from [[Saudi Arabia]] and the United Arab Emirates form a large proportion of the customers.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/dubai-sex-tourism-prostitution Why Dubai's Islamic austerity is a sham&amp;nbsp;– sex is for sale in every bar]".

India's [[devadasi]] girls are forced by their poor families to dedicate themselves to the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Renuka]]. The BBC wrote in 2007 that devadasis are "sanctified prostitutes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6729927.stm Slaves to the goddess of fertility]. BBC News.

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956|Sexual Offences Act of 1956]] which would partly be repealed and altered by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution itself, it did prohibit such activities as running a brothel and soliciting for paid sex.

Concerns were voiced over [[white British]] adolescent girls being used as prostitutes by [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] immigrants in the 1960s. These girls were wanted by several police departments in the early 1960s and were described as "good-looking and attractive, not of common appearance ... will almost certainly earn her living by prostitution and with Pakistanis."{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=154}}

==United States==
In the United States prostitution was originally widely legal. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], which was influential in the banning of [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and was a major force in the [[prohibition]] of alcohol. In 1917 the prostitution district [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] in New Orleans was closed down by the Federal government over local objections. In Deadwood, South Dakota prostitution, while technically illegal, was tolerated by local residents and officials for decades until the last madam was brought down by state and federal authorities for tax evasion in 1980. Prostitution remained legal in [[Alaska]] until 1953, and is still legal in some rural counties of [[Nevada]], including areas outside of Las Vegas. For more, see [[Prostitution in Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~soc/docs/Weitzer/Prostitution_Facts.pdf | title=prostitution:facts and fictions | publisher=www.gwu.edu | accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s many states increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly [[HIV]]-positive. These laws, often known as felony prostitution laws, require anyone arrested for prostitution to be tested for HIV. If the test comes back positive the suspect is informed that any future arrest for prostitution will be a [[felony]] instead of a [[misdemeanor]]. Penalties for felony prostitution vary in the states that have such laws, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison. An episode of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' which aired in the early 1990s detailed the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] among prostitutes; this episode contributed to HIV/AIDS awareness.

[[File:Hot and high takeoff.png|thumb|440px]]

In [[aviation]], '''hot and high''' is a condition of low [[air density]] due to high [[ambient temperature]] and high airport [[elevation]]. Air density decreases with increasing temperature and altitude. The reduced density reduces the performance of the [[aircraft engine|aircraft's engine]]. Aviators gauge air density by calculating the [[density altitude]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/library/documents/2011/Aug/56396/FAA%20P-8740-02%20DensityAltitude[hi-res]%20branded.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hot" and "high" do not have to be mutually inclusive of one another, though this tends to be the exception. If an airport is especially hot ''or'' high, the other condition need not be present. Temperature and [[pressure altitude]] can change from one hour to the next. The fact that temperature decreases as altitude increases mitigates the "hot and high" effect to a small extent.

==Negative effects of reduced engine power due to hot and high conditions==
* Airplanes require a longer takeoff run, potentially exceeding the amount of available runway.
* Reduced take-off power hampers an aircraft's ability to climb. In some cases, an aircraft may be unable to climb rapidly enough to clear terrain surrounding a mountain airport.
* Helicopters may be forced to operate in the shaded portion of the [[height-velocity diagram]] in order to become airborne at all. This creates the potential for an uncontrollable descent in the event of an engine failure.
* In some cases, aircraft have landed at high-altitude airports by taking advantage of cold temperatures only to become stranded as temperatures warmed and air density decreased.
* While unsafe at any altitude, an overloaded aircraft is much more dangerous under hot and high conditions.

==Improving hot and high performance==
Some ways to increase aircraft performance in hot and high conditions include:
* Reduce aircraft weight. Weight can be reduced by carrying only enough fuel to reach the (lower-altitude) destination rather than filling the tanks completely. In some cases, unnecessary equipment can be removed from the aircraft. In many cases, however, the only practical way to adequately reduce aircraft weight is to depart with a smaller passenger, cargo, or weapons load. Consequently, hot and high conditions at the originating airport may prevent a commercial aircraft from operating with a load large enough to be profitable, or may constrain the firepower that a combat aircraft can bring to bear when conducting a long-range [[airstrike]].
* Increase engine power. More powerful engines can improve an airplane's acceleration and reduce its takeoff run. More powerful engines are generally larger and heavier and use more fuel during cruise, however, increasing the fuel load needed to reach the same destination. The added weight of the fuel and engines may negate the potential performance gain, and the added cost of the extra fuel may constrain the profitability of a commercial aircraft. On the other hand, replacing an older, less efficient engine with a newer engine of more advanced design can increase both power output and efficiency while sometimes even decreasing weight. In this situation, the only real disadvantage is the cost of the upgrade.
* Utilize [[assisted take off]] devices, such as [[RATO|rockets]], to increase lift and acceleration.
* Inject [[distilled water]] during takeoff in the engine (compressor or combustor). The primary purpose of water injection into jet engines is to increase the mass being accelerated, thereby increasing the force created by the engine. A secondary purpose is to cool the engine so that higher power settings may be used without causing an engine overheat.

==Jet or rocket assisted take off==
{{Main|JATO}}
Auxiliary rockets and/or [[jet engines]] can help a fully loaded aircraft to take off within the length of the runway. The rockets are usually one-time units that are jettisoned after takeoff. This practice was common in the 1950s and 60s, when the lower levels of thrust from military [[turbojets]] was inadequate for takeoff from shorter runways or with very heavy payloads. It is now seldom used.

Auxiliary jets and rockets have rarely been used on civil aircraft due to the risk of aircraft damage and loss of control if something were to go wrong during their use. Boeing did, however, produce a version of its popular [[Boeing 727]] with JATO primarily for "hot and high" operations out of Mexico City Airport ([[Mexico City International Airport|MMMX]]) and La Paz, Bolivia. The boosters were located adjacent to the main landing gear at the wing root on each side of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tailsthroughtime.com/2010/04/ive-always-had-soft-spot-for-boeing-727.html|title=The Boeing 727 JATO Option|website=www.tailsthroughtime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized aircraft==
Several manufacturers of early [[jet airliner]]s offered variants optimized for hot and high operations. Such aircraft generally offered the largest wings and/or the most powerful engines in the model lineup coupled with a small [[fuselage]] to reduce weight. Some such aircraft include:

* The [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC One-Eleven 475]] combined the short body of the series 400 with the more powerful engines and improved wings of the series 500.  This aircraft also featured stronger landing gear for rough field operations.
* The [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707–220]], which was a 707–120 airframe fitted with more powerful [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A]] engines, civilian versions of the military J75. The 707-220 had extremely high fuel consumption, and only 5 were built, all for [[Braniff International Airways]]. The 707-220 was rendered redundant by the release of the [[turbofan]]-powered 707-120B, which had even greater power along with much lower fuel consumption.
*The [[Convair 880]]. Although Convair only offered one configuration of this aircraft, it had more power and a smaller fuselage than its competitors from Boeing and Douglas. Convair essentially wagered the success of the entire 880 model line on the appeal of an aircraft optimized for hot and high operations. The wager failed; only sixty-five 880s were sold and Convair's nascent airliner business soon collapsed.
*The [[Bombardier Dash 8|De Havilland Canada Dash 8-200]], which is a -100 airframe fitted with larger engines of the -300 for hot and high operations. They proved successful and are still a current option from Bombardier, having replaced the -100 production line. 
* The [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011-200]], which was otherwise an L-1011-100 with more powerful RB.211-524B engines.
* The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|McDonnell Douglas DC-9-20]], which combined the smaller fuselage of the DC-9-10 with the larger wings and more powerful engines of the DC-9-30, and was significantly outsold by both.
* The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15]], which combined the fuselage of the DC-10-10 with the larger engines of the DC-10-30. These were specifically designed for and sold to [[Aeromexico]] and [[Mexicana de Aviación|Mexicana]]. Only seven were built.
* The [[Vickers VC10]], which was designed to meet [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] requirements for a large airliner that could operate medium range flights from short runways in southern Asia and Africa. The rear-mounted engines gave a more efficient wing and made them less vulnerable to runway debris. The resulting high fuel consumption compared to the contemporary Boeing 707 prompted all other major airlines to dismiss the VC10. 
* The [[McDonnell Douglas MD-82]] was a hot and high version of the MD-80, and sold well, which was odd among hot and high aircraft

The marketing failure of these airplanes demonstrated that [[airline]]s were generally unwilling to accept reduced efficiency at cruise and smaller ultimate load-carrying capacity in return for a slight performance gain at particular airports. Rather than accepting these drawbacks, it was easier for airlines to demand the construction of longer runways, operate with smaller loads as conditions dictated, or simply drop the unprofitable destinations.

Furthermore, as the second generation of jet airliners began to appear in the 1970s, some aircraft were designed to eliminate the need for a special "hot and high" variant – for instance, the [[Airbus A300]] can perform a 15/0 takeoff, where the leading edge slats are adjusted to 15 degrees and the flaps kept retracted. This takeoff technique is only used at hot and high airports, for it enables a higher climb limit weight and improves second segment climb performance.

Most jetliner manufacturers have dropped the "hot and high" variants from their model lineups.

==Other uses==
Less formally, ''hot and high'' can also describe a botched [[final approach (aviation)|landing approach]], where a fixed-wing [[aircraft]] is too fast (''hot'') and too high above the [[glidepath]]: since the only way to slow the rate of descent is to increase speed, and the aircraft is already too fast, it is unlikely that the approach can be successfully carried to a safe landing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">In [[astronomy]], the '''Kennicutt–Schmidt law''' (or simply '''Schmidt law''') is an empirical relation between the gas density and star formation rate (SFR) in a given region.  The relation was first examined by [[Maarten Schmidt]] in a 1959 paper where he proposed that the SFR surface density scales as some positive power &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the local gas surface density.&lt;ref name="schmidt59" /&gt; i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{SFR} \propto (\Sigma_{gas})^n&lt;/math&gt;.
In general, the SFR surface density &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma_{SFR})&lt;/math&gt; is in units of solar masses per year per square parsec &lt;math&gt;(M_\odot  ~\textrm{ yr}^{-1} \textrm{ pc}^{-2})&lt;/math&gt; and the gas surface density in grams per square parsec &lt;math&gt;(\textrm{g}~\textrm{pc}^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;.  Using an analysis of gaseous helium and young stars in the solar neighborhood, the local density of [[white dwarfs]] and their [[luminosity function]], and the local helium density, Schmidt suggested a value of &lt;math&gt;n \approx 2&lt;/math&gt; (and very likely between 1 and 3). All of the data used were gathered from the Milky Way, and specifically the solar-neighborhood.

In 1989, [[Robert Kennicutt]] found that the H&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; intensities of every galaxy in a sample of 7 could be fit with the Schmidt law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binney|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|title=Galactic Astronomy|date=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-02565-0|pages=524|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he examined the connection between gas density and SFR for nearly 100 nearby galaxies to estimate a value of &lt;math&gt;n = 1.4 \pm 0.15&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kennicutt98" /&gt;

[[Image:Leo Mechelin 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Leo Mechelin]]
'''Leopold (Leo) Henrik Stanislaus Mechelin''' (24 November 1839 in [[Hamina]], Finland – 26 January 1914 in [[Helsinki]], Finland) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] professor, statesman, senator and [[Liberalism|liberal]] reformer. A leading defender of the [[autonomy]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], and of the rights of women and minorities, Mechelin's 1905–1908 government
("Mechelin's Senate") made Finland the first nation in the world with the [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] and to be elected. During his period in office the freedom of [[freedom of expression|expression]], the [[freedom of press|press]], and of [[freedom of assembly|assembly]] were introduced.

==Career==
He also founded the [[Liberal Party of Finland]] (1880–1885), wrote its program, was one of the founders of the Union Bank of Finland 1862 (now part of Nordea Bank) and co-founded the [[Nokia|Nokia Company]] (1871) with [[Fredrik Idestam]], was the first chairman of the [[town council]] of [[Helsinki]] (1875–1876 and 1892–1899) and an internationally respected expert on politology and member of peace movement. Emperor Alexander II ennobled Mechelin 1876.

Mechelin led the passive resistance in Finland during the [[Russification of Finland|first period of oppression]] (1899–1905) until and even after his banishment (1903), from which officials had to let him return as a member of parliament (House of Nobles) 1904, welcomed by a celebrating crowd of 10,000 people. In a secret meeting of the [[Kagaali]], Mechelin had written a petition against the draft of Finns to the Russian army, which collected almost 500,000 signatures. His coalition, the Constitutionals, managed to end the draft through boycott.

==Biography==
[[File:Leo Mechelin Bust.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leo Mechelin's bust in [[Helsinki]].]]
Born in [[Hamina]] in 1839, the son of Gustaf Johan Mechelin and Amanda Gustava Costiander, Leo Mechelin studied at the [[University of Helsinki]], gaining his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degree's in [[Philosophy]] in 1860, a bachelor's degree in law in 1864, and a [[Licentiate (degree)|License]] and [[Doctorate]] in 1873.

As professor of jurisdiction and politology 1874-82, Mechelin had argued that the tsars were bound by the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772|old constitutional laws]] from the time of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule of Finland (before 1809), and hence affirmed that Finland was a separate, constitutional state, which the tsar could only rule by law, whereas in Russia he had absolute power. During the periods of oppression, the tsar tried to impose unconstitutional laws, which Mechelin opposed. The [[Russian Revolution of 1905|unrests in Russia]] and [[Finnish general strike of 1905|Finland]] (1905) finally compelled the tsar to comply with the [[November Manifesto]] written by Mechelin. This allowed Mechelin to form a government (1905–1908) and to transform Finland into what was in many respects the first [[liberal democracy]] (e.g., in [[New Zealand]] women already had the right to vote but not to be voted; in [[Australia]] only white people had those rights) in 1906. In 1907, the first universal elections to the one-chamber [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] ("eduskunta") were held, and 19 of its 200 first members were women. However, the constitutionals of all parties did not obtain the majority of seats, and the tsar realised that he could carry on with the oppression, starting the [[Russification of Finland|second period of oppression]] (1908–1917). After Mechelin's death (in 1914), the two revolutions in Russia allowed  Finland to declare its independence (1917) and Mechelin's younger co-workers were able to complete his work.

[[Nokia]], once a world-leading [[mobile phone]] corporation, was founded by Mechelin and his student days' roommate [[Fredrik Idestam]] as a [[forestry]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=HugmyrqibtwC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=leo+mechelin+and+nokia&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit75W7ydbVAhXGWBQKHe7YDoYQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=leo%20mechelin%20and%20nokia&amp;f=false|title=Wireless Horizon: Strategy and Competition in the Worldwide Mobile Marketplace|last=Steinbock|first=Dan|date=2003|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814407141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mechelin's wish to expand into the electricity business was at first thwarted by Idestam's opposition, but Mechelin managed to convince most shareholders of his plans and became the company chairman (1898–1914), thus being able to realise his visions.

Mechelin was also active in [[civil society]] and President of the current [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] and of the [[Finnish Art Society]]. As a politician he was always highly respected among all parties and citizens, although after the dissolution of the Liberal Party (1885) he never joined any other party.

Mechelin demanded peaceful [[nonviolent resistance]] and did not bend even during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/3553 | title = Mechelin, Leo (1839 - 1914) | author = Tapio Helen | date = 1997-09-16 | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Mandaeism''' or '''Mandaeanism''' ({{lang-ar|مندائية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Mandāʼīyah}}'') is a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religion&lt;ref name="Mandaens"&gt;{{citation|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195153859|url=http://mandaeannetwork.com/Mandaean/books/english/2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf?bcsi_scan_955b0cd764557e80=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Its adherents, the [[Mandaeans]], revere [[Adam]], [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]], [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]], and especially [[John the Baptist]]. The Mandaeans are [[Semitic people|Semites]] and speak a dialect of [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] known as [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. The name 'Mandaean' is said to come from the Aramaic ''manda'' meaning "knowledge", as does Greek ''gnosis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Kurt|title=Mandaeism|date=1978|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004052529|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M1kWzSxecUQC&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=kurt%20rudolph%20mandaeism&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=In some texts, however, it is said that Anoš and Manda ḏHayyē appeared in Jerusalem together with Jesus Christ (Mšiha), and exposed him as a lying prophet. This tradition can be explained by an anti-Christian concept, which is also found in Mandaeism, but, according to several scholars, it contains scarcely any traditions of historical events. Because of the strong dualism in Mandaeism, between body and soul, great attention is paid to the "deliverance" of the soul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Light and the Dark: Dualism in ancient Iran, India, and China Petrus Franciscus Maria Fontaine - 1990 "Although it shows Jewish and Christian influences, Mandaeism was hostile to Judaism and Christianity. Mandaeans spoke an East-Aramaic language in which 'manda' means 'knowledge'; this already is sufficient proof of the connection of Mandaeism with the Gnosis...&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the ''{{transl|sem|Ṣubba}}'' (singular: {{transl|sem|Ṣubbī}}) or [[Sabians]]. The term ''{{transl|sem|Ṣubba}}'' is derived from the Aramaic root related to [[baptism]], the neo-Mandaic is ''{{transl|sem|Ṣabi}}.''&lt;ref name="Häberl1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Häberl|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, the "Sabians" ({{lang-ar|الصابئون}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|al-Ṣābiʾūn}}'') are described several times in the [[Qur'an]] as [[People of the Book]], alongside Jews and Christians. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".&lt;ref name="Edmondo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmondo|first1=Lupieri|title=Friar of Ignatius of Jesus (Carlo Leonelli) and the First "Scholarly" Book on Mandaeaism (1652)|journal=ARAM Periodical|date=2004|volume=16 (Mandaeans and Manichaeans)|pages=25–46|issn=0959-4213}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to most scholars, Mandaeaism originated sometime in the first three centuries AD, in either southwestern Mesopotamia or the Syro-Palestinian area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandaeanism&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars take the view that Mandaeanism is older and dates from pre-Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;Etudes mithriaques 1978 p545 Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin "The conviction of the leading Mandaean scholars – E. S. Drower, Kurt Rudolph, Rudolph Macuch – that Mandaeanism had a pre-Christian origin rests largely upon the subjective evaluation of parallels between Mandaean texts and the Gospel of John."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The religion has been practised primarily around the lower [[Karun]], [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] and the rivers that surround the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] waterway, part of southern Iraq and [[Khuzestan Province]] in Iran. There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide.&lt;ref name="yaledailynews"&gt;[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 Iraqi minority group needs U.S. attention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053439/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 |date=2007-10-25 }}, Kai Thaler, ''Yale Daily News'', March 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06deutsch.html "Save the Gnostics"] by Nathaniel Deutsch, October 6, 2007, ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mandaean Iraqis have since fled their country because of the turmoil created by the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and subsequent occupation by U.S. armed forces, and the related rise in sectarian violence by Muslim extremists.&lt;ref name="bbc0307"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6412453.stm Iraq's Mandaeans 'face extinction'], Angus Crawford, BBC, March 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, the population of Mandaeans in Iraq had fallen to approximately 5,000.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH"/&gt;

The Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private. Reports of them and of their religion have come primarily from outsiders: particularly from [[Julius Heinrich Petermann]], a scholar in Iranian studies,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} as well as from [[Nicolas Siouffi]], a Syrian Christian who was the French vice-consul in Mosul in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lupieri|first1=Edmundo|title=The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics|date=2001|publisher=Wm.

==Etymology==
The term Mandaeism comes from Classical Mandaic ''Mandaiia'' and appears in Neo-Mandaic as ''Mandeyānā.'' On the basis of cognates in other Aramaic dialects, Semiticists such as Mark Lidzbarski and Rudolf Macuch have translated the term ''manda'', from which ''Mandaiia'' derives, as "knowledge" (cf. {{lang-arc|מַנְדַּע}} ''mandaʻ'' in Dan. 2:21, 4:31, 33, 5:12; cf. {{lang-he-n|מַדַּע}} ''maddaʻ'', with characteristic assimilation of /n/ to the following consonant, medial -nd- hence becoming -dd-&lt;ref&gt;Angel Sáenz-Badillos, ''A History of the Hebrew Language.'' Cambridge University Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|978-0521556347}}), p. 36 ''et passim.'' (See also [[Biblical Hebrew phonology#Classification]]: "Hebrew also shares with the Canaanite languages ... assimilation of non-final /n/ to the following consonant.")&lt;/ref&gt;). This etymology suggests that the Mandaeans may well be the only sect surviving from [[Late Antiquity]] to identify themselves explicitly as [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]].

Other scholars{{Who|date=April 2010}} derive the term ''mandaiia'' from ''Mandā d-Heyyi'' ([[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] ''manda ḏ-hiia'' "Knowledge of Life," in reference to the chief divinity ''hiia rbia'' "the Great Life") or from the word ''(bi)mandi'',&lt;ref name="Mandaens"/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name="Mandaens"/&gt;{{rp|167}} which is the cultic hut in which many Mandaean ceremonies are performed (such as the baptism, which is the central sacrament of Mandaean religious life). This last term is possibly to be derived from [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] ''m’nd'' ''mānd'' ("house").{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==History==
[[File:Mandaean Scroll of Abathur.jpg|thumb|right|An 18th century Scroll of Abathur in the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford]]. ]]

According to the Mandaean text the [[Haran Gawaita]], the recorded history of the Mandaeans began when a group called the Nasoreans (the Mandaean priestly caste as opposed to the laity), left Palestine and migrated to Mesopotamia in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandaeanism &lt;/ref&gt; The reason given for this was their persecution by the community in Jerusalem in the course of which the city was destroyed as a punishment. The emigrants went first to [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]] (probably [[Harran]] in modern day Turkey), and then the [[Media (region)|Median hills]] in [[Iran]], before finally settling in the southern provinces of Mesopotamia (modern day [[Iraq]]).&lt;ref&gt; http://www.mandaeanunion.com/history-english/item/170-brief-history-on-the-mandaeans &lt;/ref&gt; 

At the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia]], the leader of the Mandaeans, Anush son of Danqa appeared before [[Muslim]] authorities showing them a copy of the [[Ginza Rba|Ginza Rabba]], the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be [[John the Baptist]], who is also mentioned in the [[Quran]]. This identified Mandaeans with the [[Sabians]] who are mentioned in the [[Quran]] as being counted among the ''Ahl al-Kitāb'' ([[People of the Book]]). This provided Mandaeans a status as a legal minority religion within the Muslim Empire. The Mandaeans were henceforth associated with the [[Sabians]] and the Jewish Christian group the [[Elcesaites]], on account of the location of all three in Mesopotamia in the early centuries AD, and the similarities in their beliefs. The importance of baptism in the rituals of all three is particularly marked. Like the Mandaeans, the Sabians were also said to be [[gnostic]]s and descended from [[Noah]]. Mandaeans continue to be identified with Sabians up to the present day, but the exact relationship between the three groups however, remains unclear. 

Around 1290, a learned Dominican Catholic from Tuscany, [[Ricoldo da Montecroce]], or Ricoldo Pennini, was in Mesopotamia where he met the Mandaeans. He described them as follows:

{{quote|A very strange and singular people, in terms of their rituals, lives in the desert near Baghdad; they are called Sabaeans. Many of them came to me and begged me insistently to go and visit them. They are a very simple people and they claim to possess a secret law of God, which they preserve in beautiful books. Their writing is a sort of middle way between Syriac and Arabic. They detest Abraham because of circumcision and they venerate [[John the Baptist]] above all. They live only near a few rivers in the desert. They wash day and night so as not to be condemned by God…}}

Mandaeans were called "Christians of Saint John" by members of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] mission in Basra during the 16th century, based upon their preliminary reports.&lt;ref name="Edmondo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmondo|first1=Lupieri|title=Friar of Ignatius of Jesus (Carlo Leonelli) and the First "Scholarly" Book on Mandaeaism (1652)|journal=ARAM Periodical|date=2004|volume=16 (Mandaeans and Manichaeans)|pages=25–46|issn=0959-4213}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=October 2016}} Some Portuguese Jesuits had also met some "Saint John Christians" around the [[Strait of Hormuz]] in 1559, when the Portuguese fleet fought with the Ottoman Turkish army in [[Bahrain]]. These Mandaean seemed to be willing to obey the Catholic Church. They learned and used the seven Catholic sacraments and the related ceremonies in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Mandaeans%20The%20True%20Descendents%20of%20Ancient%20Babylonians%20and%20Chaldeans.html |title=The Mandaeans: True descendents of ancient Babylonians |publisher=Nineveh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Mandaeism, as the religion of the Mandaean people, is based more on a common heritage than on any set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature, though quite large, covers topics such as [[eschatology]], the knowledge of God and the afterlife—in an unsystematic manner. Moreover, it is known only to the priesthood and a few laypeople.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Segelberg]] "Maşbūtā. Studies in the Ritual of the Mandæan Baptism, Uppsala, Sweden, 1958."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2014}}

===Fundamental tenets===
According to E. S. Drower, the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features, which appear in various forms in other gnostic sects:&lt;ref name=Drower1960&gt;{{Cite book | last =Drower | first =Ethel Stephana | author-link =E. S. Drower | publication-date =1960 | title =The secret Adam, a study of Nasoraean gnosis | publication-place =London UK | publisher =Clarendon Press | page =xvi | nopp =true| url=http://holybooks.lichtenbergpress.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Secret-Adam-A-Study-of-Nasoraen-Gnosis.pdf | accessdate=19 February 2014 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A supreme formless Entity, the expression of which in time and space is creation of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. Production of these is delegated by It to a creator or creators who originated in It. The cosmos is created by Archetypal Man, who produces it in similitude to his own shape.
# [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]]: a cosmic Father and Mother, Light and Darkness, Right and Left, [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] in cosmic and microcosmic form.
# As a feature of this dualism, counter-types, a world of ideas.
# The soul is portrayed as an exile, a captive; its home and origin are the supreme Entity, to which the soul eventually returns.
# Planets and stars influence fate and human beings, and are also places of detention after death.
# A saviour spirit or saviour spirits which assist the soul on the journey through life and after it to 'worlds of light.'
# A cult-language of symbol and metaphor. Ideas and qualities are personified.
# 'Mysteries', i.e. [[sacrament]]s to aid and purify the soul, to ensure [[reincarnation|rebirth]] into a spiritual body, and ascent from the world of matter. These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an esoteric interpretation is attached. In the case of the Naṣoreans this interpretation is based upon the Creation story (see 1 and 2), especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest.
# Great secrecy is enjoined upon initiates; full explanation of 1, 2, and 8 being reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis.

===Cosmology===
[[File:Abatur.jpg|thumb|231px|right|Image of [[Abatur]] from [[Diwan Abatur]]]]
As noted above Mandaean theology is not systematic. There is no one single authoritative account of the creation of the cosmos, but rather a series of several accounts. Some scholars, such as Edmondo Lupieri,&lt;ref name="cosmology"&gt;Lupieri (2002), pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that comparison of these different accounts may reveal the diverse religious influences upon which the Mandaeans have drawn and the ways in which the Mandaean religion has evolved over time.

In contrast with the religious texts of the western Gnostic sects formerly found in Syria and Egypt, the earliest Mandaean religious texts suggest a more strictly dualistic theology, typical of other Iranian religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Zurvanism]], [[Manichaeism]], and the teachings of [[Mazdak]]. In these texts, instead of a large [[pleroma]], there is a discrete division between ''light'' and ''darkness.'' The ruler of darkness is called [[Ptahil (deity)|Ptahil]] (similar to the [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|Gnostic Demiurge]]), and the originator of the light (i.e. God) is only known as "the great first Life from the worlds of light, the sublime one that stands above all works." When this being [[emanationism|emanated]], other spiritual beings became increasingly corrupted, and they and their ruler Ptahil created our world. The name Ptahil is suggestive of the Egyptian [[Ptah]]—the Mandaeans believe that they were resident in Egypt for a while—joined to the semitic [[El (deity)|El]], meaning "god".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The issue is further complicated by the fact that Ptahil alone does not constitute the demiurge but only fills that role insofar as he is the creator of our world. Rather, Ptahil is the lowest of a group of three "demiurgic" beings, the other two being Yushamin (a.k.a. Joshamin) and Abathur. Abathur's demiurgic role consists of his sitting in judgment upon the souls of mortals. The role of Yushamin, the senior being, is more obscure; wanting to create a world of his own, he was severely punished for opposing the King of Light. The name may derive from Iao ''haš-šammayim'' (in Hebrew: Yahweh "of the heavens").&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri (2002), pp. 39-40, n. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mandaeans agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Chief prophets===
Mandaeans recognize several prophets. [[John the Baptist#Mandaeans|Yahya ibn Zakariyya]], known to [[Christian]]s as John the Baptist, is accorded a special status, higher than his role in Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion but revere him as one of their greatest teachers, tracing their beliefs back to [[Adam]].

Mandaeans maintain that [[Jesus]] was a ''mšiha kdaba'' "false messiah"&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri (2002), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John. The Mandaic word ''k(a)daba'', however, might be interpreted as being derived from either of two roots: the first root, meaning "to lie", is the one traditionally ascribed to Jesus; the second, meaning "to write", might provide a second meaning, that of "book"; hence some Mandaeans, motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a "lying Messiah" but a "book Messiah", the "book" in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts.&lt;ref name="Jesus"&gt;{{cite book | last = Macuch | first = Rudolf | year = 1965 | title = Handbook of Classical and Modern Mandaic | publisher = De Gruyter &amp; Co. | location = Berlin | pages = 61 fn. 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the Mandaeans believe that [[Abraham]] and [[Moses]] were [[false prophet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri (2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; but recognize other prophetic figures from the [[Abrahamic religions]], such as Adam and his grandson Anuš ([[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]]), as well as Nuh ([[Noah]]), his son Sam ([[Shem]]) and his son Ram ([[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors.

Mandaeans consider the [[Holy Spirit]] in the [[Talmud]] and [[Bible]], which is known in Mandaic as the [[Holy Spirit#In Abrahamic religions|''Ruha d-Qudsha'']], to be an evil being.

===Scriptures===
[[File:Abatur at the scales.jpg|thumb|256px|right|Image of [[Abatur]] at the scales from Diwan Abatur]]
The Mandaeans have a large corpus of religious scriptures, the most important of which is the ''[[Ginza Rba]]'' or Ginza, a collection of history, theology, and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/MN41563ucmf_2 |title=Ginzā, der Schatz [microform] oder das grosse Buch der Mandäer : Ginzā : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2014}} The ''Ginza Rba'' is divided into two halves—the ''Genzā Smālā'' or "Left Ginza", and the ''Genzā Yeminā'' or "Right Ginza". By consulting the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]] in the Left Ginza, Jorunn J. Buckley has identified an uninterrupted chain of copyists to the late second or early third century.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The colophons attest to the existence of the Mandaeans or their predecessors during the late [[Parthian Empire]] at the very latest.

The oldest texts are lead amulets from about the third century AD, followed by magic bowls from about AD 600. The important religious manuscripts are not older than the sixteenth century, with most coming from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Yamauchi (1982). "The Mandaeans: Gnostic Survivors". ''Eerdmans' Handbook to the World's Religions'', Lion Publishing, Herts., England, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Ginza'' continued to evolve under the rule of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and the Islamic [[caliphate]]s, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.

Another important text is the ''[[Haran Gawaita]]'' which tells the history of the Mandaeans. According to this text, a group of Nasoreans (Mandean priests) left [[Judea]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem in the first century CE]], and settled within the Parthian Empire. 

Other important books include the ''[[Qolusta]]'', the canonical prayerbook of the Mandaeans, which was translated by [[E. S. Drower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/ginzarba.htm |title=The Ginza Rba - Mandaean Scriptures | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief works of Mandaean scripture, accessible to laymen and initiates alike, is the ''[[Mandaean Book of John]]'' ({{cite web |last1=Lidzbarski |first1=Mark |title=Das Johannesbuch der Mandäer |url=https://archive.org/details/dasjohannesbuchd01lidzuoft |publisher=Giessen : Töpelmann}}), which includes a dialogue between John and Jesus. In addition to the ''Ginza'', ''Qolusta'', and ''Draša'', there is the ''Dīvān'', which contains a description of the 'regions' the soul ascends through, and the ''[[Asfar Malwāshē]]'', the "Book of the Zodiacal Constellations". Finally, there are some pre-Muslim artifacts that contain Mandaean writings and inscriptions, such as some [[incantation bowl#In Judaism|Aramaic incantation bowls]].

The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally composed is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. Many Mandaean lay people do not speak this language, though some members of the Mandaean community resident in Iran and Iraq continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.

==Worship==
[[File:Darfash - Mandaean cross.png|thumb|180px|right|"Mandaean cross" (darfash)]]
The two most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship are baptism (masbuta), and a mass for the dead or 'ascent of the soul ceremony' (masiqta).&lt;ref&gt; http://www.mandaeanunion.com/history-english/item/170-brief-history-on-the-mandaeans &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other religions, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed every Sunday, the Mandaean holy day. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all rivers considered fit for baptism are called Yardana (after the River Jordan). After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy oil and partakes of a communion of bread and water. The ascent of the soul ceremony can take various forms, but usually involves a ritual meal in memory of the dead. The ceremony is believed to help the souls of the departed on their journey through purgatory to the World of Light.

A ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|mandī}}'' ({{lang-ar|مندى|links=no}}) is a place of worship for followers of Mandaeism. A ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|mandī}}'' must be built beside a river in order to perform maṣbuta (or baptism) because water is an essential element in the Mandaeic faith. Modern ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|mandī}}''s sometimes have a bath inside a building instead.  Each mandi is adorned with a ''darfash'', which is a cross of olive wood half covered with a piece of white pure silk cloth. The cross bears no relation to the Christian cross. Instead the four arms of the cross symbolise the four corners of the universe, while the pure silk cloth represents the Light of God.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.rferl.org/a/1053864.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation, and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They also place a high priority upon family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]] or [[asceticism]]. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and [[red meat]].

==Organisation==
There is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests. According to E.S. Drower (''The Secret Adam'', p. ix):

{{quote|[T]hose amongst the community who possess secret knowledge are called ''Naṣuraiia''—Naṣoreans (or, if the emphatic ‹ṣ› is written as ‹z›, ''Nazorenes''). At the same time the ignorant or semi-ignorant laity are called 'Mandaeans', ''Mandaiia''—'gnostics.'  When a man becomes a priest he leaves 'Mandaeanism' and enters ''tarmiduta'', 'priesthood.'  Even then he has not attained to true enlightenment, for this, called 'Naṣiruta', is reserved for a very few. Those possessed of its secrets may call themselves Naṣoreans, and 'Naṣorean' today indicates not only one who observes strictly all rules of ritual purity, but one who understands the secret doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Segelberg]], "The Ordination of the Mandæan tarmida and its Relation to Jewish and Early Christian Ordination Rites," (Studia patristica 10, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the ''tarmidia'' "disciples" (Neo-Mandaic ''tarmidānā''), the ''ganzibria'' "treasurers" (from Old Persian ''ganza-bara'' "id.," Neo-Mandaic ''ganzeḇrānā'') and the ''rišamma'' "leader of the people". This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the ''ganzeḇrā'', a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from [[Persepolis]] (c. 3rd century BCE) and which may be related to the ''kamnaskires'' (Elamite &lt;qa-ap-nu-iš-ki-ra&gt; ''kapnuskir'' "treasurer"), title of the rulers of [[Elymais]] (modern [[Khuzestan]]) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any ''ganzeḇrā'' who baptizes seven or more ''ganzeḇrānā'' may qualify for the office of ''rišamma'', though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate.

The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes (''šgandia''), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them.

In 2009, there were two dozen Mandaean priests in the world, according to the Associated Press.&lt;ref name="saving"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Contrera|first1=Russell|title=Saving the people, killing the faith|url=http://www.hollandsentinel.com/x1558731033/Saving-the-people-killing-the-faith|website=Holland Sentinel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017044028/http://www.hollandsentinel.com/x1558731033/Saving-the-people-killing-the-faith|archivedate=October 17, 2015|date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other groups==
The Mandaeans have been identified with several groups, in particular the Sabians and the Elkasaites. Other groups such as the Nazerences and the Dositheans have also been identified with the Mandaeans. The exact relation of all these groups to one another is a difficult question. While it seems certain that a number of distinct groups are intended by these names, the nature of these sects and the connections between them are less than clear. At least according to the ''Fihrist'' (see below), these groups seem all to have emerged from or developed in parallel with the "Sabian" followers of ''El-Hasaih''; "Elkasaites" in particular may simply have been a blanket term for Mughtasila, Mandaeans, the original Sabians and even Manichaeans.

===Sabians===
{{Main|Sabians}}
The [[Quran]] makes several references to the [[Sabians]], who are frequently thought to be Mandaeans. Sabians are counted among the ''Ahl al-Kitāb'' ([[People of the Book]]), and several [[hadith]] feature them. Arab sources of early Qur'anic times (7th century) also make some references to Sabians.  Some scholars hold that the etymology of the root word 'Sabi'un' points to origins either in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or Mandaic word 'Sabian', and suggest that the Mandaean religion originated with Sabeans who came under the influence of early Hellenic Sabian missionaries, but preferred their own priesthood. The Sabians believed they "belong to the prophet Noah";&lt;ref name="Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad"&gt;Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad (d. 786–787), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read ''[[Zaboor]]'' (see also [[Book of Psalms]]), and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels".&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Mandaeans claim direct descent from Noah.

Early in the 9th century, a group of [[hermeticism | Hermeticists]] in the northern Mesopotamian city of [[Harran]] declared themselves Sabians when facing persecution; an Assyrian Christian writer{{who|date=November 2010}}{{When|date=November 2010}} said that the true 'Sabians' or Sabba lived in the marshes of lower Iraq. The Assyrian writer [[Theodore Bar Konai]] (in the [[Scholion]], 792) described a "sect" of "Sabians", who were located in southern [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chwolsohn]], Die Sabier, 1856, I, 112; II, 543, cited by Salmon.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} 

[[Al-Biruni]] (writing at the beginning of the 11th century) said that the 'real Sabians' were "the remnants of the Jewish tribes who remained in [[Babylonia]] when the other tribes left it for [[Jerusalem]] in the days of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] and [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]]. These remaining tribes&amp;nbsp;... adopted a system mixed-up of [[Magi]]sm and [[Judaism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farvardyn.com/mandaean.php |title=Extracts from E. S. Drower, 'Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran{{'-}} |website=Farvardyn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204143916/http://www.farvardyn.com/mandaean.php |archive-date=2011-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elkesaites===
{{Main|Elkesaites}}
The Elkesaites were a Judeo-Christian baptismal sect which seem to have been related, and possibly ancestral, to the Mandaeans (see Sabians). The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms. They dwelt in east Judea and [[Assyria]], whence the Mandaeans claim to have migrated to southern Mesopotamia, according to the ''Harran Gawaiṯā'' legend. In the ''Fihrist'' ("Book of Nations") of Arabic scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim|Al-Nadim]] (c. 987), the ''Mogtasilah'' (''Mughtasila'', "self-ablutionists") are counted among the followers of ''El-Hasaih'' or [[Elkesaite]]s. ''Mogtasilah'' may thus have been Al-Nadim's term for the Mandaeans, as the few details on rituals and habit are similar to Mandaeans ones. The Elkesaites seem to have prospered for a while, but ultimately splintered. They may have originated in a schism where they renounced the [[Torah]], while the mainstream Sampsaeans{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} held on to it (as Elchasai's followers did)—if so, this must have happened around the mid-late 1st millennium CE. However, it is not clear exactly which group he referred to, for by then the Elkesaite sects may have been at their most diverse. Some disappeared subsequently; for example, the Sampsaeans are not well attested in later sources. The ''[[Ginza Rba]]'', one of the chief holy scriptures of the Mandaeans, appears to originate around the time of Elchasai or somewhat thereafter.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Manichaeans===
{{Main|Manichaeism}}
According to the ''Fihrist'' of ibn al-Nadim, the Mesopotamian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], the founder of [[Manichaeism]], was brought up within the [[Elcesaites|Elkesaite]] (''Elcesaite'' or ''Elchasaite'') sect, this being confirmed more recently by the [[Cologne Mani Codex]]. Unfortunately, none of the [[Mani (prophet)#Works|Manichaean scriptures]] has survived in its entirety, and it seems that the remaining fragments have not been compared to the ''Ginza Rba''.  Mani later left the Elkasaites to found his own religion. In a comparative analysis, Mandaean scholar Säve-Söderberg indicated that Mani's ''[[Psalms of Thomas]]'' were closely related to Mandaean texts.&lt;ref&gt;Torgny Säve-Söderberg, ''Studies in the Coptic Manichaean Psalm-book'', Uppsala, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature, or that both derived from the same source.

===4th-century Nazarenes===
The [[Haran Gawaita]] uses the name [[Nasoreans]] for the Mandaeans arriving from Jerusalem. Consequently, the Mandaeans have been connected with the 4th-century [[Nazarenes (sect)|Nazarenes]] described by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Drower | first =Ethel Stephana | author-link =E.

That is questioned by some, but others accept the pre-Christian origin of this group.

===Dositheans===
They are connected with the [[Samaritan]] group the [[Dositheans]] by [[Theodore Bar Kōnī]] in his ''Scholion''.

==Number of adherents==
{{main|Mandaeans}}

Official numbers estimate that the current population of Mandaeans numbers between 60,000 and 70,000 people. Their proportion in their native lands has collapsed because of the Iraq War, with most of the community relocating to nearby Iran, Syria, and Jordan.

In 2011, [[Al Arabiya]] put the number of hidden and unaccounted for Iranian Mandaeans in Iran as high as 60,000.&lt;ref name=alarabiya0612&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmed Al-Sheati |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/06/181123.html |title=Iran Mandaeans in exile following persecution |publisher=Al Arabiya News |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Mandaeans tallied in official numbers, many have formed diaspora communities outside the Middle East, especially [[Australia]], where some 10,000&lt;ref&gt;http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-21/meet-the-mandaeans-sydneys-followers-of-john-the-baptist/8727720?pfmredir=sm&lt;/ref&gt; now reside, mainly around [[Sydney]], representing 15% of the total world Mandaean population. 

According to a 2009 article in ''[[The Holland Sentinel]]'', the Mandaean community in Iran has also been dwindling, numbering between 5,000 and at most 10,000 people.

Approximately 1,000 Iranian Mandaeans have emigrated to the United States since the US State Department in 2002 granted them protective refugee status, which was also later accorded to Iraqi Mandaeans in 2007.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A community estimated at 2,500 members live in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where they began settling in 2008. Most emigrated from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacQuarrie|first1=Brian|title=Embraced by Worcester, Iraq’s persecuted Mandaean refugees now seek ‘anchor’—their own temple|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/08/12/embraced-worcester-iraq-persecuted-mandaean-refugees-now-seek-anchor-their-own-temple/qSTOVM3qTRoD8zSiuIlLTO/story.html|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=The Boston Globe |date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38185">'''Marine larval ecology''' is the study of the factors influencing dispersing [[larva]]e, which many [[marine invertebrates]] and [[fishes]] have. Marine animals with a larva typically release many larvae into the water column, where the larvae develop before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into adults.

Marine larvae can disperse over long distances, although determining the actual distance is challenging, because of their size and the lack of a good tracking method. Knowing dispersal distances is important for managing [[fishery|fisheries]], effectively designing marine reserves, and controlling [[invasive species]].

== Theories on the evolution of a biphasic life history ==
Larval dispersal is one of the most important topics in [[marine ecology]], today. Many marine invertebrates and many fishes have a bi-phasic life cycle with a [[pelagic]] larva or pelagic eggs that can be transported over long distances, and a [[demersal]] or [[benthic]] adult.&lt;ref&gt;Grosberg, R.K. and D.R. Levitan. 1992. For adults only? Supply-side ecology and the history of larval biology. Trends Ecol. Evol. 7: 130-133.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several theories behind why these organisms have evolved this biphasic life history:&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, S. E., J. S. Shima, M. E. Hellberg, S. R. Thorrold, G. P. Jones, D. R. Robertson, S. G. Morgan, K. A. Selkoe, G. M. Ruiz, and R. R. Warner. 2002. Evidence of self-recruitment in demersal marine populations. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 251-271.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Larvae use different food sources than adults, which decreases competition between life stages.
*Pelagic larvae can disperse large distances, colonize new territory, and move away from habitats that has become overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable.
*A long pelagic larval phase can help a species to break its [[parasite]] cycles.
*Pelagic larvae avoid benthic predators.

Dispersing as pelagic larvae can be risky. For example, while larvae do avoid benthic predators, they are still exposed to pelagic predators in the water column.

== Larval development strategies ==
&lt;!-- note: anchor tags in this section used by redirects --&gt;
Marine larvae develop via one of three strategies: Direct, lecithotrophic, or planktotrophic. Each strategy has risks of predation and the difficulty of finding a good settlement site.

'''Direct developing'''{{anchor|Direct development}} larvae look like the adult. They have typically very low dispersal potential, and are known as “crawl-away larvae,” because they crawl away from their egg after hatching. Some species of frogs and snails hatch this way.

'''Lecithotrophic'''{{anchor|Lecithotrophy}} larvae have greater dispersal potential than direct developers. Many fish species and some benthic invertebrates have lecithotrophic larvae, which have yolk droplets or a yolk sac for nutrition during dispersal. Though some lecithotrophic species can feed in the water column, too. But many, such as [[tunicates]], cannot, and so must settle before depleting their yolk. Consequently, these species have short pelagic larval durations and do not disperse long distances.

'''Planktotrophic'''{{anchor|Planktotrophy}} larvae feed while they are in the water column and can be over a long time pelagic and so disperse over long distances. This disperse ability is a key adaptation of benthic marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Strathmann, R. R., T. P. Hughes, A. M. Kuris, K. C. Lindeman, S. G. Morgan, J. M. Pandolfi, and R. R. Warner. 2002. Evolution of local recruitment and its consequences for marine populations. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 377-396.&lt;/ref&gt; Planktotrophic larvae feed on [[phytoplankton]] and small [[zooplankton]], including other larvae. Planktotrophic development is the most common type of larval development, especially among benthic invertebrates.

Because planktotrophic larvae are for a long time in the water column and recruit successfully with low probability, early researchers developed the “lottery hypothesis”, which states that animals release huge numbers of larvae to increase the chances that at least one will survive, and that larvae cannot influence their probability of success.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, G. 1950. Reproductive and larval ecology of marine bottom invertebrates. Biol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 25: 1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden, J., Y. Iwasa, and C. Blaxter. 1985. Demographic theory for an open population with space-limited recruitment. Ecology 66: 54-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caley, M.J., M.H. Carr, M.A. Hixon, T.P. Hughes, G.P. Jones, and B. Menge. 1996. Recruitment and the local dynamics of open marine populations. Evolution 35: 1192-1205.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis views larval survival and successful recruitment as chance events, which numerous studies on larval behavior and ecology have since shown to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsford, M. J., J. M. Leis, A. Shanks, K. C. Lindeman, S. G. Morgan, and J. Pineda. 2002. Sensory environments, larval abilities, and local self-recruitment. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 309-340.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it has been generally disproved, the larval lottery hypothesis represents an important understanding of the difficulties faced by larvae during their time in the water column.

== Predator Defense ==
Predation is a major threat to marine larvae, which are an important food source for many organisms. Invertebrate larvae in [[estuaries]] are particularly at risk because estuaries are nursery grounds for [[planktivorous fishes]]. Larvae have evolved strategies to cope with this threat, including direct defense and [[Anti-predator adaptation|avoidance]].

=== Direct Defense ===

Direct defense can include protective structures and chemical defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindquist|first=Niels|last2=Hay|first2=Mark E.|date=1996-02-01|title=Palatability and Chemical Defense of Marine Invertebrate Larvae|journal=Ecological Monographs|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=431–450|doi=10.2307/2963489|issn=1557-7015|jstor=2963489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Planktivore|planktivorous]] fishes are gape-limited predators, meaning their prey is determined by the width of their open mouths, making larger larvae difficult to ingest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devries|first=Dennis R.|last2=Stein|first2=Roy A.|last3=Bremigan|first3=Mary T.|date=1998-11-01|title=Prey Selection by Larval Fishes as Influenced by Available Zooplankton and Gape Limitation|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|language=en|volume=127|issue=6|pages=1040–1050|doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127&lt;1040:psblfa&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=1548-8659|hdl=1811/45384}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study proved that spines serve a protective function by removing spines from estuarine [[crab]] larvae and monitoring differences in predation rates between de-spined and intact larvae.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Morgan, S. G. 1989. Adaptive significance of spination in estuarine crab zoeae. Ecology 70: 462-482.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study also showed that predator defense is also behavioral, as they can keep spines relaxed but erect them in the presence of predators.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Avoidance ===

Larvae can avoid predators on small and large spatial scales. Some larvae do this by sinking when approached by a predator. A more common avoidance strategy is to become active at night and remain hidden during the day to avoid visual predators. Most larvae and plankton undertake [[diel vertical migration]]s between deeper waters with less light and fewer predators during the day and shallow waters in the [[photic zone]] at night, where [[microalgae]] is abundant.&lt;ref&gt;Zaret, T.M. and J.S. Suffern. 1976. Vertical migration in zooplankton as a predator avoidance. Limnol. Oceanogr. 21: 804-813.&lt;/ref&gt; Estuarine invertebrate larvae avoid predators by developing in the open ocean, where there are fewer predators. This is done using reverse tidal vertical migrations. Larvae use tidal cycles and estuarine flow regimes to aid their departure to the ocean, a process that is well-studied in many estuarine crab species.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, T.W. and R.B. Forward, Jr. 1979. Tidal vertical migration: An endogenous rhythm in estuarine crab larvae. Science 205: 1020-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tankersley, R.A. and R.B. Forward, Jr. 1994. Endogenous swimming rhythms in estuarine crab megalopae: implications for flood-tide transport. Mar. Biol. 118: 415-423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, C. and E. Naylor. 1996. Endogenous tidal rhythms of vertical migration in field collected zoea-1 larvae of the shore crab Carcinus maenas: implications for ebb-tide offshore dispersal. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 132: 71-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DiBacco, C., D. Sutton, and L. McConnico. 2001. Vertical migration behavior and horizontal distribution of brachyuran larvae in a low-inflow estuary: implications for bay-ocean exchange. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 217: 191-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of reverse tidal migration performed by crab species would begin with larvae being released on a nocturnal [[Tide|spring high tide]] to limit predation by planktivorous fishes. As the tide begins to ebbs, larvae swim to the surface to be carried away from the spawning site. When the tide begins to [[Tide|flood]], larvae swim to the bottom, where water moves more slowly due to the [[boundary layer]]. When the tide again changes back to ebb, the larvae swim to the surface waters and resume their journey to the ocean. Depending on the length of the estuary and the speed of the [[Ocean current|currents]], this process can take anywhere from one tidal cycle to several days.&lt;ref&gt;Forward, R.B. Jr, and R.A. Tankersley. 2001. Selective tidal-stream transport of marine animals. Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. Annu. Rev. 39: 305-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal and settlement ==
The most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of a pelagic larval stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strathmann|first=Richard R.|date=1978-12-01|title=THE EVOLUTION AND LOSS OF FEEDING LARVAL STAGES OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=894–906|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1978.tb04642.x|pmid=28567936|issn=1558-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treml|first=Eric A.|last2=Roberts|first2=Jason J.|last3=Chao|first3=Yi|last4=Halpin|first4=Patrick N.|last5=Possingham|first5=Hugh P.|last6=Riginos|first6=Cynthia|date=2012-10-01|title=Reproductive Output and Duration of the Pelagic Larval Stage Determine Seascape-Wide Connectivity of Marine Populations|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/52/4/525/663573|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=525–537|doi=10.1093/icb/ics101|pmid=22821585|issn=1540-7063}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sessility (zoology)|Sessile]] and sedentary organisms such as [[barnacles]], tunicates, and mussels require a mechanism to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic larval durations on the order of weeks or months.&lt;ref&gt;Brothers, E.B., D.M. Williams, and P.F. Sale. 1983. Length of larval life in twelve families of fishes at “One Tree Lagoon,” Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Mar. Biol. 76: 319-324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheltema, R.S. 1986. On dispersal and planktonic larvae of benthic invertebrates: an eclectic overview and summary of problems. Bull. Mar. Sci. 39: 290-322.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, larvae feed and grow, and many species [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] through several stages of development. For example, barnacles [[Ecdysis|molt]] through six [[Nauplius (larva)|naupliar]] stages before becoming a [[cyprid]] and seeking appropriate settlement substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=L. W. G.|last2=Crisp|first2=D. J.|date=1954-02-01|title=The larval stages of the Barnacle Balanus improvisus Darwin.|journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|language=en|volume=123|issue=4|pages=765–780|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1954.tb00203.x|issn=1469-7998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy can be risky. Some larvae have been shown to be able to delay their final [[metamorphosis]] for a few days or weeks, and most species cannot delay it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer, P., K. Paschke, and K. Anger. 2004. Stimulation of metamorphosis in an estuarine crab, Chasmagnathus granulata (Dana, 1851): temporal window of cue receptivity. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 311: 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J.S., M.J. Butler IV, and H. Matsuda. 2006. Investigations into some early-life history strategies for Caribbean spiny lobster and implications for pan-carib connectivity. J. Shellfish Res. 25: 731.&lt;/ref&gt; If these larvae metamorphose far from a suitable settlement site, they perish. Many invertebrate larvae have evolved complex behaviors and endogenous rhythms to ensure successful and timely settlement.

Many estuarine species exhibit swimming rhythms of reverse tidal vertical migration to aid in their transport away from their hatching site. Individuals can also exhibit tidal vertical migrations to reenter the estuary when they are competent to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Christy, J.H. and S.G. Morgan. 1998. Estuarine immigration by crab postlarvae: mechanisms, reliability and adaptive significance. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 174: 51-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

As larvae reach their final pelagic stage, they become much more [[Touch|tactile]]; clinging to anything larger than themselves. One study observed crab [[postlarvae]] and found that they would swim vigorously until they encountered a floating object, which they would cling to for the remainder of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, Alan L. 1985. Behavioral basis of internal-wave-induced shoreward transport of megalopae of the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes. Marine Ecol. Prog. Series 24: 289-295.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that by clinging to floating debris, crabs can be transported towards shore due to the oceanographic forces of [[internal waves]],{{clarify|date=March 2013}} which carry floating debris shoreward regardless of the prevailing currents.

Once returning to shore, settlers encounter difficulties concerning their actual settlement and recruitment into the population. Space is a limiting factor for sessile invertebrates on [[rocky shore]]s. Settlers must be wary of adult [[filter feeders]], which cover substrate at settlement sites and eat particles the size of larvae. Settlers must also avoid becoming stranded out of water by waves, and must select a settlement site at the proper tidal height to prevent [[desiccation]] and avoid [[Competition#Competition in biology and ecology|competition]] and [[predation]]. To overcome many of these difficulties, some species rely on chemical cues to assist them in selecting an appropriate settlement site. These cues are usually emitted by adult [[conspecifics]], but some species cue on specific bacterial mats or other qualities of the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;Crisp, D.J. and P.S. Meadows. 1962. The chemical basis of gregariousness in cirripedes. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B158: 364-387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pawlik, J.R. 1986. Chemical induction of larval settlement and metamorphosis in the reef building tube worm; [[Phragmatopoma californica]] (Sabellidae: Polychaeta). Mar. Biol. 91: 51-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J.K., J.M. Elliott, and R.N. Mariscal. 1995. Host selection, location, and association behaviors of anemonefishes in field settlement experiments. Mar. Biol. 122: 377-390.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Larval Sensory Systems ==
Although with a [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] larva, many species can increase their dispersal range and decrease the risk of [[inbreeding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=February 1999|title=On the advantages and disadvantages of larval stages in benthic marine invertebrate life cycle|url=|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=177|pages=269–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larva comes with challenges: Marine larvae risk being washed away without finding a suitable habitat for settlement. Therefore, they have evolved many sensory systems:

=== Sensory Systems ===

==== Magnetic Fields ====
Far from shore, larvae are able to use magnetic fields to orient themselves towards the coast over large spatial scales.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kingsford|first=Michael J.|last2=Leis|first2=Jeffrey M.|last3=Shanks|first3=Alan|last4=Lindeman|first4=Kenyon C.|last5=Morgan|first5=Steven G.|last6=Pineda|first6=Jesús|date=2002-01-01|title=Sensory environments, larval abilities and local self-recruitment|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2002/00000070/a00101s1/art00005|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=70|issue=1|pages=309–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Jack|last2=Muheim|first2=Rachel|date=2017-08-15|title=Pre-settlement coral-reef fish larvae respond to magnetic field changes during the day|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/16/2874|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=220|issue=16|pages=2874–2877|doi=10.1242/jeb.159491|issn=0022-0949|pmid=28576824}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is additional evidence that species can recognize anomalies in the magnetic field to return to the same location multiple times throughout their life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the mechanisms that these species use is poorly understood, it appears that magnetic fields play an important role in larval orientation offshore, where other cues such as sound and chemicals may be difficult to detect.

[[Phototaxis]] (ability to differentiate between light and dark areas) is important to find a suitable habitat.

Species that produce more complex larvae, such as fish, can use full vision&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to find a suitable habitat on small spatial scales. Larvae of [[damselfish]] use vision to find and settle near adults  of their species.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lecchini|first=David|last2=Shima|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Banaigs|first3=Bernard|last4=Galzin|first4=René|date=2005-03-01|title=Larval sensory abilities and mechanisms of habitat selection of a coral reef fish during settlement|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=143|issue=2|pages=326–334|doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1805-y|pmid=15647903|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sound ====
Marine larvae use sound and vibrations to find a good habitat where they can settle and [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into juveniles. This behavior has been seen in fish&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  as well as in the larvae of [[scleractinia]]n corals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vermeij MJ, Marhaver KL, Huijbers CM, Nagelkerken I, Simpson SD | title = Coral larvae move toward reef sounds | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e10660 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20498831 | pmc = 2871043 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many families of coral reef fish are particularly attracted to high-[[frequency]] sounds produced by invertebrates,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=S.D.|last2=Meekan|first2=M.G.|last3=Jeffs|first3=A.|last4=Montgomery|first4=J.C.|last5=McCauley|first5=R.D.|title=Settlement-stage coral reef fish prefer the higher-frequency invertebrate-generated audible component of reef noise|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1861–1868|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.11.004|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which larvae use as an indicator of food availability and complex  habitat where they may be protected from predators. It is thought that larvae avoid low frequency sounds because they may be associated with transient fish or predators&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and is therefore not a reliable indicator of safe habitat.

The spatial range at which larvae detect and use sound waves is still uncertain, though some evidence suggests that it may only be reliable at very small scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaplan MB, Mooney TA | title = Coral reef soundscapes may not be detectable far from the reef | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 31862 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27550394 | pmc = 4994009 | doi = 10.1038/srep31862 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern that changes in [[community structure]] in [[nursery habitat]]s, such as [[seagrass]] beds, [[kelp]] forests, and [[mangrove]]s, could lead to a collapse in larval recruitment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossi|first=Tullio|last2=Connell|first2=Sean D.|last3=Nagelkerken|first3=Ivan|title=The sounds of silence: regime shifts impoverish marine soundscapes|journal=Landscape Ecology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=239–248|doi=10.1007/s10980-016-0439-x|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a decrease in sound-producing invertebrates.

==== Olfaction ====
Many marine organisms use [[olfaction]] (chemical cues in the form of scent) to locate a safe area to metamorphose at the end of their larval stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has been shown in both [[vertebrate]]s&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atema|first=Jelle|last2=Kingsford|first2=Michael J.|last3=Gerlach|first3=Gabriele|date=2002-10-04|title=Larval reef fish could use odour for detection, retention and orientation to reefs|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v241/p151-160/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=241|pages=151–160|doi=10.3354/meps241151|issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[invertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumas|first=Pascal|last2=Tiavouane|first2=Josina|last3=Senia|first3=Jocelyn|last4=Willam|first4=Andrew|last5=Dick|first5=Lency|last6=Fauvelot|first6=Cecile|title=Evidence of early chemotaxis contributing to active habitat selection by the sessile giant clam Tridacna maxima|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=452|pages=63–69|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2013.12.002|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that larvae are able to distinguish between water from the open ocean and water from more suitable nursery habitats such as [[lagoon]]s&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  and seagrass beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havel|first=Lisa N.|last2=Fuiman|first2=Lee A.|title=Settlement-Size Larval Red Drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) Respond to Estuarine Chemical Cues|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|volume=39|issue=2|pages=560–570|doi=10.1007/s12237-015-0008-6|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical cues can be extremely useful for larvae, but may not have a constant presence, as water input can depend on currents and tidal flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leis|first=J.

=== Human Impacts on Sensory Systems ===
Recent research in the field of larval sensory biology has begun focusing more on how human impacts and environmental disturbance affect settlement rates and larval interpretation of different habitat cues. [[Ocean acidification]] due to [[anthropogenic climate change]] and [[sedimentation]] have become areas of particular interest.

==== Ocean Acidification ====
Ocean acidification has been shown to alter the way that pelagic larvae are able to process information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashur MM, Johnston NK, Dixson DL | title = Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Sensory Function in Marine Organisms | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–80 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28575440 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icx010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and production of the cues themselves.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossi T, Connell SD, Nagelkerken I | title = Silent oceans: ocean acidification impoverishes natural soundscapes by altering sound production of the world's noisiest marine invertebrate | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 283 | issue = 1826 | pages = 20153046 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26984624 | pmc = 4810867 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2015.3046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidification can alter larval interpretations of sounds, particularly in fish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castro JM, Amorim MC, Oliveira AP, Gonçalves EJ, Munday PL, Simpson SD, Faria AM | title = Painted Goby Larvae under High-CO2 Fail to Recognize Reef Sounds | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0170838 | pmid = 28125690 | pmc = 5268378 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0170838  | year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to settlement in suboptimal habitat. Though the mechanism for this process is still not fully understood, some studies indicate that this breakdown may be due to a decrease in size or density of their otoliths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bignami S, Enochs IC, Manzello DP, Sponaugle S, Cowen RK | title = Ocean acidification alters the otoliths of a pantropical fish species with implications for sensory function | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 18 | pages = 7366–70 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23589887 | pmc = 3645591 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1301365110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sounds produced by invertebrates that larvae rely on as an indicator of habitat quality can also change due to acidification. For example, [[Alpheidae|snapping shrimp]] produce different sounds that larvae may not recognize under acidified conditions due to differences in shell [[calcification]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hearing is not the only sense that may be altered under future ocean chemistry conditions. Evidence also suggests that larval ability to process olfactory cues was also affected when tested under future [[pH]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devine|first=B. M.|last2=Munday|first2=P. L.|last3=Jones|first3=G. P.|title=Rising CO2 concentrations affect settlement behaviour of larval damselfishes|journal=Coral Reefs|volume=31|issue=1|pages=229–238|doi=10.1007/s00338-011-0837-0|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red color cues that coral larvae use to find crustose [[coralline algae]], with which they have a [[Commensalism|commensal]] relationship, may also be in danger due to algal bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=T.|last2=Gilmour|first2=J. P.|date=2016-11-09|title=Seeing red: Coral larvae are attracted to healthy‑looking reefs|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v559/p65-71/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=559|pages=65–71|doi=10.3354/meps11902|issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sedimentation ====
Sediment runoff, from natural storm events or human development, can also impact larval sensory systems and survival. One study focusing on red soil found that increased turbidity due to runoff negatively influenced the ability of fish larvae to interpret visual cues.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Connor|first=J. Jack|last2=Lecchini|first2=David|last3=Beck|first3=Hayden J.|last4=Cadiou|first4=Gwenael|last5=Lecellier|first5=Gael|last6=Booth|first6=David J.|last7=Nakamura|first7=Yohei|date=2016-01-01|title=Sediment pollution impacts sensory ability and performance of settling coral-reef fish|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=180|issue=1|pages=11–21|doi=10.1007/s00442-015-3367-6|pmid=26080759|issn=0029-8549|hdl=10453/41685}}&lt;/ref&gt; More unexpectedly, they also found that red soil can also impair olfactory capabilities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Self-recruitment ==
Marine ecologists are often interested in the degree of [[self-recruitment]] in populations. Historically, larvae were considered passive particles that were carried by ocean currents to faraway locations. This led to the belief that all marine populations were demographically open, connected by long distance larval transport. Recent work has shown that many populations are self-recruiting, and that larvae and juveniles are capable of purposefully returning to their natal sites. 
 
	Researchers take a variety of approaches to estimating [[population connectivity]] and self-recruitment, and several studies have demonstrated their feasibility. Jones et al.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. P., M. J. Milicich, M. J. Emslie and C. Lunow. 1999. Self-recruitment in a coral reef fish population. Nature 402: 802-804.&lt;/ref&gt; and Swearer et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, S. E., J. E. Caselle, D. W. Lea, and R. R. Warner. 1999. Larval rentention and recruitment in an island population of a coral-reef fish. Nature 402: 799-802.&lt;/ref&gt; for example,  investigated the proportion of fish larvae returning to their natal reef. Both studies found higher than expected self-recruitment in these populations using mark, release, and recapture sampling. These studies were the first to provide conclusive evidence of self-recruitment in a species with the potential to disperse far from its natal site, and laid the groundwork for numerous future studies.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, L. 2006. Recent progress in understanding larval dispersal: new directions and digressions. Int. Comp. Biol. 46: 282-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[Ichthyoplankton]] have a high mortality rate as they transition their food source from yolk sac to zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voss|first=Rüdiger|last2=Hinrichsen|first2=Hans-Harald|last3=Wieland|first3=Kai|date=2001-11-19|title=Model-supported estimation of mortality rates in Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias L.) larvae: the varying impact of 'critical periods'|journal=BMC Ecology|volume=1|pages=4|doi=10.1186/1472-6785-1-4|pmid=11737879|pmc=60663|issn=1472-6785}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that this mortality rate is related to inadequate zooplankton as well as an inability to move through the water effectively at this stage of development, leading to starvation. Many ichthyoplankton use suction to feed. [[Turgor pressure|Turgidity]] of water impairs the organisms’ ability to feed even when there is a high density of prey. Reducing these hydrodynamic constraints on cultivated populations could lead to higher yields for repopulation efforts and has been proposed as a means of conserving fish populations by acting at the larval level.&lt;ref&gt;China, V., and R. Holzman. 2014. Hydrodynamic starvation in first-feeding larval fishes. PNAS doi:10.1073/pnas.1323205111.&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of [[Marine protected area|marine reserves]] has been initiated for the conservation of the world’s marine larval populations. These areas restrict fishing and therefore increase the number of otherwise fished species. This leads to a healthier ecosystem and affects the number of overall species within the reserve as compared to nearby fished areas; however, the full effect of an increase in larger predator fish on larval populations is not currently known. Also, the potential for utilizing the motility of fish larvae to repopulate the water surrounding the reserve is not fully understood. Marine reserves are a part of a growing conservation effort to combat [[overfishing]]; however, reserves still only comprise about 1% of the world’s oceans. These reserves are also not protected from other human-derived threats, such as chemical pollutants, so they cannot be the only method of conservation without certain levels of protection for the water around them as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bohnsack, J. A. 1992. Reef resource habitat protection: the forgotten factor. Marine Recreational Fisheries 14: 117-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

For effective conservation, it is important to understand the larval dispersal patterns of the species in danger, as well as the dispersal of [[invasive species]] and predators which could impact their populations. Understanding these patterns is an important factor when creating protocol for governing fishing and creating [[Marine protected area|reserves]]. A single species may have multiple dispersal patterns. The spacing and size of marine reserves must reflect this variability to maximize their beneficial effect. Species with shorter dispersal patterns are more likely to be affected by local changes and require higher priority for conservation because of the separation of subpopulations.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. P., M. Srinivasan, and G. R. Almany. 2007. Conservation of marine biodiversity. Oceanography 20: 100-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
The principles of marine larval ecology can be applied in other fields, too whether marine or not. Successful [[fisheries management]] relies heavily on understanding population connectivity and dispersal distances, which are driven by larvae. Dispersal and connectivity must also be considered when designing natural reserves. If populations are not self-recruiting, reserves may lose their species assemblages. Many invasive species can disperse over long distances, including the seeds of land plants and larvae of marine invasive species. Understanding the factors influencing their dispersal is key to controlling their spread and managing established populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22242">'''Nanoparticles for drug delivery to the brain''' is a method for transporting drug molecules across the [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) using [[nanoparticle]]s. These drugs cross the BBB and deliver pharmaceuticals to the brain for therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders. These disorders include [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[brain tumor]]s. Part of the difficulty in finding cures for these [[central nervous system]] (CNS) disorders is that there is yet no truly efficient delivery method for drugs to cross the BBB. [[Antibiotics]], [[Chemotherapy|antineoplastic agents]], and a variety of CNS-active drugs, especially [[neuropeptide]]s, are a few examples of molecules that cannot pass the BBB alone.&lt;ref name=Kreuter1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreuter|first=Jörg|title=Nanoparticulate systems for brain delivery of drugs|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2001|volume=47|issue=1|pages=65–81|doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(00)00122-8|pmid=11251246}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of nanoparticle delivery systems, however, studies have shown that some drugs can now cross the BBB, and even exhibit lower [[toxicity]] and decrease adverse effects throughout the body. Toxicity is an important concept for [[pharmacology]] because high toxicity levels in the body could be detrimental to the patient by affecting other organs and disrupting their function.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; Further, the BBB is not the only physiological barrier for [[drug delivery to the brain]]. Other biological factors influence how drugs are transported throughout the body and how they target specific locations for action. Some of these [[pathophysiology|pathophysiological]] factors include blood flow alterations, [[edema]] and increased [[intracranial pressure]], metabolic perturbations, and altered [[gene expression]] and [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref name=Lo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lo EH, Singhal AB, Torchilin VP, Abbott NJ |title=Drug delivery to damaged brain |journal=Brain Res.

== Background ==
The first successful delivery of a drug across the BBB occurred in 2005. The drug used was hexapeptide dalargin, an anti-[[nociceptive]] peptide that cannot cross the BBB alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das|first=Debanjan|author2=Lin, Senshang|title=Double-coated poly (butylcynanoacrylate) nanoparticulate delivery systems for brain targeting of dalargin via oral administration|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=June 2005|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1343–1353|doi=10.1002/jps.20357|pmid=15858853}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was encapsulated in [[polysorbate 80]] coated nanoparticles and [[intravenous therapy|intravenously injected]].&lt;ref name=Hwang/&gt; This was a huge breakthrough in the nanoparticle drug delivery field, and it helped advance research and development toward [[clinical trials]] of nanoparticle delivery systems. Nanoparticles range in size from 10 - 1000&amp;nbsp;nm (or 1&amp;nbsp;µm) and they can be made from natural or artificial [[polymer]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[dendrimer]]s, and [[micelle]]s.&lt;ref name=Kreuter1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hwang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Seung Rim|author2=Kim, Kwangmeyung|title=Nano-enabled delivery systems across the blood-brain barrier|journal=Archives of Pharmacal Research|year=2013|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most polymers used for nanoparticle drug delivery systems are natural, [[biocompatible]], and [[biodegradable]], which helps prevent contamination in the CNS. Several current methods for drug delivery to the brain include the use of [[liposome]]s, [[prodrug]]s, and [[Membrane transport protein|carrier-mediated transporters]]. Many different delivery methods exist to transport these drugs into the body, such as [[Oral administration|peroral]], [[Nasal administration|intranasal]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], and intracranial. For nanoparticles, most studies have shown increasing progression with intravenous delivery. Along with delivery and transport methods, there are several means of functionalizing, or [[activation|activating]], the nanoparticle carriers. These means include dissolving or absorbing a drug throughout the nanoparticle, encapsulating a drug inside the particle, or attaching a drug on the surface of the particle.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt;

== Types of nanoparticles for CNS drug delivery ==

=== Lipid-based ===
[[File:Liposome scheme-en.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of liposome showing a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous interior.]]

One type of nanoparticle involves use of [[liposome]]s as drug molecule carriers. The diagram on the right shows a standard liposome. It has a [[phospholipid bilayer]] separating the interior from the exterior of the cell.

Liposomes are composed of vesicular bilayers, [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e, made of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids such as [[sphingomyelin]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[glycerophospholipid]]s.&lt;ref name=Masserini&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masserini|first=Massimo|title=Nanoparticles for Brain Delivery|journal=ISRN Biochemistry|year=2013|volume=2013|pages=18|doi=10.1155/2013/238428}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cholesterol]], a type of lipid, is also often incorporated in the lipid-nanoparticle formulation. Cholesterol can increase stability of a liposome and prevent leakage of a bilayer because its [[hydroxyl]] group can interact with the polar heads of the bilayer phospholipids. Liposomes have the potential to protect the drug from degradation, target sites for action, and reduce toxicity and adverse effects.&lt;ref name=Soppimath /&gt; Lipid nanoparticles can be manufactured by high pressure [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]], a current method used to produce [[parenteral]] [[emulsion]]s. This process can ultimately form a uniform dispersion of small droplets in a fluid substance by subdividing particles until the desired consistency is acquired.&lt;ref name=Blasi&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blasi P, Schoubben A, Traina G, Manfroni G, Barberini L, Alberti PF, Cirotto C, Ricci M |title=Lipid nanoparticles for brain targeting III. Long-term stability and in vivo toxicity |journal=Int J Pharm |volume=454 |issue=1 |pages=316–23 |year=2013 |pmid=23832009 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.037 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manufacturing process is already scaled and in use in the food industry, which therefore makes it more appealing for researchers and for the drug delivery industry.

Liposomes can also be functionalized by attaching various [[ligand]]s on the surface to enhance brain-targeted delivery.

=== Cationic liposomes ===
Another type of lipid-nanoparticle that can be used for drug delivery to the brain is a [[cationic liposome]]. These are lipid molecules that are positively charged.&lt;ref name= Masserini/&gt; One example of cationic liposomes uses [[bolaamphiphile]]s, which contain [[hydrophilic]] groups surrounding a [[hydrophobic]] chain to strengthen the boundary of the nano-vesicle containing the drug. Bolaamphiphile nano-vesicles can cross the BBB, and they allow controlled release of the drug to target sites.&lt;ref name= Hwang/&gt; [[Lipoplex]]es can also be formed from cationic liposomes and DNA solutions, to yield [[transfection]] agents.&lt;ref name = Masserini/&gt; Cationic liposomes cross the BBB through adsorption mediated endocytosis followed by [[internalization]] in the [[endosome]]s of the endothelial cells. By transfection of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] through the use of lipoplexes, physical alterations in the cells could be made. These physical changes could potentially improve how some nanoparticle drug-carriers cross the BBB.

=== Solid lipid ===
[[File:SolidLipidNanoparticle.jpg|thumb|Diagram displays a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN). There is only one phospholipid layer because the interior of the particle is solid. Molecules such as antibodies, targeting peptides, and drug molecules can be bound to the surface of the SLN.]]

Also, [[solid lipid nanoparticle]]s (SLNs) are lipid nanoparticles with a solid interior as shown in the diagram on the right. SLNs can be made by replacing the liquid lipid oil used in the emulsion process with a solid lipid. In solid lipid nanoparticles, the drug molecules are dissolved in the particle's solid [[hydrophobic]] lipid core, this is called the drug payload, and it is surrounded by an aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Masserini/&gt; Many SLNs are developed from [[triglyceride]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and [[wax]]es. High-pressure [[homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] or [[micro-emulsification]] can be used for manufacturing. Further, functionalizing the surface of solid lipid nanoparticles with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) can result in increased BBB permeability.&lt;ref name=Amiji/&gt;

=== Nanoemulsions ===
Another form for nanoparticle delivery systems is oil-in-water [[emulsion]]s done on a nano-scale.&lt;ref name=Amiji/&gt; This process uses common [[biocompatible]] oils such as triglycerides and fatty acids, and combines them with water and surface-coating [[surfactant]]s. Oils rich in [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s especially contain important factors that aid in penetrating the [[tight junction]]s of the BBB.&lt;ref name=Amiji/&gt;

=== Polymer-based ===
Other nanoparticles are [[polymer]]-based, meaning they are made from a natural polymer such as [[polylactic acid]] (PLA), poly D,L-glycolide (PLG), polylactide-co-glycolide ([[PLGA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Therapeutic Nanoparticles for Accumulation in the Brain|date=2016-02-12|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2016022462|inventor-last=Dhar|inventor2-last=Baker|inventor3-last=Marrache|inventor-first=Shanta|inventor2-first=Emily Wyatt|inventor3-first=Sean|issue=WO/2016/022462|accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marrache|first=Sean|last2=Pathak|first2=Rakesh K.|last3=Dhar|first3=Shanta|date=2014-07-22|title=Detouring of cisplatin to access mitochondrial genome for overcoming resistance|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/29/10444|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=29|pages=10444–10449|doi=10.1073/pnas.1405244111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4115573|pmid=25002500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poly[[cyanoacrylate]] (PCA).&lt;ref name=Soppimath&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soppimath|first=Kumaresh S.|author2=Aminabhavi, Tejraj M. |author3=Kulkarni, Anandrao R. |author4= Rudzinski, Walter E. |title=Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery devices|journal=Journal of Controlled Release|year=2001|volume=70|issue=1–2|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/S0168-3659(00)00339-4|pmid=11166403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found that polymeric nanoparticles may provide better results for drug delivery relative to lipid-based nanoparticles because they may increase the stability of the drugs or proteins being transported. Polymeric nanoparticles may also contain beneficial [[controlled release]] mechanisms.

[[File:Polymer Branch.svg|thumb|left|Polymer Branch]]

Nanoparticles made from natural polymers that are biodegradable have the abilities to target specific organs and tissues in the body, to carry [[DNA]] for [[gene therapy]], and to deliver larger molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[peptide]]s, and even [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name=Soppimath/&gt; To manufacture these polymeric nanoparticles, the drug molecules are first dissolved and then [[Micro-encapsulation|encapsulated]] or attached to a polymer nanoparticle matrix. Three different structures can then be obtained from this process; nanoparticles, [[nanocapsule]]s (in which the drug is encapsulated and surrounded by the polymer matrix), and nanospheres (in which the drug is dispersed throughout the polymeric matrix in a spherical form).&lt;ref name=Soppimath/&gt;

One of the most important traits for nanoparticle delivery systems is that they must be biodegradable on the scale of a few days.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; A few common polymer materials used for drug delivery studies are polybutyl [[cyanoacrylate]] (PBCA), poly(isohexyl cyanoacrylate) (PIHCA), [[polylactic acid]] (PLA), or polylactide-co-glycolide ([[PLGA]]). [[Human serum albumin]] (HSA) and [[chitosan]] are also materials of interest. PBCA undergoes degradation through [[proteolysis|enzymatic cleavage]] of its [[ester bond]] on the [[alkyl]] side chain to produce [[water-soluble]] byproducts. PBCA also proves to be the fastest biodegradable material, with studies showing 80% reduction after 24 hours post [[intravenous therapy]] injection.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; PIHCA, however, was recently found to display an even lower degradation rate, which in turn further decreases [[toxicity]]. PIHCA, due to this slight advantage, is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials for transporting the drug doxorubicin as a treatment for [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]s.

Coating these polymeric nanoparticle devices with different surfactants can also aid BBB crossing and uptake in the brain. Surfactants such as polysorbate 80, 20, 40, 60, and [[poloxamer]] 188, demonstrated positive drug delivery through the blood–brain barrier, whereas other surfactants did not yield the same results.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; It has also been shown that functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG), can induce the "stealth effect", allowing the drug-loaded nanoparticle to circulate throughout the body for prolonged periods of time.&lt;ref name=Carstens&gt;{{cite book|last=Carstens|first=Myrra G.|title=Observations on the Disappearance of the Stealth Property of PEGylated Liposomes: Effects of Lipid Dose and Dosing Frequency|year=2006|publisher=Liposome Technology|pages=79–94|edition=3rd|author2=Romberg, Birgit |author3=Oussoren, Christien |author4=Storm, Gert |author5=Laverman, Peter |author6= Boerman, Otto C. |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the ''stealth effect'', caused in part by the hydrophilic and flexible properties of the PEG chains, facilitates an increase in localizing the drug at target sites in tissues and organs.&lt;ref name=Carstens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmaso&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salmaso|first=Stefano|author2=Caliceti, Paolo|title=Stealth Properties to Improve Therapeutic Efficacy of Drug Nanocarriers|journal=Journal of Drug Delivery|year=2013|volume=2013|doi=10.1155/2013/374252|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms for delivery ==

=== Liposomes ===
A mechanism for liposome transport across the BBB is [[facilitated diffusion|lipid-mediated free diffusion]], a type of facilitated diffusion, or lipid-mediated [[endocytosis]].&lt;ref name=Amiji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amiji|first=Mansoor|author2=Shah, Lipa |author3=Yadav, Sunita |title=Nanotechnology for CNS delivery of bio-therapeutic agents|journal=Drug Delivery and Translational Research|year=2013|volume=3|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist many [[lipoprotein]] receptors which bind lipoproteins to form complexes that in turn transport the liposome nano-delivery system across the BBB. [[Apolipoprotein]] E (apoE) is a protein that facilitates transport of lipids and cholesterol.&lt;ref name = Amiji/&gt; ApoE constituents bind to nanoparticles, and then this complex binds to a [[LDL receptor|low-density lipoprotein receptor]] (LDLR) in the BBB and allows transport to occur.

[[File:Blood-brain barrier transport en.png|thumb|This diagram shows several ways in which transport across the BBB works. For nanoparticle delivery across the BBB, the most common mechanisms are receptor-mediated transcytosis and adsorptive transcytosis]]

=== Polymeric nanoparticles ===
The mechanism for the transport of polymer-based nanoparticles across the BBB has been characterized as [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] by the brain capillary endothelial cells.&lt;ref name = Kreuter2/&gt; [[Transcytosis]] then occurs to transport the nanoparticles across the tight junction of endothelial cells and into the brain. Surface coating nanoparticles with surfactants such as polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 was shown to increase uptake of the drug into the brain also.&lt;ref name = Kreuter2/&gt; This mechanism also relies on certain receptors located on the [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] surface of endothelial cells of the BBB.&lt;ref name=Masserini/&gt; [[Ligand]]s coated on the nanoparticle's surface bind to specific receptors to cause a conformational change. Once bound to these receptors, transcytosis can commence, and this involves the formation of vesicles from the [[plasma membrane]] pinching off the nanoparticle system after internalization.

Additional receptors identified for receptor-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticle delivery systems are the [[Scavenger receptor (immunology)|scavenger receptor]] class B type I (SR-BI), LDL receptor (LRP1), [[transferrin receptor]], and [[insulin receptor]].&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; As long as a receptor exists on the endothelial surface of the BBB, any ligand can be attached to the nanoparticle's surface to functionalize it so that it can bind and undergo endocytosis.

Another mechanism is ''adsorption mediated transcytosis'', where electrostatic interactions are involved in mediating nanoparticle crossing of the BBB.&lt;ref name= Masserini/&gt; Cationic nanoparticles (including cationic liposomes) are of interest for this mechanism, because their positive charges assist binding on the brain's endothelial cells. Using TAT-[[peptide]]s, a cell-penetrating peptide, to functionalize the surface of cationic nanoparticles can further improve drug transport into the brain.

=== Magnetic and Magnetoelectric nanoparticles ===
In contrast to the above mechanisms, a delivery with magnetic fields doesn't strongly depend on the biochemistry of the brain. In this case, nanoparticles are literally pulled across the BBB via application of a magnetic field gradient. The nanoparticles can be pulled in as well as removed from the brain merely by controlling the direction of the gradient. For the approach to work, the nanoparticles must have a non-zero magnetic moment and have a diameter of less than 50&amp;nbsp;nm. Both magnetic and magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) satisfy the requirements. However, it is only the MENs which display a non-zero magnetoelectric (ME) effect.  Due to the ME effect, MENs can provide a direct access to local intrinsic electric fields at the nanoscale to enable a two-way communication with the neural network at the single-neuron level.&lt;ref&gt;Nair M, Guduru R, Liang P, Hong J, Sagar V, and Khizroev S (2013), “Externally-controlled on-demand release of anti-HIV drug AZTTP using magneto-electric nanoparticles as carriers”. Nature Communications 4: 1707. doi: 10.1038/ncomms2717&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guduru R, Liang P, Hong J, Rodzinski A, Hadjikhani A, Horstmyer J, Levister E, and Khizroev S (2015), “Magnetoelectric “spin” on stimulating the brain”. Nanomedicine (London) 10 (13), 2051-2061. doi: 10.2217/nnm.15.52&lt;/ref&gt; MENs, proposed by the research group of Professor Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU), have been used for targeted drug delivery and externally controlled release across the BBB to treat HIV and brain tumors, as well as to wirelessly stimulate neurons deep in the brain for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and others.

== Toxicity ==
A study was performed to assess the [[toxicity]] effects of doxorubicin-loaded polymeric nanoparticle systems.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; It was found that doses up to 400&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of PBCA nanoparticles alone did not cause any toxic effects on the organism. These low toxicity effects can most likely be attributed to the controlled release and modified [[biodistribution]] of the drug due to the traits of the nanoparticle delivery system.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; Toxicity is a highly important factor and limit of drug delivery studies, and a major area of interest in research on nanoparticle delivery to the brain.

== Research ==
In the early 21st century, extensive research is occurring in the field of nanoparticle drug delivery systems to the brain. One of the common diseases being studied in neuroscience today is Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have been done to show how nanoparticles can be used as a platform to deliver therapeutic drugs to these patients suffering from the disease. A few Alzheimer's drugs that have been studied especially are [[rivastigmine]], [[tacrine]], [[quinoline]], [[piperine]], and [[curcumin]].&lt;ref name=Kreuter2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreuter|first=Jörg|title=Drug delivery to the central nervous system by polymeric nanoparticles: What do we know?|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2013|volume=71|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2013.08.008|pages=2–14|pmid=23981489}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBCA, [[chitosan]], and PLGA nanoparticles were used as delivery systems for these drugs. Overall, the results from each drug injection with these nanoparticles showed remarkable improvements in the effects of the drug relative to non-nanoparticle delivery systems. This possibly suggests that nanoparticles could provide a promising solution to how these drugs could cross the BBB. One factor that still must be considered and accounted for is nanoparticle accumulation in the body. With long-term and frequent injections that are often required to treat [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]] such as Alzheimer's disease, polymeric nanoparticles could potentially build up in the body, causing undesirable effects. This area for concern would have to be further assessed to analyze these possible effects and to improve them.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt;

== Naming of the Centre ==

When founded, the OCHS was for a short time known as the Oxford Centre for Vaishnava and Hindu Studies (OCVHS). The Centre's lean towards [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] traditions was reflective of the fact that its Founding Director, [[Shaunaka Rishi Das]], is a Vaishnava priest. As the Centre grew, it pivoted to become more inclusive and broader in scope regarding Hindu Studies, a decision which resulted in the current name of the OCHS.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aktor|first=Mikael|date=2015|title=Asymmetrical Religious Commitments? Religious Practice, Identity, and Self-Presentation among Western Scholars of Hinduism and Buddhism|url=|journal=Numen|volume=62|pages=265–300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre started out in a suburban house on Divinity Road with only three students and a small library of donated books. It has since moved into a larger office in Madgalen Street, Oxford, with space for student facilities, scholars' rooms, administrative space, and a full-fledged library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iskconnews.org/oxford-centre-for-hindu-studies-campaigns-for-new-home,3635|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Campaigns for New Home|work=ISKCON News|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the OCHS, according to Mikael Aktor, has successfully evolved into "a respected and well-known academic institution that hosts research within a broad spectrum of themes related to the study of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Educational programmes==
Most students of the OCHS are members of Oxford colleges and are studying for Oxford degrees from undergraduate to doctoral levels. Students are reading for degrees in the faculties of Theology and Religion, Oriental Studies, History and Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q593_01_textonly.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234019/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q593_01_textonly.htm|date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the Centre has been inviting scholars to deliver lectures and tutorials at Oxford University. These include recipients of the Shivdasani and J.P. and Beena Khaitain Visiting Fellowships, with the Shivdasani Fellowship sponsoring Indian scholars and the J.P. and Beena Khaitan Fellowship helping scholars from other regions come to Oxford every term.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/OCHS-Academic-Report-2016.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Academic Report 2015–16|last=|first=|date=2016|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these fellowships and student scholarships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeonline.org/financial-assistance/scholarships/hindu-scholarship|title=Hindu Scholarships|date=|publisher=CollegeOnline.org|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre encourages intellectual understanding between cultures of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/as/religiousstudies/alumni/newsletter/faculty-news.php|title=William &amp; Mary - Faculty News|date=2010-11-30|publisher=Wm.edu|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre offers regular lectures and seminars at Oxford, interdisciplinary and broad in their range, including the named Majewski, Wahlstrom and Ford lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasia.ox.ac.uk/events/lectures/events/oxford_centre_for_hindu_studies?SQ_CALENDAR_DATE=2009-02-05|title=Events &amp;#124; South Asian Studies|date=|publisher=Southasia.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2009-10/weekly/280110/lecs.htm#17Ref|title=Oxford University Gazette, 28 January 2010: Lectures|date=|publisher=Ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Centre's longest-standing exchange programs is with [[Aarhus University]], active nearly every term since October 2014. Dr Bjarne Wernicke-Olsen, an OCHS Fellow, established the [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] with the Aarhus University Department for the Study of Religion that enabled the exchange. Danish visiting students are hosted at the Centre for one or more terms as they further their Sanskrit studies. The Centre has also at times hosted large groups of visiting Aarhus students and served as their meeting place for lectures and readings. In Spring 2016, on one such visit, a group of students came to the OCHS for a two-day seminar on the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika|Haṭhayogapradīpikā]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Current research projects ===

==== Bengali Vaishnavism in the Modern Period ====
Project Director: [[Ferdinando Sardella]], Lucian Wong

This project undertakes an interdisciplinary survey of modern Bengali Vaishnavism from the mid-18th century to the mid-20th century. Part of this work involves the mapping, collection, and translation of relevant literature from this period. The six main areas of research in regards to Bengali Vaishnavism are: 1) theology and philosophy, 2) history, 3) transnational currents and the development of modern institutions, 4) case studies and biography, 5) human rights, gender, family, and caste, and 6) theoretical and methodological issues. The project was launched with a workshop at Worcester College (2015) on which a volume was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/bengali-vaishnavism-modern-period|title=Bengali Vaishnavism in the Modern Period|date=2012-03-23|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavata Purana Project ====
Project Directors: [[Radhika Ramana Dasa|Ravi M. Gupta]], [[Kenneth Valpey|Kenneth R. Valpey]]

This research project assesses the [[Bhagavata Purana]] together with its context and consolidates past scholarship on the text. It has been remarkably productive so far. Its first phase saw the publication of a volume of research articles entitled 'Bhagavata: The Bhāgavata Purāṇa: Sacred Text and Living Tradition' (2013) as well as the publication of an annotated and abridged translation of the Bhagavata Purana (2016), both by [[Columbia University Press]]. Phase two of the project was marked by a large international conference in Chennai with the University of Madras that brought together the network of scholars in the field. The [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|BORI]] in its partnership with the OCHS has compiled a database of Bhagavata Purana manuscripts and secondary literature and is assessing a critical edition of the text.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Annual Report 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/bhagavata-purana-research-project|title=Bhagavata Purana Research Project|date=2012-03-23|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/bori-ties-up-with-oxford-centre-for-review-of-bhagvata-purana-edition/|title=BORI ties up with Oxford Centre for review of Bhagvata Purana edition|date=2016-03-12|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shakta Traditions Project ====
Project Directors: Bjarne Wernicke-Olesen, Gavin Flood

The [[Shaktism|Shakta]] Traditions project takes an interdisciplinary approach to investigating Goddess (Devi) worship among the Brahmanical community, in Tantric practices, and at the village level. The project aims to carve out space for the tradition within the Indian religious context by defining its theology, textual lineage, historical evolution, and its relationship to parallel traditions such as [[Shaivism]]. It has produced several international conferences and symposia, such as the international Shakta Traditions conference (2011), as well as numerous conference volumes published by the Oxford University Press and Routledge. In 2018, Bjarne Oleson established a study and research centre for the project in Kathmandu with a focus on manuscript collection and preservation and fieldwork.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2017–18|last=|first=|date=June 2018|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shakta Traditions project resulted from the Memorandum of Understanding between the OCHS and Aarhus University and is run as a collaboration between the two institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/projects-2/|title=Projects - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/sakta-traditions|title=The Sakta Traditions|date=2012-06-12|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Goswami Project ====

Project Managers: Kiyokazu Okita, Rembert Lutjeharms

This project investigates the formative period of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] through research into the Sanskrit writings of the [[Six Goswamis of Vrindavana|Goswamis]], a group of early followers of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Krishna Chaitanya]] whose works provided the theological underpinning of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. The core of the project involves preparing critical editions and translations of important Goswami texts. Other branches of the project involve study of early Gaudiya Vaishnavism's relation to contemporaneous Vaishnava schools, the theology of authors who inspired the Goswamis, how the Goswamis' teachings were developed by later Vaishnavas, and the material culture of the early Gaudiyas. The project was launched with a two-day workshop entitled 'The Building of Vrindavana' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/gosvami-era|title=The Gosvāmī Era: The Founding of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism in Early Modern South Asia|date=2013-04-04|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===
The OCHS has hosted a number of conferences and symposia characterised by their interdisciplinary approach. These gatherings have dealt with a wide range of topics including, the idea of Desire, Women in Hinduism, Philosophy, Archaeology, temple art and architecture, and Shakta Traditions.

The Shivdasani conferences synthesized the work being done in various projects. The first Shivdasani Conference (2007) was held in Trinity College and was titled ''Archaeology and Text: The Temple in South Asia –'' it helped launch the Centre's Archeology and Text Project. The proceedings of this conference were published by Oxford University Press, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Editor, Himanshu Prabha Ray, Archaeology and Text: The Temple in South Asia, Oxford University Press, India 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second Shivdasani Conference (2009) – ''Thinking Inside the Box: The Concept of a Category in Indian Philosophy''– took place at Somerville College. It explored linguistic, aesthetic, and ontological categories as they appear in Indian schools of philosophy, simultaneously bringing these ideas into dialogue with Western methods and launching the Categories in Indian Philosophy research project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/conference-2009.pdf|title=Shivdasani Conference 2009 - Thinking Inside the Box: The Concept of a Category in Indian Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCHS has held several conferences and symposia to help launch and progress the Shakta Traditions project. It held the first international Shakta Traditions conference (2011) with approximately fifty participants and twelve specialist scholars. The conference took an interdisciplinary survey of Shakta history, practice, and doctrine with the aim of exploring the tradition's uniqueness in the context of the Indian religious landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/first-international-sakta-traditions-conference/|title=First International Śākta Traditions Conference 2011 - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also held symposiums on Shakta Traditions in 2017 and in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/sakta-traditions-symposium/|title=Śākta Traditions Symposium - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/sakta-traditions-symposium-ii/|title=Śākta Traditions Symposium II - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to further develop the Bhagavata Purana Project, the OCHS held a conference in Chennai co-hosted by the University of Madras and [[The C.

It was designed by Dr Nick Sutton and Anuradha Dooney in conjunction with Vineet Chander from Princeton University.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The OCHS Annual Report 2014–15|last=|first=|date=2015|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, they, along with Shaunaka Rishi Das, explored the emerging institution of Hindu chaplaincy in a book titled 'Hindu Chaplaincy: The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Guide'. As discussed in the book, they take interest in the task of translating a conventionally Christian notion of Chaplaincy into Hindu terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hindu Chaplaincy: The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Guide|last=Chander|first=Vineet|last2=Sutton|first2=Nicholas|last3=Shaunaka Rishi Das|publisher=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|year=2017|isbn=1999764404|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Bhumi Project ====
The Bhumi Project is one of the OCHS's key outreach programs and aims to mobilize Hindus against climate change globally. It was launched by the OCHS in partnership with the [[Alliance of Religions and Conservation]] in 2009 and with input from the four largest Hindu temples in the UK. Its inauguration was held at Windsor Castle in the presence of Prince Philip and Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations. The project encourages Hindu communities to develop plans to transform their environmental practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/bhumi_overview.pdf|title=The Bhumi Project|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhumi Project uniquely dialogues with these groups by making a case for environmentalism grounded in Hindu scripture, an approach exemplified in its published petition, the "Hindu Declaration on Climate Change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/murali-balaji/a-hindu-call-to-action-in_b_8631290.html|title=A Hindu Call to Action in Fighting Climate Change|last=Balaji|first=Murali|date=2015-11-23|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhumi Project then works with them by providing them with resources and the chance to take on over twenty projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Centre helped launch the Bhumi Pledge in 2015, in which it invited students worldwide to make a pledge to care for the environment and organize an environmental awareness event on their campus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Bhumi Project has also facilitated Hindu Environment Week for several years, in which events to raise awareness of environmental issues are held across the world (India, UK, US) - there were over 10,000 global participants in 2015.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Members of the Bhumi Project have participated in panels, conferences (such as the annual [[COP22]] UN climate change negotiations), and interfaith events (such as the 2017 interfaith talks in Delhi with [[Islamic Relief]] and EcoSikh).&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; The Centre has launched with GreenFaith for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hinduclimatedeclaration2015.org/launch_annoucement|title=Launch Annoucement|work=Bhumi Devi Ki Jai!|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Dow Jones Dharma Index ====

In October 2006, after being invited by the Emerging Markets Group (EMG), the OCHS began work with Dow Jones in creating the Dharma Index. This index serves as an investing guide for Hindu and Buddhist communities by integrating dharmic ethical considerations into its investment calculus. The OCHS brought together academics, financial experts, and religious leaders (both Hindu and Buddhist) to form three committees tasked with creating the Index. The final document contains five indices, one each for the global market, USA, India, UK, and Japan. It also contains an overview of dharmic ethical values along with guidelines for their practical application in investment. The Index was launched on 15 Jan 2008 at the Taj Hotel, Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/dj_report08.pdf|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies &amp; The Dow Jones Dharma Index: A case study in bridge building|last=|first=|date=2008|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The British Hinduism Oral History Project====
For the first time, the experiences of 300 first generation Hindus who settled in Britain were recorded, transcribed, given a web presence, and archived. This three-year project, launched at the Indian High Commission, London, in 2001, was funded by the Heritage Lottery Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/trs/staff/kim_knott.htm|title=Theology and Religious Studies - Faculty of Arts - University of Leeds|date=|publisher=Leeds.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shalini Sharma, The Life of Hindus in Britain, IIAS Newsletter, Number 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Youth Research Project====

The Hindu Youth Research Project, conducted in 2001, is the first survey of its kind in the UK, developed with the assistance of the Hindu Youth Festival 2001. The results have served to make the concerns and experiences of young British Hindus known to government, media and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Santosh and Savita Vij, The Hindu Youth Research Project 2001, The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, Oxford, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.J.

====Digital Shikshapatri====

This project provides online access to an important part of the British Hindu cultural heritage. The [[Shikshapatri]] manuscript is part of the Sanskrit manuscript collection of Oxford's Bodleian Library. The text was written by [[Swaminarayan|Shree Swaminarayan]], founder of Swaminarayan Hinduism, and is a religious manual for daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Rae A. Earnshaw, John A. Vince, Digital convergence: libraries of the future, Springer-Verlag, London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The project aimed at helping people of all backgrounds to better understand the significance of this popular manuscript. The project also proved to be a good example of how scholars and community members successfully worked together for a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/2,6545,15.html|title=Hindu Press International - Vegetarian Journal Poll: Americans 2.3 Percent Vegetarian - Hindu Press International - Hinduism Today Magazine|date=|publisher=Hinduismtoday.com|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a collaborative venture between the OCHS, the Indian Institute Library, and the Refugee Studies Centre of Oxford University, was funded by The New Opportunities Fund, and lasted from 2001-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odl.ox.ac.uk/collections/shikshapatri.htm|title=ODL - Digital Initiatives at Oxford University|date=2004-02-23|publisher=Odl.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships with academic institutions ===

The OCHS has entered into partnerships and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with academic institutions across the world — from India, institutions such as the C.P.

The relevance of such partnerships is exemplified by the Centre's partnership with [[Nepal Sanskrit University]] (NSU) and the [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]] (BORI). Through the MoU with Nepal Sanskrit University in 2014, the Centre gains access to the National Archive of Nepal's large selection of rare, unedited, and unpublished Sanskrit and Nepali manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/nsu-oxford-university-sign-agreement/|title=NSU, Oxford University sign agreement|date=2018-03-25|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, the BORI's partnership with the OCHS on the Bhagavata Purana Project has led to great strides in the project. The BORI is engaging in a lengthy assessment of the critical edition of the Bhagavata Purana published by the BJ Institute of Learning and Research. In collaboration with the OCHS, they are analyzing the methodology used to put together this critical edition, taking into consideration dozens of other manuscripts, and are finally assessing whether the BJ Institute's critical edition is the most genuine manuscript. Besides this, the team has also researched the living traditions of the Bhagavata Purana in Maharashtra and is creating a collection of data on the text of the Bhagavata Purana and related texts. This work has contributed much to the ongoing phase two of the Bhagavata Purana Project.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

The Centre has signed MoUs with places across the globe, including the [[University of Florida]] (UF), the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], and Aarhus University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2010.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2009–10|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UF's collaboration with the OCHS inspired the creation of a centre at the University of Florida called the Centre for the Study of Hindu Traditions (CHiTra), paralleling the OCHS in its aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2007.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2006–7|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's MoU with Aarhus University resulted in a program allowing Sanskrit students at Aarhus to spend a semester at the Centre as visiting students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/news/aarhus-ochs-student-exchange-programme|title=Aarhus-OCHS Student Exchange Programme|date=2014-09-18|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Danish students have taken advantage of this opportunity.

'''Photorealism''' is a genre of art that encompasses [[painting]], [[drawing]] and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a [[photograph]] and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another [[Medium (arts)|medium]]. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American [[art movement]] that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==

===Origins===
As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from [[Pop Art]]&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"&gt;Lindey (1980), pp. 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin&gt;[[Nochlin, Linda]], "The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II", ''Art In America.'' 61 (November–December 1973), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a counter to [[Abstract Expressionism]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt; as well as [[Minimal art|Minimalist art movements]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"&gt;Battock, Gregory. Preface to [[Louis K. Meisel|Meisel, Louis K.]] (1980), ''Photorealism''. New York:[[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. pp 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"/&gt;  Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a [[camera]] and photographs is an acceptance of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt; However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"&gt;Scharf, Aaron (1969), ''Art and Photography'' Baltimore: Allan Lane, The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations;&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"/&gt; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;

By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;  Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as [[Edward Hopper]], they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art.&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"&gt;Chase, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"&gt;Prown, Jules David and Rose, Barbara (1977), ''American Painting: From the Colonial Period to the Present''. New York:Rizzoli. {{ISBN|0847800490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"/&gt;

The association of Photorealism to ''[[Trompe L'oeil]]'' is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709&gt;Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh (1991), ''The Visual Arts: A History,'' 3rd Edition. New York: [[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. p. 709. {{ISBN|0810939134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to "fool the eye" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;

===Definition===
The word ''Photorealism'' was coined by [[Louis K. Meisel]]&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"&gt;[http://www.meiselgallery.com/ Meiselgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show "Twenty-two Realists."&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"&gt;Meisel (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, [[New Realism]], Sharp Focus Realism, or [[hyperrealism (painting)|Hyper-Realism]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12" /&gt;

Louis K. Meisel,&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"/&gt; two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the [[Smithsonian]] in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"/&gt;  The definition for the 'originators' was as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#  The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information.
#  The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semimechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.
#  The Photo-Realist must have the technical ability to make the finished work appear photographic.
#  The artist must have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the central Photo-Realists.
#  The artist must have devoted at least five years to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Styles===
Photorealist painting cannot exist without the [[photograph]].  In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"/&gt;  Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto [[canvas]]es.  Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide.  This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and [[virtuoso|virtuosity]] to simulate, such as [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s in specular surfaces and the [[geometry|geometric]] rigor of man-made environs.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists===
The first generation of American photorealists includes such painters as [[John Baeder]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Charles Bell (painter)|Charles Bell]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Don Eddy]], [[Robert Bechtle]],  and [[Tom Blackwell]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"&gt;Meisel (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--[[landscape]]s (mostly [[cityscape|urban]] rather than naturalistic), [[portrait]]s, and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"/&gt; In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Nora. (October 15, 2015) [http://onmywall.co/photorealism-technical-mastery-and-effortless-style/ "Photorealism - Technical Mastery and Effortless Style"] ''On My Wall''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, [[Duane Hanson]] and [[John DeAndrea]] are [[sculptor]]s associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated [[hair]] and real clothes. They are called ''Verists.''&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980" /&gt;

===Since 2000===

[[File:Glennray Tutor 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dream of Love'' (2005), Oil on canvas. Example of Photorealist [[Glennray Tutor]]'s work]]

Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries.  According to Meisel and Chase's ''Photorealism at the Millennium'', only eight of the original photorealists were still creating photorealist work in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; ten including [[John Baeder]] and Howard Kanovitz.

Artists Charles Bell, John Kacere, and Howard Kanovitz have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, and Don Eddy have moved away from photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.

Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original photorealists.  Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by [[Glennray Tutor]]. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph.  Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with [[Franz Gertsch]] in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and [[Roberto Bernardi]] are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisel, Millennium"/&gt; This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as [[The Prague Project]], in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.

The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as "[[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]."&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media.  The artist [[William Fink|Bill Fink]] has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Photo Realism: Artist Bill Fink uses human ash to create a visual AIDS memorial|author=Steve Greenberg|date=2 June 1992|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|issue=604|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as [[Juxtapoz]]'s 2014 book entitled ''Hyperreal'' detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

'''Physiological condition''' or, more often "physiological conditions" is a term used in [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[medicine]]. It refers to conditions of the external or [[milieu interieur|internal milieu]] that may occur in nature for that organism or cell system, in contrast to artificial [[laboratory]] conditions. A temperature range of 20-40 degrees Celsius, atmospheric pressure of 1, pH of 6-8, glucose concentration of 1-20 mM, atmospheric oxygen concentration, and earth gravity are examples of physiological conditions for most earth organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Casarett and Doulls Toxicology , Basic Science of Poisons|publisher=CTI Reviews|date=26 September 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAQg93xxZyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydroxyl radical.png|thumb|The [[hydroxyl radical]], [[Lewis structure]] shown, contains one unpaired electron]]

In [[chemistry]], a '''radical''' is an [[atom]], [[molecule]], or [[ion]] that has an [[unpaired electron|unpaired valence electron]].&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05066.html ''radical (free radical)''] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05066.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayyan | first1 = M. | last2 = Hashim | first2 = M.A. | last3 = AlNashef | first3 = I.M. | year = 2016 | title = Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications | url = | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 116 | issue = 5| pages = 3029–85 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With some exceptions, these unpaired electrons make radicals highly [[chemical reaction|chemically reactive]].  Many radicals spontaneously [[dimer (chemistry)|dimerize]].  Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.

A notable example of a radical is the [[hydroxyl radical]] (HO•), a molecule that has one unpaired electron on the oxygen atom. Two other examples are [[triplet oxygen]] and [[methylene radical|triplet carbene]] (''':'''{{chem|CH|2}}) which have two unpaired electrons.

Radicals may be generated in a number of ways, but typical methods involve [[redox reaction]]s. [[Ionizing radiation]], heat, electrical discharges, and [[electrolysis]] are known to produce radicals. Radicals are intermediates in many chemical reactions, more so than is apparent from the balanced equations.

Radicals are important in [[combustion]], [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[polymerization]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] chemistry, [[biochemistry]], and many other chemical processes. A large fraction of natural products is generated by radical-generating enzymes.  In living organisms, the radicals [[superoxide]] and [[nitric oxide]] and their reaction products regulate many processes, such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure. They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds. Such radicals can even be messengers in a process dubbed [[redox signaling]].  A radical may be trapped within a ''[[Cage effect (chemistry)|solvent cage]]'' or be otherwise bound.

==Depiction in chemical reactions==
&lt;!-- "Mass spectrum analysis" links here --&gt; 
In chemical equations, radicals are frequently denoted by a dot placed immediately to the right of the atomic symbol or molecular formula as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}_2 \; \xrightarrow{UV} \; 2 {\mathrm{Cl} \cdot}&lt;/math&gt;

Radical [[reaction mechanism]]s use single-headed arrows to depict the movement of single electrons:

[[File:Radical.svg|centre|300px]]

The [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the breaking bond is drawn with a 'fish-hook' arrow to distinguish from the usual movement of two electrons depicted by a standard curly arrow. The second electron of the breaking bond also moves to pair up with the attacking radical electron; this is not explicitly indicated in this case.

Radicals also take part in [[radical addition]] and [[radical substitution]] as [[reactive intermediate]]s. [[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|Chain reactions]] involving radicals can usually be divided into three distinct processes.  These are ''initiation'', ''propagation'', and ''termination''.
*'''Initiation''' reactions are those that result in a net increase in the number of radicals. They may involve the formation of radicals from stable species as in Reaction 1 above or they may involve reactions of radicals with stable species to form more radicals.
*'''Propagation''' reactions are those reactions involving radicals in which the total number of radicals remains the same.
*'''Termination''' reactions are those reactions resulting in a net decrease in the number of radicals. Typically two radicals combine to form a more stable species, for example: 2Cl'''·'''→ Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== Formation ==
&lt;!--[[Single-electron transfer]] and [[Single electron transfer]] redirect here--&gt;

===Homolysis===
Radicals can form by [[Bond cleavage|breaking of covalent bonds]] by [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. The homolytic [[Bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]], usually abbreviated as "Δ''H''{{px1}}°" are a measure of bond strength. Splitting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into 2H•, for example, requires a Δ''H''{{px1}}° of +435 k[[Joule per mole|J'''·'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}]], while splitting Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into 2Cl• requires a Δ''H''{{px1}}° of +243 kJ'''·'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}.  For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.

===From other radicals===
Radicals or charged species add to non-radicals to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain]] reaction.
Being prevalent and a diradical, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with hydroperoxide radical.  This process is related to [[rancidification]] of unsaturated fats.

===One electron redox===
Radicals may also be formed by single-electron [[Redox|oxidation or reduction]] of an atom or molecule.  These redox reactions occur in electrochemical cells and in ionization chambers of mass spectrometers.

==Persistence and stability==
[[File:VitE.gif|frame|right|The radical derived from ''[[tocopherol|α-tocopherol]]'']]
Although radicals are generally short-lived due to their reactivity, there are long-lived radicals. These are categorized as follows:

===Stable radicals===
The prime example of a stable radical is molecular [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Another common example is [[nitric oxide]] (NO). Organic radicals can be long lived if they occur in a [[conjugated system|conjugated π system]], such as the radical derived from [[tocopherol|α-tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]). There are also hundreds of examples of [[Tetrasulfur tetranitride|thiazyl]] radicals, which show low reactivity and remarkable thermodynamic stability with only a very limited extent of π [[resonance stabilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oakley | first1 = Richard T. | title = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 299–391 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.1002/9780470166376.ch4 | format=PDF | url = http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/oakley/papers/rto_086.pdf | department = Cyclic and Heterocyclic Thiazenes (section) | series = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-470-16637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = J | last2 = Banister | first2 = A | last3 = Lavender | first3 = I | title = Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry | volume = 62 | pages = 137–247 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2725(08)60422-5 | department = The Chemistry of Dithiadiazolylium and Dithiadiazolyl Rings (section) =  | series = Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-12-020762-6  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistent radicals===
Persistent radical compounds are those whose longevity is due to [[Steric effects|steric crowding]] around the radical center, which makes it physically difficult for the radical to react with another molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar50097a003|title=Persistent carbon-centered radicals|year=1976|last1=Griller|first1=David|first2=Keith U.|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=9|pages=13–19|last2=Ingold}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these include Gomberg's [[triphenylmethyl radical]], [[Fremy's salt]] (Potassium nitrosodisulfonate, (KSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO·), [[aminoxyls]], (general formula R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO·) such as [[TEMPO]], [[TEMPOL]], nitronyl nitroxides, and azephenylenyls and radicals derived from PTM (perchlorophenylmethyl radical) and TTM (tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical). Persistent radicals are generated in great quantity during combustion, and "may be responsible for the [[oxidative stress]] resulting in cardiopulmonary disease and probably cancer that has been attributed to exposure to airborne fine particles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Lomnicki S.|author2 = Truong H.|author3 = Vejerano E.|author4 = Dellinger B.|title = Copper oxide-based model of persistent free radical formation on combustion-derived particulate matter|journal = Environ. Sci. Technol.|year = 2008|volume = 42|issue = 13|pages = 4982–88|pmid = 18678037|doi = 10.1021/es071708h|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.4982L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diradicals===
[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. Multiple radical centers can exist in a molecule. Atmospheric oxygen naturally exists as a diradical in its ground state as [[triplet oxygen]]. The low reactivity of atmospheric oxygen is due to its diradical state. Non-radical states of dioxygen are actually less stable than the diradical. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., "oxidize". The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.&lt;/ref&gt; Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svensson|first=Mats|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083–84|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactivity==
{{Main|Free radical reaction}}
Radical alkyl intermediates are stabilized by similar physical processes to [[carbocations]]: as a general rule, the more substituted the radical center is, the more stable it is. This directs their reactions. Thus, formation of a tertiary radical (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C·) is favored over secondary (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HC·), which is favored over primary (RH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C·). Likewise,  radicals next to functional groups such as carbonyl, nitrile, and ether are more stable than tertiary alkyl radicals.

Radicals attack double bonds. However, unlike similar ions, such radical reactions are not as much directed by electrostatic interactions. For example, the reactivity of nucleophilic ions with α,β-unsaturated compounds (C=C–C=O) is directed by the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen, resulting in a partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. There are two reactions that are observed in the ionic case: the carbonyl is attacked in a direct addition to carbonyl, or the vinyl is attacked in [[conjugate addition]], and in either case, the charge on the nucleophile is taken by the oxygen. Radicals add rapidly to the double bond, and the resulting α-radical carbonyl is relatively stable; it can couple with another molecule or be oxidized. Nonetheless, the electrophilic/neutrophilic character of radicals has been shown in a variety of instances. One example is the alternating tendency of the copolymerization of [[maleic anhydride]] (electrophilic) and [[styrene]] (slightly nucleophilic).

In intramolecular reactions, precise control can be achieved despite the extreme reactivity of radicals. In general,  radicals attack the closest reactive site the most readily. Therefore, when there is a choice, a preference for five-membered rings is observed: four-membered rings are too strained, and collisions with carbons six or more atoms away in the chain are infrequent.

Triplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s, which are diradicals, have distinctive chemistry.

==Combustion==
[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]
{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}
A familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by ·O-O·. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also "[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.

Combustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).

When a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO·) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO·).

==Polymerization==
In addition to combustion, many [[polymerization]] reactions involve radicals. As a result, many plastics, enamels, and other polymers are formed through [[radical polymerization]]. For instance, [[drying oil]]s and [[alkyd]] paints harden due to radical crosslinking by oxygen from the atmosphere.

Recent advances in radical polymerization methods, known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]], include:
*Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]])
*Atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]])
*Nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP)
These methods produce polymers with a much narrower distribution of molecular weights.

==Atmospheric radicals==
{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}
The most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation—and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1. 3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 4}}, respectively).
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{NO2} -&gt;[h \nu] {NO} + {O}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{O} + {O2} -&gt; {O3}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{NO2} + {O2} -&gt;[h \nu] {NO} + {O3}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{NO} + {O3} -&gt; {NO2} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 4}}}}
In the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the chlorine radical, Cl•, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e., [[Ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2. 2}}–{{EquationNote|eq. 2. 4}} below).
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{CFCS} -&gt;[h \nu] {Cl.}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{Cl.} + {O3} -&gt; {ClO.} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{O3} -&gt;[h \nu] {O} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{O} + {ClO.} -&gt; {Cl.} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{2O3} -&gt;[h \nu] 3O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 5}}}}
Such reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.

==In biology==
{{See also|Dioxygen in biological reactions}}
Radicals play important roles in biology.  Many of these are necessary for life, such as the intracellular killing of bacteria by phagocytic cells such as [[granulocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s. Radicals are involved in [[signal transduction|cell signalling]] processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pacher P, Beckman JS, Liaudet L |title=Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in health and disease |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=315–424 |year=2007 |pmid=17237348 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00029.2006 |pmc=2248324}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[redox signaling]].  For example, radical attack of linoleic acid produces a series of [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]s and [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]s, which may act to regulate localized tissue inflammatory and/or healing responses, pain perception, and the proliferation of malignant cells. Radical attacks on arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid produce a similar but broader array of signaling products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fphys.2013.00366 | volume=4 | title=Lipid peroxidation: pathophysiological and pharmacological implications in the eye | journal=Frontiers in Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DeoxyadenosylRadical.png|thumb|Structure of the [[deoxyadenosyl radical]], a common biosynthetic intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Broderick, J.B.; Duffus, B.R.; Duschene, K.S.; Shepard, E.M. |title=Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2014|volume=114|pages=4229–317|doi= 10.1021/cr4004709}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Radicals may also be involved in [[Parkinson's disease]], senile and drug-induced [[deafness]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Floyd | first1 = R.A. | year = 1999 | title = Neuroinflammatory processes are important in neurodegenerative diseases: An hypothesis to explain the increased formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as major factors involved in neurodegenerative disease development | url = | journal = Free Radical Biology and Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 9–10| pages = 1346–55 | doi =  10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease [[hemochromatosis]], is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including movement disorder, psychosis, skin pigmentary [[melanin]] abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The [[free-radical theory]] of aging proposes that radicals underlie the [[Senescence|aging process]] itself. Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.

Because radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]]. In addition, [[antioxidant]]s play a key role in these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] and [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that [[bilirubin]] and [[uric acid]] can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain radicals. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of [[purine]]s. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to [[jaundice]], which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the role of radicals in biology and of the use of electron spin resonance in their detection may be found in {{cite book|author=Rhodes C.J.|title=Toxicology of the Human Environment – the critical role of free radicals|publisher=Taylor and Francis|place= London|year= 2000|isbn= 0-7484-0916-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactive oxygen species===
[[Reactive oxygen species]] or ROS are species such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hydroxyl radical]], commonly associated with cell damage. ROS form as a natural by-product of the normal metabolism of [[oxygen]] and have important roles in cell signaling.
Two important oxygen-centered radicals are [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radical]]. They derive from molecular oxygen under reducing conditions. However, because of their reactivity, these same radicals can participate in unwanted side reactions resulting in cell damage. Excessive amounts of these radicals can lead to cell injury and [[death]], which may contribute to many diseases such as [[cancer]], [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[diabetes]] and major disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rajamani Karthikeyan |author2=Manivasagam T |author3=Anantharaman P |author4=Balasubramanian T |author5=Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

==History and nomenclature==
[[File:Gombergm01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Moses Gomberg]] (1866–1947), the founder of radical chemistry]]
Until late in the 20th century the word "radical" was used in chemistry to indicate any connected group of atoms, such as a [[methyl|methyl group]] or a [[carboxyl]], whether it was part of a larger molecule or a molecule on its own. The qualifier "free" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and "radical" now implies "free".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.

The term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase "radical" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word "radix" meaning "root"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl "radical" and a hydroxyl "radical". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.

In a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon–containing) radical identified was [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C•.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch|Morris Kharash]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds. I. The Addition of Hydrogen Bromide to Allyl Bromide'' M.S. Kharasch, Frank R. Mayo J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1933, 55, pp. 2468–96 {{DOI|10.1021/ja01333a041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Radicals: Reactive Intermediates with Translational Potential'' Ming Yan, Julian C. Lo, Jacob T. Edwards, and Phil S. Baran J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2016, 138 (39), pp. 12692–714 {{DOI|10.1021/jacs.6b08856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most fields of chemistry, the historical definition of radicals contends that the molecules have nonzero electron spin. However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]], [[chemical reaction]], and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: "any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)".&lt;ref&gt;G. Herzberg (1971), "The spectra and structures of simple free radicals", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostics==
Radicals typically exhibit [[paramagnetism]], but the bulk magnetic properties of an ion or molecule are often not conveniently measured. [[Electron spin resonance]] is instead the definitive and most widely used technique for characterizing radicals.  The nature of the atom bearing the unpaired electron and its neighboring atoms can often be deduced by the EPR spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|last=Chechik|first=Victor|last2=Carter|first2=Emma|last3=Murphy|first3=Damien|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of radicals can also be detected or inferred by [[chemical trap|chemical reagents that trap]] (i.e. combine with) radicals. Often these traps are themselves radicals, such as [[TEMPO]].

[[Image:Carlofelice.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Teatro Carlo Felice]], designed by [[Aldo Rossi]], who is considered the founder of neo-rationalism]]
In architecture, '''rationalism''' is an architectural current which mostly developed from Italy in the 1920s-1930s. [[Vitruvius]] had claimed in his work ''[[De Architectura]]'' that architecture is a science that can be comprehended rationally. This formulation was taken up and further developed in the architectural treatises of the [[Renaissance]]. Progressive art theory of the 18th-century opposed the [[Baroque]] use of [[illusionism]] with the classic beauty of truth and reason.

Twentieth-century rationalism derived less from a special, unified theoretical work than from a common belief that the most varied problems posed by the real world could be resolved by reason. In that respect it represented a reaction to [[historicism (art)|historicism]] and a contrast to [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Expressionism]].

==Enlightenment rationalism==
[[Image:Étienne-Louis Boullée Memorial Newton Night.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Project for an [[Isaac Newton]] memorial by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]].]]
The name rationalism is retroactively applied to a movement in [[architecture]] that came about during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (more specifically, [[neoclassicism]]), arguing that architecture's intellectual base is primarily in science as opposed to reverence for and emulation of archaic traditions and beliefs. Rational architects, following the philosophy of [[René Descartes]] emphasized geometric forms and ideal proportions.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Broadbent |first1=Geoffrey |title=Emerging Concepts in Urban Space Design |year=1990 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold (International) |location=London |isbn=9780747600251}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81–84}}

The French Louis XVI style (better known as [[Neoclassicism]]) emerged in the mid-18th century with its roots in the waning interest of the Baroque period. The architectural notions of the time gravitated more and more to the belief that reason and natural forms are tied closely together, and that the rationality of science should serve as the basis for where structural members should be placed. Towards the end of the 18th century, [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand]], a teacher at the influential École Polytechnique in Paris at the time, argued that architecture in its entirety was based in science.

Other architectural theorists of the period who advanced rationalist ideas include Abbé [[Jean-Louis de Cordemoy]] (1631–1713),&lt;ref name="A History"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kostof |first1=Spiro |title=A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780195034721}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|559}}&lt;ref name="Emergence 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lefaivre |first1=Liane |last2=Tzonis |first2=Alexander |title=The Emergence of Modern Architecture: A Documentary History from 1000 to 1810 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415260244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|265}} the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Carlo Lodoli]] (1690–1761),&lt;ref name="A History"/&gt;{{rp|560}} Abbé [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]] (1713–1769) and [[Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849).&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|87–92}}

The architecture of [[Claude Nicholas Ledoux]] (1736–1806) and [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]] (1728–99) typify Enlightenment rationalism, with their use of pure geometric forms, including spheres, squares, and cylinders.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|92–96}}

==Structural rationalism==
The term structural rationalism most often refers to a 19th-century French movement, usually associated with the theorists [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Auguste Choisy]]. 
Viollet-le-Duc rejected the concept of an ideal architecture and instead saw architecture as a rational construction approach defined by the materials and purpose of the structure.
The architect [[Eugène Train]] was one of the most important practitioners of this school, particularly with his educational buildings such as the [[Collège Chaptal]] and [[Lycée Voltaire (Paris)|Lycée Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Paris Adapts to Meet the Twentieth Century |last1=Froissart-Pezone|first1=Rossella|last2=Wittman|first2=Richard|journal=Studies in the Decorative Arts |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=1999–2000|page=30
 |publisher=University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Bard Graduate Center|jstor=40662721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th-century rationalism==
 [[Image:Como, ex casa del fascio 04.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The former Casa del Fascio in [[Como, Italy]], designed by [[Giuseppe Terragni]].]]

Architects such as [[Henri Labrouste]] and [[Auguste Perret]] incorporated the virtues of structural rationalism throughout the 19th century in their buildings. By the early 20th century, architects such as [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]] were exploring the idea that structure itself could create space without the need for decoration. This gave rise to [[modernism]], which further explored this concept. More specifically, the Soviet Modernist group [[ASNOVA]] were known as 'the Rationalists'.

Rational Architecture (Italian: ''Architettura razionale'') thrived in Italy from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1926, a group of young architects – [[Sebastiano Larco]], [[Guido Frette]], [[Carlo Enrico Rava]], [[Adalberto Libera]], [[Luigi Figini]], [[Gino Pollini]], and [[Giuseppe Terragni]] (1904–43) founded the so-called [[Gruppo 7]], publishing their manifesto in the magazine ''Rassegna Italiana''. Their declared intent was to strike a middle ground between the classicism of the ''[[Novecento Italiano]]'' movement and the industrially inspired architecture of [[Futurism]].&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York |isbn=9780500203958}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203}} Their "note" declared:

{{quote|The hallmark of the earlier avant garde was a contrived impetus and a vain, destructive fury, mingling good and bad elements: the hallmark of today's youth is a desire for lucidity and wisdom...This must be clear...we do not intend to break with tradition...The new architecture, the true architecture, should be the result of a close association between logic and rationality.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|203}}}}
[[Image:Palazzo_Gualino_in_Turin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palazzo Gualino, under renovation, in [[Turin, Italy]] ]]
One of the first rationalist buildings was the [[Palazzo Gualino]] in [[Turin]], built for the financier [[Riccardo Gualino]] by the architects [[Gino Levi-Montalcini]] and [[Giuseppe Pagano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museotorino.it/view/s/9286e70e9b4c47c9828e92515148173e |title=Palazzo Gualino |publisher=MuseoTorino |accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gruppo 7 mounted three exhibitions between 1926 and 1931, and the movement constituted itself as an official body, the Movimento Italiano per l'Architettura Razionale (MIAR), in 1930. Exemplary works include Giuseppe Terragni's [[Casa del Fascio (Como)|Casa del Fascio]] in [[Como]] (1932–36), The Medaglia d'Oro room at the Italian Aeronautical Show in Milan (1934) by Pagano and [[Marcello Nizzoli]], and the Fascist Trades Union Building in [[Como]] (1938–43), designed by Cesare Cattaneo, Pietro Lingeri, Augusto Magnani, L. Origoni, and Mario Terragni.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|205–9}}

Pagano became editor of ''[[Casabella]]'' in 1933 together with Edoardo Persico. Pagano and Persico featured the work of the rationalists in the magazine, and its editorials urged the Italian state to adopt rationalism as its official style. The Rationalists enjoyed some official commissions from the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini, but the state tended to favor the more classically inspired work of the National Union of Architects. Architects associated with the movement collaborated on large official projects of the Mussolini regime, including the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] (begun in 1932) and the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR) in the southern part of [[Rome]] (begun in 1936). The EUR features monumental buildings, many of which evocative of ancient Roman architecture, but absent ornament, revealing strong geometric forms.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|204–7}}

==Neo-rationalism==
In the late 1960s, a new rationalist movement emerged in architecture, claiming inspiration from both the Enlightenment and early-20th-century rationalists. Like the earlier rationalists, the movement, known as the Tendenza, was centered in Italy. Practitioners include [[Carlo Aymonino]] (1926–2010), [[Aldo Rossi]] (1931–97), and [[Giorgio Grassi]]. The Italian design magazine ''Casabella'' featured the work of these architects and theorists. The work of architectural historian [[Manfredo Tafuri]] influenced the movement, and the [[University Iuav of Venice]] emerged as a center of the Tendenza after Tafuri became chair of Architecture History in 1968.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|157 et seq.}} A Tendenza exhibition was organized for the 1973 [[Milan Triennale]].&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|178–183}}

Rossi's book ''L'architettura della città'', published in 1966, and translated into English as ''The Architecture of the City'' in 1982, explored several of the ideas that inform Neo-rationalism. In seeking to develop an understanding of the city beyond simple functionalism, Rossi revives the idea of [[typology (urban planning and architecture)|typology]], following from Quatremère de Quincy, as a method for understanding buildings, as well as the larger city. He also writes of the importance of monuments as expressions of the collective memory of the city, and the idea of place as an expression of both physical reality and history.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|166–72}}&lt;ref name="Post-Modernism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jencks |first1=Charles |title=Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture |year=1987 |publisher=Rizzoli |location=New York |isbn=9780847808359}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178–80}}

Architects such as [[Leon Krier]], [[Maurice Culot]], and [[Demetri Porphyrios]] took Rossi's ideas to their logical conclusion with a revival of Classical Architecture and Traditional Urbanism.  Krier's witty critique of Modernism, often in the form of cartoons, and Porphyrios's well crafted philosophical arguments, such as "Classicism is not a Style", won over a small but talented group of architects to the classical point of view.  Organizations such as the Traditional Architecture Group at the [[RIBA]], and the [[Institute of Classical Architecture]] attest to their growing number, but mask the Rationalist origins.

In Germany, [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]] became the leading practitioner of German rationalism from the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Post-Modernism"/&gt;{{rp|178–80}} Ungers influenced a younger generation of German architects, including [[Hans Kollhoff]], [[Max Dudler]], and [[Christoph Mäckler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durth |first1=Werner |last2=May |first2=Roland |title=Schinkel's Order: Rationalist Tendencies in German Architecture |journal=Architectural Design |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=London |date=September 2007 |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=44–49 |doi=10.1002/ad.514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''robustness''' is used to describe a species with a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] based on strength and a heavy build. The alternative morphology is the [[Gracility|gracile]] body type. 

For example, comparing similar species, [[rat]]s have robust body types while [[Mouse|mice]] are gracile. Male and female members of the same species may display [[sexual dimorphism]] and have robust and gracile morphologies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

The terms "robust" vs. "gracile" are used relatively in the context of [[human evolution]], to distinguish:
*"robust" vs. "gracile" [[australopithecines]], see ''[[Paranthropus]]''
*"robust" [[archaic humans]] vs. "gracile" [[anatomically modern humans]]
*"robust" [[early modern humans]]  ([[Cro-Magnon]]) vs. "gracile" [[Epipaleolithic]] humans ([[Combe-Capelle]])

'''Seipin''' is a homo-oligomeric [[integral membrane protein]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum (ER)]] that concentrates at junctions with cytoplasmic [[lipid droplet]]s (LDs). Alternatively, seipin can be referred to as Bernardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 protein (BSCL2), and it is encoded by the corresponding gene of the same name, i.e. [[BSCL2]]. At protein level, seipin is expressed in cortical neurons in the frontal lobes, as well as motor neurons in the spinal cord.

[[File:SEIPINS.jpg|right|398x398px|''Seipin. Subcellular location'']]

== Structure ==

===Primary structure===
The seipin gene [[BSCL2]] was originally identified in mammals and the fruit fly, and later extended to fungi and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fei W, Shui G, Gaeta B, Du X, Kuerschner L, Li P, Brown AJ, Wenk MR, Parton RG, Yang H | title = Fld1p, a functional homologue of human seipin, regulates the size of lipid droplets in yeast | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 180 | issue = 3 | pages = 473–82 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18250201 | pmc = 2234226 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200711136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human seipin gene is located on [[chromosome 11]]q13, with protein coding on the Crick strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magré J, Delépine M, Khallouf E, Gedde-Dahl T, Van Maldergem L, Sobel E, Papp J, Meier M, Mégarbané A, Bachy A, Verloes A, d'Abronzo FH, Seemanova E, Assan R, Baudic N, Bourut C, Czernichow P, Huet F, Grigorescu F, de Kerdanet M, Lacombe D, Labrune P, Lanza M, Loret H, Matsuda F, Navarro J, Nivelon-Chevalier A, Polak M, Robert JJ, Tric P, Tubiana-Rufi N, Vigouroux C, Weissenbach J, Savasta S, Maassen JA, Trygstad O, Bogalho P, Freitas P, Medina JL, Bonnicci F, Joffe BI, Loyson G, Panz VR, Raal FJ, O'Rahilly S, Stephenson T, Kahn CR, Lathrop M, Capeau J | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of the gene altered in Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy on chromosome 11q13 | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–70 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11479539 | doi = 10.1038/ng585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three validated coding transcripts in GenBank. The [[primary transcript]] originally described, contained 11 [[exon]]s with protein coding beginning on exon 2 and ending in exon 11 (transcript variant 2), resulting in a 398 [[amino acid]] protein with two strongly predicted [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane domains (TMDs)]], coded in exons 2 and 7 (isoform 2).

However, a longer transcript (variant 1) is generated with an alternative first exon containing a translational start site that results in an additional 64 amino acids at the [[N-terminus|N-terminal extension]], 462 amino acids in total (isoform 1).

A third coding transcript (variant 3) splices out exon 7 and produces a shortened and altered carboxy terminus in exon 10, generating a protein of 287 amino acids (isoform 3).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Secondary structure===

The secondary structure of seipin includes a conserved central core domain, and diverse cytosolic N- and C-termini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang W, Thein S, Guo X, Xu F, Venkatesh B, Sugii S, Radda GK, Han W | title = Seipin differentially regulates lipogenesis and adipogenesis through a conserved core sequence and an evolutionarily acquired C-terminus | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 452 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–44 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23458123 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20121870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tertiary structure===
The protein has a short cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane alpha-helix, a water-soluble beta-sandwich domain located in endoplasmic reticulum, and second TM helix.

==Pathophysiology==

There are three different variations of seipin's amino acid sequence:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{UniProt Full|Q96G97|BSCL2 - Seipin - Homo sapiens (Human) - BSCL2 gene &amp; protein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a N → S change in position 88, does not affect protein [[Subcellular localization|subcellular location]]. 
* a S → L change in position 90, does not affect the function in lipid storage.
* a A → P change in position 212 that increases localization to [[Nuclear membrane|nuclear envelope]].

All seipin mutations occur within its loop domain. Between some of these, four large deletions can be found which indicate that at least exons 4 and 5 are required for seipin function in humans. In addition, other six mutations have been identified in the loop domain. The majority of these cluster at the single [[asparagine]]-linked glycosylation site (NVS) in seipin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The two mutations that cause neuronal seipinopathy, N88S and S90L, are located directly within this site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Windpassinger C, Auer-Grumbach M, Irobi J, Patel H, Petek E, Hörl G, Malli R, Reed JA, Dierick I, Verpoorten N, Warner TT, Proukakis C, Van den Bergh P, Verellen C, Van Maldergem L, Merlini L, De Jonghe P, Timmerman V, Crosby AH, Wagner K | display-authors = 6 | title = Heterozygous missense mutations in BSCL2 are associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy and Silver syndrome | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–6 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14981520 | doi = 10.1038/ng1313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from suspending the glycosylation process, these mutations engender an aggregation of seipin and, consequently, the initiation of the ER stress response. The seipin protein can also have a modification residue, that can transform the 289’ and 372’ serine into a [[phosphoserine]], an [[ester]] of [[serine]] and [[phosphoric acid]].

Overexpression of mutated seipin proteins N88S or S90L can also activate [[autophagy]], and substantially altering the sub-cellular distribution of the autophagosome marker GFP-LC3, which leads to a number of large [[vacuole]]s appearing in the [[cytoplasm]]. The sub-cellular location of GFP-LC3 and mutated seipin proteins highly overlap. Moreover, these seipin proteins can diffuse small lipid droplets to fuse into larger lipid.

Seipin mutations have been associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (see below), and mutations in an N-glycosylation motif links seipin to two other disorders, i.e. Silver syndrome and autosomal-dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V.&lt;ref name="pmid16574104"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lundin C, Nordström R, Wagner K, Windpassinger C, Andersson H, von Heijne G, Nilsson I | display-authors = 6 | title = Membrane topology of the human seipin protein | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 580 | issue = 9 | pages = 2281–4 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16574104 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2006.03.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease associations ==

=== Congenital generalized lipodystrophy ===
CGL ([[congenital generalized lipodystrophy]]) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by almost complete loss of adipose tissue (both metabolic and mechanical adipose depots) and an increase of ectopic fat storage in liver and muscle. Of the four CGL types, [[BSCL2]] (Berardinelli-Seip Congenital lipodystrophy type 2), resulting from mutations in the BSCL2/seipin gene, exhibits the most severe lipodystrophic phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wee K, Yang W, Sugii S, Han W | title = Towards a mechanistic understanding of lipodystrophy and seipin functions | journal = Bioscience Reports | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 583–591 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25195639 | pmc = 4182903 | doi = 10.1042/BSR20140114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, these patients could suffer [[dyslipidemia]], [[Fatty liver|hepatic steatosis]], [[insulin]] resistance and [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] due to a cell-autonomous defect in [[Cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Neurological seipinopathies ===
For many years mutations of the seipin gene were associated with a loss of function, such as in CGL (see above). However, recent studies show that mutations such as N88S and S90L seem to have a gain-of-toxic-function which may result in autosomal dominant [[motor neuron disease]]s and [[Distal hereditary motor neuronopathies|distal hereditary motor neuropathy]].

Owing to the wide clinical spectrum of these mutations, it has been proposed to collectively refer to seipin-related motor neuron diseases as seipinopathies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ito D, Suzuki N | title = Seipinopathy: a novel endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated disease | journal = Brain | volume = 132 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 8–15 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18790819 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awn216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms can vary and include: developmental regression of motor and cognitive skills in the first years of life leading to death ([[encephalopathy]]), muscle weakness and spasticity in lower limbs ([[Hereditary spastic paraplegia|spastic paraplegia]] type XVII), weakness of distal muscles of upper limbs (distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V) as well as wasting of the hand muscles (in both cases). Complex forms of seipinopathies may include deafness, dementia or mental retardation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Male infertility ===
Testicular tissue-derived seipin is essential for male fertility by modulating testicular phospholipid homeostasis. The lack of seipin in [[germ cell]]s results in complete male infertility and [[Teratospermia|teratozoospermia]]. [[Spermatid]]s devoid of seipin in germ cells are morphologically abnormal with large ectopic lipid droplets and aggregate in dysfunctional clusters. Elevated levels of [[phosphatidic acid]] accompanied with an altered ratio of [[Polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated]] to [[Monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]] and [[Saturated fat|saturated]] fatty acids show impaired [[phospholipid]] homeostasis during [[spermiogenesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang M, Gao M, Wu C, He H, Guo X, Zhou Z, Yang H, Xiao X, Liu G, Sha J | title = Lack of testicular seipin causes teratozoospermia syndrome in men | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 19 | pages = 7054–9 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24778225 | pmc = 4024893 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1324025111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[spermiogenesis|.]]

According to [[Robin Williams (academic)|Robin A. Williams]] and David Edge (1996), "Central to '''social shaping of technology''' ('''SST''') is the concept that there are choices (though not necessarily conscious choices) inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the direction or trajectory of innovation programs."

If technology does not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, then innovation is a 'garden of forking paths'. Different routes are available, potentially leading to different technological outcomes. Significantly, these choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

SST is one of the models of the technology: society relationship which emerged in the 1980s with MacKenzie and Wajcman's influential 1985 collection, alongside Pinch and Bijker's  [[social construction of technology]] framework and Callon and Latour's [[actor-network theory]]. These have a common feature of criticism of the [[linear model of innovation]] and  [[technological determinism]].  It differs from these notably in the attention it pays to the influence of the social and technological context of development which shapes innovation choices. SST is concerned to explore the material consequences of different technical choices, but criticizes technological determinism, which argues that technology follows its own developmental path, outside of human influences, and in turn, influences society. In this way, social shaping theorists conceive the relationship between technology and society as one of '[[Mutual Shaping|mutual shaping]]'.

Some versions of this theory state that technology affects society by affordances, constraints, preconditions, and unintended consequences (Baym, 2015). Affordance is the idea that technology makes specific tasks easier in our lives, while constraints make tasks harder to complete. The preconditions of technology are the skills and resources  that are vital to using the technology to its fullest potential. Finally, the unintended consequences of technology are unanticipated effects and impact of technology. The cell phone is an example of social shaping of technology (Zulto 2009). The cell phone has evolved over the years to make our lives easier by providing people with handheld computers that can answer calls, answer emails, search for information, and complete numerous other tasks (Zulto, 2009). Yet it has constraints for those that are not technologically savvy, hindering many people in society who do not understand how to utilize these devices. There are preconditions, such as monthly bills and access to electricity. There are also many unintended consequences such as the unintended distraction they cause for many people.

Not only does technology affect society, but according to SST, society affects technology by way of economics, politics, and culture (Baym, 2015). For instance, cell phones have spread in poor countries due to cell phones being more affordable than a computer and internet service (economics), government regulations which have made it fairly easy for cell phone providers to build networks (politics), and the small size of cell phones which fit easily into many cultures’ need for mobile communication (culture).

'''Sociality''' is the degree to which individuals in an [[animal]] [[population]] tend to associate in [[social group]]s ('''gregariousness''') and form cooperative [[societies]].

Sociality is a survival response to [[evolutionary pressure]]s.&lt;ref name="iesbs"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Smelser |editor-first=Neil J. |editor2-last=Baltes |editor2-first=Paul B. |editor-link=Neil J.

This wasp behaviour evidences the most fundamental characteristic of animal sociality: [[parental investment]]. Parental investment is any expenditure of [[resource]]s (time, energy, [[social capital]]) to benefit one's [[offspring]]. Parental investment detracts from a parent's capacity to invest in future reproduction and aid to [[Family|kin]] (including other offspring). An animal that cares for its young but shows no other sociality traits is said to be  ''subsocial''.

An animal that exhibits a high degree of sociality is called a ''social animal''. The highest degree of sociality recognized by sociobiologists is ''[[eusociality]]''. A eusocial [[taxon]] is one that exhibits [[Overlapping generations|overlapping adult generations]], [[Reproduction|reproductive]] [[division of labor]], cooperative care of young, and—in the most refined cases—a biological [[caste system]].

[[Solitary animal|Solitary animals]], such as the [[jaguar]], do not associate except for [[courtship]] and [[mating]]. If an animal taxon shows a degree of sociality beyond courtship and mating, but lacks any of the characteristics of eusociality, it is said to be ''presocial''.&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gadagkar |first=Raghavendra |date=September 1987 |title=What are social insects? |url=http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/hpg/ragh/publication_list/Gadagkar_Publications/Gadagkar_1987b.pdf |format=PDF |journal=IUSSI Indian Chapter Newsletter |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although presocial species are much more common than eusocial species, eusocial species have disproportionately large populations.&lt;ref name="Nowak, Tamita, and Wilson, (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nowak | first1=Martin A. | last2=Tamita | first2=Corina E. | first3=Edward O. | last3=Wilson | year=2010 | title=The Evolution of Eusociality | journal=Nature | volume=466 | issue=7310 | pages=1057–1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | pmid=20740005 | pmc=3279739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presociality ==
The [[entomologist]] [[Charles Duncan Michener|Charles D. Michener]] published a classification system for presociality in 1969, building on the earlier work of Suzanne Batra (who coined the words ''eusocial'' and ''quasisocial'' in 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Michener | first1=C.

In his use of these words, he did not generalize beyond [[insect]]s. [[E. O. Wilson]] later refined Batra's definition of ''quasisocial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.

=== Subsociality ===

Subsociality is common in the animal kingdom. In ''subsocial'' [[taxa]], parents care for their young for some length of time. Even if the period of care is very short, the animal is still described as subsocial. If adult animals associate with other adults, they are not called ''subsocial'', but are ranked in some other classification according to their social behaviours. If occasionally associating or nesting with other adults is a taxon's most social behaviour, then members of those populations are said to be ''solitary but social''. See Wilson (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1971 |title= The Insect Societies |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |isbn=9780674454903 |oclc=199513}}&lt;/ref&gt; for definitions and further sub-classes of varieties of subsociality.

=== Solitary but social ===

{{See also|Solitary animal}}

Solitary-but-social animals forage separately, but some individuals sleep in the same location or share nests. The [[home range]]s of females usually overlap, whereas those of males do not. Males usually do not associate with other males, and male offspring are usually evicted upon maturity. Among [[primate]]s, this form of social organization is most common among the nocturnal [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] species and [[tarsier]]s. Some examples of solitary-but-social species are [[mouse lemur]]s, [[loris]]es, and [[orangutan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sussman |first=R. W. |title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure |chapter=Ecology: General Principles |page=29 |publisher=Pearson Custom Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-536-74363-3 |oclc=57408633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parasociality ===
Sociobiologists place communal, quasisocial, and semisocial animals into a meta-class: the ''parasocial''. The two commonalities of parasocial taxa are the exhibition of parental investment, and socialization in a single, [[Nest|cooperative dwelling]].&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"/&gt;

Communal, quasisocial, and semisocial groups differ in a few ways. In a communal group, adults cohabit in a single nest site, but they each care for their own young. Quasisocial animals cohabit, but they also share the responsibilities of [[Alloparenting|brood care]]. (This has been observed in some [[Hymenoptera]] and spider taxa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0648 | last1=Furey | first1=R. E. | title=Two cooperatively social populations of the theridiid spider Anelosimus studiosus in a temperate region | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=55 | issue=3 |pages=727–735 | year=1998 | pmid=9515053}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in some other [[invertebrate]]s.)&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"/&gt; A semisocial population has the features of communal and quasisocial populations, but they also have a biological caste system that delegates labor according to whether or not an individual is able to reproduce.

Beyond parasociality is eusociality. Eusocial insect societies have all the characteristics of a semisocial one, except overlapping generations of adults cohabit and share in the care of young. This means that more than one adult generation is alive at the same time, and that the older generations also care for the newest offspring.

== Eusociality ==
[[File:Natural Beehive and Honeycombs.jpg|thumb|alt=Bees almost completely cover a honeycomb suspended from a tree branch.|[[Giant honey bee]]s cover the [[honeycomb]] of their nest.]]
{{Main|Eusociality|Evolution of eusociality}}

Eusocial societies have overlapping adult generations, cooperative care of young, and division of reproductive labor. When organisms in a species are born with physical characteristics specific to a caste which never changes throughout their lives, this exemplifies the highest acknowledged degree of sociality. Eusociality has evolved in several orders of insects. Common examples of eusociality are from Hymenoptera ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, [[Sawfly|sawflies]], and wasps) and [[Blattodea]] (infraorder [[Isoptera]], termites), but some [[Coleoptera]] (such as the beetle ''[[Austroplatypus incompertus]]''),  [[Hemiptera]] (bugs such as ''[[Pemphigus spyrothecae]]''), and [[Thysanoptera]] (thrips) are described as eusocial. Eusocial species that lack this criterion of morphological caste differentiation are said to be ''primitively eusocial''.&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"/&gt;

Two potential examples of primitively eusocial mammals are the [[naked mole-rat]] and the [[Damaraland mole-rat]] (''Heterocephalus glaber'' &amp; ''Fukomys damarensis'', respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Burda | first1=H. Honeycutt | last2=Begall | first2=S. | last3=Locker-Grutjen | first3=O | last4=Scharff | first4=A. | year=2000 | title=Are naked and common mole-rats eusocial and if so, why? | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1456956 | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=47 | issue=5| pages=293–303 | doi=10.1007/s002650050669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both species are [[diploid]] and highly [[inbred]], and they aid in raising their siblings and relatives, all of whom are born from a single reproductive queen. They usually live in harsh or limiting environments. However, a study conducted by O’Riain and Faulkes in 2008 suggests that due to regular [[inbreeding avoidance]], mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient.&lt;ref name="O'Riain and Faulkes, (2008)"&gt;{{cite book | last1=O'Riain | first1=M.J. | last2=Faulkes | first2=C.

Eusociality has arisen among some [[crustacean]]s that live in groups in a restricted area. ''[[Synalpheus regalis]]'' are parasitic shrimp that rely on fortress defense. They live in groups of closely related individuals, amidst tropical [[reef]]s and [[sponge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple origins of eusociality among sponge-dwelling shrimps (''Synalpheus'')|first=J. Emmett|last=Duffy |author2=Cheryl L.

As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|title=On the frequency of eusociality in snapping shrimps (Decapoda: Alpheidae), with description of a second eusocial species|author=Duffy, J.

'''Tacet''' is [[Latin]] which translates literally into English as "(it) is silent" (pronounced: {{IPA|/ˈte.sət/}}, {{IPA|/ˈtæ.sət/}}; or {{IPA|/ˈtɑ.ˌkɛt/}}).&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Tacet|accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a musical term to indicate that an instrument or voice does not sound, also known as a [[rest (music)|rest]]. In vocal polyphony and in orchestral scores, it usually indicates a long period of time, typically an entire [[Movement (music)|movement]]. In more modern music such as [[jazz]], tacet tends to mark considerably shorter breaks. '''Multirests''', or multiple-measure rests, are rests which last multiple [[bar (music)|measures]] (or multiple rests, each of which lasts an entire measure).

{{Quote|Tacet. (Lat.) A word by which the performer is to understand that the instrument with the name of which it is conjoined is to be silent: a ''Violino Tacet''; the violin is not to play: ''Oboe Tacet''; the oboe is silent.|[[Thomas Busby (composer)|Thomas Busby]] (1827)&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Thomas (1827). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJFRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT272&amp;dq=tacet+music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOyujejZ_WAhVRyWMKHf0mAfYQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=tacet%20music&amp;f=false Complete Dictionary of Music]'', p.z2. Snider. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was common for early [[Symphony|symphonies]] to leave out the [[brass instrument|brass]] or [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] in certain movements, especially in slow (second) movements, and this is the instruction given in the parts for the player to wait until the end of the movement.

[[File:Old multirests.png|thumb|How multirests used to be notated (see [[longa (music)|longa]], [[double whole note|breve]], and [[semibreve]])]]
[[File:15 bars multirest.png|thumb|How multirests are now notated, known as the H-bar (which may be narrow, leaving room for things such as an [[anacrusis]] to be written in)]]

It is also commonly used in [[accompaniment]] music to indicate that the instrument does not play on a certain run through a portion of the music, i.e., "Tacet 1st time." The phrase ''tacet al fine'' is used to indicate that the performer should remain silent for the remainder of the piece (or portion thereof), and need not, for example, count rests.

Tacet may be appropriate when a particular instrument/voice/section, "is to rest for an entire section, movement, or composition."&lt;ref&gt;McGrain, Mark (1990). ''Music Notation'', p.126. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Partial rests, of course, in every case must be written in. Even though it means 'silent,' the term ''tacet''...is not a wise substitution for a lengthy rest within a movement...The term ''tacet'', therefore, should be used ''only'' to indicate that a player rests throughout an ''entire movement''. In printed music this would be indicated:"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]] (1969/1979). ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'', p.435-7. 2nd edition. Crescendo Publishing, part of Taplinger Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8008-5453-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{center|II. TACET}}

==Uses of tacet==
The earliest known usage of the term is 1724.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

A unique usage of this term is in [[John Cage|John Cage's]] 1952 composition [[4′33″]].  A tacet is indicated for all three movements, for all instruments.  The piece lasts a total of 4 minutes and 33 seconds, without a note being played.

'''''The New Jerusalem''''' is a [[1920 in literature|1920]] [[book]] written by British writer [[G. K. Chesterton]].

==Quotes==
*"On the road to Cairo one may see twenty groups exactly like that of the Holy Family in the pictures of the Flight into Egypt; with only one difference. The man is riding on the ass."
*"The real mistake of the Muslims is something much more modern in its application than any particular passing persecution of Christians as such. It lay in the very fact that they did think they had a simpler and saner sort of Christianity, as do many modern Christians. They thought it could be made universal merely by being made uninteresting. Now a man preaching what he thinks is a platitude is far more intolerant than a man preaching what he admits is a paradox. It was exactly because it seemed self-evident, to Muslims as to Bolshevists, that their simple creed was suited to everybody, that they wished in that particular sweeping fashion to impose it on everybody."

[[File:Filoloski Knez.jpg|thumb|185px|'''Faculty of Philology''', view from [[Prince Michael Street]]]]
The '''Faculty of Philology ''' is one of the constituent schools of the [[University of Belgrade]]. The school's purpose is to train and educate its students in the academic study or practice in [[linguistics]] and [[philology]].

==History==
The study of philology was established in [[Belgrade]] within the [[University_of_Belgrade#History|Belgrade Higher School]]'s Department of Philosophy in 1808. The Department of Philology gained independence from the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]] in 1960. Many eminent international philologists contributed to the development of the Faculty of Philology, e.g. Russian Slavist Platon Kulikovsky, who was a visiting professor at the Higher School between 1877 and 1882, was the founder of Russian studies in Serbia; Englishman David Law started teaching English language and literature classes in 1907 and paved the way for the English Department (founded in 1929). Bruno Gujon from Italy worked at the Faculty from 1912 to 1914 and paved the way for Italian studies. During the post Second World War period the school established new departments, e.g. [[Romanian Language]] and Literature (1963), [[Spanish Language]] and Literature (1971), [[Arabic]] and [[Turkish Language]] and Literature Departments (1960), [[Chinese Language]] and Literature (1974), [[Japanese Language]] and Literature (1985), Scandinavian Languages (Swedish, Danish, Norwegian in 1986, starting with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] Lectorate in 1979), Lectorates for [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (1987), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (1989), [[Hebrew]] (1990), Library Science Department (1963), General [[Linguistics]] Department (1990), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] Studies Department (1994), [[Greek Language]] and Literature Department (1995), et at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fil.bg.ac.rs/eng/istorijat.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719224222/http://www.fil.bg.ac.rs/eng/istorijat.html |archive-date=2010-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Amazon Echo Plus 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Amazon Echo]], an example of a voice computer]]
'''Voice computing''' is the discipline that develops hardware or software to process voice inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Schwoebel, J. (2018). An Introduction to Voice Computing in Python. Boston; Seattle, Atlanta: NeuroLex Laboratories. https://neurolex.ai/voicebook&lt;/ref&gt;

It spans many other fields including [[human-computer interaction]], [[conversational computing]], [[linguistics]], [[natural language processing]], [[automatic speech recognition]], [[speech synthesis]], [[audio engineering]], [[digital signal processing]], [[cloud computing]], [[data science]], [[ethics]], [[law]], and [[information security]].

Voice computing has become increasingly significant in modern times, especially with the advent of [[smart speakers]] like the [[Amazon Echo]] and [[Google Assistant]], a shift towards [[serverless computing]], and improved accuracy of [[speech recognition]] and [[text-to-speech]] models.

==History==
Voice computing has a rich history.&lt;ref&gt;Timeline for Speech Recognition. https://medium.com/swlh/the-past-present-and-future-of-speech-recognition-technology-cf13c179aaf&lt;/ref&gt; First, scientists like [[Wolfgang Kempelen]] started to build speech machines to produce the earliest synthetic speech sounds. This led to further work by Thomas Edison to record audio with [[dictation machines]] and play it back in corporate settings. In the 1950s-1960s there were primitive attempts to build automated [[speech recognition]] systems by [[Bell Labs]], [[IBM]], and others. However, it was not until the 1980s that [[Hidden Markov Models]] were used to recognize up to 1,000 words that speech recognition systems became relevant.

|}

Around 2011, [[Siri]] emerged on Apple iPhones as the first voice assistant accessible to consumers. This innovation led to a dramatic shift to building voice-first computing architectures. [[PS4]] was released by Sony in North America in 2013 (70+ million devices), Amazon released the [[Amazon Echo]] in 2014 (30+ million devices), [[Microsoft]] released Cortana (2015 - 400 million Windows 10 users), Google released [[Google Assistant]] (2016 - 2 billion active monthly users on Android phones), and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released [[HomePod]] (2018 - 500,000 devices sold and 1 billion devices active with iOS/Siri). These shifts, along with advancements in cloud infrastructure (e.g. [[Amazon Web Services]]) and [[codecs]], have solidified the voice computing field and made it widely relevant to the public at large.

==Hardware==
A &lt;strong&gt;voice computer&lt;/strong&gt; is assembled hardware and software to process voice inputs.

Note that voice computers do not necessarily need a screen, such as in the traditional [[Amazon Echo]]. In other embodiments, traditional [[laptop computers]] or [[mobile phones]] could be used as voice computers. Moreover, there has become increasingly more interfaces for voice computers with the advent of [[Internet of things|IoT]]-enabled devices, such as within cars or televisions.

As of September 2018, there are currently over 20,000 types of devices compatible with Amazon Alexa.&lt;ref&gt;Voicebot.AI. https://voicebot.ai/2018/09/02/amazon-alexa-now-has-50000-skills-worldwide-is-on-20000-devices-used-by-3500-brands/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
&lt;strong&gt;Voice computing software&lt;/strong&gt; can read/write, record, clean, encrypt/decrypt, playback, transcode, transcribe, compress, publish, featurize, model, and visualize voice files.

Here are some popular software packages related to voice computing:

==Legal considerations==
In the United States different states have varying [[telephone recording laws]]. In some states, it is legal to record a conversation with the consent of only one party, in others the consent of all parties is required.

Moreover, [[COPPA]] is a significant law to protect minors on the internet. With an increasing number of minors interacting with voice computing devices (e.g. the Amazon Alexa), the [[Federal Trade Commission]] recently relaxed the COPAA rule so that kids can issue voice searches and commands.&lt;ref&gt;Techcrunch. https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/ftc-relaxes-coppa-rule-so-kids-can-issue-voice-searches-and-commands/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, [[GDPR]] is a new European law that governs the [[right to be forgotten]] and many other clauses for EU citizens. GDPR also is clear that companies need to outline clear measures to obtain consent if audio recordings are made and define the purpose and scope as to how these recordings will be used (e.g. for training purposes). The bar for valid consent has been raised much higher under the GDPR. Consents must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous; tacit consent is no longer be enough.&lt;ref&gt;IAPP. https://iapp.org/news/a/how-do-the-rules-on-audio-recording-change-under-the-gdpr/&lt;/ref&gt;

All these things make it quite unclear how voice computing technology will be regulated into the future.

==Research Conferences==
There are many research conferences that relate to voice computing. Some of these include:
* [[International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing]]
* Interspeech &lt;ref&gt;Interspeech 2018. http://interspeech2018.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* AVEC &lt;ref&gt;AVEC 2018. http://avec2018.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

* ACII2019 The 8th Int'l Conf. on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction &lt;ref&gt;ASCII 2019. http://acii-conf.org/2019/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developer community==
Google Assistant has roughly 2,000 actions as of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Voicebot.ai. https://voicebot.ai/2018/01/24/google-assistant-app-total-reaches-nearly-2400-thats-not-real-number-really-1719/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5891">The '''wind profile power law''' is a relationship between the wind speeds at one height, and those at another.

==Definition==

The wind profile power law relationship is :

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{u}{u_r} = \bigg(\frac{z}{z_r} \bigg)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed (in metres per second) at height &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; (in metres), and &lt;math&gt;u_r&lt;/math&gt; is the known wind speed at a reference height &lt;math&gt;z_r&lt;/math&gt;. The exponent (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) is an empirically derived coefficient that varies dependent upon the stability of the atmosphere.  For [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|neutral stability]] conditions, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is approximately 1/7, or 0.143.

In order to estimate the wind speed at a certain height ''z'', the relationship would be rearranged to:

:&lt;math&gt;u = u_r\bigg(\frac{z}{z_r} \bigg)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The value of 1/7 for α is commonly assumed to be constant in wind resource assessments, because the differences between the two levels are not usually so great as to introduce substantial errors into the estimates (usually &lt; 50 m).  However, when a constant exponent is used, it does not account for the roughness of the surface, the displacement of calm winds from the surface due to the presence of obstacles (i.e., zero-plane displacement), or the stability of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Touma, J.S., 1977, ''Dependence of the wind profile power law on stability for various locations'', J. Air Pollution Control Association, Vol. 27, pp. 863-866&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Counihan, J., 1975, ''Adiabatic atmospheric boundary layers: A review and analysis of data from the period 1880-1972'', Atmospheric Environment, Vol.79, pp. 871-905&lt;/ref&gt; In places where trees or structures impede the near-surface wind, the use of a constant 1/7 exponent may yield quite erroneous estimates, and the [[log wind profile]] is preferred. Even under neutral stability conditions, an exponent of 0.11 is more appropriate over open water (e.g., for offshore wind farms), than 0.143,&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, S.A., E.A. Meindl, and D.B. Gilhousen, 1994, ''Determining the power-law wind-profile exponent under near-neutral stability conditions at sea'', J. Appl. Meteor., Vol. 33,  pp. 757-765&lt;/ref&gt; which is more applicable over open land surfaces.

==Limits==

The wind profile of the atmospheric [[boundary layer]] (surface to around 2000 metres) is generally logarithmic in nature and is best approximated using the [[log wind profile]] equation that accounts for surface roughness and atmospheric [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability]]. The relationships between surface power and wind are often used as an alternative to logarithmic wind features when surface roughness or stability information is not available.

==Applications==

The power law is often used in [[wind power]] assessments&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D.L., C.G. Holladay, W.R. Barchet, H.P. Foote, and W.F. Sandusky, 1986, Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, WA. [http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/ Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, E.W. and J.P. Hennessey, Jr., 1978, ''On the use of power laws for estimates of wind power potential'', J. Appl. Meteorology, Vol. 17, pp. 390-394&lt;/ref&gt; where wind speeds at the height of a turbine (
&lt;math&gt;\ge &lt;/math&gt; 50 metres) must be estimated from near surface wind observations (~10 metres), or where wind speed data at various heights must be adjusted to a standard height&lt;ref&gt;Robeson, S.M., and Shein, K.A., 1997, ''Spatial coherence and decay of wind speed and power in the north-central United States'', Physical Geography, Vol. 18, pp. 479-495&lt;/ref&gt; prior to use. Wind profiles are generated and used in a number of [[List of atmospheric dispersion models|atmospheric pollution dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power density===

Estimates of wind power density are presented as wind class, ranging from 1 to 7. The speeds are average wind speeds over the course of a year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/tables/A-8T.html Classes of wind power density at 10 m and 50 m]&lt;/ref&gt; although the frequency distribution of wind speed can provide different power densities for the same average wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/tables/1-2T.html Comparison of annual average wind power at three sites with identical wind speeds.]&lt;/ref&gt;
