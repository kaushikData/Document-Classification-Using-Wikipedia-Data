      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">'''!Wowow!''' is a [[artist collective|collective]] in [[Peckham]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radnofsky|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise known as '''The Children of !Wowow!''', they are a group of artists, fashion designers, writers and musicians, who have promoted numerous art events and parties in London and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

!Wowow! began in the back of the Joiners Arms in [[Camberwell]] in 2003 as a performance night in a pub by Hanna Hanra and [[Matthew Stone]]. In 2004, the collective squatted a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] co-op in Peckham South East London and made it into an [[artist-run space]]. They include fashion designer [[Gareth Pugh]],&lt;ref name=timeout&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[performance art]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ist [[List of The Bill characters (A–D)#Millie Brown|Millie Brown]], video installation artist [[Adham Faramawy]], James Balmforth and artist [[Matthew Stone]]. Other artists to have shown in the space include [[Boo Saville]], Gareth Cadwallader, and Ellie Tobin.&lt;ref name=watkins&gt;{{harvnb|Watkins|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, !Wowow! organised warehouse parties in [[Peckham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times club nights with 2000 people took place.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt; One of these was attended by [[Lauren Bush]], the former U.S. President's niece, and her two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] bodyguards.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt;

The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings, film, photography and performance by recent [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade]] graduates for a month in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building at 251 Rye Lane, Peckham, formerly occupied by the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] shop, which the artists gutted and refurbished.&lt;ref name=hoggard&gt;{{harvnb|Hoggard|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists, who curated the exhibition together, included [[Chloe Dewe Mathews]] with photographs of [[lido]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Matthew Stone]] with digital recreations of old paintings, Rachael Haines with surrealist inspired collages and Boo Saville with monkey paintings and [[Ballpoint pen|biro]] drawings.&lt;ref name=hoggard/&gt; The opening featured [[shamanism|shamanistic]] chanting, a shopping Trolley Mardi Gras, live bands and a recreation of [[Michael Jackson]]'s video [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|''Thriller'']] by [[Performance art|performance]] artist [[Marvin Gaye Chetwynd|Lali Chetwynd]]'s troupe.&lt;ref name=hoggard/&gt;

In November 2005, the Children of !Wowow! organised a week-long event in a large warehouse in Peckham, curated by member Gareth Cadwallader, and in a number of smaller venues in the area, featuring members of the collective and also [[Mark McGowan (performance artist)|Mark McGowan]].&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt; Events included ''Stolen Cinema'' with cult films from a local rental shop, Richard Elms' play ''Factory Dog'', and a ''Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast'' presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown.&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt; he week culminated with a party for 1,500 people, with 10,000 bottles of beer, 500 bottles of [[whisky|whiskey]], and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew, Ludes, The Long Blondes, and Ivich Lives.&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt;

The Amazing squat created its own "distinctly odd harlequin-esque fashion style", through Gareth Pughs' participation.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt; Hanna Hanra and Katie Shillingford edited ''Fashion/ Art/ Leisure'', a fanzine affiliated with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Stone]] said:
{{quote|text=It was an opportunity to invest in what we believed in, rather than chipping off bits of our soul working as unpaid interns. The practicalities of not having to work meant that we could be playful with what we did, but some serious ideas came out of that ridiculous house.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt;}}

Since the Imperials left their original building in 2006, they have organised events in Dresden and also squatted a Kwik Fit Garage in Camberwell for an exhibition. Millie Brown and [[Adham Faramawy]] have organised several art and music events. These have included an event in March 2007 in Birmingham. Along with the original group, several other artists and performers exhibited, including [[Theo Adams]], [[Ben Schumacher]], [[Lennie Lee]], and Fayann Smith.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''''23 Minutes Over Brussels''''' is a recording of a live performance by [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] on June 16, 1978, at the [[Ancienne Belgique]] in [[Brussels]], Belgium, while supporting [[Elvis Costello]] and [[The Clash]]. The recording was first released as a promo in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/suicide/21__minutes_in_berlin___23_minutes_in_brussels/ |title=21½ Minutes in Berlin / 23 Minutes in Brussels by Suicide : Reviews and Ratings - Rate Your Music|publisher=rateyourmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained largely unheard until its release in 1998 with the reissue of the band's [[Suicide (1977 album)|self-titled debut album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Suicide-Suicide/release/627068 |title=Suicide - Suicide (CD, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording "gives some indication of the public's reaction to this confrontational duo in their heyday".&lt;ref name="Hear Before You Die Page 386"&gt;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2008 Edition)-Dimmery, Robert Page 386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A friend of the band, Howard Thompson, recorded the performance on cassette tape, and it was later released as a flexi-disc insert for a music magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ Recording notes&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, while [[Mute Records]] was rereleasing Suicide's catalog, the tape was remastered and included as a bonus track for their [[Suicide (1977 album)|first album]]. The entire performance is mixed as a single track.

==History==

Before Suicide even starts playing, booing can be heard from the crowd indicating that they wanted to hear the main act, [[Elvis Costello]], straight away. Suicide is introduced and begins to play "Ghost Rider". Once it ends, there is booing from the crowd. The second song is "Rocket U.S.A". After that, at roughly 9:30, the audience can be heard chanting "ELVIS! ELVIS!". This attitude continues through the third and fourth songs, "Cheree" and "Dance".

The audience becomes more active during the performance of "[[Frankie Teardrop]]". At roughly 19:30, loud applause can be heard; someone steals [[Alan Vega]]'s microphone (a woman at 20:35 can be heard saying "They took the mic"). Shortly afterwards, the music stops and the promoter comes on, warning the audience that if they don't give the microphone back, there will be "no show". Vega joins in, swearing at the audience. After receiving the microphone, he continues to sing "Frankie Teardrop" [[a cappella]]. After even more booing, Vega shouts "SHUT THE FUCK UP! THIS IS ABOUT FRANKIE!". A few moments later, there is rapturous applause as the band leaves the stage.

Later, Elvis Costello played a very short and angry set in which he made no secret of his outrage over Suicide's treatment by the crowd. This incited a riot. The show was cancelled and Vega's nose was broken. The story is detailed in the liner notes of the 2000 re-release.&lt;ref name="headheritage1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ |title=Julian Cope presents Head Heritage &amp;#124; Unsung &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Suicide - 23 Minutes Over Brussels |publisher=Headheritage.co.uk |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack |url=http://poundforpound.blogspot.com/2008/12/suicide-23-minutes-over-brussels.html |title=Pound for Pound: Suicide - 23 Minutes Over Brussels |publisher=Poundforpound.blogspot.com |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Suicide would only become famous after the peak of their activity was over. During the 1980s and 90s, they were responsible for influencing many bands and shaping genres such as [[industrial music]], [[dance music]] and notably [[electroclash]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This performance has been called "a record of proof of an innovative band’s struggle with an unreceptive audience" and has been compared to the audience's reactions to [[Electric Dylan controversy|Dylan going electric]]. It also "clearly demonstrates two individuals flying in the face of convention, screaming their guts out to be heard, and failing to make a poignant imprint on the listening audience".&lt;ref name="headheritage1"/&gt; [[Allmusic]] said that "though the (reissues) extra tracks dilute the original album's impact somewhat, they're worthwhile supplements to one of the punk era's most startlingly unique works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phares |first=Heather |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r19328/review |title=Suicide [First Album&amp;#93; - Suicide |publisher=AllMusic |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In review of their debut album for [[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]], [[Chris Shade]] called it a "riotous comedy", and noted that "(their) lack of [[rock 'n' roll]] accoutrements such as a drummer or guitarist often aroused violent reactions in their bewildered audiences".&lt;ref name="Hear Before You Die Page 386"/&gt;

[[File:Adrian-Ross-1904.jpg|thumb|right|Ross in 1904]]
'''Arthur Reed Ropes''' (23 December 1859 – 11 September 1933), better known under the pseudonym '''Adrian Ross''', was a prolific writer of lyrics, contributing songs to more than sixty British [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  He was the most important lyricist of the British stage during a career that spanned five decades.  At a time when few shows had long runs, nineteen of his [[West End theatre|West End]] shows ran for over 400 performances.

Starting out in the late 1880s, Ross wrote the lyrics for the earliest British musical theatre hits, including ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894) and ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896).  Ross next wrote the lyrics for a string of hit musicals, beginning with ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899), ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900) and ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901) and continuing without a break through [[World War I]].  He also wrote the English lyrics for a series of hit adaptations of European operettas beginning with ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' in 1907.

During World War I, Ross was one of the founders of the [[Performing Rights Society]].  He continued writing until 1930, producing several more successes after the war.  He also wrote the popular novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' and a number of short stories.

==Life and career==
Ross was born in [[Lewisham]], London.  He was the youngest son and fourth child of Ellen Harriet Ropes née Hall, of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and William Hooper Ropes, a Russia merchant.  Ross's parents lived in [[Normandy]], France, but sent him to school in London at Priory House School in [[Clapton, London|Clapton]], [[Mill Hill School]], and the [[City of London School]].  He later attended [[King's College, Cambridge]], where, in 1881, he won the Chancellor's Medal for English verse for his poem "Temple Bar", and also won the Members' Prize for the English essay.  In 1883 he graduated with a first-class degree, winning the Lightfoot scholarship for history and a Whewell scholarship for international law.  He was elected a fellow of the College.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=RPS878AR|name=Ropes, Arthur Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Parker, J., rev. Katharine Chubbuck. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35826 "Ropes, Arthur Reed (1859–1933)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Cambridge University]] graduate and [[academia|don]], teaching history and poetry from 1884 to 1890 and writing serious and comic verse of his own, the first volume of which was published in 1884. In 1889, he published "A Sketch of the History of Europe". He was also a translator of French and German literature under his own name.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He created the fictitious name "Adrian Ross" due to a concern that writing musicals would compromise his academic career.&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/who7c.htm "Who's Who in Musicals: Ross, Adrian"], Musicals101.com: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[Image:Moroccobound1.jpg|left|thumb|A. C. Seymour and [[Letty Lind]] in ''[[Morocco Bound]]'']]
During a brief illness in 1883 after catching cold at the University Boat Race, Ross used the lonely time in bed to write the libretto of an entertainment entitled ''A Double Event''. This was produced at [[St. George's Hall, London]] in 1884 with music by [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]], and Ross used the name "Arthur Reed". His next work for the stage, also as Arthur Reed, was the book and lyrics for a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], ''Faddimir'' (1889 at the [[Opera Comique]]), with music by fellow Cambridge graduate, [[F. Osmond Carr]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The piece earned enough praise so that the impresario [[George Edwardes]] commissioned the two to write another burlesque, together with the comic actor John Lloyd Shine, called ''Joan of Arc''.  Songs from the piece included "I Went to Find Emin", "Round the Town", and "Jack the Dandy-O".  ''Joan of Arc'' opened in 1891 at the Opera Comique starring [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]] and [[Marion Hood]]; he wrote under the pseudonym Adrian Ross, which he used for the rest of his career. The piece was a hit, lasting for almost eight hundred performances, and Ross resigned from Cambridge.  To supplement his income from theatre writing, Ross became a contributor to such journals as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''Sketch'', ''Sphere'' and ''The World'', and he joined the staff of ''Ariel'' in 1891–1892.  He wrote in ''[[Tatler (1901)|The Tatler]]'' under the pseudonym Bran Pie and in 1893 published an edition of [[Lady Mary Wortley Montague]]'s Letters. He also published numerous French texts for the Pitt Press series.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Ross and Carr's next work, in collaboration with [[James T. Tanner]], was ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), a smart, contemporary tale of backstage and society goings-on.  This left behind the earlier Gaiety burlesques and helped set the new fashion for the series of modern-dress [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] shows that quickly spread to other theatres and dominated British musical theatre.  For his next piece, ''[[Morocco Bound]]'' (1893, with the song "Marguerite from Monte Carlo"), Ross concentrated on writing lyrics, leaving the "book" mostly to Arthur Branscombe.  This proved to be his most successful model through most of his career.&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/british/authors/ross.html "Adrian Ross" profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906072755/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/authors/ross.html |date=6 September 2006 }} at the British Musical Theatre site of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 7 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The position of "lyricist" was relatively new, as previously the writers of libretti would invariably write the lyrics themselves.  As the new Edwardes-produced [[Edwardian Musical Comedy|"musical comedies"]] took the place of burlesque, [[comic opera]] and [[operetta]] on the stage, Ross and [[Harry Greenbank]] established the usefulness of a separate lyricist.

===Gaiety and Daly Theatre musicals===
Ross contributed lyrics to almost all of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]'s shows, beginning with ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894, with his song "Brown of Colorado") and ''[[Go-Bang]]'' in 1895.  He wrote over two thousand lyrics and produced lyrics for over sixty musicals thereafter, including most of the hit musicals through [[World War I]].  In 1896, he contributed to the Gaiety Theatre hit, ''[[The Circus Girl]]''.  He also wrote lyrics for the one-act [[comic opera]], ''[[Weather or No]]'' (1896), which played as a companion piece to ''[[The Mikado]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], as well as several other [[Savoy operas]], such as ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'' (1894), ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]], or The Court of Vignolia'' (1897), ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein|The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[Image:Dollarprincess.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lily Elsie]] in ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'']]
Ross also wrote lyrics for the shows at [[Daly's Theatre]].  His lyrics to additional numbers for ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895) and ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) were successful enough so that Edwardes asked him for major contributions to the rest, beginning with ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), especially after the death of the theatre's early chief lyricist, Harry Greenbank.  These included a series of enormous successes, including ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899), ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''Kitty Grey'' (1901), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901), ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902), ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1903), ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), ''[[The Cingalee]]'' (1904), ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907).  In 1901, Ross married Ethel Wood, an actress, and the couple produced a son and two daughters. The family resided in Church Street, [[Kensington]].&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt; Also in 1901, he collaborated with his sister Mary Emily Ropes on the children's story, ''On Peter's Island''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Adrian|contributor-last=Dalby|contributor-first=Richard|contribution=Preface|title=The Hole of the Pit: And by One, by Two and by Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5i68QO9hh0C&amp;pg=PA10|date=2013|publisher=The Oleander Press|isbn=978-0-900891-86-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Edwardes found success, beginning in 1907, in mounting English-language versions of the new generation of continental European [[operettas]] to the London stage, Ross wrote the English lyrics for the adaptations, often with libretti by [[Basil Hood]].  His words to the songs in ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907) became the standard English version of that piece, performed throughout the world for many decades.  Other Continental musicals that Ross anglicised included ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[The Girl in the Train]]'' (1910), ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), ''[[The Girl on the Film]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Marriage Market]]'' (1913), most of which had enduring success throughout the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Other successes from this period were the musicals ''[[King of Cadonia]]'' (1908), ''[[Havana (Edwardian musical)|Havana]]'' (1908), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1911), and ''[[Betty (musical)|Betty]]'' in 1915.  In addition, many of Ross's most successful pieces had additional successes on tour in Britain, in America and elsewhere.  His biggest hits on Broadway included ''The Girl from Kays'' (1903), ''The Merry Widow'' (1907 and many revivals), ''Havana'' (1909), ''Madame Sherry'' (1911) and ''The Quaker Girl'' (1911).

===Later career===
[[Image:Lilactimeross.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Sheet music from ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus|Lilac Time]]'']]
In 1914, Ross was one of the founders of the Performing Rights Society.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt; Ross continued, after Edwardes's death, to write lyrics for numerous shows at the Gaiety, Daly's, the [[Adelphi Theatre]], and other London theatres.  During [[World War I]], he continued to produce hits, writing the lyrics for the musical adaptation of a French comedy, ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916), the musical ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'' (1917), [[André Messager]]'s adaptation of [[Booth Tarkington]]'s ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (operetta)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1919, "Philomel") and contributed to ''[[A Southern Maid]]'' (1920).  He also worked on the [[revue]]s ''Three Cheers'' (1917) with [[Herman Darewski]], ''Airs and Graces'' with [[Lionel Monckton]], and, years later, ''Sky High'' for the [[London Palladium|Palladium Theatre]], but these were only diversions from his chief focus of writing lyrics for musicals and operetta adaptations.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt; In 1922, he wrote both the book and the lyrics for the popular English version of ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus]]'', the international hit based on [[Franz Schubert]]'s music and life, produced in Britain as ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus|Lilac Time]]''.  In 1927, Ross and Dudley Glass, an Australian composer, collaborated on a musical based on ''The Beloved Vagabond'' by [[W. J. Locke]].  His last works were produced in 1930: the English adaptation of the operetta ''Friederike'' for the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_f/frederica.htm "Frederica"], The Guide to Musical Theatre (NODA)&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical based on ''The Toymaker of Nuremberg'' by Austin Strong, which was produced as a Kingsway Theatre Christmas entertainment.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

Ross collaborated extensively with the foremost British-based composers of musical theatre active during his productive period, including Carr, [[Ivan Caryll]], Monckton, [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]], and later [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]], [[Harold Fraser-Simson]], [[Howard Talbot]] and Messager.  Sixteen of his musicals ran for more than 400 performances.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Ross tailored each song to fit the style required by the producer – songs for the Gaiety were different from those for Daly's. Many of his most popular shows, songs (both for the theatre and beyond it) and adaptations are still performed today.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

===Fiction and last years===
Ross also wrote the popular horror novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' and a number of short stories. Set in 1645 during the [[English Civil War]], the novel tells of a loathsome entity that inhabits a flooded pit amid the marshes surrounding a castle. The book is notable for its depth of characterisation – especially of the compassionate young narrator, a [[Puritan]] scholar who has refused to join [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army because of his objections to religious violence and who sees the good in everyone – and for its subtle depiction of the creature in the hole, which is never completely seen even as it overwhelms the castle. The novel was published in 1914 and never reprinted until [[Ramsey Campbell]] collected it in his 1992 anthology ''[[Uncanny Banquet]]''. [[Brian Stableford]] called it "a minor classic of the genre".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford|Stableford, Brian]]. "Ross, Adrian", in [[David Pringle]] (ed.), ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers''. London: St. James Press, 1998, p. 486, {{ISBN|978-1-55862-206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross also wrote ''Short History of Europe'', edited ''Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu's Letters'' (Selection and Life), and was a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt;

Ross died of heart failure at his home in [[Kensington, London|Kensington]], London on 11 September 1933 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arthur R.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

'''Applied aesthetics''' is the application of the branch of philosophy of aesthetics to cultural constructs.
{{TOC right}}

==Architecture and interior design==

Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

[[Interior design]]ers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as [[feng shui]].

==Digital art==

A new art form struggling for acceptance is [[digital art]], a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness.

Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's "Brillo Pad Boxes", a question of what constitutes art.

The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of "what effort is the artist putting into their work?"

The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium.

==Education and social sciences==

Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like [[John Dewey]] have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with [[postmodern]] or [[poststructural]] influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and [[Michel Foucault]]. Aesthetics in education has been linked to [[pragmatism]] as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation.

See ''Understanding Curriculum," Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information.

==Fashion design==

[[Fashion design]]ers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.

==Film, television, and video==

[[Film]] combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of [[cinematography]] are closely related to still [[photography]], but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the [[lighting]] are highly important. [[Sound recording]], editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the [[Film score|musical score]]. As in [[Theatre]], [[art direction]], in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as [[costume design]] and [[makeup]]. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the [[Film director|director]].

[[Montage sequence|Montage]], or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of [[post production]], and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital [[special effects]].

In the case of a [[video installation]], the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple [[video monitor|monitor]], projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.

==Gastronomy==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2007}}
Although [[culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into [[gastronomy]]. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to [[drinking water]], there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including [[odour]], [[colour]], [[total dissolved solids]] and clarity. There are numerical standards in the [[United States|U.S.]] for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.

Note, however, a use of a word translated to "culinary" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and "beautiful" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the "truth" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).

Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as "original instruments". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience "wants"...its whims.

This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful "customer" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance "above" the mere audience, something only the most "snobbish" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.

There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.

Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being "art", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation.

Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.

This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates "fine dining" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a "better" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use "good" and "bad" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).

The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a "fine" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.

A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.

==Humor==

{{Further|Humor|Jokes|Mathematical humor}}
There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis.

==Industrial design==

[[Industrial Design]]: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.

==Information technology==

Aesthetics in [[information technology]] has focused upon the study of [[human-computer interaction]] and creating [[user-friendly]] devices and [[software applications]]. [[Software]] itself has aesthetic dimensions ("[[software aesthetics]]"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer [[video games]] and [[virtual reality]] simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as [[Web browser]]s, [[website]]s, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of [[cyberspace]] has sometimes been linked to the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing [[software]] itself. Numerous [[programmers]] profess to experiencing a dimension of [[elegance]] in the functionality and structuring of software at the [[source code]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html Preface to the First Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered "beautiful" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily "clever". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth,  "Literate Programming", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this would say that the need to justify "good design" by reference to "cost savings" means that "good design" isn't "art" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of "user friendliness" have to justify their "user friendly" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.

That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).

A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial "art" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.

The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late [[Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's]] corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was "hard to digest", in Adorno's words not very culinary.

Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many "artistic" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes "user friendliness" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.

This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work "user friendly" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.

==Landscape design==

[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Literature==

{{main|Literary merit}}
In [[poetry]], [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

==Maps==

Aesthetics in [[cartography]] relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).

Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.

==Marketing==

As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the "trade dress" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, [[sophistication]], color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.

Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.

==Mathematics==

{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
{{Further|mathematical humor}}
The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful." Math appeals to the "senses" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in [[geometry]], the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of [[polyhedra]], and the [[serendipity]] of relating theorems across disciplines.  There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in [[mathematical humor]].

==Music==

{{main|Aesthetics of music}}
Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in [[music]] include lyricism, [[harmony]], hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see [[musical development]]). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern [[rock music]] might sound terrible in the context of the early [[baroque music|baroque]] age.

==Neuroesthetics==

[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. ''See also'' [[Vogelkop bowerbird]].

==Performing arts==

[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[film score|score]]. [[Performance art]] often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. [[Role-playing games]] are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called [[role-playing game theory|RPG theory]].

==Two-dimensional and plastic arts==

Aesthetic considerations within the [[visual arts]] are usually associated with the sense of [[visual perception|vision]]. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

In the United States during the postwar period, the "push-pull" theories of [[Hans Hofmann]], positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with [[abstract expressionism]]. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

==Urban life==

[[Image:Clifton suspension bridge from hotwells 600.jpg|thumb|300px|Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in [[Bristol]] (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive.]]
Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, [[graffiti]] and [[street art]], a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as [[park]]s and [[parade]]s, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

==Website Design==

Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users’ satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users’ perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed  “classical aesthetics”  and “expressive aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T., &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Classical Aesthetics'' - pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the 	design rules advocated by usability experts.
*''Expressive Aesthetics'' - created by the designers’ creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions.
While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. &lt;br /&gt;
In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplicity
* Diversity
* Colors
* Craftsmanship

Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Best practices for aesthetic Website Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
•	Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use one set of design elements across your website.

'''Website Design Aesthetics and Credibility''' &lt;br /&gt;
Website design influences user’s perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J., &amp; Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design. Information Processing and Management: an International Journal , 386-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

{{European art history}}

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H.

While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art of the Umbrella movement''' refers to artistic works created as part of the [[Umbrella movement]] in Hong Kong which demanded democracy in the election of the territory's top leader. Most of the physical works of art are located within the three main protest sites of [[Umbrella Square|Admiralty]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Mong Kok]], some concepts have originated from outside Hong Kong.

Art is often held to be an integral part of activism. For the students involved in the "[[2014 Hong Kong protests|Umbrella Revolution]]", their art is a primary vehicle of expression and a method of documenting what occurs.&lt;ref name=JournalSentinel&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Louise |last=Schumacher |date=6 November 2014 |title=The enchanting art of Hong Kong's Umbrella Revolution |url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/arts/the-enchanting-art-of-hong-kongs-umbrella-revolution-b99385524z1-281848021.html |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the umbrella – an everyday item that protects users against the rain and the sun – by the protesters to deflect pepper spray and tear gas of the police&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disizart.com/products/wall-prints-black-and-white-art|title=Hong Kong Police Man Stance {{!}} Wall Art Decor {{!}} Taken during the Umbrella Movement Protests in Hong Kong|last=Disizart|website=''Disizart.com''|access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has given the object iconic status at a political level, symbolising resistance and the underlying social grievances.&lt;ref name=JournalSentinel/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141009fpol&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/09/hong_kong_protest_art|title=Hong Kong's Wild Protest Art|work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20141007WaPo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/07/photos-the-colorful-world-of-hong-kongs-protest-art/|title=Photos: The colorful world of Hong Kong’s protest art|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupied streets of Hong Kong have been transformed into an extended canvas of artistic creativity.&lt;ref name=20141008CNNprotestart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/08/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-art/|title=Street becomes canvas for 'silent protest' in Hong Kong|author=Ivan Watson, Pamela Boykoff and Vivian Kam|date=8 October 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
As an everyday item that protects users against the rain and the sun, the umbrella has, in the past, symbolised political weakness. In the context of the Hong Kong protests, it has been used to shield against the pepper spray and tear gas of the police, thus has become a political symbol of resistance.&lt;ref name=JournalSentinel/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141009fpol/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141007WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141001WSJcrt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/10/01/hong-kong-protests-mark-twist-in-history-of-umbrella-symbolism/?mod=blog_flyover|title=Hong Kong Protests Mark Twist in History of Umbrella Symbolism|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20140930cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/30/world/asia/objects-hong-kong-protest/|title=The symbols of Hong Kong's 'Umbrella Revolution' |author=Tim Hume and Madison Park|date=30 September 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical umbrellas in all their guises have been used as subjects or as objects.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt; The eight-lane expanse of road freed by the occupation has been transformed into an extended canvas for artistic expression.&lt;ref name=bbc29648459/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141115NYTjoyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=quartz279221&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/279221/someone-should-preserve-hong-kongs-protest-art-before-its-too-late/|title=Someone should preserve Hong Kong's protest art before it's too late|author=Heather Timmons|work=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; One artist explained that due to the lack of physical public space in Hong Kong, people's imagination is suppressed. She added that: "When the rules that bind your action are suddenly lifted, you are given the freedom to redefine everything." Artwork featuring the form of umbrellas are in abundance.&lt;ref name=20141006scmp/&gt; Examples of works include umbrellas drawn on or decorated with calligraphy, balloon twisting into umbrellas, and mobiles of origami umbrellas.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29648459/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20141026/494809/|title=佔中巧手扭出黃雨傘　嚴選「外國勢力」氣球|work=Apple Daily |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colette Gaiter, an Associate Professor of Art at the University of Delaware, praised the quality of the artwork as possessing "an elevated aesthetic sensibility even in the ubiquitous handwritten signs and Post-it notes".&lt;ref name=20141007WaPo/&gt;

''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition aims to elevate awareness and generate more concern for the demand for "real universal suffrage" for Hong Kong. Wong said that use of social media such as Facebook allows for the creation of a "safe platform" for universal participation, which in turn generates awareness.&lt;ref name=artnet121249/&gt; Among the entries is one created by international street artist [[Invader (artist)|Invader]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

The [[yellow ribbon]], which has been used to represent women's suffrage, was adopted early by the movement.&lt;ref name=20140930cnn/&gt; Activists adorned street railings and barricades with these, pinned them on shirts, and used them on Facebook profiles.&lt;ref name=20140930cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29407067/&gt; Use of the symbolic yellow crossed over into the umbrellas.&lt;ref name=20141115NYTjoyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=baptistgrad/&gt;

Opening up yellow umbrellas indoors, as well as outdoors, has also become a way of sending in pro-democracy message in silence.

== Installations ==
A number of installations and sculptures were created at occupation sites, of which one of the largest is a patchwork hanging in the middle of [[Umbrella Square]] made of fabric taken from more than a hundred broken umbrellas which were sewn together.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29648459&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29648459|title=In pictures: Hong Kong protest art|work=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Mary Louise (6 November 2014).

''Journal Sentinel'' (Milwaukee).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was developed by Baptist University art students, to bolster the movement in the early days. A group of about ten other students stripped the fabric from umbrellas that were broken and had been stained by tear gas in the police bombardment of 28 September, and wove them together and deployed it above what is now referred to as "Umbrella Square". Tse, the project leader, hoped that the umbrellas broken by the police, fashioned into canopy, symbolises an extended physical protection for citizens that also serves as a reminder of the presence of other citizens who are behind to support, in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;See AJ+ video&lt;/ref&gt; At Admiralty, large yellow umbrellas have been installed at many lamp posts; ''Happy Gadfly'' concept by mainland artist Miso Zo inspired by ''The Gadfly'', by [[Ethel Lilian Voynich]]. Made from discarded umbrellas, plastic bottles and other discarded materials, the project's originator says the installation symbolises how "They can destroy the movement, but like the fly it will come back."&lt;ref name=20141108NYtimes/&gt; Other sizeable installations include a pepper spray installation at Causeway Bay, a shrine to [[Kwan Yu]] at Mong Kok.

=== "Mr and Ms. Hong Kong People" ===
"Mr and Little Miss Hong Kong People" is a series of caricatures that draws inspiration from Roger Hargreaves' [[Mr. Men]] series. A local graphic artist named [[Maxwell Ip]] drew a set of cartoon figures to explain the important figures behind the Umbrella movement. Originally created "just for fun", he created more once the popularity exploded, with the aim of providing suitable and politically neutral materials for parents to educate their children about the protests, and important figures involved.&lt;ref name="scmp1631193"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1631193/mr-men-adaptations-inform-children-about-occupy-protests|author=Chan, Gloria|title=Mr Men adaptations inform children about the Occupy protests|date=4 November 2014|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20141022globalv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/10/22/learn-whos-who-in-hong-kongs-umbrella-revolution-with-mr-and-little-miss-hong-kong-people/|title=Learn Who's Who in Hong Kong's Umbrella Revolution With 'Mr and Little Miss Hong Kong People'|work=Global Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept accumulated over 64,000 "likes" in just over two weeks.&lt;ref name="scmp1631193" /&gt; Eight hours after the creation of "Mr 689" – the nickname of Hong Kong chief executive [[CY Leung]], Ip's personal Facebook page of the character had more than 3,000 shares.&lt;ref name="scmp1631193" /&gt; The popularity led Ip to immediately create a public Facebook page for the characters, which are added as events unfold. In addition to the cute wolf that caricatures "Mr 689", other popular characters include "Mr Tear" (after the tear gas episode of 28 September), "Mr Chow &amp; Mr Shum" (after the HKFS leaders [[Alex Chow]] and [[Lester Shum]]), "Mr 4&amp;nbsp;pm" (after Steve Hui of the PR section of the HK Police – who appeared on television at 4&amp;nbsp;pm daily), "Little Miss Lam Cheng" (after the Chief secretary [[Carrie Lam (politician)|Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor]])&lt;ref name="scmp1631193" /&gt; "Mr Hungry" (after Mok Siu Man, who started a hunger strike on 2 October that lasted 40 days) and "Little Miss Ip Cancer" (after former secretary for security [[Regina Ip]]).&lt;ref name="20141022globalv" /&gt; Some of the characters' names are English crossovers from Cantonese or hybrids – for example, the character of [[Joshua Wong (student activist)|Joshua Wong]] is named "Mr. G Phone", after his Chinese name.&lt;ref name="20141022globalv" /&gt;

== Vernacular ==
The existence of homophones in Chinese language allows great potential for wordplay that replacing characters with similar tones, or pitch patterns can effect significant changes in meaning.&lt;ref name=gma391168&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/391168/lifestyle/peopleandevents/fun-with-puns-umbrella-terms-a-new-weapon-in-hong-kong-democracy-battle|title=Fun with puns: ‘Umbrella Terms’ a new weapon in Hong Kong democracy battle|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20141128guardian/&gt; Although Chinese is full of idioms, popular sayings, customs, jokes that rely on wordplay, the Beijing leadership has imposed a ban on wordplay in broadcasting as such use ostensibly breaches the law on spoken and written Chinese. Critics believe the ban is aimed at making it illegal to criticise the leadership and/or its policies in veiled manner, whilst avoiding censorship.&lt;ref name=20141128guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/28/china-media-watchdog-bans-wordplay-puns|title=China bans wordplay in attempt at pun control|author=Tania Branigan|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have noted that the protests have resulted in the unprecedented creation of new Cantonese terms that contain political puns and special idioms. There has also been a resurgence in Cantonese usage, countering the trend imposed by Beijing to expand use of [[Standard Chinese]] (aka Mandarin or Putonghua) in the place of "dialects", which is defined to include [[Cantonese]].&lt;ref name="gma391168" /&gt;

The new lexicon of protest incorporates the term "left plastic" (左膠), a derogative term used by radicals to refer to "leftists/moderates".&lt;ref name=quartz292835&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/292835/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-is-starting-to-splinter/|title=Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement is starting to splinter|author=Lily Kuo|work=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also "[[gau wu]]" (鳩嗚), a vulgar homophone of a term in Mandarin which means "to shop" (購物) – the character substitution transforms the original meaning into "to occupy the streets in protest".

The encampments are referred to as "villages", road signs have been changed pointing to social change; occupiers' flimsy tents have often been given grandiose addresses such as "Umbrella Court" or "Democracy Gardens", parodying names given to luxury property developments in an increasingly unaffordable city.&lt;ref name="gma391168" /&gt;

A glossary of the terms affiliated with the Umbrella Movement protests was created online, at umbrellaterms.hk.&lt;ref name="gma391168" /&gt;

== Preservation ==
[[File:Visual Archive and Research Collective.jpg|thumb|Tent in Umbrella Square of the Visual Archive and Research Collective]]Two groups are involved in efforts to preserve the artwork. The Umbrella Movement Visual Archive and Research Collective, founded by Wen Yau and Sampson Wong, aims to document "how people form a community here, and how they transform the space". The collective has 10 teams of volunteers to photograph and interview those who have participated in the protests, and digitally preserve protest objects, indicate their location, and include creators' thoughts and inspirations for the works. It will create a website with interactive map and images of all the pieces.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141027afp/&gt; The group is co-operating with Umbrella Movement Art Preservation, led by Meaghan McGurgan and Kacey Wong, which has made an inventory of works and their location, and will grab certain pieces before the police clear the site.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141115NYTjoyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141115NYTjoyce&gt;Lau, Joyce (14 November 2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">A '''background artist''' or sometimes called a '''background stylist''' or '''background painter''' is one who is involved in the process of [[animation]] who establishes the color, style, and mood of a scene drawn by an animation [[Page layout|layout]] artist. The methods used can either be through traditional [[painting]] or by [[digital media]] such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Traditional methods involved painting entire production scenes for a [[television program]] or [[film]]. Current methods may involve painting primarily '''background keys''' or the [[establishing shot]] while production background artists paint the corresponding background paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Michelle|title=Background Painter - Career Profile|url=http://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/background-painter-career-profile|publisher=Animation Career Review|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fields in which a Background Artist may work:
*[[Motion pictures]]
*[[Television]]
*[[Video games]]
*[[Internet|The Internet]]

Other [[artist]]s who contribute to [[animated cartoon]]s, but who are not Background Artists, are layout artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), [[storyboard]] artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), character designers (who create the style and personality of each character).

In [[Japanese animation]], the cast member credited as the [[Art Director]] (美術監督, bijutsu kantoku) usually refers to the sole background artist (for smaller productions) or director in charge of background art creation.

[[File:Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe IMGP2104.JPG|thumb|Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe]]
The '''Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe''' is a theatre and opera house in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]]. It has existed in its present form and place at Ettlinger Tor since 1975. Achim Thorwald became the ''Intendant'' (Artistic director) in summer 2002 and held that post until the end of the 2010/11 season.  Peter Spuhler succeeded him at the beginning of the 2011/12 season and continues to serve in that post.

The Staatstheater is a ''Dreisparten'' venue, housing three performance genres: musical theatre, ballet and theatre, as well as the studio stage in Karlstraße. The ''Badische Staatskapelle'' (orchestra) and the ''Badische Staatsopernchor'' (opera chorus) are resident companies of the theatre.

==History==
City architect [[Friedrich Weinbrenner]] constructed the first predecessor of the ''Badischen Staatstheater'' in 1808 near the castle. In 1810, it became the ''Großherzoglichen Hoftheater'' (court theatre).

[[File:Karlsruhe Hoftheater von Heinrich Hübsch.jpg|thumb|''Hoftheater'' by [[Heinrich Hübsch]], 1853 to 1944]]
During a performance on 28 February 1847 a fire broke-out, destroying the building, which was built mostly from wood and canvas.  A total of 63 spectators perished, most in a panic caused by doors that opened inwards and prevented a speedy escape.  The replacement theatre, by court architect [[Heinrich Hübsch]], was finished in 1853 and opened under the direction of [[Eduard Devrient]].

During an aerial bombardment in 1944, the ''Hoftheater'' was destroyed again. The site is now occupied by the [[German Federal Constitutional Court]]. Plans for the current facility were finalized in 1964 and the venue opened in 1975.

Between 1978 and 1984, works of [[baroque]] composer [[Georg Friedrich Händel]] have been presented in a special format annually known as ''Händel Days''. In 1985, these became the Händel Festival, which occurs yearly on 23 February, the composer's birthday. The festival celebrated the 300th anniversary of Händel's birth in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5928">Works of '''bamboo painting''', usually in ink, are a recognized [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] or subgenre of [[East Asia]]n painting. In a work of bamboo painting in ink, a skilled artist and [[calligraphy#East Asian calligraphy|calligrapher]] will paint a [[bamboo]] stalk or group of stalks with leaves. The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the foreground and background, and between the varying [[wikt:texture|textures]] represented by the stalks and the leaves, gave scope to the painter to demonstrate his or her mastery with an inkpot and a brush.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/large88.html |title=Ink Bamboo |work=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo painter often inscribes a [[poem]] that accompanies the painting and further elucidates the motif. The poem is often an integral part of the work as a whole. A viewer of the work can compare the calligraphy of the poem with the calligraphy of the painting, as both are typically inscribed with the same brush and reflect a similar mood and state of awareness.  

A standard primer on classical East Asian bamboo painting is [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy" (1633).  Because of the volume of bamboo works painted over time, the production of a work of ink bamboo became one of the standard subjects to which an East Asian student could be set in a competitive [[Imperial examination|examination]].&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt;

==Appreciation==
From the days of their common origin, Chinese painting and Chinese writing have been allied arts. They use the same equipment and share aims, techniques, and standards. Ever since the beginning, bamboo has been written and also been painted in the same manner, in other words, a work depicting bamboo is both a painting and a piece of calligraphy. There are so-called “bamboo painters” who all their lives paint only bamboo.  The bamboo is strong, upright, and dependable. He may bend with the wind, the storm and the rain, but he never breaks. He is a true gentleman of courage and endurance (Ju 1989). 

{{blockquote|The first principle of bamboo composition is, the four parts of the plant should be considered in the following order: stem, knot, branches and leaves. If the basic rule is not followed, time and effort will be wasted and the picture will never be completed.” This is the beginning of the early Book of Bamboo, a part of the Mustard Seed Garden manual of painting which was prepared and published by Chinese master in the year 1701 A.D. No bamboo painting is a photographic copy of some bamboo at some particular place, seen from a particular angle; instead it is a suggestion of the true essence of the bamboo, an expression of the qualities of a true Chinese gentleman, whom the bamboo symbolizes (Ju 1989).}}

[[Image:Wen Tong Babmbuk.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Example of ink bamboo painting by [[Wen Tong]], c. 1060.]]
The [[bamboo]] plant came under close observation by many Asians because of its persistence and vegetative productivity. The plant was especially appreciated by men and women educated in the tradition of [[Confucius]]. It came to be seen as an exemplar of [[De (Chinese)|moral force]], and appreciating the bamboo was seen as an act of [[Chun Tzu|self-cultivation]]. It was said of the ink bamboo painter [[Wen Tong]] that "there are whole bamboos in his heart" (胸有成竹).

[[Bamboo]] is not exclusive to the '''[[Four Gentlemen|Four Noble Kind]]''' group. It also belongs to a distinct group where it openly fraternizes with [[pine trees]] and [[Prunus mume|plum blossoms]]. Collectively, they are called the '''[[Three Friends of Winter]]''' because [[bamboo]] and [[pine]] do not wither on winter days and the plum blossoms starts blooming during the cold season. 

Bamboo also exhibits a certain visual appeal on educated people because its [[silhouette]] cast by either the sun or moon on the paper windows of a Chinese house produced a poetic effect. Its straight stalk was the symbol of the sage, in that adversity could always bend it but it could never break it. The inner region of the bamboo stalk symbolizes the void that must be established in one's mind before thinking of useful ideas. To put it in simpler terms, one should always have clarity of mind when dealing with things to avoid chaos and to achieve desired results.

On the technical area, one needed to be an expert with the brush in order to execute perfectly cylindrical, smooth and hard [[internodes]], and thin, translucid, nervous leaves placed in various perspectives. One should also have a keen talent in identifying where to place dark [[Lightness (color)|tones]] and light tones in the painting. 

These characteristics are enough to validate that bamboo is a complete subject because it portrays lasting values one needed to get on with life and it commands a truly talented painter to create varying tones that never repeat.

The '''Canada Council for the Arts''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil des Arts du Canada}}), commonly called the '''Canada Council''', is a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown Corporation]] established in 1957 to act as an [[arts council]] of the [[government of Canada]], created to foster and promote the study and enjoyment of, and the production of works in, the [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/canada-council-for-the-artsconseil-des-arts-du-canada History] The Canadian Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; It funds [[Canadians|Canadian]] artists and encourages the production of art in Canada. The current board chair of the Canada Council is [[Pierre Lassonde]].

==Organization==
The Canada Council is an arms-length agency based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], that reports to [[Monarchy of Canada|the Crown]] through the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women|Minister of Canadian Heritage]]. Its endowment income is supplemented by annual appropriations from parliament, donations, and bequests. Its main duty is allotting grants to Canadian artists based on the merits of their applications.  The council also funds and administers many of Canada's top arts awards, including the [[Governor General's Award|Governor General's Literary Awards]].

The council has six main divisions. Each of these co-ordinates grant-giving to a different area of the arts:
*[[visual arts]]
*[[media arts]]
*[[dance]]
*[[music]]
*[[theatre]]
*[[literature|writing]] and [[publishing]]

These are complemented by three groups that work with all the sections:
*[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] Arts Secretariat, which fosters First Peoples art in all media
*Equity Office, which encourages diversity in arts funding
*Inter-Arts Office, to deal with proposals that combine or transcend traditional artistic disciplines

==Activities==

===Art Bank===
The Canada Council has supervisory authority over the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130121011333/http://www.artbank.ca/en/Home.aspx Art Bank]. The Art Bank is a division of the Canada Council for the Arts whose mandate is to rent works of art to public and private sector offices.&lt;ref name="Mandate"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.artbank.ca/en/The%20Collection/Mandate.aspx
 |title       = Mandate of Art Bank
 |accessdate  = {{date|15 mar 2013}}
 |deadurl     = yes
 |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130410025655/http://www.artbank.ca/en/The%20Collection/Mandate.aspx
 |archivedate = 2013-04-10
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the largest collection of [[contemporary art|contemporary]] Canadian art in the world.&lt;ref name="Mandate" /&gt; The collection includes some 18,000 artworks, 6,400 of which are currently rented to more than 200 government and corporate clients.

Established in the 1970s and developed by Canada Council Visual Arts Officer [[Suzanne Rivard-Lemoyne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Jan|date=1992|title=The Anatomy of Excellence: The Canada Council Art Bank Collection, 1972-1983|url=|journal=Queen's University Dissertations|volume=|pages=8|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Art Bank buys art from notable Canadian artists through a system of peer review juries. The bank is completely self-funded, earning its money from renting out works in its collection. The Bank continues to expand its collection by buying works in accord with its annual purchasing budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbank.ca/en/The%20Collection/Purchase%20Program%20Information.aspx Purchase Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524125545/http://www.artbank.ca/en/The%20Collection/Purchase%20Program%20Information.aspx |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of its art is rented by the [[Government of Canada|Federal government]], with less than ten percent being rented to the private sector. Works of art are rented out for two-year periods. The rental rate is generally 20% of the piece's market value. Although the Art Bank is located in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] it services its clients across the country.  Its collection has been appraised to be worth over 71 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbank.ca/en/The%20Collection.aspx Value of Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402040115/http://www.artbank.ca/en/The%20Collection.aspx |date=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Canada Council Art Bank began to purchase Aboriginal art to enhance its collection as part of its 45th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turtleisland.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=132|title={Turtle Island Native Network} • View topic - Opportunity for Aboriginal Artists - Art Bank Purchase|author=|date=|website=www.turtleisland.org|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical Instrument Bank===
The Council also operates a Musical Instrument Bank. Established in 1985, the Instrument Bank has acquired many valuable [[stringed instruments]] that are loaned mainly to Canadian musicians. The loans are often made to musicians as a result of juried competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/09/25/music-instrument-bank-winners.html|title=Instrument Bank grants rare violins, cellos to young artists|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the instrument bank was championed by Canadian cellist [[Denis Brott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalmontreal.org/denisbrott/main.php?page=8|title=404 - Montreal Chamber Music Festival|first=Montreal Chamber Music|last=Festival|date=|website=www.festivalmontreal.org|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards supervised===
The Council promotes public awareness of the arts through its communications, research and arts promotion activities. The Council administers the Killam Program of scholarly awards, the [[Governor General's Awards#Governor General.27s Literary Awards|Governor General's Literary Awards]] and the [[Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts]].

===Other supervised bodies===
The [[Canadian Commission for UNESCO]] and the [[Public Lending Right]] Commission operate under the Council's aegis.

==Grant awards==
Each year the council receives some 16,000 grant requests, which are reviewed by panels of artists set up by each division of the council. In 2006-07, the Council awarded some 6,000 grants to artists and arts organizations and made payments to more than 15,400 authors through the Public Lending Right Commission. Grants and payments totaled more than $152 million.

==Funding==
The Canada Council is called from time to time to appear before parliamentary committees, particularly the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage]]. Its accounts are audited by the [[Auditor General of Canada]] and included in an Annual Report to Parliament.

The '''Circle Repertory Company''', originally named the '''Circle Theater Company''', was a theatre company in New York City that ran from 1969 to 1996.  It was founded on July 14, 1969, in Manhattan, in a second floor loft at Broadway and 83rd Street by director [[Marshall W. Mason]], playwright [[Lanford Wilson]], director [[Rob Thirkield]], and actress [[Tanya Berezin]], all of whom were veterans of the [[Caffe Cino]]. The plan was to establish a pool of artists &amp;mdash; actors, directors, playwrights and designers &amp;mdash; who would work together in the creation of plays. In 1974 [[The New York Times]] acclaimed Circle Rep as the "chief provider of new American plays."

Marshall W.  Mason was succeeded as Artistic Director (1969–1987) by co-founder Tanya Berezin (1987–1995). In 1995, [[Austin Pendleton]] succeeded her, with actress [[Lynn Thigpen]] as associate artistic director, [[Milan Stitt]] as executive director and Edward M. Hausle as artistic director of the Circle Rep Lab..

Originating in the 1960s, a time when many experimental theaters arose, this company outlasted many others. The Company moved their home to the [[Sheridan Square Playhouse]] at 99 Seventh Avenue South in the early 1970s and performed there through 1994. (In the early 1980s the name Sheridan Square Playhouse was dropped in favor of Circle Repertory Theatre). The company closed its doors in 1996 after 27 years.

==Writers==
Circle Repertory Company, also called Circle Rep, became home to some of the most prolific talent in the American theater.

Harper, Michael Higgins, Ruby Holbrook, Jonathan Hogan, Laura Hughes, Ken Kliban, Zane Lasky, [[Bobo Lewis]], Lou Liberatore, Robert Lupone, Sharon Madden, [[Jeff McCracken]], Edward J.

==Company members==
Company designers were [[John Lee Beatty]] and David Potts for sets, [[Dennis Parichy]] and [[Malcolm Sturchio]] for lights, [[Jennifer von Mayrhauser]] and Laura Crow for costumes, Chuck London and Stuart Warner for sound. Company composers have been [[Norman L. Berman]], [[Jonathan Brielle]], and [[Peter Kater]]. Company stage managers were Fred Reinglas, MA Howard and Denise Yaney.   Production Managers included Earl Hughes, Jody Boese, Kate Stewart and Karen Potosnak.

==Program==
In 1979 Circle Rep returned to their original concept of rotating rep, producing two plays in repertory; ''[[Hamlet]]'', and Schiller's ''[[Play (theatre)|Mary Stuart]]''. By 1982 Circle Rep had outgrown its theater and began to present some works on other stages. Running parallel to the classics, Circle Rep became celebrated for its productions of new plays, particularly those in the style that has been labeled "lyric realism," with Lanford Wilson being the father of the genre. Marshall W. Mason directed dozens of Wilson's plays starting with ''Balm in Gilead'' in 1965, ''[[Home Free!]]'' and ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]'' in London (1968) and continuing at Circle Rep with ''Sextet (Yes)'' in 1971.

==Projects==
In addition to major productions Circle Rep ran a Projects-in-Progress series called Circle Rep Lab. The Lab's Artistic Director was first Daniel Irvine, then Michael Warren Powell. Powell left due to artistic differences and was replaced by Edward M. Hausle, a young actor and playwright for the Lab since 1993. This choice caused some controversy amongst some of the long-standing members due to his age (Hausle was only 22 at the time.) At its height the Lab had over 300 active members. (actors, writers directors and designers) Plays selected for this series received a week of rehearsal and a four-performance run. Several of these plays went on to become major productions the following season or at other theaters, and include such original stagings as Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother'', Bill C. Davis' ''Mass Appeal'', and William M. Hoffman's ''As Is''. Michael Warren Powell became the artistic director of a successor company, Circle East, which continues on a smaller scale the work of the Lab.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p12.nysed.gov/nysssa/SOT/faculty.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115021340/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/nysssa/SOT/faculty.html |date=January 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary office, headed by B. Rodney Marriott and followed by [[Milan Stitt]], was one of the few that read unsolicited scripts and plays and responded with detailed criticism. To the end of developing scripts and plays, the company ran two reading series, Friday Readings and Extended Readings.

The company collaborated with the [[Dramatists Guild]] on a series called Young Playwrights Festival, founded by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Gerald Chapman (director)|Gerald Chapman]] in 1981. For the festival, ten plays with writers ranging from 8 to 18 were chosen for full production or staged readings. Plays were produced at Circle Rep with professional actors. Among the playwrights were Kenneth Lonergan and Jonathan Marc Sherman.

[[File:Cootie Game 01a.JPG|thumb|''Cootie Game'', a board game from 1918]]

'''Cooties''' is a fictitious childhood disease, used in the United States and Canada as a rejection term and an infection [[Tag (game)|tag game]] (such as [[Humans vs. Zombies]]).  It is similar to the British [[dreaded lurgi]], and to terms used in the [[Nordic countries]], in Italy, Australia and  New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Bronner/&gt;  A child is said to "catch" cooties through close contact with an "infected" person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age.

==Origin==
The word is thought to originate from the [[Austronesian language family]], in which the [[Philippine languages]], [[Māori language|Maori]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cooties |title=Definition of cootie |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]-[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word ''kutu'' refers to a parasitic biting insect.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the [[First World War]] to refer to [[lice]] that proliferated in battlefield trenches.&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=213 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Got Cooties?

A hand-held game, the ''Cootie Game'', was made by the Irvin-Smith Company of Chicago in 1915; it involved tilting capsules (the cooties) into a trap over a background illustration depicting a  battlefield.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=78|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cootie games followed, all involving some form of bug or cootie,&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; until [[The Game of Cootie]] was launched in 1948 by [[Schaper Toys]].&lt;ref name=Game&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=77|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game was very successful, becoming an icon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=79|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the [[Toy Industry Association]] included it on its "Century of Toys List" of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

In addition to the cooties games, the term ''cooties'' was popularised in America in the 1950s by military personnel coming back from service alongside the British in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=Origin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sue1980"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1980|title=The Cooties Complex|journal=Western Folklore|volume=39|issue=3, Children's Folklore|pages=198–210|doi=10.2307/1499801|jstor=1499801|oclc=50529929|author=Sue Samuelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the British dreaded lurgi, the cooties games developed during the early 1950s [[polio]] epidemic, and became associated with dirt and contagion.&lt;ref name=Bronner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooties&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=214 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==
The lice of the [[Trench warfare#World War I: Entrenchment|First World War trenches]] nicknamed "cooties" were also known as "arithmetic bugs" because "they added to our troubles, subtracted from our pleasures, divided our attention, and multiplied like hell."&lt;ref&gt;

In Italy children have the term ''la peste'' ("the plague").&lt;ref name="Bronner"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA452#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=452 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooties are known in [[Denmark]] as ''pigelus'' and ''drengelus'' and in [[Norway]] as ''jentelus'' and ''guttelus'': each pair meaning literally "girl lice" and "boy lice". In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], it usually refers to girls, where they are known as ''tjejbaciller''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserv.cs.chalmers.se/users/peterlj/runtime05/projects/hugnplay/doc/Projektrapport.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031084602/http://appserv.cs.chalmers.se/users/peterlj/runtime05/projects/hugnplay/doc/Projektrapport.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |title=p. 10 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "girl [[bacillus|bacilli]]") and ''tyttöbakteeri'' ("girl bacteria"). In [[Serbia]] the game is known as "šuga"; the word means [[scabies]].

==Cooties game==
A child is said to "catch" cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, or touching of an "infected" person or from a person of the opposite sex of the same age. Often the "infected" person is someone who is perceived as different, due to disability, shyness, being of the opposite sex, or having peculiar mannerisms.&lt;ref name="public.oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/appeals/cootie/|title=Appeals: cootie &amp;#124; Oxford English Dictionary|date=|publisher=Public.oed.com|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase is most commonly used by children in elementary school aged 4-10; however, it may be used by older children in a sarcastic or playful way.&lt;ref name="Sue1980"/&gt; Sometimes the phrase specifies the type of cooties, as in "''you've got girl cooties!''" or "''you've got boy cooties!''" after a child has been touched by or in other ways interacted with a child of the opposite sex.

In the United States, children sometimes "immunize" one another from cooties by administering a "cootie injection".&lt;ref name=Origin/&gt; Typically, one child administers the "shot", using an index finger to trace circles and dots on another child's forearm while reciting the rhyme, "Circle, circle, Dot, dot,  – Now you've got the cootie shot!" In some variations, a child then says, "Circle, circle, Square, square, – Now you have it everywhere!" In this case, the child receives an immunization throughout his or her body. These variations may continue to a final shot where the child says, "Circle, circle, Knife, knife,  – Now you've got it all your life!". A number of other variations exist.

'''Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School''' is both a [[burlesque]] [[cabaret]] and [[life drawing]] event originating in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Brooklyn]], at the Lucky Cat.  Dr. Sketchy's was founded in [[New York City]] in 2005, by [[illustrator]] and former artist's model [[Molly Crabapple]] and illustrator [[A.V. Phibes]] who later left to attend to her design studio.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;Kino, Carol (October 2, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/arts/design/04kino.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "A World Drawn From Wild Tastes"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as a cross between an old-fashioned life-drawing session and a new-wave cabaret, it usually meets every other Saturday at [[the Slipper Room]], a burlesque-themed bar on Orchard Street in Manhattan (though Crabapple has held it at other locations like Times Square), where approximately 50 artists, web designers, cartoonists and hipsters pay $12 each to draw a downtown personalities such as alternative model Raquel Reed or performance artist Amber Ray.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; In a typical sketching session, artists will drink alcohol, sketch burlesque models, and play art games in a bar or venue like an art museum.  Crabapple will often travel around the world visiting different Dr. Sketchy's.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Jennifer (2010). [http://www.cityist.com/features/molly_crabapple/ "A Graphic Artist: Whimsical illustrator Molly Crabapple thinks outside The Box"]. ''Cityist''. Retrieved June 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 there are branches of Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School all over the world.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;
  
''The Official Dr. Sketchy's Rainy Day Colouring Book'', by Molly Crabapple and John Leavitt, was released by Sepulculture Books in December 2006, and is in its second printing.  Other projects include a 2008 pin-up calendar, a series of YouTube comedy shorts, a national tour, an art show, and a 21-show run at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

In 2010, a short documentary by Peter Bolte was made about ''Dr. Sketchy''.

Despite conservatism in continents such as Asia, Dr. Sketchy's appears to be widely accepted in Tokyo, Singapore and the Philippines.  The Singapore branch is headlined by the zesty{{weasel word|date=May 2014}} Becca D'Bus.  The Philippine branch is one of Crabapple's favorite new branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dontpaniconline.com/magazine/arts/molly-crabapple/ MOLLY CRABAPPLE] on [http://www.dontpaniconline.com Don't Panic Online Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fauvism''' is the style of '''''les Fauves''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the wild beasts"), a group of early twentieth-century [[modern art]]ists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and strong color over the [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] values retained by [[Impressionism]]. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the [[Art movement|movement]] as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions.&lt;ref name=elderfield13&gt;[[John Elderfield]],  The ''"Wild Beasts" Fauvism and Its Affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p.13, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Judi, et al., ''The Fauve Landscape'', 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, {{ISBN|1-55859-025-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the movement were [[André Derain]] and [[Henri Matisse]].

==Artists and style==
[[File:Les Fauves, Exhibition at the Salon D'Automne, from L'Illustration, 4 November 1905.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Press clipping, Les Fauves: Exhibition at the Salon d'Automne from 1905|Press clipping, Les Fauves: Exhibition at the [[Salon d'Automne]], in ''L'Illustration'', 4 November 1905]]

Besides Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]], other artists included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Georges Braque]] (subsequently Picasso's partner in [[Cubism]]).&lt;ref name=elderfield13/&gt;

The paintings of the Fauves were characterized by seemingly wild brush work and strident colors, while their subject matter had a high degree of simplification and [[Abstract art|abstraction]].&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism&gt;Tate (2007). Glossary: Fauvism. Retrieved on 2007-12-19, [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/f/fauvism. Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; Fauvism can be classified as an extreme development of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]'s [[Post-Impressionism]] fused with the [[pointillism]] of [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]]&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism/&gt; and other [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] painters, in particular [[Paul Signac]]. Other key influences were [[Paul Cézanne]]&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 1990, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Gauguin]], whose employment of areas of saturated color—notably in paintings from Tahiti—strongly influenced Derain's work at [[Collioure]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Alexandra J. (2005). "History: How did the Fauves come to be?". "Fauvism: Expression, Perception, and the Use of Color", [[Brown University]].  Retrieved on 2009-06-18, [http://www.brown.edu/Courses/CG11/2005/Group149/history.htm Brown courses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116163041/http://www.brown.edu/Courses/CG11/2005/Group149/history.htm |date=2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Gauguin had said to [[Paul Sérusier]]:&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Bradley, ''Van Gogh and Gauguin: Electric Arguments and Utopian Dreams'', 2003, Westview Press, p. 159, {{ISBN|0-8133-4157-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."
Fauvism has been compared to [[Expressionism]], both in its use of pure color and unconstrained brushwork.&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism/&gt; Some of the Fauves were among the first avant-garde artists to collect and study African and Oceanic art, alongside other forms of non-Western and folk art, leading several Fauves toward the development [[Cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua I. Cohen, "Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8." The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC.]]
[[Gustave Moreau]] was the movement's inspirational teacher;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and a [[Symbolist painters|Symbolist painter]], he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure color was inspirational for his students.&lt;ref name=dempsey&gt;Dempsey, Amy (2002).

He disturbed our complacency."&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

In 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist [[John Peter Russell]] on the island of [[Belle Île]] off the coast of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm "Book talk: The Unknown Matisse..."], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], interview with [[Hilary Spurling]], 8 June 2005. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, "I couldn't stand it any more."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-colored palette for bright Impressionist colors, later stating, "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained color theory to me."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Russell had been a close friend of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In 1901, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] encountered the work of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] for the first time at an exhibition, declaring soon after that he loved Van Gogh more than his own father; he started to work by squeezing paint directly onto the canvas from the tube.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; In parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-[[Renaissance]] French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, ''French Primitives''.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; Another aesthetic influence was African sculpture, of which [[Vlaminck]], [[Derain]] and Matisse were early collectors.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

Many of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in [[Matisse]]'s painting, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' ("Luxury, Calm and Pleasure"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, whilst in [[Saint-Tropez]] with [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Charles Camoin]], and [[Jean Puy]] at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] disparaged the painters as "''fauves''" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, ''Fauvism''. The artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name after [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"), contrasting their "orgie of tones" with a [[Renaissance]]-style sculpture that shared the room with them.&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T.

At the same exhibition Paul Cézanne was represented by ten works. He wouldn't live long enough to see the end of the show. Cézanne died 22 October 1906 (aged 67). His works included ''Maison dans les arbres'' (no. 323), ''Portrait de Femme'' (no. 235) and ''Le Chemin tournant'' (no. 326). Van Dongen showed three works, ''Montmartre'' (492), ''Mademoiselle Léda'' (493) and ''Parisienne'' (494). [[André Derain]] exhibited 8 works, ''Westminster-Londres'' (438), ''Arbres dans un chemin creux'' (444) along with 5 works painted at [[l'Estaque]].&lt;ref name="Salon 1906" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; Camoin entered 5 works, Dufy 7, Friesz 4, Manguin 6, Marquet 8, Puy 10, Valtat 10, and Vlaminck was represented by 7 works.&lt;ref name="Salon 1906" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

The word '''''geek''''' is a [[slang]] term originally used to describe [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] or non-mainstream people; in current use, the word typically connotes an expert or [[enthusiast]] or a person obsessed with a hobby or [[intellectual]] pursuit, with a general [[pejorative]] meaning of a "peculiar person, especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual, unfashionable, boring, or socially awkward".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/geek|title=Geek|date=|accessdate=January 2, 2016 |work=Dictionary.com-Merriam-Webster entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some use the term self-referentially without malice or as a source of pride,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hAzJoAEACAAJ&amp;dq=geek+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ74qlp_PXAhWQqaQKHe77D7oQ6AEIJjAA|title=Geek-Art: An Anthology: Art, Design, Illustration &amp; Pop Culture|first=Thomas|last=Olivri|date=4 November 2014|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=4|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; often referring simply to "someone who is interested in a subject (usually intellectual or complex) for its own sake". Nonetheless, it remains a pejorative, widely used in an abusive manner especially against children and teens who may be more focused on studies, while less popular, fashionable, or socially inclined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Berlatsky |first= Noah|title=Why Geeks Get Bullied (It's Not Necessarily for Being Geeks) |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-geeks-get-bullied-its-not-necessarily-for-being-geeks/272723/ |magazine=The Atlantic |date=31 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from [[English dialect]] ''geek'' or ''geck'' (meaning a "fool" or "[[freak]]"; from [[Middle Low German]] ''Geck''). "Geck" is a standard term in modern German and means "fool" or "fop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Geck |title=Duden &amp;#124; Geck &amp;#124; Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition, Synonyme, Herkunft |language=de |publisher=Duden.de |date=October 30, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root also survives in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]] [[adjective]] ''gek'' ("crazy"), as well as some [[German dialects]], and in the [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] word ''Gickeleshut'' ("[[jester]]'s hat"; used during carnival).&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"/&gt; In 18th century [[Austria]], ''Gecken'' were freaks on display in some [[circus]]es. In 19th century North America, the term ''geek'' referred to a performer in a [[geek show]] in a circus, [[traveling carnival]] or [[travelling funfair]] [[sideshow]]s (see also [[freak show]]).&lt;ref name="Online-Etymology-Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=geek|title=Geek|date=|accessdate=May 3, 2013 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 edition of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' included only the definition regarding geek shows.{{Clarification|date=December 2017}} This variation of the term was used to comic effect in an episode of popular 1970s TV show [[Sanford &amp; Son]].
Professional wrestling manager "Classy" [[Freddie Blassie]] recorded a song in the 1970s called "Pencil-Necked Geek".

==Definitions==
The 1975 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary, published a decade before the [[Digital Revolution|Digital revolution]], gave only one definition: "Geek [noun, slang]. A carnival performer whose act usually consists of biting the head off a live chicken or snake." The tech revolution found new uses for this word, but it still often conveys a derogatory sting. Today, Dictionary.com gives five definitions, the fourth of which is "a carnival performer who performs sensationally morbid or disgusting acts, as biting off the head of a live chicken." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/geek |title=Dictionary.com: Geek |language=en |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of geek has been used as slang with different connotations, including as an affectionate label. However, this doesn't mean that the term is meaningless or has lost its meaning over time. It remains mostly a derogatory term used to label people unfairly and offensively. Not a friendly and affectionate compliment about somebody's personality, but a hurtful insulting form of invalidation or emotional abuse.

The term [[nerd]] has a similar, practically synonymous meaning as geek, but many choose to identify different connotations among these two terms, although the differences are disputed. In a 2007 interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] said the difference between nerds and geeks is "geeks get it done" or "ggid"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/80961/january-17-2007/richard-clarke The Colbert Report 17th of January video interview Richard Clarke]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Smith (novelist)|Julie Smith]] defined a geek as "a bright young man turned inward, poorly socialized, who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors, who thought of that secret, dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspace—somewhere exciting, a place more real than his own life, a land he could conquer, not a drab teenager's room in his parents' house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/christensen.shtml |title=Reconstruction 6.1 (Winter 2006) |publisher=Reconstruction.eserver.org |date= |accessdate=June 30, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:Geek Picnic (Moscow; 2014-01-26) 28.JPG|thumb|A visitor at Geek Picnic (Moscow) wearing a Geek shirt and a VR headset]]
Technologically oriented geeks, in particular, now exert a powerful influence over the global economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/october/innovation-economic-impact-102412.html|title=Study shows Stanford alumni create nearly $3 trillion in economic impact each year|work=Stanford News|first=Jamie|last=Beckett|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas previous generations of geeks tended to operate in research departments, laboratories and support functions, now they increasingly occupy senior corporate positions, and wield considerable commercial and political influence. When U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] met with Facebook’s [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and the CEOs of the world’s largest technology firms at a private dinner in Woodside, California on February 17, 2011, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine ran a story titled "The world’s most powerful man meets President Obama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The world’s most powerful man meets President Obama |first1=Dan |last1=Amira |date=February 18, 2011 |newspaper=[[New York Magazine]] |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/the_worlds_most_powerful_man_m.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Zuckerberg’s company had grown to over one billion users.

According to [[Mark Roeder]] the rise of the geek represents a new phase of human evolution. In his book, ''[[Unnatural Selection: Why The Geeks Will Inherit The Earth]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com.au/books/Unnatural-Selection-Why-Geeks-Will-Inherit-Earth-Mark-Roeder/?isbn=9781743095683 Unnatural Selection by Mark Roeder]&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests that "the high-tech environment of the [[Anthropocene]] favours people with geek-like traits, many of whom are on the [[autism spectrum]], [[ADHD]], or [[dyslexia]]. Previously, such people may have been at a disadvantage, but now their unique cognitive traits enable some of them to resonate with the new technological [[zeitgeist]] and become very successful."

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine observed, on June 2, 2012, "Those square pegs (geeks) may not have an easy time in school. They may be mocked by jocks and ignored at parties. But these days no serious organisation can prosper without them."&lt;ref&gt;In praise of misfits. Economist. June 2, 2012. http://www.economist.com/node/21556230&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Geek chic'''" refers to a minor fashion trend that arose in the mid 2000s in which young people adopted "geeky" fashions, such as oversized black [[horn-rimmed glasses]], [[suspenders]]/[[Braces (clothing)|braces]], and [[three quarter pants|highwater trousers]]. The glasses—sometimes worn with non-prescription lenses or [[lensless glasses|without lenses]]—quickly became the defining aspect of the trend, with the media identifying various celebrities as "trying geek" or "going geek" for wearing such glasses, such as [[David Beckham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geeky Becks' specs appeal|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3135201/Geeky-Becks-specs-appeal.html#ixzz2MKyQ8coR|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin Timberlake]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nice glasses!

The term "geek chic" was appropriated by some self-identified "geeks" to refer to a new, socially acceptable role in a technologically advanced society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambert |first=Katie |url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/geek-chic.htm |title=How Stuff works: Geek Chic |publisher=People.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iron Jawed Angels''''' is a 2004 American [[historical drama film]] directed by [[Katja von Garnier]]. The film stars [[Hilary Swank]] as suffragist leader [[Alice Paul]], [[Frances O'Connor]] as activist [[Lucy Burns]], [[Julia Ormond]] as [[Inez Milholland]], and [[Anjelica Huston]] as [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]. It received critical acclaim after the film premiered at the 2004 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Behind/Articles/Sundance2004/Sundance2004.html|title=Interview with Paul Fischer at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004|website=Film Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film focuses on the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|American women's suffrage]] movement during the 1910s and follows women's suffrage leaders Alice Paul and Lucy Burns as they use peaceful and effective [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] strategies, tactics, and dialogues to revolutionize the American feminist movement to grant women the right to vote. The film was released in the United States on February 15, 2004.

==Plot==
[[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] return from England where they met while participating in the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] started by radical suffragette leader [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and led by her daughter [[Christabel Pankhurst]]. The pair presents a plan to the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association|National American Woman's Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) to campaign directly in Washington D.C. for national voting rights for women. They find that their ideas are too forceful for the established suffragette leaders, particularly [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], but they are allowed to lead the NAWSA Congressional Committee in D.C. They start by organizing the [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|1913 Woman Suffrage Procession]] on the eve of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s inauguration.

While soliciting donations at an art gallery, Paul convinces labor lawyer [[Inez Milholland]] to lead the parade on a white horse. Paul also meets a Washington newspaper political cartoonist, Ben Weissman (a fictional character), and there are hints of romantic overtones. In a fictional scene, Paul tries to explain to [[Ida B. Wells]] why she wants African American women to march in the back of the parade in order to not anger southern Democrats and activists, but Wells refuses, and she comes out of the crowd to join a white group during the middle of the parade (Wells did refuse to be segregated, and marched with her state delegation, but never met with Paul about it.&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2226351&lt;/ref&gt;). After disagreements over fundraising, Paul and Burns are forced out of the NAWSA, and they found the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP) to support their approach. Alice Paul briefly explores a romantic relationship with Ben Weissman.

Further conflicts within the movement are portrayed as NAWSA leaders criticize NWP tactics, such as protesting against Wilson, and their sustained picketing outside of the White House in the [[Silent Sentinels]] action. Relations between the American government and the NWP protesters also intensify, as many women are arrested for their actions and charged with "obstructing traffic."

The arrested women are sent to the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]] for 60-day terms. Despite [[Night of Terror (event)|abusive and terrorizing treatment]], Paul and other women undertake a [[hunger strike]], during which paid guards [[Force-feeding|force-feed]] them milk and raw eggs. The suffragists are blocked from seeing visitors or lawyers, until (fictional) [[U.S. Senator]] Tom Leighton visits his wife Emily, one of the imprisoned women. News of their treatment leaks to the media after Emily secretly passes a letter to her husband during his visit. Paul, Burns, and the other women are released.

Pressure continues to be put on President Wilson as the NAWSA joins in the NWP call for passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Wilson finally accedes to the pressure rather than be called out in the international press for fighting for democracy in Europe while denying democracy's benefits to half of the U.S. population. During the amendment's ratification, [[Harry T. Burn]], a member of the Tennessee legislature, receives a telegram from his mother at the last minute, changes his vote, and the amendment passes.

==Origin of title==
The film derives its title from Massachusetts Representative [[Joseph Walsh (Massachusetts)|Joseph Walsh]], who in 1917 opposed the creation of a committee to deal with women's suffrage. Walsh thought the creation of a committee would be yielding to "the nagging of iron-jawed angels" and referred to the [[Silent Sentinels]] as "bewildered, deluded creatures with short skirts and short hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOUSE MOVES FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE; Adopts by 181 to 107 Rule to Create a Committee to Deal with the Subject. DEBATE A HEATED ONE Annoyance of President by Pickets at White House Denounced as "Outlawry."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1917/09/25/archives/house-moves-for-woman-suffrage-adopts-by-181-to-107-rule-to-create.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 25, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of steel holding open the jaws of the women being force-fed after the [[Silent Sentinel]] arrests and hunger strike is also a plot point in the film.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a positive review, writing, "''Iron Jawed Angels'' is an important history lesson told in a fresh, and blazing fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvplex.go.com/buenavista/ebertandroeper/mp3/040216_iron_jawed_angels.mp3|title=Iron Jawed Angels Review|website=TV Plex|date=February 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Faundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing, "[[HBO]]'s starry suffragette drama, ''Iron Jawed Angels'', latches on to a worthy historical subject and then hopes noble intentions will be enough to carry the day. Alas, there's no such luck in this talky, melodramatic overview of the dawn of equal rights for women in America. Gussied up with a comically anachronistic use of period music on the soundtrack and flashy, [[MTV]]-style montage sequences, pic misguidedly strives – but ultimately fails – to belie its instincts as an assembly-line movie-of-the-week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/iron-jawed-angels-1200536877/|title=Review: 'Iron Jawed Angels'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Pardi of ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave a mixed review, "All the elements for a splendid film about the early days of the women's rights are in place, but director Katja von Garnier's use of distracting cinematic trickery and jarringly modern music meshes poorly with the period setting... Blessed with a flawless physical production, von Garnier distorts her epic tale with music that belongs on a [[Lilith Fair]] tour; it sometimes feels as though she and her writers conceived the fight for women's suffrage as a 1912 version of ''[[Sex and the City]]''. Only when the anachronisms finally subside in the film's final third is the moving core is allowed to shine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movies.tvguide.com/iron-jawed-angels/review/278843|title=Iron Jawed Angels Review|website=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for five awards at [[56th Primetime Emmy Awards]], none of which were won; three awards at the [[62nd Golden Globe Awards]], winning one; and two awards at the [[9th Golden Satellite Awards]], winning one. [[Anjelica Huston]] won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] and the [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] for her performance in the film.

'''Isabel Coixet Castillo''' ({{IPA-ca|izəˈβɛl kuˈʃɛt}}; born 9 April 1960) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[film director]]. She is one of the most prolific film directors of contemporary [[Spain]], having directed twelve feature-length films since the beginning of her film career in 1988, in addition to documentary films, shorts, and commercials. Her films follow a departure from traditional national [[cinema of Spain]], and help to “untangle films from their national context, ... clearing the path for thinking about national film from different perspectives.”&lt;ref name="Pavlovic 2009 181–225"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pavlovic|first=Tatjana|title=100 Years of Spanish Cinema|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-8420-5|pages=181–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recurring themes of “emotions, feelings, and existential conflict” coupled with her distinct visual style secure the “multifaceted (she directs, writes, produces, and acts)” filmmaker's status as a “[[Catalans|Catalan]] [[auteur]]”.&lt;ref name="Pavlovic 2009 181–225"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Paul Julian|title=Waiting for Pedro|journal=Sight and Sound|date=January 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=9–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life ==
Isabel Coixet (Sant Adrià del Besós, Barcelona, April, 9 of 1960) started filming when she was given a 8mm camera on the occasion of her First Communion. After obtaining a BA degree in History at Barcelona University, where she majored in Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century History, she worked in advertising and spot writing with a magazine called ''Fotogramas''. She continued working in the world of advertising, gaining a brillian curriculum in that field, standing out as creative director of the agency JWT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://festivaldemalaga.com/noticias/ver/550/isabel-coixet-premio-retrospectiva-malaga-hoy-del-18-festival|title=Oficial Malaga Film Festival Webpage|last=|first=|date=|website=Festival de Malaga|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her illustrious client list includes BMW, Renault and Ikea. She won several accolades for her spots, but the ads did not fulfilled her expectations.

Coixet made her first short film in 1984 “''Mira y verás''”. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guiadelocio.com/cine/personajes/isabel-coixet|title=Guía del Ocio|last=|first=|date=|website=Guía del Ocio|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1988, Coixet made her debut as a scriptwriter and director in ''Demasiado Viejo Para Morir Joven'' ("Too Old to Die Young"). For this movie, she was nominated at the [[Goya Awards]] as a Best New Director.

In 1996, she traveled to the United States to shoot his first English-language feature film entitled ''Things I Never Told You'' (''Cosas que nunca te dije''). In this moving drama, the cast was made up of American actors led by Lili Taylor and Andrew McCarthy. Coixet received her second nomination at the Goya Awards for [[Goya Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Coixet then made an association with a French production company and in 1998 she shooted for the first time in Spain and in Spanish to carry out the historical adventure ''A los que aman''. Two years later she founded her own production company, with which she produced her most acclaimed film to date, Mi vida sin mí (My Life Without Me). Since then she has been one of the most acclaimed directors of our cinema.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2000, she founded her own production company called [http://misswasabi.com Miss Wasabi Films], for which she has produced over 400 commercials. 

Her international success came in 2003 thanks to the intimate drama ''My Life Without Me''. The film is based on a short story by Nancy Kincaid in which the Canadian actress Sarah Polley played Ann, a young mother who decides to hide from her family that she has terminal cancer. This Hispanic-Canadian co-production was highly praised at the Berlin International Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2003/02_programm_2003/02_Filmdatenblatt_2003_20030081.html#tab=boulevard|title=My Life Without Me {{!}} Mein Leben ohne mich|last=|first=|date=|website=www.berlinale.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coixet then continued working with Polley on a new film, ''The Secret Life of Words'' which was released in 2005, starring Sarah Polley, Tim Robbins and Javier Cámara. The film was awarded with four Goyas: Best Film, Best Director, Best Production and Best Screenplay.

The award ceremony was held at the Palau de la Música.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2006/04/26/catalunya/1146013656_850215.html|title=Isabel Coixet se convierte en la gran triunfadora de los Sant Jordi de cine|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=2006-04-26|work=El País|access-date=2018-11-16|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Productions ===
Isabel Coixet created her own production company in 2000, [http://misswasabi.com/ Miss Wasabi], with the vocation to self-produce her own more personal projects. The production company has dedicated itself basically to advertising, the making of video clips, documentaries and a fictional feature film, but also to projects outside the audiovisual sector, such as exhibitions, books and other types of cultural projects. Among the main projects, directed and produced by Isabel Coixet, are the documentary '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Aral, el mar perdido''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (2009), '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''From I to J''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (2010), '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Escuchando al Juez Garzón''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (2011), the feature film '''Ayer no termina nunca''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (2013), or "''Talking about Rose.

=== 50 años de... ===
On the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of TVE Catalunya (TVE Cataluña) Isabel Coixet, along with fifteen other Catalan documentary filmmakers, had the idea of capturing in images, taken from the archive of Televisión Española, the last half Spanish century. The programme ''50 years of...'' (50 años de…) is in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of the first TVE broadcast in Catalonia, whose first headquarters was the mythical Miramar Hotel in Barcelona, which was maintained for twenty-four years, until 1983, when the production center was moved to San Cugat del Vallés. There has been a second season, as well as a third entitled ''Cómo hemos cambiado''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20090817/anos/289219.shtml|title=50 años de... {{!}} La evolución de la sociedad española, en 16 capítulos (temporada 2009) - RTVE.es|date=2009-08-17|work=RTVE.es|access-date=2018-11-16|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403211441/|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20091228/evolucion-sociedad-espanola-segunda-temporada/308382.shtml|title=50 años de... {{!}} La evolución de la sociedad española  (segunda temporada) - RTVE.es|date=2009-12-28|work=RTVE.es|access-date=2018-11-16|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and Political Views==
Coixet was first released in the cinema almost at the same time as she released in maternity. Her daughter, Zoe, was born in 1997, a year after the release of her first feature, ''Things I Never Told You''. With her and her husband, DJ and musician César Sala, she formed a home in Barcelona, from where she has no problem sharing her opinions on the debate around the Catalan secession.

This is not surprising, given that she has always shown that she has a marked political profile (her steps in advertising have led her to create campaign spots for the Spanish party PSOE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elmundo.es/album/loc/2016/02/02/56b0e5b4268e3ee8698b46a9.html|title=El lado más íntimo de los candidatos a Mejor Director en los Premios Goya 2016 - Isabel Coixet se licenció en H... {{!}} loc {{!}} EL MUNDO|work=ELMUNDO|access-date=2018-11-16|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and Themes ==
Coixet's work as a director is striking for being, as ''The New York Times'' describes her, “unclassifiable.”&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Berlinale-Escuchando-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/arts/29iht-coixet29.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Isabel Coixet, an 'Unclassifiable' Director|last1=Minder|first1=Raphael|date=28 September 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the film, she shoots in English or Spanish, and subjects are diverse. Coixet’s trademark is her filmmaking technique, which was derived from her background in advertising, where visuals, color, and composition are carefully constructed.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Berlinale-Escuchando-2011" /&gt; She works as the camera operator on all of her films.

Among her most recurrent themes we can find a concern for communication, for words as a way of conventional understanding between people and that usually do not have the effect we expect. As she herself has acknowledged on occasion, she is obsessed with those situations in which messages do not reach their recipient. 

Another of her signs of identity is her marked social commitment, both with themes such as global warming (which she showed in 'The Secret Life of Words') and with social themes (documentaries such as the one made to Judge Garzón are a good example). 

Love and solitude are also constant in her cinema, in a very deep and spiritual way, nothing topical and stereotyped, although there is a common place recognizable in several of her productions that is the laundry.

The filmmaker's approach to her characters and their stories is surprising because of her ability to get them in deep. To offer them to the spectator with a simple but tremendously transparent view. 

This search for connection is influenced by one of her great referents: the poet John Berger, from whom she draws, in his own words, the conviction that "anything can explain the world" through the connection between poetry, philosophy, etc. 

In Coixet's universe, spiritual connections between people are combined with a strong social consciousness, always ready to denounce the injustices of the world.

In addition, Isabel Coixet's political and feminist involvement is evident. For example, ''The Secret Life of Words'' is a film that denounces the rape of a certain woman in a certain conflict: the Balkan War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fotogramas.es/noticias-cine/a18626003/isabel-coixet-para-principiantes/|title=Isabel Coixet para principiantes|date=2017-04-09|work=Fotogramas|access-date=2018-11-16|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Albert.jpg|right|thumb|250px|James Albery]]'''James Albery''' (4 May 1838 &amp;ndash; 15 August 1889) was an English [[dramatist]].

==Life and career==
Albery was born in London. On leaving school Albery entered an architect's office, and started to write plays. His [[farce]] ''A Pretty Piece of Chiselling'' was given its first production by the Ingoldsby Club in 1864. After some failures, his adaptation, ''Dr Davy'', was produced at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] (1866). His most successful piece, ''Two Roses'', a comedy, was produced at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in 1870, in which [[Sir Henry Irving]] made one of his earliest London successes as Digby Grant.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The production ran for 300 performances.

Albery was the author of a large number of other plays and adaptations, including ''Coquettes'' (1870); ''Pickwick'', a four-act drama (based on [[Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1871); ''Pink Dominos'' (1877), a [[farce]] that ran for an extremely successful 555 performances and was one of a series of adaptations from the French which he made for the [[Criterion Theatre]], where his wife, the actress Mary Moore (who after his death became Lady [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] (1861—1931)), played the leading parts; ''Jingle'' (a farcical version of ''Pickwick''), produced at the Lyceum in 1878;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Albery, James|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Oriana'' (with music by [[Frederic Clay]]).

His one-act [[operetta]], ''[[The Spectre Knight]]'', with music by [[Alfred Cellier]], ran as a companion piece to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' and then ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]] in 1878 and on tour.  He also wrote the farce ''Brighton'' (1888) among other later plays. Albery also wrote a book called ''Where's the Cat?'' in 1880.

Albery's and Moore's son was [[Bronson Albery]] (1881-1971), a theatre director, after whom the Albery Theatre is named.  He wrote this epitaph for himself:  "He slept beneath the moon/He basked beneath the sun;/He lived a life of going-to-do,/And died with nothing done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Osmania Veterinarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LpYAAAAYAAJ|year=1954|publisher=Osmania University|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Collier Brillantverführung auf weiß.jpg|thumb|upright|''Diamond temptation'' design.]]
'''Jewellery''' (British English) or '''jewelry''' (American English)&lt;ref name=americanbritspelling&gt;see [[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled in British English|American and British spelling differences]]&lt;/ref&gt; consists of small decorative items worn for personal [[adornment]], such as [[brooch]]es, [[ring (jewellery)|rings]], [[necklace]]s, [[earring]]s, [[pendant]]s, [[bracelet]]s, and [[cufflink]]s. Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal, often combined with [[gemstone]]s, has been the normal material for jewellery, but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used.  It is one of the oldest type of [[archaeological artefact]] – with 100,000-year-old beads made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery.&lt;ref name="bbcnewsdiscovery"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5099104.stm Study reveals 'oldest jewellery'], ''[[BBC News]]'', June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.

Jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. [[Gemstone]]s and similar materials such as [[amber]] and [[coral]], [[precious metal]]s, [[bead]]s, and [[seashell|shells]] have been widely used, and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] has often been important.  In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from [[hairpin (fashion)|hairpins]] to [[toe ring]]s, and even [[genital jewellery]].  The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes, and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures, but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture.

The word ''jewellery'' itself is derived from the word ''jewel'', which was [[anglicisation|anglicised]] from the [[French language|Old French]] "''jouel''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jewel jewel. (n.d.).] Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved on August 7, 2007, from the Dictionary.com website.&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond that, to the [[Latin]] word "''jocale''", meaning plaything. In [[British English]], [[Indian English]], [[New Zealand English]], [[Hiberno-English]], [[Australian English]], and [[South African English]] it is spelled ''jewellery,'' while the spelling is ''jewelry'' in [[American English]].&lt;ref name=americanbritspelling/&gt;  Both are used in [[Canadian English]], though ''jewelry'' prevails by a two to one margin. In French and a few other European languages the equivalent term, ''joaillerie'', may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as ''[[objets d'art]]'' and church items, not just objects worn on the person.

==Form and function==
[[File:Kenyan man.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kenya]]n man wearing tribal beads.]]
Humans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:

Most cultures at some point have had a practice of keeping large amounts of wealth stored in the form of jewellery. Numerous cultures store wedding [[dowry|dowries]] in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Viking Money|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the use of [[slave beads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/trade-beads/|title=Trade Beads|last=Web Team|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum|date=2011-01-13|website=www.vam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many items of jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[buckle]]s, originated as purely functional items, but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished.&lt;ref name="kingfisherhistory"&gt;Holland, J. 1999. The Kingfisher History Encyclopedia. ''Kingfisher books''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewellery can also symbolise group membership (as in the case, of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[crucifix]] or the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Star of David]]) or status (as in the case of [[Livery collar|chains of office]], or the Western practice of [[marriage|married]] people wearing wedding rings).

Wearing of [[amulet]]s and [[devotional medal]]s to provide protection or ward off evil is common in some [[culture]]s. These may take the form of symbols (such as the [[ankh]]), stones, plants, animals, body parts (such as the [[Hamsa|Khamsa]]), or [[glyph]]s (such as stylised versions of the [[Throne Verse]] in [[Islamic art]]).&lt;ref&gt;

==Materials and methods==
[[File:Collar abalorios.jpg|thumb|upright|Bead embroidery design.]]
In creating jewellery, [[gemstone]]s, [[coin]]s, or other precious items are often used, and they are typically set into precious metals. Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually [[sterling silver]], or 92.5% fine silver. In [[costume jewellery]], [[stainless steel]] findings are sometimes used.

Other commonly used materials include [[glass]], such as fused-glass or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]; [[wood]], often carved or turned; [[Exoskeleton|shells]] and other natural animal substances such as [[bone]] and [[ivory]]; natural [[clay]]; [[polymer clay]]; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give an English [[Assay office]] (the building which gives English jewellery its stamp of approval, the [[Hallmark]]) the right to destroy the piece, however it is very rare for the assay office to do so.

[[Bead]]s are frequently used in jewellery. These may be made of glass, gemstones, metal, [[wood]], shells, clay and polymer clay. [[beadwork|Beaded jewellery]] commonly encompasses [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[earring]]s, [[belt (clothing)|belts]] and [[ring (jewellery)|rings]]. Beads may be large or small; the smallest type of beads used are known as [[seed bead]]s, these are the beads used for the "woven" style of beaded jewellery. Another use of seed beads is an embroidery technique where seed beads are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets. Bead embroidery, a popular type of handwork during the [[Victorian era]], is enjoying a [[renaissance]] in modern jewellery making. Beading, or beadwork, is also very popular in many [[African culture|African]] and indigenous North American cultures.

[[Silversmith]]s, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[Lapidary|lapidaries]] methods include [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], [[soldering]] or [[welding]], cutting, [[Lapidary|carving]] and "cold-joining" (using [[adhesive]]s, [[staple (fastener)|staples]] and [[rivet]]s to assemble parts).&lt;ref&gt;McCreight, Tim.

===Diamonds===

Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in [[Angola]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], and other nations have been labelled as [[blood diamond]]s when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an [[insurgency]].

The [[British crown jewels]] contain the [[Cullinan Diamond]], part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found (1905), at 3,106.75 [[Carat (unit)|carats]] (621.35 g).

Now popular in [[engagement ring]]s, this usage dates back to the marriage of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2167870/ "Diamonds Are a Girl's Worst Friend:  The trouble with engagement rings."] by Meghan O'Rourke at Slate.com on June 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Many precious and semiprecious stones are used for jewellery. Among them are:

;[[Amber]]: Amber, an ancient [[organic gemstone]], is composed of tree resin that has hardened over time. The stone must be at least one million years old to be classified as amber, and some amber can be up to 120 million years old.
;[[Amethyst]]: Amethyst has historically been the most prized gemstone in the quartz family. It is treasured for its purple hue, which can range in tone from light to dark.
;[[Emerald]]: Emeralds are one of the three main precious gemstones (along with rubies and sapphires) and are known for their fine green to bluish green colour. They have been treasured throughout history, and some historians report that the Egyptians mined emerald as early as 3500 BC.
;[[Jade]]: Jade is most commonly associated with the colour green but can come in a number of other colours as well. Jade is closely linked to Asian culture, history, and tradition, and is sometimes referred to as the ''stone of heaven''.
;[[Jasper]]: Jasper is a gemstone of the chalcedony family that comes in a variety of colours. Often, jasper will feature unique and interesting patterns within the coloured stone. Picture jasper is a type of jasper known for the colours (often beiges and browns) and swirls in the stone’s pattern.
;[[Quartz]]: Quartz refers to a family of crystalline gemstones of various colours and sizes.  Among the well-known types of quartz are [[rose quartz]] (which has a delicate pink colour), and smoky quartz (which comes in a variety of shades of translucent brown). A number of other gemstones, such as [[Amethyst]] and [[Citrine quartz|Citrine]], are also part of the quartz family. [[Rutilated quartz]] is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions.
;[[Ruby]]: Rubies are known for their intense red colour and are among the most highly valued precious gemstones.  Rubies have been treasured for millennia. In [[Sanskrit]], the word for ruby is ''ratnaraj'', meaning ''king of precious stones''.
;[[Sapphire]]: The most popular form of sapphire is blue sapphire, which is known for its medium to deep blue colour and strong saturation.  Fancy sapphires of various colours are also available.  In the United States, blue sapphire tends to be the most popular and most affordable of the three major precious gemstones (emerald, ruby, and sapphire).
;[[Turquoise]]: Turquoise is found in only a few places on earth, and the world’s largest turquoise producing region is the southwest United States.  Turquoise is prized for its attractive colour, most often an intense medium blue or a greenish blue, and its ancient heritage.  Turquoise is used in a great variety of jewellery styles.  It is perhaps most closely associated with southwest and Native American jewellery, but it is also used in many sleek, modern styles.  Some turquoise contains a matrix of dark brown markings, which provides an interesting contrast to the gemstone’s bright blue colour.

Some gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are classified as organic, meaning that they are produced by living organisms.  Others are inorganic, meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.

Some gems, for example, [[amethyst]], have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems, such as [[cubic zirconia]], which can be used in place of diamond.&lt;ref&gt;Nassau, K. (1980).''Gems made by man''. {{ISBN|0801967732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal finishes===
[[File:A002.jpg|thumb|right|An example of gold plated jewellery.]]
For [[platinum]], [[gold]], and [[silver]] jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, [[brushed metal|brushed]], and hammered. High-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as [[diamond]]s. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving "brush strokes". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy [[Surface texture|texture]].

Some jewellery is plated to give it a shiny, reflective look or to achieve a desired colour. Sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or may be plated with rhodium or gold. Base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver, gold, or rhodium for a more attractive finish.

==Impact on society==
Jewellery has been used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings;&lt;ref name="Pliny33"&gt;Pliny the Elder. ''The Natural History''. ed. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]], Book XXXIII ''The Natural History of Metals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+33.1 Online at the Perseus Project] Chapter 4. Accessed July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; later, [[sumptuary law]]s dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. This was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. Cultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as [[Body piercing|piercings]], has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, [[hip hop]] culture has popularised the slang term [[bling-bling]], which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.

Conversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise [[wedding ring]]s for men, which caught on, as well as [[engagement ring]]s for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. By the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the U.S. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Vicky. "A real Man's Ring: Gender and the Invention of Tradition." ''Journal of Social History'', Summer 2003, pp 837–856.&lt;/ref&gt; Religion has also played a role in societies influence. Islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as a social [[Haraam|taboo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]. ''[http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/Q_LP/ The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam (online)]''&lt;/ref&gt; and many religions have edicts against excessive display.&lt;ref&gt;Greenbaum, Toni. "SILVER SPEAKS: TRADITIONAL JEWELRY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST". ''Metalsmith'', Winter2004, Vol. 24, Issue 1, p.56. Greenbaum provides the explanation for the lack of historical examples; the majority of Islamic jewellery was in the form of bridal [[Dowry|dowries]], and traditionally was not handed down from generation to generation; instead, on a woman's death it was sold at the [[souk]] and recycled or sold to passers-by. Islamic jewellery from before the 19th century is thus exceedingly rare.&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, the New Testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold, in the writings of the apostles Paul and Peter. In Revelation 17, "the great whore" or false religious system, is depicted as being "decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand." (Rev. 17:4) For Muslims it is considered [[haraam]] for a man to wear [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|title=Dictionary of Islam|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian denominations forbidding the use of jewellery by both men and women include [[Amish Mennonite|Amish-Mennonite]]s and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] churches.

==History==
The history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. It has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient [[culture]]s worked.

===Prehistory===

The earliest known Jewellery was actually created not by humans (Homo Sapiens) but by Neanderthal living in Europe. Specifically, perforated beads made from small sea shells have been found dating to 115,000 years ago in the Cueva de los Aviones, a cave along the southeast coast of Spain. Later in Kenya, at [[Enkapune Ya Muto]], beads made from perforated [[ostrich]] egg shells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago. In Russia, a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news//3270-150507-siberia-denisovan-bracelet|title=Stone Bracelet May Have Been Made by Denisovans|year=2015|quote=A stone bracelet unearthed in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia in 2008 is being called the oldest-known jewelry of its kind. Anatoly Derevyanko, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, and the research team believe that the cave’s Denisovan layers were uncontaminated by human activity from a later period. The soil around the two fragments of the jewelry piece was dated with oxygen isotopic analysis to 40,000 years ago. "In the same layer, where we found a Denisovan bone, were found interesting things; until then it was believed these were the hallmark of the emergence of Homo sapiens. First of all, there were symbolic items, such as jewelry, including the stone bracelet as well as a ring, carved out of marble," Derevyanko told The Siberian Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the [[European early modern humans]] had crude [[necklace]]s and [[bracelet]]s of bone, teeth, berries, and stone hung on pieces of string or animal [[sinew]], or pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together. In some cases, jewellery had shell or [[mother-of-pearl]] pieces.
A decorated engraved pendant (the [[Star Carr Pendant]]) dating to around 11,000 BC, and thought to be the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site of [[Star Carr]] in [[North Yorkshire]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.40.8 | issue=40 | title=A Unique Engraved Shale Pendant from the Site of Star Carr: the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Milner | first1 = Nicky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In southern [[Russia]], carved bracelets made of [[mammoth]] [[tusk]] have been found. The [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] features a perforation at the top, showing that it was intended to be worn as a [[pendant]].

Around seven-thousand years ago, the first sign of [[copper]] jewellery was seen.&lt;ref name="kingfisherhistory" /&gt; In October 2012 the Museum of Ancient History in Lower Austria revealed that they had found a grave of a female jewellery worker – forcing archaeologists to take a fresh look at prehistoric gender roles after it appeared to be that of a female fine metal worker – a profession that was previously thought to have been carried out exclusively by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://austrianindependent.com/news/General_News/2012-10-03/12320/Cavewoman_jeweller_rewrites_gender_history|title=Cavewoman jeweller rewrites gender history|author=The Austrian Independent News and Pictures|work=austrianindependent.com|access-date=2012-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007223640/http://austrianindependent.com/news/General_News/2012-10-03/12320/Cavewoman_jeweller_rewrites_gender_history|archive-date=2012-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first signs of established jewellery making in [[Ancient Egypt]] was around 3,000–5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="last2millionyears"&gt;Reader's Digest Association. 1986. The last 2 million years. ''Reader's Digest''. {{ISBN|0864380070}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egyptians]] preferred the luxury, rarity, and workability of [[gold]] over other metals. In [[Predynastic Egypt]] jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among [[grave goods]].

In conjunction with gold jewellery, Egyptians used coloured [[glass]], along with semi-precious gems. The colour of the jewellery had significance. Green, for example, symbolised fertility. [[Lapis lazuli]] and silver had to be imported from beyond the country’s borders.

Egyptian designs were most common in [[Phoenicia]]n jewellery. Also, ancient [[Turkey|Turkish]] designs found in [[Persia]]n jewellery suggest that trade between the Middle East and [[Europe]] was not uncommon. Women wore elaborate gold and silver pieces that were used in ceremonies.&lt;ref name="last2millionyears" /&gt;

===Europe and the Middle East===

====Mesopotamia====

By approximately 5,000 years ago, jewellery-making had become a significant craft in the cities of [[Mesopotamia]]. The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]], where hundreds of burials dating 2900–2300 BC were unearthed; tombs such as that of [[Puabi]] contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as [[lapis lazuli]] crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In [[Assyria]], men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including [[amulet]]s, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and [[cylinder seal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewellery in Mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as [[cloisonné]], [[engraving]], fine [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]], and [[filigree]].&lt;ref&gt;Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 295–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout Mesopotamian archaeological sites. One record in the [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] royal archives, for example, gives the composition of various items of jewellery: {{quote|
* 1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including: 34 flat speckled chalcedony bead, [and] 35 gold fluted beads, in groups of five.
* 1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including: 39 flat speckled chalcedony beads, [with] 41 fluted beads in a group that make up the hanging device.
* 1 necklace with rounded lapis lazuli beads including: 28 rounded lapis lazuli beads, [and] 29 fluted beads for its clasp.&lt;ref&gt;Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Greeks started using gold and gems in jewellery in 1600 BC, although beads shaped as shells and animals were produced widely in earlier times. Around 1500 BC, the main techniques of working gold in Greece included casting, twisting bars, and making wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewellery Through 7000 Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lZQAAAAMAAJ|year=1976|publisher=British Museum Publications|isbn=978-0714100548|pages=65–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the Mycenaean period, but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the Bronze Age. The forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient Greece such as the armring (13th century BC), brooch (10th century BC) and pins (7th century BC), have varied widely since the Bronze Age as well. Other forms of jewellery include wreaths, earrings, necklace and bracelets. A good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in Greece is the ‘Gold Olive Wreath’ (4th century BC), which is modeled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the Olympic Games. Jewellery dating from 600 to 475 BC is not well represented in the archaeological record, but after the Persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deppert-Lippitz, Barbara |author2=Bromberg, Anne R. |author3=Dennis, John |title=Ancient Gold Jewelry at the Dallas Museum of Art|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUtQAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Dallas Museum of Art|isbn=978-0936227191|chapter=Ch. 4 Europe and Western|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads Because these bracelets used considerably more metal, many examples were made from bronze. By 300 BC, the Greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using [[amethyst]]s, [[pearl]], and [[emerald]]s. Also, the first signs of [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] appeared, with the Greeks creating them from [[India]]n [[Sardonyx]], a striped brown pink and cream [[agate]] stone. Greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures, with simple designs and workmanship. However, as time progressed, the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used.

Jewellery in [[Greece]] was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions. It was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth, social status, and beauty. The jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the "[[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]" or endowed the owner with [[supernatural powers]], while others had a religious symbolism. Older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the Gods.

They worked two styles of pieces: cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered. It was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two halves were then joined together, and [[wax]], followed by molten metal, was placed in the centre. This technique had been practised since the late [[Bronze Age]]. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface.'''

The Greeks took much of their designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European influences can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous [[polychrome]] butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near [[Olbia]], with only one example ever found anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|title=Polychrome Necklaces from the Late Hellenistic Period|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199–257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rome====
[[File:Intaille en améthyste.JPG|thumb|upright|Roman [[Amethyst]] [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] [[engraved gem]], c. 212 AD; later regarded as of St. Peter.]]
Although jewellery work was abundantly diverse in earlier times, especially among the barbarian tribes such as the [[Celts]], when the Romans conquered most of Europe, jewellery was changed as smaller factions developed the Roman designs. The most common artefact of early Rome was the [[brooch]], which was used to secure clothing together. The Romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent. Although they used gold, they sometimes used bronze or bone, and in earlier times, glass beads &amp; pearl. As early as 2,000 years ago, they imported [[Sri Lanka]]n [[sapphire]]s and Indian diamonds and used emeralds and [[amber]] in their jewellery. In Roman-ruled [[England]], fossilised [[wood]] called [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] from Northern England was often carved into pieces of jewellery. The early Italians worked in crude gold and created clasps, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They also produced larger [[pendant]]s that could be filled with [[perfume]].

Like the Greeks, often the purpose of Roman jewellery was to ward off the "Evil Eye" given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only wore a finger [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]. Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men wore a ring on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women wore rings with an [[engraved gem]] on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into [[medieval]] times when [[Monarch|kings]] and noblemen used the same method. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes.&lt;ref name="last2millionyears" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Post-Roman Europe continued to develop jewellery making skills. The [[Celts]] and [[Merovingians]] in particular are noted for their jewellery, which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Clothing fasteners, amulets, and, to a lesser extent, [[signet ring]]s, are the most common artefacts known to us. A particularly striking Celtic example is the [[Tara Brooch]]. The [[Torc]] was common throughout Europe as a symbol of status and power. By the 8th century, jewelled weaponry was common for men, while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women. Grave goods found in a 6th–7th century burial near [[Chalon-sur-Saône]] are illustrative. A young girl was buried with: 2 silver [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], a necklace (with coins), bracelet, gold earrings, a pair of hair-pins, comb, and buckle.&lt;ref&gt;Duby Georges and Philippe Ariès, eds. ''A History of Private Life'' Vol 1 – From Pagan Rome to Byzantium. Harvard, 1987. p 506&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Celtic art|Celts]] specialised in continuous patterns and designs, while Merovingian designs are best known for stylised animal figures.&lt;ref&gt;Duby, throughout.&lt;/ref&gt; They were not the only groups known for high quality work. Note the Visigoth work shown here, and the numerous decorative objects found at the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Ship burial]] at [[Sutton Hoo]] [[Suffolk]], [[England]] are a particularly well-known example.&lt;ref name="last2millionyears"/&gt;  On the continent, [[cloisonné]] and [[garnet]] were perhaps the quintessential method and gemstone of the period.

The Eastern successor of the Roman Empire, the [[Byzantine Empire]], continued many of the methods of the Romans, though religious themes came to predominate. Unlike the Romans, the Franks, and the Celts, however, Byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold, and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems. As in the West, Byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females, with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings. Woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like [[kolt]]s that decorated [[headband]].
Like other contemporary cultures, jewellery was commonly buried with its owner.&lt;ref name="Byzantium"&gt;Sherrard, P. (1972). ''Great Ages of Man: Byzantium''. Time-Life International.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renaissance====
[[File:Cameo Claudius Cdm Paris Chab220.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sardonyx]] [[cameo (carving)|cameo]].]]
The [[Renaissance]] and exploration both had significant impacts on the development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the [[Cheapside Hoard]], the stock of a jeweller hidden in [[London]] during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian [[emerald]], [[topaz]], [[amazonite]] from Brazil, [[spinel]], [[iolite]], and [[chrysoberyl]] from Sri Lanka, [[ruby]] from India, Afghan [[lapis lazuli]], [[Iran|Persian]] [[turquoise]], Red Sea [[peridot]], as well as Bohemian and Hungarian [[opal]], [[garnet]], and [[amethyst]]. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, Diana. ''Rings: Symbols of Wealth, Power, and Affection''. New York: Abrams, 1993. {{ISBN|0810937751}} p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among merchants of the period was [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]], who brought the precursor stone of the [[Hope Diamond]] to France in the 1660s.

When [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleon’s rule, jewellers introduced ''[[parure]]s'', suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond [[tiara]], diamond [[earring]]s, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleon’s wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw the early stages of [[costume jewellery]], with [[Scale (zoology)|fish scale]] covered glass beads in place of [[pearl]]s or [[conch]] shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called ''bijoutiers'', while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called ''joailliers'', a practice which continues to this day.

====Romanticism====
[[File:Schwarzer Trauerschmuck2.jpg|thumb|upright|Mourning jewellery in the form of a [[jet (lignite)|jet]] [[brooch]], 19th century.]]
Starting in the late 18th century, [[Romanticism]] had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery. Perhaps the most significant influences were the public’s fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern [[archaeology]] and a fascination with Medieval and Renaissance art. Changing social conditions and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery. As a result, the use of industrial processes, cheaper alloys, and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or [[costume jewellery]]. Distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish, however, as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses, not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work. One such artist was the French goldsmith [[François-Désiré Froment-Meurice]]. A category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery. It originated in England, where [[Queen Victoria]] was often seen wearing [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] jewellery after the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and it allowed the wearer to continue wearing jewellery while expressing a state of mourning at the death of a loved one.&lt;ref name = "1000facts"/&gt;

In the United States, this period saw the founding in 1837 of [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] by [[Charles Lewis Tiffany]]. Tiffany's put the United States on the world map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Later, it would gain popular notoriety as the setting of the film [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]. In France, [[Pierre Cartier (jeweler)|Pierre Cartier]] founded [[Cartier SA]] in 1847, while 1884 saw the founding of [[Bulgari]] in Italy. The modern production studio had been born and was a step away from the former dominance of individual craftsmen and [[patronage]].

This period also saw the first major collaboration between East and West. Collaboration in [[Pforzheim]] between German and Japanese artists led to [[Shakudō]] plaques set into [[Filigree]] frames being created by the Stoeffler firm in 1885).&lt;ref&gt;Ilse-Neuman, Ursula. Book review  “Schmuck/Jewellery 1840–1940: Highlights from the Schmuckmuseum Pforzheim.’’ ‘’Metalsmith’’. Fall2006, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the grand finalé – and an appropriate transition to the following period – were the masterful creations of the Russian artist [[Peter Carl Fabergé]], working for the Imperial Russian court, whose [[Fabergé egg]]s and jewellery pieces are still considered as the epitome of the goldsmith’s art.

====18th Century / Romanticism/ Renaissance====
Many whimsical fashions were introduced in the extravagant eighteenth century. Cameos that were used in connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the gold chains were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.&lt;ref name="A history of feminine fashion"&gt;{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 9781289626945|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art Nouveau====
In the 1890s, jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing [[Art Nouveau]] style and the closely related German [[Jugendstil]], British (and to some extent American) [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Catalan [[Modernisme]], Austro-Hungarian [[Sezession]], Italian "Liberty", etc.

Art Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonné, and [[plique-à-jour]].  Motifs included orchids, irises, pansies, vines, swans, peacocks, snakes, dragonflies, mythological creatures, and the female silhouette.

[[René Lalique]], working for the Paris shop of [[Samuel Bing]], was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend. The [[Darmstadt Artists' Colony]] and [[Wiener Werkstätte]] provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark [[Georg Jensen]], though best known for his [[Silver (household)|Silverware]], also contributed significant pieces. In England, [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], (notably through the [[Cymric (metalware)|Cymric]] designs of [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]) and the British arts &amp; crafts movement of [[Charles Robert Ashbee]] contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's dragonfly design is one of the best examples of this. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamels]] played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature.

The end of [[World War I]] once again changed public attitudes, and a more sober style developed.&lt;ref&gt;Constantino, Maria. ''Art Nouveau''. Knickerbocker Press; 1999 {{ISBN|1577150740}} as well as Ilse-Neuman 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art Deco====
Growing political tensions, the after-effects of the war, and a reaction against the perceived decadence of the turn of the 20th century led to simpler forms, combined with more effective manufacturing for mass production of high-quality jewellery. Covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s, the style has become popularly known as [[Art Deco]]. [[Walter Gropius]] and the German [[Bauhaus]] movement, with their philosophy of "no barriers between artists and craftsmen" led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms. Modern materials were also introduced: plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery, and of note are the chromed pendants of Russian-born Bauhaus master [[Naum Slutzky]]. Technical mastery became as valued as the material itself. In the West, this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the German [[Elizabeth Treskow]], although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s. It is based on the basic shapes.

===Asia===
In Asia, the [[Indian subcontinent]] has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery making anywhere,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} with a history of over 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Untracht, Oppi p15"&gt;Untracht, Oppi. ''Traditional Jewellery of India''. New York: Abrams, 1997 {{ISBN|0810938863}}. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], in what is now predominately modern-day Pakistan and part of northern and western India. Early jewellery making in [[China]] started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of [[Buddhism]] around 2,000 years ago.

====China====

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Chinese used [[silver]] in their jewellery more than gold. Blue [[kingfisher]] [[feather]]s were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. However, [[jade]] was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty.&lt;ref name="kingfisherhistory" /&gt; The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved. Jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries BC show evidence of having been worked with a compound [[milling machine]], hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Peter J., "Early Precision Compound Machine from Ancient China." ''Science,'' 6/11/2004, Vol. 304, Issue 5677&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the most uncommon piece of jewellery is the earring, which was worn neither by men nor women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Amulet]]s were common, often with a Chinese symbol or [[dragon]]. Dragons, Chinese symbols, and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenixes]] were frequently depicted on jewellery designs.

The Chinese often placed their jewellery in their graves. Most Chinese graves found by [[archaeologist]]s contain decorative jewellery.&lt;ref name="vanished"&gt;Reader's Digest Association. 1983. Vanished Civilisations. ''Reader's Digest''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian subcontinent]] has a long jewellery history, which went through various changes through cultural influence and politics for more than 5,000–8,000 years. Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Untracht, Oppi p15"/&gt; One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic [[bangle]]s. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the [[bead]] trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age.  Persian style also played a big role in India’s jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.

Jewellery in the Indus Valley was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists. They were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black. Over time, clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones. In present-day [[India]], bangles are made out of [[metal]] or glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/fashion/bangles.html |title=Bangles|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, [[choker]]s, and gold rings. Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads. Small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and women’s hair. The beads were about one millimetre long.

A female skeleton (presently on display at the National Museum, New Delhi, India) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand. ''Kada'' is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in Indian culture. They symbolizes animals like peacock, elephant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When showstopper Juhi walked down the ramp|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-08/bollywood/39833107_1_gehna-jewellers-sunil-datwani-ramp|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

According to Hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. Gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon. Both are the quintessential metals of Indian jewellery. Pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why Hindu tradition associates gold with immortality.  Gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient Indian literature. In the Vedic Hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda), a metaphor of the sun, whose light rises from the primordial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Untracht|first=Oppi|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=1997|isbn=978-0810938861|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewellery had great status with India’s royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. Only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. This would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals.  Even though the majority of the Indian population wore jewellery, [[Maharaja]]s and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. The [[Maharaja]]'s role was so important that the Hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. He was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prior|first1=Katherine|last2=Adamson|first2=John|title=Maharajas' Jewels|year=2000|publisher=Vendome Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0865652187|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Navaratna]] (nine gems)is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a [[Maharaja]] (Emperor). It is an amulet, which comprises diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, cat’s eye, coral, and hyacinth (red zircon). Each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity, represented the totality of the Hindu universe when all nine gems are together. The diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones. There were various cuts for the gemstone. Indian Kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers. Maharaja and other royal family members value gem as Hindu God. They exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close, especially the royal family members and other intimate allies. "Only the emperor himself, his intimate relations, and select members of his entourage were permitted to wear royal turban ornament. As the empire matured, differing styles of ornament acquired the generic name of [[sarpech]], from sar or sir, meaning head, and pech, meaning fastener."

[[India]] was the first country to mine [[diamond]]s, with some mines dating back to 296 BC. India traded the diamonds, realising their valuable qualities. Historically, diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lover’s or ruler’s lost favour, as symbols of tribute, or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection. Mughal emperors and Kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and worldly titles inscribed upon them. Moreover, it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in Indian social, political, economic, and religious event, as it often has done elsewhere. In Indian history, diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment, finance wars, foment revolutions, and tempt defections. They have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates. They have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond. Indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes.  Victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Katherine|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=2000|publisher=Vendome|location=New York|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and [[Indian wedding|weddings]].&lt;ref name="vanished" /&gt;

===North and South America===
Jewellery played a major role in the fate of the [[Americas]] when the [[Spain|Spanish]] established an empire to seize [[South America]]n gold. Jewellery making developed in the Americas 5,000 years ago in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. Large amounts of gold was easily accessible, and the [[Aztec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Maya civilisation|Mayans]], and numerous Andean cultures, such as the Mochica of Peru, created beautiful pieces of jewellery.

With the Mochica culture, goldwork flourished. The pieces are no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful examples of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst. The nose and ear ornaments, chest plates, small containers and whistles are considered masterpieces of ancient Peruvian culture.&lt;ref name="Larco"&gt;{{cite book

Among the Aztecs, only nobility wore gold jewellery, as it showed their rank, power, and wealth. Gold jewellery was most common in the Aztec Empire and was often decorated with [[feather]]s from [[Quetzal|Quetzal birds]] and others. In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige. [[Tlatoani|The Emperor]] and his High Priests, for example, would be nearly completely covered in jewellery when making public appearances. Although gold was the most common and a popular material used in Aztec jewellery, [[jade]], [[turquoise]], and certain feathers were considered more valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miller, Mary Ellen |author2=Taube, Karl A. |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya: An Illustrated Dictionary of Mesoamerican Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YGBQgAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0500050682}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to adornment and status, the Aztecs also used jewellery in sacrifices to appease the gods. Priests also used gem-encrusted daggers to perform animal and human sacrifices.&lt;ref name="last2millionyears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1000facts"&gt;Farndon, J. (2001). ''1,000 Facts on Modern History''. Miles Kelly Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ancient American civilization with expertise in jewellery making were the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. At the peak of their civilization, the Maya were making jewellery from jade, gold, silver, [[bronze]], and [[copper]]. Maya designs were similar to those of the Aztecs, with lavish headdresses and jewellery. The Maya also traded in precious gems. However, in earlier times, the Maya had little access to metal, so they made the majority of their jewellery out of bone or stone. Merchants and nobility were the only few that wore expensive jewellery in the Maya region, much the same as with the Aztecs.&lt;ref name="vanished" /&gt;

In [[North America]], Native Americans used [[Exoskeleton|shells]], wood, turquoise, and [[soapstone]], almost unavailable in South and Central America. The turquoise was used in necklaces and to be placed in earrings. Native Americans with access to [[oyster]] shells, often located in only one location in America, traded the shells with other tribes, showing the great importance of the body adornment trade in Northern America.&lt;ref name="500nations"&gt;Josephy Jr, A.M.

'''Native American jewellery''' is the personal adornment, often in the forms of necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, pins, brooches, labrets, and more, made by the [[Indigenous peoples of the United States]]. Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers. [[Native American tribes]] continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade. Lois Sherr Dubin writes, "[i]n the absence of written languages, adornment became an important element of Indian [Native American] communication, conveying many levels of information." Later, jewellery and personal adornment "...signaled resistance to assimilation. It remains a major statement of tribal and individual identity."&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Metalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine a variety of metals, hardwoods, precious and semi-precious gemstones, [[beadwork]], [[quillwork]], teeth, bones, hide, vegetal fibres, and other materials to create jewellery. Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.

===Pacific===
{{Main article|Jewellery in the Pacific}}
Jewellery making in the [[Pacific]] started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.

Jewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power. Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some, such as the inhabitants of [[Papua New Guinea]], wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy. Tribesman may wear boar bones through their noses.

Island jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;Neich, R., Pereira, F. 2004. Pacific Jewellery and Adornment. ''David Bateman'' &amp; ''Auckland Museum''. {{ISBN|1869535359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opal Armband 800pix.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[opal]] [[bracelet]].]]
[[Australia]] is now the number one supplier of [[opal]]s in the world. Opals had already been mined in Europe and South America for many years prior, but in the late 19th century, the Australian opal market became predominant. Australian opals are only mined in a few select places around the country, making it one of the most profitable stones in the Pacific.&lt;ref name="opal"&gt;Dorling Kindersley Ltd. 1989. Facts and Fallacies: Stories of the Strange and Unusual. Reader's Digest. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand]] [[Māori culture|Māori]] traditionally had a strong culture of personal adornment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=MINZ_T14&amp;Language=English&amp;dumbyparam=search "Maori made and wore items of jewllery..."], Te Papa&lt;/ref&gt; most famously the [[hei-tiki]]. Hei-tikis are traditionally carved by hand from bone, [[nephrite]], or [[bowenite]].

Nowadays a wide range of such traditionally inspired items such as bone carved pendants based on traditional fishhooks ''[[hei matau]]'' and other [[Pounamu|greenstone]] jewellery are popular with young New Zealanders of all backgrounds – for whom they relate to a generalized sense of New Zealand identity. These trends have contributed towards a worldwide interest in traditional Māori culture and arts.

Other than jewellery created through Māori influence, modern jewellery in New Zealand is multicultural and varied.&lt;ref name="pacific" /&gt;

==Modern==
[[File:Gold-jewellery-jewel-henry-designs-terabass.jpg|thumb|right|Gold and gemstone contemporary jewellery design.]]
Most modern commercial jewellery continues traditional forms and styles, but designers such as [[Georg Jensen]] have widened the concept of wearable art. The advent of new materials, such as plastics, [[Precious Metal Clay]] (PMC), and colouring techniques, has led to increased variety in styles. Other advances, such as the development of improved [[pearl]] harvesting by people such as [[Mikimoto Kōkichi]] and the development of improved quality artificial gemstones such as [[moissanite]] (a [[diamond simulant]]), has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.

The [[Art jewellery|"jewellery as art"]] movement was spearheaded by artisans such as [[Robert Lee Morris]] and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK. Influence from other cultural forms is also evident. One example of this is [[bling-bling]] style jewellery, popularised by hip-hop and rap artists in the early 21st century, e.g. [[Grill (jewelry)|grills]], a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.

[[File:Shraddha Kapoor at IBJA awards and fashion showcase.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Indian actress [[Shraddha Kapoor]] showcasing a modern Indian-style jewellery.]]
The late 20th century saw the blending of European design with oriental techniques such as [[Mokume-gane]]. The following are innovations in the decades straddling the year 2000: "Mokume-gane, hydraulic die forming, anti-clastic [[raising (metalworking)|raising]], [[fold-forming]], reactive metal anodising, shell forms, [[Metal clay|PMC]], [[photoetching]], and [use of] [[CAD/CAM]]."&lt;ref&gt;McCrieght, Tim.  "What's New?" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, [[3D printing]] as a production technique gains more and more importance. With a great variety of services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for [[prototype]]s, small batch series or unique and [[Personalization|personalized]] designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include [[Polyamide]], [[steel]] and [[wax]] (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using [[3D Modelling Software]].

[[Art jewellery|Artisan jewellery]] continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession. With more than 17 United States periodicals about beading alone, resources, accessibility, and a low initial cost of entry continues to expand production of hand-made adornments. Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ajew/hd_ajew.htm|title=Nineteenth-Century American Jewelry|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The increase in numbers of students choosing to study jewellery design and production in Australia has grown in the past 20 years, and Australia now has a thriving contemporary jewellery community. Many of these jewellers have embraced modern materials and techniques, as well as incorporating traditional workmanship.

More expansive use of metal to adorn the wearer, where the piece is larger and more elaborate than what would normally be considered jewellery, has come to be referred to by designers and fashion writers as [[Metal Couture]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohemad, Dena.

''Pushit Journal'' – News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilbarra, Sabina (May 5, 2014) [http://www.lol-la.com/qa-with-maleficent-costume-designer-manuel-albarran/ "Q &amp; A with Manuel Albarran"].

==Masonic==
[[File:Masonic jewels.jpg|upright|thumb|Types of masonic collar jewels.]]
Freemasons attach jewels to their detachable collars when in Lodge to signify a Brothers Office held with the Lodge. For example, the square represents the Master of the Lodge and the dove represents the Deacon.

== Body modification ==
[[File:Karen Padaung Girl Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] girl in Northern Thailand.]]
Jewellery used in [[body modification]] can be simple and plain or dramatic and extreme. The use of simple silver studs, rings, and earrings predominates.  Common jewellery pieces such as, earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.

[[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] women in [[Myanmar]] place large golden rings around their necks. From as early as five years old, girls are introduced to their first neck ring. Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves.  At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach {{convert|10|–|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity.&lt;ref name="ripleys"&gt;Packard, M. (2002). ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not Special Edition]]''. Scholastic Inc. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tribes related to the Paduang, as well as other cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings.  In the Americas, [[labret]]s have been worn since before [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] by [[Innu]] and [[First Nations]] peoples of the northwest coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|jstor=483428|title=George Catlin among the Nayas: Understanding the Practice of Labret Wearing on the Northwest Coast|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199–257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lip plate]]s are worn by the African [[Mursi people|Mursi]] and [[Sara people]], as well as some South American peoples.

In the late twentieth century, the influence of [[modern primitive|modern primitivism]] led to many of these practices being incorporated into western subcultures.  Many of these practices rely on a combination of body modification and decorative objects, thus keeping the distinction between these two types of decoration blurred.

In many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin.  Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture.  Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin.  Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with pulleys to hoist the recipient into the air.  This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.&lt;ref name="ripleys" /&gt;

==Jewellery market==
According to a 2007 KPMG study,&lt;ref name = giasummer2007&gt;{{cite journal| last = KPMG India | title= Global Jewelry Consumption | journal= Gems and Gemology | volume= XLIII |issue= Summer 2007| pages=180 | year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest jewellery market is the United States with a market share of 30.8%, Japan, India, China, and the Middle East each with 8–9%, and Italy with 5%. The authors of the study predict a dramatic change in market shares by 2015, where the market share of the United States will have dropped to around 25%, and China and India will increase theirs to over 13%. The Middle East will remain more or less constant at 9%, whereas Europe's and Japan's marketshare will be halved and become less than 4% for Japan, and less than 3% for the biggest individual European countries, Italy and the UK.

[[Image:KateSantley001.jpg|right|frame|Santley, c. 1875]]
'''Evangeline Estelle Gazina''' (c.1837&lt;ref name=Culme&gt;Culme, John. [http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20040821home.html Kate Santley], ''Footlight Notes'', No. 361, 14 August 2004, accessed 7 September 2012; and [http://www.remainstobeseen.com/item.php?item_no=2431 "Kate Santley by Sarony Cabinet Card"], ''Remains to Be Seen'', accessed 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; – 18 January 1923), better known under her stage name, '''Kate Santley''', was a German-born actress, singer and comedian.  After spending her childhood in the US, she came to England in 1861, where she had a successful career, later also becoming a theatre manager.

==Early life==
Santley's parents emigrated from Germany to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she was educated. At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, she came to England as a practising musician, but soon afterwards went on the stage as "Eva Stella", later becoming "Kate Santley".&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Kate Santley. Memories of Opera Bouffe and Burlesque", ''[[The Times]]'', 19 January 1933, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical theatre career==
Santley made a name in the 1860s in British [[music hall]]s and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] [[pantomime]]s.  Early in her career, she was popular for singing the song "The Bell goes a-ringing for Sarah."  At the [[Oxford Music Hall]], she had appeared with [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], who later married [[Carl Rosa]].  Santley was slim and pretty and became much photographed for visiting cards, postcards and advertising.  Early in her career, she played in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''St. George and the Dragon''.

[[Image:Kate Santley as Princess Toto.jpg|left|frame|as ''[[Princess Toto]]'']]
In 1871–72, she visited the US, where she appeared on Broadway, including in a revival of the hit 1866 musical, ''[[The Black Crook]]''.  Returning to London in 1872, she appeared in the London production of ''The Black Crook'' at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], where, the next year, she also starred in the title role in Burnand's English version of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Belle Hélène]]''.  Later in 1873, she sang Cunegonde in ''Le roi Carotte''.  In 1874, she played Haidee in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Don Juan'', then in ''La Jolie Parfumeuse'', followed by the title role in ''[[Whittington (opera)|Whittington]]'', by Offenbach.&lt;ref&gt;Perdoni, Leon A. [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra/Prog3.htm "An Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square Programme for 1873"]. Arthur Lloyd, 2005, accessed 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, she played Wilhelmina in ''The Jolly Waterman'' at the [[Opera Comique]] and then created the title character in (and produced) ''[[Princess Toto]]'', a [[comic opera]] by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Frederic Clay]].  Thereafter, Clay wrote numerous songs (such as her popular hit, "Nobody knows as I know") and other operas for Santley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London|publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Santley produced and starred in ''Dipunacy'', which was a popular [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''Diplomacy''.  1879, at the [[Royalty Theatre]], Santley played in ''La Marjolaine'' and starred in (and produced) ''Little Cinderella'' and in the hit ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'' by [[Frank Desprez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021130.html "Kate Santley and Company at the Royalty Theatre" (review of ''Tita'')]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, she played in the Drury Lane pantomime ''Mother Goose (and the Enchanted Beauty)'' with [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]], the popular music hall comedian.  In 1884, Santley played in ''La Cosaque'' at the Royalty, and in 1886, she hired [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] as musical director for the tour of her musical ''Vetah''.  In 1887, she played the title role in ''Indiana'' at the Grand Theatre, [[Islington]], and then on tour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RA4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160 "The Only Jones"], ''Judy, or the London Serio-comic Journal'', Volume 41, 5 October 1887, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre management==
[[File:Indiana - Weir Collection.jpg|thumb|Santley in ''Indiana'' at [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]], Edinburgh]]
In 1876, Santley managed [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s revival of their one-act hit ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]].  [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] joined forces with Santley in January 1877 at the Royalty to present ''Lischen and Fritzen'', Offenbach's ''Orpheus in the Underworld'' and ''Happy Hampstead'' by Carte (under the pseudonym Mark Lynne) and his secretary, [[Frank Desprez]].
In 1877, Santley became the manager of the Royalty Theatre, an association lasting some thirty years.  She later seems to have acquired the head lease.&lt;ref name=british-history&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41093 ''The Pitt Estate in Dean Street – The Royalty Theatre''] ''[[Survey of London]]: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho'' (1966), pp. 215–21 (British History Online), accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, the First Chief Officer of the [[London Fire Brigade]] strongly recommended to the Metropolitan Board of Works the immediate closure of the theatre.  Santley, however, had it reconstructed to designs of architect Thomas Verity, whose plans, providing improved means of egress, were approved in 1882.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

Many of the productions at the Royalty were opera-bouffes adapted from the French.  M. L. Mayer, formerly of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the [[Comédie-Française]] appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognised home of the Parisian drama.'  There was further reconstruction of the theatre in 1883, and Santley was praised for the theatre's renovations then and in the later 1905 renovation.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; The opening of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and of new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Apollo Theatre]], drew audiences away from the little Royalty theatre in Dean Street, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.  This led to her providing an occasional home for the [[Independent Theatre Society]], who produced plays on a subscription-only basis – hence evading the censorship of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The London première's of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (on 13 March 1891) and [[Émile Zola]]'s ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' (on 9 October 1891), led to a storm of protest, with some critics calling for the withdrawal of Santley's licence.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s first play, ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', premièred for the Society at the theatre on 9 December 1892.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; When the theatre finally had a great success, with [[Brandon Thomas]]'s play, ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'', its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

In 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was [[Arthur Bourchier]], and the theatre underwent another renovation.  He produced, among other plays, ''The Chili Widow'', an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights.  In 1899, the first production of the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] took place with the first performance of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''.  In 1900–01 [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre.  Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by [[W. B. Yeats]] and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of [[John Millington Synge|Synge]]'s first play, ''The Shadow of the Glen''.  In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

==Personal==
Santley married Lieutenant Colonel Lockhart Mure Hartley Kennedy in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl?start=1901&amp;end=1901&amp;sq=4&amp;eq=4&amp;type=Marriages&amp;vol=5c&amp;pgno=1115&amp;db=bmd_1460362145&amp;jsexec=1&amp;mono=0&amp;v=MTQ2MTE0NDk1MDo0NzI2NWU4ZTI4NTk3MDdmMDI5YjljYmEyY2EwYzUxMzcwNTNmYzNl&amp;searchdef=db%3Dbmd_1460362145%26given%3DLockhart%26type%3DMarriages%26surname%3DKennedy%26sq%3D1%26eq%3D4&amp;action=Find "Evangeline Estella G.

'''''Language, Truth, and Logic''''' is a 1936 work of [[philosophy]] by [[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Jules Ayer]]. It brought some of the ideas of the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical empiricists]] to the attention of the English-speaking world.

In the book, Ayer defines, explains, and argues for the [[verification principle]] of [[logical positivism]], sometimes referred to as the ''criterion of significance'' or ''criterion of meaning''. Ayer explains how the [[Verification principle|principle of verifiability]] may be applied to the problems of philosophy.

==Historical background==
According to Ayer's autobiographical book, ''Part of My Life'', it was work he started in the summer and autumn of 1933 that eventually led to ''Language, Truth and Logic'', specifically ''Demonstration of the Impossibility of Metaphysics''—later published in ''Mind'' under the editorship of [[G.E. Moore]]. The title of the book was taken ("To some extent plagiarized" according to Ayer) from [[Friedrich Waismann]]'s ''Logik, Sprache, Philosophie''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Part of my Life'', p. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criterion of meaning==

According to Ayer, analytic statements are tautologies. A tautology is a statement that is [[logical truth|necessarily true]], true by definition, and true under any conditions. A tautology is a repetition of the meaning of a statement, using different words or symbols. According to Ayer, the statements of logic and mathematics are tautologies. Tautologies are true by definition, and thus their validity does not depend on [[empirical]] testing.

Synthetic statements, or empirical propositions, assert or deny something about the real world. The validity of synthetic statements is not established merely by the definition of the words or symbols they contain. According to Ayer, if a statement expresses an empirical proposition, then the validity of the proposition is established by its empirical verifiability.

Propositions are statements that have conditions under which they can be verified. By the verification principle, meaningful statements have conditions under which their validity can be affirmed or denied.

Statements that are not meaningful cannot be expressed as propositions. Every verifiable proposition is meaningful, although it may be either true or false. Every proposition asserts or denies something, and thus is either true or false.

==Types of verification==

Ayer distinguishes between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ verification, noting that there is a limit to how conclusively a proposition can be verified. ‘Strong’ (fully conclusive) verification is not possible for any empirical proposition, because the validity of any proposition always depends upon further experience. ‘Weak’ (probable) verification, on the other hand, is possible for any empirical proposition.

Ayer also distinguishes between practical and theoretical verifiability. Propositions for which we do not have a practical means of verification may still be meaningful if we can verify them in principle.

Literal meaning must also be distinguished from factual meaning. Literal meaning is an attribute of statements that are either analytic or empirically verifiable. Factual meaning is an attribute of statements that are meaningful without being analytic. Thus, statements that have factual meaning say something about the real world.

Ayer agrees with Hume that there are two main classes of propositions: those that concern 'relations of ideas,' and those that concern 'matters of fact.' Propositions about 'relations of ideas' include the a priori propositions of logic and mathematics. Propositions about 'matters of fact,' on the other hand, make assertions about the empirical world.

Ayer argues that philosophic propositions are analytic, and that they are concerned with 'relations of ideas.' The task of philosophy is to clarify the logical relationships of empirical propositions. If the meaning of propositions is defined by verifiability, then philosophy cannot provide speculative truths about metaphysical statements that cannot be empirically verified.

==Metaphysics attacked==

Ayer rejects the metaphysical thesis that philosophy can give us knowledge of a [[transcendent reality]]. He dismisses metaphysical arguments, calling them nonsense, and saying that they cannot be empirically verified. He argues that metaphysical statements have no literal meaning, and that they cannot be subjected to criteria of truth or falsehood.

A significant consequence of abandoning metaphysics as a concern of philosophy is a rejection of the view that the function of philosophy is to propose basic principles of meaning and to construct a [[deductive system]] by offering the consequences of these principles of meaning as a complete picture of reality.  But this is, some may argue, what Ayer does, in presenting the principle of verifiability as a criterion of meaningfulness for any empirical proposition.

According to Ayer, no proposition concerning "matters of fact" can ever be shown to be necessarily true, because there is always a possibility that it may be refuted by further empirical testing. Logical certainty is possible only for analytic observations, which are tautologies, and not for empirical observations concerning "matters of fact."

Ayer explains that his radical empiricism is opposed to rationalism. Rationalism asserts that there are truths about the world that can be known by ''a priori'' reasoning, or independently of experience. According to the principle of verifiability, propositions about 'matters of fact' can be meaningful only if they are capable of being empirically verified.

Ayer agrees with, and elaborates on, Kant’s explanation of the distinction between [[analytic reasoning|analytic]] and [[synthetic reasoning|synthetic judgments]]. According to Ayer, a proposition is analytic if its validity depends only on the definitions of the symbols it contains. A proposition is synthetic if its validity is determined by the facts of experience.

Analytic observations give us new knowledge, because they reveal unsuspected implications of our statements and beliefs. But analytic observations do not give us new knowledge of matters of fact, because they only tell us what is already known.

==Truth as validation==

Ayer defines truth as the criterion by which empirical propositions are validated. To say that a proposition is true is simply to assert it, and to say that a proposition is false is simply to assert a contradictory proposition. Thus, truth and falsehood are simply signs of assertion or denial of empirically verifiable propositions.

In the same manner, assertions of value have meaning only insofar as they are verifiable. If an ethical or aesthetic judgment cannot be subjected to empirical testing, then it is meaningless. An empirical test may be practical or theoretical.

==Value judgments==
{{Main|Emotivism}}
For Ayer, ethical or aesthetic judgments are subjective rather than objective, and cannot be demonstrated to be true or false. Ethical or aesthetic judgments express feelings, not propositions, and have no objective validity. Value-judgments are not analytic, and are not verifiable as 'matters of fact.'

According to Ayer when we argue about whether a value-judgment is right or wrong, we are really arguing about the empirical facts on which a value-judgment is based, or about the logical interpretation of empirical facts. We cannot argue about something that cannot be expressed as a proposition. We can only argue about something that can be analytically or empirically verified.

For Ayer, metaphysical statements, such as statements about transcendent reality, have no objective validity, and therefore are meaningless. Examples of this lack of meaning include statements about the existence or nonexistence of God. According to Ayer, such statements can be neither proven nor disproven, and cannot be validated or invalidated by empirical testing.

==New take on philosophy==

Ayer’s logical empiricism makes an important contribution to philosophy in that it provides a method of putting an end to otherwise irresolvable philosophical disputes. In Ayer's logical empiricism, philosophy is no longer seen as a metaphysical concern, nor as an attempt to provide speculative truths about the nature of ultimate reality. Instead, philosophy is seen as an activity of defining and clarifying the logical relationships of empirical propositions. In considering how to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine,&lt;ref&gt;p140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer also anticipates the development in 1950 of the [[Turing test]] to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence (consciousness).

The principle of verifiability, however, may become a means to arbitrarily reject any abstract or transcendent concept, such as “truth,” “justice,” or "virtue." Such concepts are seen as having no literal meaning. Thus, Ayer’s viewpoint may become a radical scepticism. Ethics, [[aesthetics]], and religion are all viewed as meaningless, as having no literal meaning. Ethical concepts are seen merely as expressions of feeling. Ethical or aesthetic concepts are seen as having no factual content, and therefore cannot be accepted as valid or invalid.

Ayer is careful to explain that the verification principle is a definition of meaning, and that it is not an empirical proposition. He admits that there are other possible definitions of meaning.

The most frequently expressed reservation about the principle is whether it is itself verifiable; this was addressed in the fictional dialogue "Logical Positivism: a discussion".  Ayer believed that it could be derived analytically from usual definitions of words like "understanding".  He admitted that one could then ask for verification of that definition and then carry on into an infinite regress.  Ayer considered the latter option to be simply not worth consideration, although philosophers like [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Richard Rorty]] have since used it to undermine the concrete view of language found in works like ''Language, Truth and Logic''.

==Ayer's later rejection of logical positivism==

Logical positivism was the philosophical flavour of the day in the 1920s and 1930s, and it was indeed popularized by Ayer in his book ''Language, Truth and Logic''. However, Ayer himself later rejected much of his own work. Fifty years after he wrote his book, he said: 'Logical positivism died a long time ago. I don’t think much of ''Language, Truth and Logic'' is true ... it is full of mistakes.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Flew]] and Roy Varghese, ''There is a God'' (Harper One,
2007), pp. xiv; xviii - xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23086">In their career, the British rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] recorded many songs that consisted, in whole or part, of pre-existing songs, melodies, or lyrics. They sometimes credited those sources, sometimes not. The band has been sued a number of times over attribution, some cases having concluded with others being awarded writing credit for the song in question.

This is a partial list of songs that contributed to or inspired Led Zeppelin songs or covers. It includes non-controversial ones the band attributed to other writers from the outset.

&lt;!-- If you add a new song/row, be sure to increase the "rowspan" for its album to match. 
		So if it's a Led Zeppelin II song, find the row that says something like:

		and change rowspan='3' to rowpsan='4', because you just added the fourth song from that album

In the 1980s, Bredon was made aware of Led Zeppelin's version of the song, and since 1990 the Led Zeppelin version has been credited to Anne Bredon/Jimmy Page &amp; Robert Plant.

 | colspan=6 | This song was correctly credited to Willie Dixon, but a similar controversy exists over whether Page got the idea from friend and former bandmate [[Jeff Beck]]:

{{quote|[Beck] had the same sort of taste in music as I did. That's why you'll find on the early LPs we both did a song like "You Shook Me." It was the type of thing we'd both played in bands. Someone told me he'd already recorded it after we'd already put it down on the first Zeppelin album. I thought, "Oh dear, it's going to be identical", but it was nothing like it, fortunately. I just had no idea he'd done it. It was on ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' but I first heard it when I was in Miami after we'd recorded our version. It's a classic example of coming from the same area musically, of having a similar taste.&lt;ref name=Schulps&gt;Dave Schulps, [http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp Interview with Jimmy Page], ''[[Trouser Press]]'', October 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Major differences between both versions include the prominence afforded [[Nicky Hopkins]] keyboard playing in the [[Mickie Most]] mix, and that Rod Stewart sings only two verses in the Jeff Beck recording.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Akkerman, (2014) "You Shook Me", ''Experiencing Led Zeppelin: A Listener's Companion'', p.7, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-8915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | colspan=6 | [[Al Stewart]] learned Jansch's version of the traditional song "Black Waterside." However, he mistook Jansch's '[[Drop-D tuning|drop-D]]' tuning for [[DADGAD]].  At the time, Stewart was recording his own debut record and had engaged [[Jimmy Page]] as a session musician.  According to Stewart's account, it was he (Stewart) who taught Page 'Blackwaterside' (the DADGAD version) during a tea-break.&lt;ref name="Harper p. 200"&gt;Harper p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this difference, Jansch's record company sought legal advice following the release of ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]''.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;[[Mick Wall]] (2008), ''When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography Of Led Zeppelin'',' London: Orion, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1965, [[Anne Briggs]] and Jansch were performing regularly together in folk clubs&lt;ref name="Harper p. 162"&gt;Harper p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; and spent most of the daytime at a friend's flat, collaborating on new songs and the development of complex guitar accompaniments for traditional songs.&lt;ref name="Harper p.161"&gt;Harper p.161&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, no legal action was ever taken against Led Zeppelin, because it could not be proven that the recording in itself constituted Jansch's own copyright, as the basic melody was traditional.  Nevertheless, Jansch said that Page "ripped me off, didn't he?  Or let's just say he ''learned'' from me."&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;

 | colspan="5" | Jimmy Page repeatedly mentioned Bert Jansch as an influence in interviews. Jansch's album [[Jack Orion]] contained two tracks whose components later appeared in Page songs without writing credit. Jansch bandmate [[Jacqui McShee]] later said:

{{quote|Actually, I think it's a very rude thing to do. Pinch somebody else's thing and credit it to yourself. It annoys me. ... In all the English papers at home he's always talking about Bert.

In a May 1970 interview with that group conducted by Lemon Squeezings friend Rick McGrath for Vancouver's underground newspaper Georgia Strait, Jansch and McShee expressed their frustration with Page's sole writing credit on the song.

 |- style="background-color:#ddd;" | 
 | colspan="5" | The song is a medley of fragments of blues songs and lyrics, including "[[Shake 'Em On Down]]" by [[Bukka White]].&lt;ref name="DL" /&gt; Therefore, the song is both a tribute to contemporary folk singer [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] and the influential American blues singer who recorded from the 1930s to the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9530">[[Nuclear pulse propulsion]] is a common feature of [[hard science fiction]] stories, as the idea offers high thrust and/or high [[specific impulse]] [[spacecraft propulsion|drives]] without requiring new physics.

==Books==
* The 1951 novel ''[[Wine of the Dreamers]]'', by [[John D. MacDonald]], involves the development of a hybrid interstellar ship. Its spacetime-warp drive cannot be used near planets, so the ship would leave Earth by feeding pellets into a "critical mass chamber" of 20 Mohs hardness.
* An early appearance of an Orion-style nuclear pulse propelled rocket in science fiction was in the science fiction novel ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' written by [[A. E. van Vogt]] in 1956. In this novel there is a post-atomic-war interplanetary empire called the Empire of Lynn that uses Orion-type nuclear rockets for interplanetary spaceflight. In the story the past atomic war was an interstellar war fought between humans and hostile aliens from another star somewhere between 800 and 8000 years before.
* A manned mission to [[Venus]] on a ship using Orion-like [[Earth (Noon Universe)#Interstellar Transport|photon engine]] is a core of 1960 science fiction novel ''[[The Land of Crimson Clouds]]'', written by the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky|Strugatsky brothers]].
* Early versions of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' featured a version of the spaceeship ''[[Discovery One]]'' using this drive. The final vehicle did not use this idea since [[Stanley Kubrick]] decided that showing the ship accelerate by a 'put-put' method might be "too comic" for film, as well as the fact that it might be seen as him having embraced nuclear weapons after his prior film, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke]], ''[[The Lost Worlds of 2001]]'', pp. 124-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] has references to the Orion drive.
* An Orion spaceship features prominently in the [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Footfall]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]. In the face of an alien siege/invasion of Earth, the humans must resort to drastic measures to get a fighting ship into orbit to face the alien fleet.
* In the novel ''[[King David's Spaceship]]'' by [[Jerry Pournelle]] inhabitants of a planet that is to be re-admitted to the [[CoDominium|Empire]] plot to build the spaceship based on an Orion project concept in order to qualify their planet as a higher-developed, Class One Imperial world. However, this craft uses non-nuclear explosives.
* [[Poul Anderson]]'s novel ''[[Orion Shall Rise]]'' features a post-collapse confederation gathering forbidden nuclear materials for some unknown end—although the title gives away the true nature of their mysterious project.
* In ''[[The Stone Dogs]]'' by [[S. M. Stirling]], Orion spacecraft are created during an arms race between the Domination of the [[The Domination|Draka]] and the Alliance for Democracy, and used by both sides in their explorations of the solar system and as warships. The drive itself features as an improvised weapon in the book, being used to keep other ships at a distance.
* In the book ''[[The Shiva Option]]'' by [[David Weber]] and [[Steve White (science fiction)|Steve White]], an arachnid homeworld is destroyed by converting several asteroids into Orion-drive starships and launching them at it.
*Orion was used by [[Michael P. Kube-McDowell]] in ''[[Emprise]]'', the first book of the [[Trigon Disunity]] series.
*The speculative fiction novel ''[[Anathem]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a spacecraft that travels between different dimensions and uses an Orion-style propulsion system. This ship, the [[Daban Urnud]], is discovered by observing the nuclear explosions used to modify its orbit.
*[[Dan Simmons]]' novel ''Olympos'' describes an Orion-style spaceship, designed by the Moravec machine race to emulate 21st century human technology.
*The 1977 short story and [[Hugo Award|Hugo-award]] winner 'Tricentennial' by [[Joe Haldeman]] featured the Daedelus (or [[John F. Kennedy]], or [[Leonid Brezhnev]] - apparently spaceships are also prone to renaming), which was powered by nuclear bombs.
*In [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'', bobble technology makes this method of travel safe.
*In his 1981 anthology ''Cepheïde'', Dutch SF/Fantasy author [[Tais Teng]] describes a ship with Orion propulsion as one of the most primitive and wasteful methods of interstellar flight, still only achieved by a tiny minority of all intelligent races in the universe. The ship is said to be the last relic of an unknown race exterminated by the dominant YiYiki (descendants of the [[humpback whales]]).
*In the [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]] novel ''The Golden Globe'', the wreck of an Orion spaceship is converted to an interstellar starship.
*John Varley's ''[[Steel Beach]]'' sets several scenes near or within the bulk of the "Robert A. Heinlein," an Orion-style ship which was built and then abandoned when humanity lapsed into apathy for stellar exploration.
*[[Chris Berman]]'s novel, ''The Hive'', involves the use of a ground-launched Orion spacecraft by the People's Republic of China in a gamble to reach an alien artifact in orbit between Jupiter and Saturn before the crew of a spacecraft built by the United States and Russia can reach it first. The novel has been banned in China until "these references are removed" which shows how sensitive the whole subject of nuclear bomb propulsion still is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200902/1235368674.html |title=China Bars Sales of Chris Berman's Novel, The Hive - Breaking news in actress sharon,berman,China, The Hive |publisher=Free-press-release.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel ''[[Ark (Baxter novel)|Ark]]'' a starship Ark One is built to save a small group of people as Earth drowns under a global flood. It launches and performs the first phase of its mission using a version of Orion. This version is ground-launched though owing to the situation (the entire planet is about to drown anyway) environmental concerns are set aside.
*In the books ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]'' and ''[[Olympos (novel)|Olympos]]'' by [[Dan Simmons]] a space ship with Orion thrust is used to travel through the Solar System over the course of a week.
*In the book ''Citadel'' by [[John Ringo]], an Orion Drive is used to upgrade the 9&amp;nbsp;km diameter Battlestation Troy into a mobile spaceship.

==Other media==

* The ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky]]" features a [[generation ship]], constructed out of a hollowed-out iron asteroid, propelled using "Orion class nuclear pulse engines" in which fission bombs were detonated in shafts.  It appeared to have been traveling for about 10,000 years, and had travelled about 30 [[light years]] on its own power.
* The ''[[Space: 1999]]'' episode "[[Voyager's Return]]" featured a fictional nuclear drive probe called "''[[List of Space: 1999 vehicles#Voyager One/Voyager Two|Voyager One]]''", powered by the life-destroying "Queller Drive", which killed all the life forms on two of the Federated Worlds of Sidon. The episode centers on the Sidons's seek for revenge against Earth.
* In the FOX television series ''[[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]'', ''Phaeton'' (Earth's first starship) is propelled by an Orion drive.
* In the backstory for the video game ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'', the [[sleeper ship]] is propelled by an Orion-type drive, the shield of which fails (almost certainly due to [[sabotage]]) when the ship is almost at its destination, causing the passengers on the colony ship to splinter into factions.
* The 1998 film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' featured a spacecraft named ''Messiah'', which utilized the "Orion drive" and appears to be a variant of nuclear detonation propulsion. In the film, the drive is credited to the Russians.
*The 2006 movie ''Earthstorm'' with [[Steven Baldwin]] and [[Dirk Benedict]]. The crew sent to the moon used nuclear pulse to get to there faster than conventional means.
* The ''Orion'' concept is used in the series premiere of ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]'' for Earth's first interstellar spaceship.
* In ''[[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam]]'', the GRYPS-2 laser cannon and the asteroid base Axis use Orion-type drives.
* While it never comes up in the actual show, in the DVD extras for ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Joss Whedon]] mentions that his idea for the "full burn" propulsion in the title spacecraft class was a directed nuclear detonation.
* The 2011 movie ''Attack of the Moon Zombies'' features an "Orion Atomic Pulse Rocket" that transports people and supplies to a lunar base.  The model was based on the lunar ferry design described in a Project Orion report.
*The 2014 Syfy Channel miniseries ''[[Ascension (TV series)|Ascension]]'' is based on a Project Orion generation ship being built in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Deadline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/jason-blum-ascension-syfy-not-low-budget-tv-series/|title=TCA: Syfy's 'Ascension' Departs From Jason Blum's Microbudget Film Formula|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lola Griffin''' is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama ''[[Holby City]]'', played by actress [[Sharon D. Clarke]]. She first appeared in the [[Holby City (series 7)|series seven]] episode "Patience", broadcast on 7 June 2005. Lola is characterised as a "tough" female and "wisecracking earth mother". She was introduced into the series as the ex-wife of established character [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]). D. Clarke has praised the character's inclusion because she is a black woman with power, which she believed was a diverse and positive depiction. When the actress left the show in 2008, writers produced a standalone episode built around her exit. When Lola learns she is being made redundant, she takes a job at another hospital. Lola last appeared in the episode titled "[[Holby City (series 10)#ep53|Mad World]]", which was broadcast on 14 October 2008.

===Characterisation===
{{cquote|Lola's warm but tough, friendly but judgmental, a sensual yet wisecracking earth mother and one of the guys. Lola doesn’t mince her words, she wouldn’t know how. Underneath the Mother Hen exterior is a complicated mixture of steely resolve and massive soft-heartedness.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - Holby City - Characters|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/characters/profiles/index.shtml?content/_lola/page1|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=7 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218083547/http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/holbycity/characters/profiles/index.shtml?content/_lola/page1|archivedate=18 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;|4=An excerpt from Lola's profile on the official ''Holby City'' website.}}

Lola arrives at Holby City hospital to take the role of a new consultant. She is the ex-wife of established character [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]). [[BBC Online]] describes the pair as having "banter and competitiveness" formed from "years of familiarity and former intimacy".&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; They added "get on the wrong side of her and you'll know about it." She is also characterised as a "feisty" woman who is "controlling yet compassionate".&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - Holby City - Characters - Lola Griffin|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/drama/holbycity/characters-cast/characters/lolagriffin.shtml|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=7 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503183735/http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/drama/holbycity/characters-cast/characters/lolagriffin.shtml|archivedate=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As ''Holby City'' is a medical show, the actress had to learn much of the terminology spoken in the profession. D. Clarke wanted to understand most of it to make Lola appear authentic. She told a reporter from ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' that "if i'm saying quickly, in passing, I’ll just learn it phonetically, parrot fashion, and try to make it trip off the tongue like I’ve always said it."&lt;ref name=medicalpro/&gt; She also learned how to correctly perform a [[tension pneumothorax]] to aid her performance.&lt;ref name=medicalpro&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharon: It's bound to sink in|url=http://metro.co.uk/2007/04/23/sharon-its-bound-to-sink-in-310516/|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she first arrives at the hospital Ric is annoyed at the prospect of working with her. He becomes stressed and decides to leave to work in [[Ghana]]. Quarshie told Graham Kibble-White from the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' that his "larger-than-life ex-wife Lola has just rolled up in Holby and I think her appearance is the last straw for him, so he decides to take a job in Ghana."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kibble-White|first1=Graham|title=Doc's Holiday|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133758505.html|website=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]] via [[Highbeam Research]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=3 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lola becomes involved in various storylines with Ric's family. When Ric's daughter [[Jess Griffin]] ([[Verona Joseph]]) objects to his engagement to [[Thandie Abebe-Griffin]] ([[Ginny Holder]]), she tries to involve Lola in the feud. This leads to Lola and Ric clashing, with him warning her to stay out of his personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the pressure getting too much for Lola?|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/events/is-the-pressure-getting-too-much-for-lola/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc. UK]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument takes its toll on Lola and when she discusses hospital business with [[Lord Byrne]] ([[Ronald Pickup]]) she clutches her chest and collapses from a major heart attack. Her fellow colleagues then battle to save her life.&lt;ref name=insidesoap&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lola's last stand?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=21-27 April 2007|issue=16|pages=33|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another main story for Lola begins when a patient dies and Lola believes her baby daughter Leanne needs caring for. Lola incorrectly believes her father Steve Spence (Karl Haynes) is a drug addict. She takes Leanne home with her which gets her into trouble with Ric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paterson|first1=Peter|title=Drama Is the Last Casualty; Holby City (BBC1)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-149270407.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]] via [[Highbeam Research]])|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=9 August 2006}}{{subscriptionrequired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lola develops a bond with Leanne and she over invests in her care.

They hear Leanne crying and decide to break into the property where they find Steve unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fulton|first1=Rick|title=Drama: Holby; BBC1, Dec 24.(Features)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155191780.html|website=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]] via [[Highbeam Research]])|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=30 November 2006}}{{subscriptionrequired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve dies and Lola is offered care of Leanne. She decides she cannot look after a child full time and have a career and lets Leanne go.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Very Thought of You|episodelink=Holby City (series 9)|series=Holby City|serieslink=Holby City|credits=Robert Del Maestro (director), Matthew Evans (writer) |network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=28 December 2006|seriesno=11|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer's later began a rivalry between Lola and [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] [[Linden Cullen]] ([[Duncan Pow]]).&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt; Linden arrives to reshape the hospital's [[Acute Assessment Unit]] ward, which Lola had been running temporarily. A ''[[Daily Express]]'' writer observed that the pair end up "in a battle for supremacy" with nursing consultant [[Mark Williams (Holby City)|Mark Williams]] ([[Robert Powell]]) caught in the middle of their feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital drama: Holby City|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/34653/HOSPITAL-DRAMA-Holby-City|website=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Lola and registrar [[Joseph Byrne (Holby City)|Joseph Byrne]] ([[Luke Roberts (actor)|Luke Roberts]]) appear in the show's spin-off series [[HolbyBlue]], they appear as witnesses after a patient is stabbed and [[Jac Naylor]] ([[Rosie Marcel]]) is arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Jane|title=We love telly: We love Doctors - Holby Blue BBC1, 8pm.(Features)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-176890977.html|website=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]] via [[Highbeam Research]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=20 March 2008}}{{subscriptionrequired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke announced her departure during a live television interview on 22 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Paul O'Grady Show |episodelink= |series=The Paul O'Grady Show |serieslink=The Paul O'Grady Show |network=[[Channel 4]] | season       =  | number       = 499 |airdate= 22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lola was not written out of the series later that year, departing in the episode titled "[[Holby City (series 10)#ep53|Mad World]]", which was broadcast on 14 October 2008.&lt;ref name=exitint/&gt; The show devised it as an entire standalone episode around the character's exit. Lola learns that she is going to be made redundant and takes a job at a private psychiatric hospital. D. Clarke told a reporter from the ''[[Birmingham Mail]]'' that her character would not leave "without getting her due". She receives a large payout and reveals she has secretly applied for another job with more power. She added "there's a company car, she's got her own office and there are massive grounds."&lt;ref name=exitint/&gt; In the episode Lola discovers her former colleague [[Abra Durant]] ([[Ade Edmondson]]) is a patient at the hospital. She investigates his case and convinces him to leave and regain control of his life. The job soon proves to be not what Lola had expected. She makes a decision to leave the area for good. D. Clarke concluded that "she's already been told she's there to dish out pills and not get involved. Lola's always been hands-on and, after an incident, she's reminded of what she loves."&lt;ref name=exitint&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprise on the wards for Lola; TV Choice Holby City (BBC1, 8pm).(Features)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-186905832.html|website=[[Birmingham Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]] via [[Highbeam Research]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=14 October 2008}}{{subscriptionrequired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. Clarke was happy with her achievements on ''Holby City'' and being part of a diverse cast. She was particularly content with her character holding such power. She told Roz Laws (''Birmingham Mail'') that "When I started out in my acting career, I found I was always cast as a nurse. I was finally able to break out of that in Holby City, when I played Dr Lola Griffin and finally had some power. It was boundary-breaking, not casting black actors to push up quotas or push trolleys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laws|first1=Roz|title=Holby City star back in Birmingham for Once On This Island|url=https://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/holby-city-star-back-birmingham-3943863|website=[[Birmingham Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later reflected "I'm very proud to have had people come up to me and say that their daughter became a doctor because of Holby. I remember being on set one day and looking around and seeing six black women in the scene. Where else on screen was that going to happen?"&lt;ref name=lawson/&gt; She later described playing the character as one of her career highlights. The actress stated that she got a "positive reaction" from viewers and added that Lola was special because of "her strength as a black woman with authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.

==Reception==
For her portrayal of Lola, D.

She looked more like she had indigestion from eating too many pies than cardiac problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wise|first1=Jon|title=Over at Holby City; the wise man of tv.(Features)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-162771720.html|website=[[The People]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]] via [[Highbeam Research]])|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=29 April 2007}}{{subscriptionrequired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mask and Wig Club''', a [[gentlemen's club|private club]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], founded in 1889, is the oldest all-male collegiate musical comedy troupe in the [[United States]]. Created as an alternative to the existing theatrical and dramatic outlets at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Mask and Wig has presented comedy, music, and dancing to the University of Pennsylvania, [[Philadelphia]], and audiences across the country. Its credo is "Justice to the stage; credit to the University."&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

The club's performers, or "The Cast," put on two all-original shows each year in collaboration with the Club's own Stage Crew, Band, and Business Staff. Many Mask and Wig originals were made famous on the radio by mid 20th century luminaries. The well-known "Route 66" was composed by club member [[Bobby Troup]]&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/1994/02/24/Resources/Still.Laughing-2180040.shtml{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},&lt;/ref&gt; and launched to the height of popularity by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Troup's song "Daddy" was written for a Mask and Wig show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondhandsongs.com/work/60718|title=Original versions of Daddy written by Bobby Troup -  SecondHandSongs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mask and Wig songs, such as "[[The Gypsy in My Soul]]," written by [[Clay Boland]] and [[Moe Jaffe]], have been performed by the likes of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].  The first electrically recorded album ever released was Mask and Wig's "Joan of Arkansas," in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/recording-industry/|title=Recording Industry - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mask and Wig Club of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] was first conceived of in 1888 by a small group of undergraduates, led by Clayton Fotterall McMichael, who were interested in the stage and desired something the University did not offer: a troupe that would produce original humorous theatrical pieces.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; In 1889, therefore, McMichael and the other original founders sent out a call for undergraduate men to audition for the group and participate in the creation and production of its first performance.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2908635/Some-Fifty-Odd-Years-of-The-Mask-and-Wig-Club-1889-1941|title=Some Fifty Odd Years of The Mask and Wig Club (1889-1941)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMichael and his peers envisioned a group that involved dressing up in frocks and performing spoofs and parodies.  Because colleges at the time were open only to young gentlemen, any production was limited to an all–male cast. These organizations naturally saw burlesque, which was quite popular in that era, as the perfect genre. The overblown characterizations, loose plotting, musical interludes, and parody of high art made the style perfect for a group of young, well-educated, amateur men, especially since the drag tradition came "built-in".&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

Founder McMichael combed the local bookstores for a story to produce and found it in Henry Byron's The Nymphs of the Lurleyburg. A substantially altered version, "Lurline", the Club's first production, hit the boards at the Chestnut Street Opera House on June 4, 1889, for one night only. Backed financially by the ladies of Philadelphia high society, the Club enjoyed great success in its early years. With increasingly reliable audience turnout and revenue from ticket sales, the runs were extended and the Club established a fine tradition among Philadelphia's theater–going society.  Moreover, the club made a very strong impression on campus and it achieved great notoriety within its first year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upm/upm7100/1890record.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mask and Wig rehearsal (1930).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Company members rehearsing at the clubhouse in 1930.]]
In 1894 the Club purchased a property at 310 South Quince Street to serve as a gathering place and rehearsal hall, [[the Mask and Wig Clubhouse]].  The building had been erected by the first African-American Lutheran congregation in America as St. Paul's Lutheran Church in 1834, but had been sold in 1839&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-02-22/news/25754844_1_storefront-church-evangelical-lutheran-church-pastor-jones|title=Archives - Philly.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into a coachhouse and stable, and later into a dissecting room for medical students. Prominent Philadelphia architect [[Wilson Eyre]] was commissioned to remodel the building, and hired the young [[Maxfield Parrish]], who would later become one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century, to decorate the interior. The Grille Room was decorated with caricatures of members, a tradition that continues today, with the second century of members' caricatures continued upstairs at the entrance to the auditorium. Eyre expanded the clubhouse to its present size, 1901-1903.

The Club prospered throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The middle of this century was a heady time for the Club.  Mask and Wig songs were the rage of the big band orchestras, radio shows, and solo acts of the day. The likes of [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Count Basie]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]] all covered Mask and Wig tunes. Between 1952 and 1958, the club appeared four times on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040053/fullcredits#cast|title=The Ed Sullivan Show|date=20 June 1948|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1961 production, ''Wry on the Rocks'', introduced a satirical revue format in a cabaret atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.maskandwig.com/Annual%20Productions/1961%20Wry%20on%20the%20Rocks/Wry%20on%20the%20Rocks%20-%20Program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, with ''Myth America'', Mask and Wig returned the student–written book musical to its stage, a practice which continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.maskandwig.com/Annual%20Productions/1992%20Myth%20America/Myth%20America%20-%20Progam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Important in the show's success are the traditional high standards in the caliber of performers and excellence of the material performed. The Club's primary purpose has always been and continues to be, "Justice to the stage; credit to the University."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maskandwig.com/about/|title=About - The Mask and Wig Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the end of World War II the Mask and Wig dormitory on the residence quadrangle was used to house a U.S. Army unit assigned to quickly learn the Japanese language.  Upon the completion of the study the soldiers were to be commissioned in the U.S. Army and serve in the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) of the Army in Japan.  This army unit had classes in the University in the Egyptian Antiquities room while being scrutinized by several mummies.  Classes were also held in the Wharton School of Business.  Jerry Epple, a member of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], says he remembers to this day the stone carving of a mask and wig near the dormitory entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astpww2.org/main/memoirs_2.htm|title=生理前のオリモノが白いのは異常ですか？意外と知らないオリモノについて|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040708/http://www.astpww2.org/main/memoirs_2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Mask and Wig maintains its position as one of the premier extracurricular activities on the Penn campus. Its yearly tour over spring break brings the show to alumni clubs across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maskandwig.com/about/tour/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===Club organization===
The Mask and Wig Club has two components: the Undergraduate Company and the Graduate Club.  The Undergraduate Company is composed of current undergrads at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who are the performers in and creators of each year's productions.  They are the public face of the organization.

The Graduate Club is composed of Mask and Wig Alumni. The Graduate Club is responsible for many of the decisions that guide the Undergraduate Club, including overseeing many aspects of the production of the Spring Show, and the maintenance of the Clubhouse. They provide much of the funding for the maintenance of the Clubhouse and were responsible for raising the funds for its renovation. The Graduate Club and the Undergraduate Club interface through regular Board of Governors meetings, which feature both Undergraduate and Graduate club members.

===Undergraduate sections===
The Mask and Wig Club is made up of four distinct sections: the cast, the band, the crew, and the business staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perücke – so alt wie die Zivilisation|url=http://www.perücke.biz/peruecke-so-alt-wie-die-zivilisation/|website=Perücke.biz|language=de-DE}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast writes and performs all of its own material during the Fall and Spring Shows.  The band often functions as a pit orchestra, playing original, self-arranged pieces for the Fall show, and professionally arranged pieces for the Spring production.  The band also holds the headliner spot at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s annual Spring Fling festival in the Quad. The crew builds elaborate, ornate, and completely original sets for both the Fall and Spring Shows.  The business staff is responsible for advertising and selling tickets for the club's shows.

==Performances==

===Free Show===
Free Show is the first Mask and Wig show of the academic year.  The show is held during the first week of the academic year and is free of charge to all new freshmen. The cast performs classic bits that are tried and true. Free Show serves a few purposes: it introduces the new freshmen of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to one of Penn's oldest institutions, and hopes to recruit new members by displaying what membership in the group entails. In 2018, for the first time the Free Show was performed in collaboration with Penn's all-female musical sketch comedy troupe, Bloomers.

===Fall Show===
Each fall, the undergraduates produce their own sketch comedy show that runs for one week in a theater on Penn's campus.  The upperclassmen handle all aspects of production from acting direction to choreography to musical production.  A notable highlight of the show is the Second Act Opener, which consists of a medley of songs from a famous musician or group, but with parodied lyrics that often follow a Penn-centered plot. Past parodied musicians include [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Billy Joel]], [[The Beatles]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Disney]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

===ComFest===
In 1999, Mask and Wig established an annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival to showcase the talent of the nation's best collegiate sketch comedy troupes. The mission of the festival is not just to put on a hilarious show that cultivates new talent, but also to honor and showcase a well-known comedian. Each host does a stand-up routine for the audience and participates in sketches with Mask and Wig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maskandwig.org/comfest/history.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past college sketch troupes include:
*[[Princeton Triangle Club]]
*University of Maryland Sketchup
*Yale Fifth Humour
*Boston College Hello Shovelhead
*Cornell University Humor Us! Sketch Comedy

Past guest hosts include:
*2000 [[Paul Provenza]]
*2001 [[Ana Gasteyer]]

*2009 [[Judah Friedlander]]
*2010 [[Tom Green]]
*2011 [[Aasif Mandvi]]
*2012 [[Greg Proops]]
*2014 [[Tommy Pope]]

===Spring Show===
The Spring Show, historically known as the Annual Production, is the theatrical centerpiece of Mask and Wig.  Performed at [[The Mask and Wig Clubhouse]], the production is an original show that runs from late January to early April.  While the format of the Spring Show has evolved over the years, the show currently runs as a full "book" musical comedy, complete with singing and tap dancing.

Unlike the Fall Show, the Annual Production is professionally composed, directed, and choreographed by some of the best talents in the industry.  The script, however, is written by the Club's cast.

===Tour===
During spring break the troupe takes their show around the country as they road trip across the United States, usually performing in areas with a high Penn alumni concentration.  The trip usually includes about four to six stops.  In recent years the tour has taken Wig to cities like London, [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Chicago]], and [[Toronto]].

The tour is yet another one of the group's many traditions.  In Mask and Wig's heyday, the group had its own train car that it would use to do a similar tour around the nation.

===Spring Fling===
The Mask and Wig Band traditionally headlines the last day of Spring Fling performances, which was historically a Saturday, at the stage in the Lower Quad. In 2018 the festival was moved to [[Penn Park]] along with the Mask and Wig performance.  They generally perform an hour-long set of covers of popular music.  Members of the cast generally sing for the band, along with female vocalists from other Penn performing arts groups.  The other members of the company join the band on stage for the duration of the performance, and the show concludes with the singing of the Mask and Wig hallmark musical number, Tradition, by the senior members of the company.

==The Clubhouse==
===Clubhouse art===
Working in his studio just a few blocks away at Thirteenth and Walnut Streets, [[Maxfield Parrish]] received one of his first commissions in 1894 from Mask and Wig.  This first job came as he was finishing his studies at the [[Pennsylvania Academy]]; it was for decoration of the stage [[proscenium]] and ticket window, illustration of a number of caricatures on the wall of the Grille Room, and most notably the [[Old King Cole]] mural.  This was the start of his professional career; shortly after seeing the mural, the editor of “Harper's” Magazine invited Parrish to do some of their covers for which he became famous.  He would continue working for the Club to finish a total of 35 caricatures and illustrate the earliest program covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1077023|title=Christies - Page Not Found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Eyre was older and more established than Parrish when he began working on the Clubhouse, and was good friends with Parrish's father, [[Stephen Parrish|Stephen]].  Eyre was the architect in charge of renovating the Club's new home and transforming it from a stable into a “[[Bavaria]]n” themed Clubhouse.  His first remodel in 1894 transformed the space from the stable by adding an entry hall with stairs, designing and decorating the Grille Room, and turning the second floor into a theater.  Eyre designed most of the furniture in the Grille Room; three of the original tables still exist and will be returned to the Clubhouse upon its reopening.  Eyre also oversaw the second major change.  The building was enlarged in 1903 by adding 10 feet to the front creating the façade that still exists there today.  Eyre's original drawing of the front design, created in 1902, is shown to the right.  Eyre's design has endured for over a century with few changes aside from the ongoing addition of paneling for caricatures in the Grille Room and Theater.  Though Eyre's career included several projects like the Clubhouse, he is best known for his design of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]’s Museum.

===Clubhouse renovations===
Immediately following the close of the 2007 Spring show, the clubhouse began to undergo an extensive renovation.  In addition to bringing the building up to modern code, the club also installed an elevator and central air conditioning unit.  The construction, originally projected to be complete in time for a normal Spring show run, experienced a number of delays and setbacks.  On the morning of March 15, 2008, a fire broke out in the attic of the clubhouse, setting back the completion date indefinitely.  While nothing of historical significance was critically damaged, the 2008 Spring show, "West Wing Story", could not go on in the club's signature theater.

Luckily, the club had a contingency plan in case of such an emergency, and was able to put on their show.  "West Wing Story" played for two weekends in April, 2008 at the Prince Music Theater in downtown Philadelphia, marking the first annual production to be performed at a venue other than the clubhouse since 1960.  The generosity of Mask and Wig's Graduate Club made it financially possible to perform in a professional theater.  With renovations still behind schedule in 2009, the annual production "Oh, the Humanities!" was also performed at the Prince Music Theater for three weekends, selling a record number of tickets due to the large theater capacity.

The clubhouse renovation was completed in the fall of 2009, allowing the club to once again return to its own stage for the 2010 Annual Production, "A Cheshire Catastrophe".

{{Views}}

In [[technical drawing]] and [[computer graphics]], a '''multiview projection''' is a technique of illustration by which a standardized series of [[orthographic projection|orthographic]] [[two-dimensional]] pictures is constructed to represent the form of a [[three-dimensional]] object. Up to six pictures of an object are produced (called ''primary views''), with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: ''first-angle'' or ''third-angle'' projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being ''projected'' onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, ''usually'' three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as ''front view'', ''top view'' and ''end view''. Other names for these views include ''plan'', ''elevation'' and ''section''.

The terms ''orthographic projection'' and ''orthogonal projection'' are sometimes reserved specifically for multiviews. However, ''orthographic'' and ''orthogonal'' more correctly refer to the [[right angle]] formed between the projection rays and the [[projection plane]], versus the angle formed between the ''subject of the drawing'' and the projection plane. Thus, orthographic projections include ''[[axonometric projection|axonometric]]'' or ''auxiliary views'' in addition to multiviews.

==Overview==
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]], including ''elevation'' and ''plan'' views]]
To render each such picture, a ''[[Line (geometry)#Ray|ray]] of sight'' (also called a ''projection line'', ''projection ray'' or ''line of sight'') towards the object is chosen, which determines on the object various points of interest (for instance, the points that are visible when looking at the object along the ray of sight); those points of interest are mapped by an [[orthographic projection]] to points on some [[Plane (geometry)|geometric plane]] (called a ''[[projection plane]]'' or ''[[image plane]]'') that is perpendicular to the ray of sight, thereby creating a 2D representation of the 3D object.

Customarily, two rays of sight are chosen for each of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|three axes]] of the object's coordinate system; that is, parallel to each axis, the object may be viewed in one of 2 opposite directions, making for a total of 6 orthographic projections (or "views") of the object:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Ingrid Carlbom, Joseph Paciorek |title=Planar Geometric Projections and Viewing Transformations |journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=465–502 |year=1978 |doi=10.1145/356744.356750}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Along the ''x''-axis: The ''left'' and ''right'' views, which are known as ''elevations'' (because they often show the features along the "vertical" length of an object such as a building).
* Along the ''y''-axis: The ''top'' and ''bottom'' views, which are known as ''plans'' (because they often show the features within a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross&amp;nbsp;section]] of the object, such as a floor in a building).
* Along the ''z''-axis: The ''front'' and ''back'' views, which are also known as ''elevations'', following the same reasoning.

These six planes of projection intersect each other, forming a box around the object, the most uniform construction of which is a cube; traditionally, these six views are presented together by first projecting the 3D object onto the 2D faces of a cube, and then "unfolding" the faces of the cube such that all of them are contained within the same plane (namely, the plane of the medium on which all of the images will be presented together, such as a piece of paper, or a computer monitor, etc.). However, even if the faces of the box are unfolded in one standardized way, there is ambiguity as to which projection is being displayed by a particular face; the cube has two faces that are perpendicular to a ray of sight, and the points of interest may be projected onto either one of them, a choice which has resulted in two predominant standards of projection:

# '''First-angle projection''': The points of interest are projected in the ''same'' direction as the ray of sight; the points are projected onto the plane that lies ''behind'' the object, as determined by the ray of sight; the plane of projection acts like the top of a table over which the points of interest are dropped into place.
# '''Third-angle projection''': The points of interest are projected in the ''opposite'' direction of the ray of sight; the points are projected onto the plane that lies ''in&amp;nbsp;front'' of the object, as determined by the ray of sight; the plane of projection acts like a glass table from under which the observer sees the points of interest after they have been dropped into place on the top of the table.

==Primary views==
Multiview projections show the ''primary views'' of an object, each viewed in a direction parallel to one of the main coordinate axes. These primary views are called ''plans'' and ''elevations''. Sometimes they are shown as if the object has been cut across or sectioned to expose the interior: these views are called ''sections''.

===Plan===
{{see also|Plan (drawing)|Floor plan}}
[[File:Millbank Prison Plan.jpg|thumb|right|A plan view of [[Millbank Prison]], 1828]]
A '''plan''' is a view of a 3-dimensional object seen from vertically above (or sometimes below). It may be drawn in the position of a horizontal plane passing through, above, or below the object. The outline of a shape in this view is sometimes called its ''planform'', for example with [[planform (aeronautics)|aircraft wings]].

The plan view from above a building is called its roof plan. A section seen in a horizontal plane through the walls and showing the floor beneath is called a ''floor plan''.

===Elevation===
[[File:Panthéon Soufflot - élevation principale.png|thumb|Principal façade of the [[Panthéon, Paris]], by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]].]]

An '''elevation''' is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a vertical plane beside an object. In other words, an elevation is a side-view as viewed from the front, back, left or right (and referred to as a ''front elevation'', ''[left/ right] side elevation'', and a ''rear elevation'').

An elevation is a common method of depicting the external configuration and detailing of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. Building façades are shown as elevations in [[architectural drawing]]s and [[technical drawing]]s.

Elevations are the most common orthographic projection for conveying the appearance of a building from the exterior. [[Perspective projection|Perspectives]] are also commonly used for this purpose. A building elevation is typically labeled in relation to the compass direction it faces; the direction from which a person views it. E.g. the North Elevation of a building is the side that most closely faces true north on the compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frank| last = Ching | author-link = Frank Ching | title = Architectural Graphics - Second Edition | place = New York | publisher = Van Norstrand Reinhold | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-442-21862-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interior elevations are used to show detailing such as [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] and trim configurations.

In the building industry elevations are a non-perspective view of the structure. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Drawing sets include front, rear and both side elevations. The elevations specify the composition of the different facades of the building, including ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches and other architectural details.

====Developed elevation====
A '''developed elevation''' is a variant of a regular elevation view in which several adjacent non-parallel sides may be shown together, as if they have been unfolded.  For example, the north and west views may be shown side-by-side, sharing an edge, even though this does not represent a proper orthographic projection.

===Section===
{{See also|Cross section (geometry)}}
A '''section''', or ''cross-section'', is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object.

A section is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions.  It is often used in [[technical drawing]] and is traditionally [[crosshatch]]ed. The style of crosshatching often indicates the type of material the section passes through.

With [[computed axial tomography]], computers construct cross-sections from [[x-ray]] data.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Auxiliary views==
An ''auxiliary view'' or ''pictorial'', is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six ''primary views''.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoline, Gary R. ''Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.).'' New York, NY. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These views are typically used when an object has a surface in an oblique plane. By projecting into a plane parallel with the oblique surface, the true size and shape of the surface is shown. Auxiliary views tend to make use of [[axonometric projection]].

===Quadrants in descriptive geometry===
[[File:Quadrants in descriptive geometry.png|thumb|200px|left|Gaspard Monge's four quadrants and two planes.]]
Modern orthographic projection is derived from [[Gaspard Monge]]'s [[descriptive geometry]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Monge defined a reference system of two viewing planes, horizontal ''H'' ("ground") and vertical ''V'' ("backdrop").  These two planes intersect to partition 3D space into 4 quadrants, which he labeled:
* ''I'': above ''H'', in front of ''V''
* ''II'': above ''H'', behind ''V''
* ''III'': below ''H'', behind ''V''
* ''IV'': below ''H'', in front of ''V''
These quadrant labels are the same as used in 2D planar geometry, as seen from infinitely far to the "left", taking ''H'' and ''V'' to be the ''X''-axis and ''Y''-axis, respectively.

The 3D object of interest is then placed into either quadrant ''I'' or ''III'' (equivalently, the position of the intersection line between the two planes is shifted), obtaining ''first''- and ''third-angle'' projections, respectively.  Quadrants ''II'' and ''IV'' are also mathematically valid, but their use would result in one view "true" and the other view "flipped" by 180° through its vertical centerline, which is too confusing for technical drawings. (In cases where such a view is useful, e.g. a ceiling viewed from above, a reflected view is used, which is a mirror image of the true orthographic view.)

Monge's original formulation uses two planes only, and obtains the top and front views only.  The addition of a third plane to show a [[Elevation (view)|side view]] (either left or right) is a modern extension.  The terminology of ''quadrant'' is a mild anachronism, as a modern orthographic projection with three views corresponds more precisely to an octant of 3D space.
'''

===First-angle projection===
In '''first-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant '''I''', i.e. it '''floats above and before''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''opaque''', and each view is '''pushed''' through the object onto the plane furthest from it.  (Mnemonic: an "actor on a stage".)  Extending to the 6-sided box, each view of the object is projected in the direction (sense) of sight of the object, onto the (opaque) interior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the opposite side of the box. A two-dimensional representation of the object is then created by "unfolding" the box, to view all of the '''interior''' walls. This produces two [[plan]]s and four [[elevation]]s. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the
object on top of an upside-down bowl. Sliding the object down the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''

===Third-angle projection===

[[File:Orthographic example.gif|thumb|An example of a multiview orthographic drawing from a US Patent (1913), showing two views of the same object. Third angle projection is used.]]
In '''third-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant III, i.e. it is positioned '''below and behind''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''transparent''', and each view is '''pulled''' onto the plane closest to it.  (Mnemonic: a "shark in a tank", esp. that is sunken into the floor.)  Using the 6-sided viewing box, each view of the object is projected opposite to the direction (sense) of sight, onto the (transparent) exterior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the same side of the box.  The box is then unfolded to view all of its '''exterior''' walls. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the object in the bottom of a bowl. Sliding the object up the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.

Here is the construction of third angle projections of the same object as above.  Note that the individual views are the same, just arranged differently.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Additional information===

First-angle projection is as if the object were sitting '''on''' the paper and, from
the "face" (front) view, it is rolled to the right to show the left side or rolled up to show its bottom. It is standard throughout Europe and Asia (excluding Japan).  First-angle projection was widely used in the UK, but during World War II, British drawings sent to be manufactured in the USA, such as of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]], had to be drawn in third-angle projection before they could be produced, e.g., as the [[Packard V-1650 Merlin]]. This historical position of the UK means that some British companies completely adopted third angle projection. BS 308 (Part 1) Engineering Drawing Practice, gave the option of using both projections, but generally every illustration (other than the ones explaining the difference between first and third-angle) was done in first-angle. After the withdrawal of BS 308 in 1999, BS 8888 offered the same choice since it referred directly to ISO 5456-2, Technical drawings – Projection methods – Part 2: Orthographic representations.

Third-angle is as if the object were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that the front view is in the center of the two arms, then the top view is above it, the bottom view is below it, the left view is to the left, and the right view is to the right. It is standard in the USA ([[the American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan ([[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia.

Both first-angle and third-angle projections result in the same 6 views; the difference between them is the arrangement of these views around the box.

A great deal of confusion has ensued in drafting rooms and engineering departments when drawings are transferred from one convention to another.  On [[engineering drawing]]s, the projection angle is denoted by an international symbol consisting of a truncated [[cone (geometry)|cone]], respectively for first-angle and third-angle:

http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/orthographic_projection_fyp/images/projection_symbols.png

[[File:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either First Angle (left) or Third Angle (right)]]

The 3D interpretation of the symbol can be deduced by envisioning a solid truncated cone, standing upright with its large end on the floor and the small end upward.  The top view is therefore two concentric circles ("donut"). In particular, the fact that the inner circle is drawn with a solid line instead of dashed identifies this view as the top view, not the bottom view.
* In ''first-angle projection'', the "top" view is pushed down to the floor, and the "front" view is pushed back to the rear wall; the intersection line between these two planes is therefore closest to the large end of the cone, hence the first-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end open toward the donut.
* In ''third-angle projection'', the "top" view is pulled up to the ceiling, and the "front" view is pulled forward to the front wall; the intersection line between the two planes is thus closest to the small end of the cone, hence the third-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end away from the donut.

==Multiviews without rotation==

Orthographic multiview projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]] and may produce an image of a specified, imaginary object as viewed from any direction of space. Orthographic projection is distinguished by parallel projectors emanating from all points of the imaged object and which intersect of projection at right angles. Above, a technique is described that obtains varying views by projecting images after the object is rotated to a desired position.

Descriptive geometry customarily relies on obtaining various views by imagining an object to be stationary, and changing the direction of projection (viewing) in order to obtain the desired view.

See ''Figure 1''. Using the rotation technique above, note that no orthographic view is available looking perpendicularly at any of the inclined surfaces. Suppose a technician desired such a view to, say, look through a hole to be drilled perpendicularly to the surface. Such a view might be desired for calculating clearances or for dimensioning purposes. To obtain this view without multiple rotations requires the principles of Descriptive Geometry. The steps below describe the use of these principles in third angle projection.

First-angle is used in most of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/orthographic_projection_fyp/webpages/third_angle.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-angle projection is most commonly used in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spdxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=asme+y14.3&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y-LDefoeGq&amp;sig=6eEmEixLZMufehl3MD2gSdoGVes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyls65nPPKAhVDuRQKHSCzCP84FBDoAQgeMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=asme+y14.3&amp;f=false|title=Engineering Drawing and Design|first1=David A.|last1=Madsen|first2=David P.|last2=Madsen|date=1 February 2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan (in JIS B 0001：2010);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-design-glossary.musabi.ac.jp/third-angle-projection/|publisher=[[Musashino Art University]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|title=Third Angle Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is preferred in Australia, as laid down in [[AS 1100]].101—1992 6.3.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/AS1100.1011992TechnicalDwgs/AS1100.101-1992+Technical+Dwgs_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "AS 1100.101 1992 Technical Dwgs"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''NSCAD conceptual art''' refers to a period beginning in 1969 when [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] (NSCAD), a post-secondary [[art]] school in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] became an important art centre with an international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Barber, "Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery, 1998, p. 11''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, the artist [[Garry Kennedy]] was appointed President, and he immediately moved to remake the College from a provincial art school into an international centre for artistic activity. He invited notable artists to come to NSCAD as visiting artists, particularly those involved in [[conceptual art]]. Artists who made significant contributions during this period include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Claes Oldenburg]].

==NSCAD University Press==
Under the direction of Kennedy, The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was established as a vehicle to publish books by and about leading contemporary artists. The Press was instrumental in establishing the university's international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Garry Neill Kennedy, "NSCAD and the Sixties", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1972 and 1987, 26 titles by such artists as [[Michael Snow]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] were published.

'''Pauline Campanelli''' (1943{{ndash}}2001) was an American artist who specialized in [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] [[still life]]s. Though her work did not often attract prestigious galleries or museums, only [[Andrew Wyeth]] sold more paintings while living than she did. Her top selling print, “Rose Berries” sold almost one million copies. In addition to painting, she wrote books on ancient pre-Christian rituals.

==Biography==
Pauline Eblé was born on January 25, 1943 in [[The Bronx]], New York. At the age of 3 she contracted [[polio]], spending a year in an [[iron lung]] and another year and a half in a hospital. She was home schooled with college texts until she was aged 13 and then attended high school in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]]. After graduating, she attended the [[Ridgewood School of Art]]&lt;ref name="biography obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Pauline Campanelli, 58, Artist Who Evoked Rustic Simplicity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/14/nyregion/pauline-campanelli-58-artist-who-evoked-rustic-simplicity.html|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2001|location=New York City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Art Students League of New York]].&lt;ref name=style&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Eblé Campanelli|url=http://nygs.com/artist/c/campanelli_pauline.html|website=New York Graphic Society|publisher=New York Graphic Society|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=New York City, New York|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726205156/http://nygs.com/artist/c/campanelli_pauline.html|archivedate=26 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campanelli's style was known as superrealism or [[photorealism]] and she was most known for her [[still life]]s&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Eblé Campanelli|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Pauline-Eble-Campanelli|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ordinary objects found in nature like fossils, shells, bird's nests and the like.&lt;ref name=style /&gt; She was influenced by [[Piet Mondrian]] as well as [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects|naturalism]] and her belief in [[paganism]].&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt; She was a meticulous painter, who strove to complete minute details accurately. Early in her career, she produced nearly twenty paintings per year, but after 1990, six per year was her average.&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims|first1=Carol|title=Pauline Eblé Campanelli, 58, Artist and Antiques Writer|url=http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/pauline-eble-campanelli-58-artist-and-antiques-writer/|website=Antiques and the Arts Weekly|publisher=The Bee Publishing|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=Newtown, CT|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, she sold more paintings as a living artist than any painter except [[Andrew Wyeth]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and her top-selling print, ''Wild Rose Berries'', sold almost one million copies.&lt;ref name=tribute /&gt;

In 1969, Eblé married fellow painter Dan Campanelli and they made their living from teaching art classes and selling paintings. In 1976, they bought a stone farmhouse in New Jersey which was abandoned and had no electricity. As they were unable to obtain financing and had no savings, they restored the building themselves with hand tools. Eblé-Campanelli abandoned her wheelchair for hands and knees and refinished the floors, while Dan worked on the sagging structure. They pressed grapes in an antique fruit press, making their own wine;  Eblé-Campanelli canned 400 jars of fruit annually; and she spun fleece from their Dorset sheep into yarn for projects.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt; Their work and home was featured in ''Colonial Homes'' in the March/April 1981 issue and ''Country Living Magazine'' in April 1985. That same year, the New Jersey Network produced a [[PBS]] program on their artwork and life for television.&lt;ref name="television and books"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Campanelli|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/author.php?author_id=385|website=Llewellyn|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide Ltd.|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=Woodbury, Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Eblé-Campanelli and her husband studied witchcraft and pre-Christian rituals to understand ancient practices and bring an appreciation to their rustic life.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt; She researched and wrote books, publishing her first volume, ''Wheel of the Year: Living the Magical Life'' in 1989.&lt;ref name="television and books" /&gt; Her most popular book, ''Ancient Ways: Reclaiming Pagan Traditions'' (1991) sold more than 40,000 copies.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt;

Campanelli died November 29, 2001 at her home near Phillipsburg, in [[Pohatcong Township, New Jersey]] from complications of her polio.&lt;ref name="biography obit" /&gt;

It was stolen in 1951 from the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and resurfaced in 2012.

==History==
''Paysage Bords de Seine'' was painted by Renoir in 1879. In June 1925, the painting was purchased by the [[Paris]] art gallery [[Bernheim-Jeune]] from a "Madame Papillon" (possibly Alphonsine Fournaise Papillon, a figure in the artist's ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'').&lt;ref name="Shapira_20120911"/&gt; In January 1926, Herbert L. May purchased the painting from Bernheim-Jeune. In 1937, May's ex-wife, [[Saidie May]], loaned the painting to the Baltimore Museum of Art.&lt;ref name="Shapira_20120927"/&gt; In her [[Will and testament|will]], Saidie May bequeathed the painting, along with all her other artworks, to the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Sometime between the evening of November 16, 1951, and a little after noon on November 17, ''Paysage Bords de Seine'' was stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art during the "From Ingres to Gauguin" show.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun Dec 2013"&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-ae-renoir-motion-20131203,0,481860.story Baltimore Museum of Art asks judge to dismiss woman's claims to Renoir painting]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum sold the title of the painting in an insurance claim of $2,500 to [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Company]], which paid the museum for the loss.&lt;ref name="Shapira_20120927"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-01-10/entertainment/bs-ae-renoir-summary-judgment-granted-20140110_1_renoir-girl-museum-director-doreen-bolger-bords Title to Renoir painting stolen in 1951 awarded to Baltimore Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Marcia Fuqua brought the painting to The Potomack Company [[auction house]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], to sell.&lt;ref name="Shapira_20120927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapira_20130404"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Shapira |title='Renoir Girl' unmasked as Loudoun County's Marcia 'Martha' Fuqua |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/renoir-girl-unmasked-as-loudoun-countys-marcia-martha-fuqua/2013/04/04/32391550-9722-11e2-814b-063623d80a60_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuqua claimed that she bought the painting at a flea market in [[West Virginia]] for $7 in late 2009, however a family member said the painting had been in the family for "50 or 60 years" (he later changed his account)&lt;ref name="Shapira_20130404"/&gt; and other witnesses claimed to have seen the painting in the family's possession decades before the attempted sale.&lt;ref name="Shapira_20130504"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Shapira |title=Witnesses say flea-market Renoir was seen in family's home decades ago |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2013-05-04 |accessdate=2013-05-06 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/witnesses-say-flea-market-renoir-was-seen-in-familys-home-decades-ago/2013/05/04/2d657db4-add1-11e2-a986-eec837b1888b_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapira_20131205"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Shapira |title='Renoir Girl' may have been trying to sell stolen landscape painting on the sly |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2013-12-06 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/mother-of-renoir-girl-may-not-have-known-she-was-trying-to-sell-stolen-painting/2013/12/05/8df60dfc-5cee-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Potomack Company cancelled the auction scheduled for September 29, 2012, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] seized the painting and opened an investigation into the theft.&lt;ref name="Shapira_20130404"/&gt;  In November 2013, the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company transferred the title of the painting from the insurance claim back to the Baltimore Museum of Art.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun Dec 2013"/&gt;

The '''Penumbra Theatre Company''', an [[African-American]] theatre company in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]], was founded by [[Lou Bellamy]] in 1976. The theater has been recognized for its artistic quality and its role in launching the careers of playwrights including two-time [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [[August Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Errol |author2=James V. Hatch|title=A History of African American Theatre|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2005|pages=471–72|isbn=978-0-521-62443-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ePerohXDIUC&amp;pg=PA471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=MHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Penumbra Theater: Art, Race and a Nation on Stage|url=http://www.minnesotahistorycenter.org/exhibits/penumbra-theatre-at-40|publisher=[[Minnesota History Center]]|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite web|title=History Center Celebrates 40 years of St. Paul's Penumbra Theater|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/02/16/history-center-celebrates-40-years-of-st-pauls-penumbra-theatre/|publisher=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 135-seat theater serves as a space to showcase the exploration of the African-American experience. Each year, Penumbra performs for over 40,000 people and conducts educational outreach workshops for more than 5,000 students. The theater employs more actors, choreographers, dancers, directors, and administrators of color than all other theaters in Minnesota combined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Located at St Paul's Hallie Q. Brown Community Center in the Martin Luther King Center building, the Penumbra is the largest one of three African-American theaters in the United States and is arguably considered the most influential in history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Beginnings==
Due to displacement and segregation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many African Americans were aided by [[settlement homes]] for not only economic and social services, but programming for the arts as well. The Hallie Q. Brown Community Center of St. Paul, Minnesota, much like the South Side Settlement house in Chicago and Henry Street Settlement house in New York, wanted to invest more in its art programming because it gave community members the tools to craft a voice within a community through visual arts, music, literature, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of African American Theatre|last=G. Hill|first=Errol|last2=V. Hatch|first2=James|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=412–13. 471–72|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These centers were not only a popular outlet for entertainment, but also a critical part of the [[Black Arts Movement]] where African Americans spoke out about racial inequalities and allowed them to shape a sense of identity. The Hallie Q. Brown Community Center’s second executive director, Henry R. Thomas, drafted a construction plan to incorporate a fully functional theater within its Martin Luther King Jr. facility to support these demands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Penumbra: The Premiere Stage for African American Drama|last=Mahala|first=Macelle|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the [[Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]] (CETA) awarded the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center a $150,000 grant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Board of Directors Meeting Minutes|journal=Penumbra Theatre Company Archives|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to further develop its cultural arts programming. The CETA appointed [[Lou Bellamy]], a theatre arts graduate student at [[University of Minnesota]], as the center’s cultural arts director where he later founded the Penumbra Theatre Company.

=== 1977–78 productions ===

[[Eden (Steve Carter play)|''Eden (1976)'']] by [[Steve Carter (playwright)|Steve Carter]] was the first production to launch of the 1977–78 season of the Penumbra Theatre Company. It explores diversity of ethnicities within the African-American community. The [[Negro Ensemble Company]] had recently premiered this performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://necinc.org/past-productions/|title=Production History|last=Edwards|first=Gus|date=|year=1978|publisher=New York: Dramatist Play Services|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the Penumbra a direct tie to the [[Black Arts Movement|Black Arts movement]]. Another relation to the movement is [[Ed Bullins]], a prominent editor, theorist, and playwright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sell|first=Mike|year=2001|title=[Ed.] Bullins as Editorial Performer:Textual Power and the Limits of Performance in the Black Arts Movement|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=no. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote Penumbra’s second production, the 1975 Broadway transfer of ''The Taking of Miss Jane''. The third production, ''Heartland, Louisiana'', showcases original work by Penumbra’s resident playwright, Horace Bond, who was Bellamy’s former graduate advisor and mentor. Bond focused mainly on developing African-American productions, particularly in the south. This proved successful in captivating and connecting African-American audiences who either grew up in the heavily segregated south and moved to northern cities or had relatives that had done so. For the fourth production, the Company staged the historic work of [[William Wells Brown]]’s [[The Escape; or, A Leap for Freedom|''The Escape; or, a Leap for Freedom'']]. Penumbra chose to actively produce plays that dealt with the implications and practices of [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]] in an effort to further investigate the history of African-American theatre.

Bellamy soon left Mixed Blood theatre as cultural arts director at Hallie Q. Brown Community Center. Penumbra initially identified itself as a multiracial company. While the company’s members, staff, and audience has always been ethnically diverse, their leadership and productions have a distinguishable dominance of African-American culture.&lt;ref name=UMP&gt;{{Mahala, Macelle (2013). Penumbra: The Premiere Stage for African American Drama. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  As its first few seasons continued, it began to fully emerge as an African-American theatre company.

"Bellamy.. insists that black theater – which he defines as stories of the black experience, rooted in the black community, as told by blacks – can only be done correctly with a deep understanding of black literature and culture, including the impact of slavery. Without that background, Bellamy says, a director is likely to overlook or misread clues embedded in the text – everything from West-African story motifs to the tendency of a race cowed by slavery to hide learning rather than to celebrate it." &lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web|title=Penumbra Theater Founder defines American black stage|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2008/0624/p20s01-ussc.html|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable company members ==

=== August Wilson at the Penumbra ===
The Penumbra Theater company worked with playwright and poet [[August Wilson]] early in his career, helping the writer transition from poet to playwright. August Wilson’s first play, ''[[Black Bart and the Sacred Hills]]'' (1977), and later ''[[Jitney (play)|Jitney!]]'' (1982) premiered at the Penumbra Theater. His work is still regularly played on the Penumbra stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penumbratheatre.org/repertoire/|title=Repertoire|website=Penumbra Theatre|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“We are what we imagine ourselves to be, and we can only imagine what we know to be possible. The founding of Penumbra Theatre enlarged that possibility. And its corresponding success provokes the community to a higher expectation of itself. I became a playwright because I saw where my chosen profession was being sanctioned by a group of black men and women who were willing to invest their lives and their talent in assuming a responsibility for our presence in the world and the conduct of our industry as black Americans."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;- August Wilson, Written to commemorate the 20th anniversary of The Penumbra Theatre Company in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Penumbra: The Premier Stage for African American Drama|last=Mahala|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=64|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Lou Bellamy ===
[[Lou Bellamy]] founded the Penumbra theater in 1976, and will stand as the artistic director of the company until 2017, when the position will be filled by his daughter, Sarah Bellamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/sarah-bellamy-will-take-over-at-penumbra-theatre/240010661/|title=Sarah Bellamy will take over at Penumbra Theatre|newspaper=Star Tribune|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as the Associate Professor at the [[University of Minnesota]] in the Department of Theatre Arts and Dance for over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penumbratheatre.org/lou-bellamy-2/|title=Lou Bellamy|website=Penumbra Theatre|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Bellamy is largely credited for the artistic success of the Penumbra theater, as he is responsible for hiring and gestating some of the theater’s more notorious artists (Including writer [[August Wilson]] and director [[Claude Purdy]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In May 2001, Lou Bellamy won an [[Obie Award|Obie award]] for his directorial contribution to [[August Wilson]]'s [[Two Trains Running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/news/read/?paper=topstories&amp;id=1179925923|title=Minnesota State Mankato grad Lou Bellamy wins Obie Award — Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSU) – 2007-05-23|website=www.mnsu.edu|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach initiatives ==
In addition to theatrical performances, the Penumbra Theater also runs public events, dialogues, workshops and a variety of other events aimed at social awareness. Programs include workshops on race, a summer institute for teenagers, and performances and internships for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penumbratheatre.org/services/|title=Services|website=Penumbra Theatre|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The African-American Theater History Project ===
The African-American Theater History Project (also known as Umbra Search), In a partnership between the Penumbra Theater Company and [[University of Minnesota|The University of Minnesota]] with financial support from the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] and the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umbrasearch.org/pages/about|title=Umbra: Search African American History|website=Umbra: Search African American History|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; addresses the lack of access to primary documentation regarding the history and culture of African-American theater. The project’s aim is to collaborate with other African-American theater companies to collect, catalog and archive important historical documents, and make this information publicly available in an online catalog to promote awareness and education regarding the history of African-American theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcgcircle.org/2014/05/the-african-american-theater-history-project-seeks-participants/|title=The African American Theater History Project Seeks Participants — TCG Circle|website=www.tcgcircle.org|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception and awards ==
* In 2000, [[Danny Glover]] presented the Penumbra Theatre company with the Jujamcyn Award in New York City, putting the company on the top list of regional theatres.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penumbratheatre.org/history/|title=History|website=Penumbra Theatre|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11939">[[File:CLUNY-Maquette pilier nautes 1.JPG|thumb|upright|200px|Model reconstructing the Pillar of the Boatmen in the [[Musée de Cluny]]]]
The '''Pillar of the Boatmen''' (French ''Pilier des nautes'') is a monumental Roman column erected in [[Lutetia]] (modern Paris) in honour of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] by the guild of boatmen in the 1st c. AD. It is the oldest monument in Paris and is one of the earliest pieces of representational Gallo-Roman art to carry a written inscription {{harv|Hatt|1952}}.

It was found re-used in the 4th c. city wall on the Île de la Cité and is now displayed in the [[frigidarium]] of the [[Thermes de Cluny]].

==Description==

The pillar is made of a type of limestone called "pierre de Saint-Leu-d'Esserent", from Saint-Leu, Oise, France. The original pillar would have been 5.24m high, 0.91m wide at the base and 0.74m wide at the top (Saragoza 2003). It is likely to have been formed in four tiers and although the order from top to bottom is reasonably certain from the relative sizes of the blocks, we do not know the rotational order in which the blocks were arranged; there are 64 possibilities.

However, there is no proof that they were stacked and could also have been two pairs of altars.

The guild was for relatively wealthy shipowners or traders. An indication of the power of the guild is shown by one of the sculptures of the pillar where they parade in arms with shields and spears, a privilege granted by the Romans, which is exceptional in less than half a century after the conquest of Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Charniguet and Anne Lombard-Jourdan: Cernunnos, Deer god of the Gauls, Paris, Larousse, coll. "Gods, myths &amp; heroes", 2009,  {{ISBN|978-2-03-584620-4}} , p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The guild was also the first known society of Paris. 

===Inscription===
Written in [[Latin]] with some [[Gaulish language]] features, the inscription mingles [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]] with gods that are distinctly Gallic. The pillar is dated by a dedication to ''Tiberius Caesar Augustus'', that is [[Tiberius]] who became [[Roman emperor|emperor]] in 14 AD. It was set up publicly ''(publice posierunt)'' by the guild of sailors of Lutetia, from the ''[[civitas]]'' of the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] ''(nautae Parisiaci)''. These sailors would have been merchants who travelled along the [[Seine]].

The main dedication is to Jupiter in the form of ''Iovis Optimus Maximus'' ("Jove Best and Greatest"). The names of the emperor and the supreme deity appear in the [[dative]] case as the recipients of the dedication. The remaining theonyms are [[nominative]] legends that accompany individual depictions of the gods. These are (in the order they appear below) Jove, [[Tarvos Trigaranos]] (the Bull with three Cranes), [[Vulcan (god)|Volcanus]] (Vulcan), [[Esus]], [[Cernunnos]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Smertrios]], and [[Fortuna (luck)|Fortuna]].

The dedication ({{CIL|13|3026}}; ''RIG'' L2-1) is as follows:

:Tib(erio) Caesare /
:Aug(usto) Ioui Optum[o] /
:Maxsumo /
:nautae Parisiaci /
:publice posierunt //
:Eurises // Senan[t] U[s]e[t]lo[n][-] //
:Iouis // Taruos Trigaranus //
:Volcanus // Esus //
:[C]ernunnos // Castor // [---] //
:Smer[---] //
:Fort[una] // [--]TVS[--] // D[--]

[[File:Le Pilier des Nautes 04.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Pilier des Nautes : the gods [[Tarvos trigaranus]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]].]]

|}

The pillar provides the only undisputed instance of the divine name ''[[Cernunnos]]'' {{harv|Koch|2006|p=396}}. The Gaulish theonyms are presented as deity names in their own right, and not as [[interpretatio romana|epithets for Roman gods]] (by contrast, see the many [[Mars (mythology)#Provincial epithets|Celtic gods syncretized with Mars]]). Other figures appear on the pillar without legible inscriptions, including the Roman gods Mars and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], who can be identified by their conventional iconography, and other unidentified figures, mainly female.

===Deities===

The top tier, of which only the top half remains,  depicts [[Cernunnos]], [[Smertrios]], and [[Castor and Pollux]]. Cernunnos has stag's antlers from which hang two torcs. From the amount of the body in the top half, Cernunnos is assumed to have been depicted in a cross-legged seated position as is typical of other Cernunnos depictions {{harv|Bober|1951|pages=14, 19, 21–24}}; there is insufficient room for him to be seated on a chair or standing {{harv|Bober|1951|page=30}}. Smertrios is shown kneeling, brandishing a club and attacking a snake. Castor and Pollux are shown standing beside their horses, each holding a spear {{harv|Busson|1998|p=451}}.

The second tier, which is complete, shows [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], [[Esus]], [[Tarvos Trigaranos]] and [[Vulcan (god)|Vulcan]]. Jupiter is shown standing, holding a spear and a thunderbolt. Esus is shown standing beside a willow tree, which he is cutting down with an axe.  Tarvos Trigaranus is depicted as a large, heavy-set bull standing in front of a willow tree. Two cranes stand on his back and a third on his head. Vulcan is shown standing, with hammer and tongs {{harv|Busson|1998|pp=449–450}}.

The third tier, the top half of which survives, bears the main dedicatory inscription on one face. Since this has a border and appears complete, the content of the bottom half of this face is unknown. The other sides show a group of three young men with shields and spears; a group of three older, bearded men with spears and shields, bearing the inscription ''Iurises''; and a group of three figures, at least one of which is female. They are unarmed, dressed in flowing gowns, and have an inscription ''Senani U[s]eiloni'' {{harv|Busson|1998|p=448}}.

The fourth, lowest tier is slightly wider than the upper three. Only the top half remains, and the inscriptions are badly damaged. Each face shows a pair of standing figures. [[Mars (god)|Mars]], with spear and sword, is accompanied by a female deity with large round ear-rings and a flowing garment which is held over one arm. [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], identifiable by his caduceus, is depicted with a goddess who may be [[Rosmerta]], his frequent companion in Gallic art. [[Fortuna (luck)|Fortuna]] is accompanied by another female deity, perhaps [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. Two other unidentified female deities are on the fourth face, the one to the left is naked to the waist and holds a large cloak behind her with upraised arms; the other is clothed and has large round ear-rings {{harv|Busson|1998|p=447}}.

==History of the Pillar==

Some time in the 3rd century, the stone blocks that formed the pillar were broken into two and used to reinforce the foundations of the walls along the riverbank. Over time, the island grew slightly so that the 3rd-century wharfs are now a dozen metres from the banks of the modern river {{harv|Kruta|1883}}.

The [[Christian]] [[cathedral]] of St. Etienne  was founded by [[Childebert I|Childebert]] in 528 AD on the site of the Gallo-Roman temple; [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] was in turn built over this in 1163 AD.

The pillar was found on 6 March 1710 (''not'' 1711, as is often erroneously stated) during the construction of a crypt under the nave of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and first published by Baudelot de Dairval in 1712 {{harv|Busson|1998|pages=445–446}}. Not all of the pieces were recovered; for three of the tiers we have only the top half.

After discovery, the stone blocks were taken to the Hôtel de Cluny, a mediaeval ecclesiastical building constructed over the remains of a 2nd-century Roman bath house. This became the ''Musée de Cluny'' and then, the ''[[Musée national du Moyen Age]]''.

In 2001, the blocks were restored, removing the black patina of grime that had accumulated on the surface of the stone over the three centuries since discovery {{harv|Saragoza|2003}}. The restored stones are once again on display in the museum.

[[Image:Venus and Adonis quarto.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the first [[quarto]] (1593) of Shakespeare's ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'', printed by Richard Field, adorned with his emblem the ''Anchora Spei'', "anchor of hope."]]

'''Richard Field''' (or '''Feild''') (1561–1624) was a printer and publisher in Elizabethan London, best known for his close association with the poems of [[William Shakespeare]], with whom he grew up in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirwood, A. E. M. "Richard Field, Printer, 1589–1624." ''The Library'' 12 (1931), pp. 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Field's family lived on Bridge Street, Stratford-upon-Avon, close to the Shakespeare's house on Henley Street. His father was a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]]. It is generally accepted that Shakespeare and Field knew each other in Stratford, since they were similar in age and their fathers were in similar businesses (tanner and glover). After Field's father Henry died in August 1592, William's father [[John Shakespeare]] was one of the local officials charged with the appraisal of the deceased man's property.

In 1579 Richard Field began an apprenticeship with the London printers [[George Bishop (Printer)|George Bishop]] and [[Thomas Vautrollier]]. Vautrollier died in 1587. In 1588, Field collaborated with Jacqueline Vautrollier, Thomas Vautrollier's widow and a printer in her own right, on ''The copie of a letter sent out of England to Don Bernardin Mendoza declaring the state of England''. This piece of Protestant propaganda was the first work to bear Field's name. Field went on to marry Jacqueline in 1589. He succeeded to his former master's business, "one of the best in London."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, F. E. ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1864.'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Field's shop was in the [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] area of London, near [[Ludgate]]. He regularly printed works for the most highly regarded publishers in London, including William Ponsonby and [[Edward Blount]]. In 1592 his brother, Jasper Field, joined Richard's business as an apprentice.

Field's Protestantism led him to publish a number of Spanish-language Protestant works for sale in Catholic Spain, under the name "Ricardo del Campo." Examples include a translation of Calvin's reformed catechism, ''Catecismo que significa forma de instrucción, que contiene los principios de la religión de dios, util y necessario para todo fiel Christiano : compuesto en manera de dialogue, dónde pregunta el maestro, y responde el discípulo'' (1596). His Spanish works included a number which claimed to be written by [[Cipriano de Valera]], including ''Dos tratados. El primero es del Papa y de su autoridad colegiado de su vida y dotrina, y de lo que los doctores y concilios antiguos y la misma sagrada Escritura enseñan. El segundo es de la Missa recopilado de los doctores y concilios y de la sagrada Escritura'' (1599) and a Spanish New Testament (1596).

For his title pages, Field adopted an [[Aldine Press|Aldine]] device, an anchor with the Latin motto ''Anchora Spei,'' "anchor of hope," which previously belonged to the Vautrollier.

In Field's era, the trades of printer and publisher were to some significant degree separate activities: booksellers acted as publishers and commissioned printers to do the requisite printing. Field concentrated more on printing than publishing: of the roughly 295 books he printed in his career, he was publisher of perhaps 112, while the rest were published by other stationers.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When, for example, [[Andrew Wise]] published [[Thomas Campion]]'s ''Observations in the Art of English Poesy'' in 1602, the volume was printed by Field.

Field rose to be one of the 22 master printers of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]]. From 1615 on he kept his shop in Wood Street, near his home. Field had a number of apprentices, one being George Miller. After Field's death in 1624, his business passed to the partners Richard Badger and George Miller, who continued to employ the Aldine device.

==Shakespeare's poems==
[[File:Dedication page of The Rape of Lucrece by William Shakespeare 1594.jpg|thumb|The dedication page of ''The Rape of Lucrece''.]]
Field is best remembered for printing the early editions of three of Shakespeare's non-dramatic poems:
* ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' – Field printed the first four editions of the narrative poem, the [[book size|quartos]] of 1593 and 1594 and the [[book size|octavos]] of 1595 and 1596.
* ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' – Field printed the first quarto edition of 1594.
* ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'' – working for Edward Blount, Field printed the 1601 first quarto edition of the poem ''Love's Martyr'' by [[Robert Chester (poet)|Robert Chester]]. In addition to Chester's poem, the volume contained short poems by other hands, including Shakespeare's work.

In contrast to the early printed editions of Shakespeare's plays, Field's texts for the two narrative poems meet a high standard of quality. Scholars have sometimes supposed Shakespeare's direct involvement: "The two early poems, both carefully printed by Field, are probably the only works the publication of which Shakespeare supervised."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, have disputed the idea of the poet's personal involvement, arguing that Field, "a highly efficient printer with a reputation for honesty and scrupulousness," could have produced the high-quality texts on his own.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''The Poems.'' John Roe, ed. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006; p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Field entered ''Venus and Adonis'' into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 18 April 1593, and published as well as printed the first two editions, but on 25 June 1594 he transferred the rights to the poem to bookseller John Harrison ("the Elder"). Harrison published ''Lucrece'' as well as future editions of ''Venus,'' and sold the books from his shop at the sign of the White Greyhound in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] Churchyard. Harrison later published editions of ''Lucrece'' that were printed by other printers.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 165, 207, 402, 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other connections==
Another association between Shakespeare and Field has been theorised. It has often been noticed that many of the texts that Shakespeare used as sources for his plays were products of the Vautrollier/Field printshop. These texts include [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]], [[John Harington (writer)|Sir John Harington]]'s translation of ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s ''Pandosto'', the works of [[Ovid]], and possibly [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles''. Since Field would have kept a copy of each of these books in his shop, it has been theorised that Shakespeare used Field's shop as a library during his early career.&lt;ref&gt;Stopes, Charlotte. ''Shakespeare's Warwickshire Contemporaries.'' Startford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare Head Press, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James S. Shapiro|James Shapiro]] argues that the influence of Plutarch was especially significant in Shakespeare's mid-career and that he "probably worked from a copy of Plutarch given, or lent him, by Field, an expensive and beautiful folio that cost a couple of pounds".&lt;ref name = "shap"/&gt;

Richard and Jacqueline Field lived on Wood Street in the parish of St. Olave in the early 17th century; Shakespeare moved in with the Mountjoy family in nearby Silver Street in 1602. Mrs. Field and the Mountjoys were members of the community of [[Huguenot]] exiles in London, and likely knew each other on that basis – a further probable connection between Shakespeare and the Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Cymbeline''==
There is no direct evidence for a connection between Shakespeare and Field after 1601, but an indirect connection exists in a reference in Shakespeare's ''[[Cymbeline]]'', believed to have been written around 1610. In IV,ii,377 of that play, Imogen gives the decapitated corpse of Cloten the name "Richard du Champ," French for Richard Field. (When printing Spanish texts, Field called himself "Ricardo del Campo.")&lt;ref name = "shap"&gt;Shapiro, James. ''A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare: 1599.'' New York, HarperCollins, 2005; p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's reason for giving his friend and colleague's name to the headless corpse of a villain is a matter of speculation. However, at this point in the play Imogen believes the body to be that of her husband Posthumus. When discovered (dressed as a young man) embracing the corpse, she dissembles by inventing the imaginary "du Champ", referring to him as "a very valiant Briton and a good", calling herself his devoted servant. For this reason the name is typically interpreted as an affectionate compliment to Field.&lt;ref&gt;Ros King, ''Cymbeline: constructions of Britain'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, p.89.; Laurie E. Maguire, ''Shakespeare's Names'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomoya Aki, a male high school teenager who works part-time to fund his ''[[otaku]]'' lifestyle (anime, [[galge|dating sim]]s, and related merchandise)  encounters a beautiful girl one day during spring vacation. A month later, he finds out that the girl is his classmate, Megumi, who is hardly noticeable to her classmates. Hoping to create a [[visual novel]] computer game, he turns to school beauties Eriri Spencer Sawamura for designing the art, and Utaha Kasumigaoka for writing the game scenario. Tomoya then recruits Megumi to star as the "heroine" (the main character's love interest) of his game, thus forming the development team "Blessing Software", in which the three most renowned students in the school (Tomoya, Eriri, and Utaha) work on one of the least noticeable (Megumi). The series follows their adventures in developing the game and their plans to sell it at the [[Comiket]] convention, as well as the emotional entanglements among the team.

'''Segerlindska teatern''' ('Segerlind Theatre') was a theater in Gothenburg, active between 1816 and 1892.  It was also known as ''Nya teatern'' ('New Theatre'), ''Stora teatern'' ('Grand Theatre') and (after the foundation of the [[Stora Teatern|Grand Theatre]]) as ''Mindre teatern'' ('Little Theatre'). 

The theatre was constructed as a replacement of the old ''[[Comediehuset]]'', which was by then considered too decrepit. It was financed by the wealthy [[Laurentius Segerlind]] and designed by [[Jonas Hagberg]].  Influenced by the building of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in Stockholm, it had was situated by the street Södra Hamngatan and had room for 1 269 spectators.  The theatre was inaugurated on 12 August 1816 by the theater company of [[Johan Anton Lindqvist]], which had moved there from the ''Comediehuset''. The theatre was mostly used by travelling theatre companies rather than having a permanent staff. Attempts where made to create a permanent theatre by Johan Anton Lindqvist (1816-20) and [[Gustaf Åbergsson]] (1820-23). By 1859, the building was considered to old and the [[Stora Teatern|Grand Theatre]] was built to replace it.  The building was used as a concert house until 1864, when it was again inaugurated as a theatre.  This time, however, it had been redesigned and was reduced, with room for only 500 spectators. 
The theatre was burnt down in 1892.

{{Literature}}
The '''sociology of literature''' is a subfield of the [[sociology of culture]]. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s 1992  ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996).

==Classical sociology==

None of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[ideology]] has been directed at literature by [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Max Weber]]'s theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by [[Frankfurt School]] writers such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. [[Emile Durkheim]]'s view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by [[Robert Escarpit]]. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim

==Lukács and the theory of the novel==

An important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'', first published in German in 1916, in the ''Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft''. In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. ''The Theory of the Novel'' argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel: A Historico-Philosophical Essay of the Forms of Great Epic Literature'', trans. A. Bostock, London: Merlin Press, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world. 

Lukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was ''The Historical Novel'', written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.

Lukács was an important influence on [[Lucien Goldmann]]'s ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'', Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's ''The Sociology of Literature'' and [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Signs Taken for Wonders''.

==The Frankfurt School==

Founded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Leo Löwenthal]]. Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'', Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' and Löwentahl's ''Literature and the Image of Man'' were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.

Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'' is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the [[commodification]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of modern life, citing [[Goethe]] and [[Baudelaire]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1991). ''Notes to Literature'', Vol. 1, trans. S.W. Nicholson, New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 37-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy.    

Habermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'' was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.

==The sociology of the avant-garde==

Peter Bürger was Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the University of Bremen. His ''Theorie der Avantgarde'' was published in German in 1974 and in English translation in 1984. Like Habermas, Bürger was interested in the institutional sociology of literature and art. He postulated a historical typology of aesthetic social relations, measured along three main axes, the function of the artwork, its mode of production and its mode of reception.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him three main kinds of art, sacral, courtly and bourgeois. Bourgeois art, he argued, had as its function individual self-understanding and was produced and received individually. It became a celebration in form of the liberation of art from religion, the court and, eventually, even the bourgeoisie. Modernist art was thus an autonomous social 'institution', the preserve of an increasingly autonomous intellectual class. The 'historical avant-garde' of the inter-war years developed as a movement within and against modernism, he concluded, as an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against precisely this autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas adopts a very similar approach in his own account of the avant-garde.

==The sociology of the book trade==

Robert Escarpit was Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the Centre for the Sociology of Literary Facts. His works included ''The Sociology of Literature'', published in French in 1958 and in English translation in 1971, and ''The Book Revolution'', published in French in 1965 and in English in 1966. In Durkheimian fashion, Escarpit aimed to concern himself only with the externally defined 'social facts' of literature, especially those registered in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; His focus fell on the 'community of writers', understood in aggregate as 'generations' and 'teams'. He extended the definition of literature to include all 'non-functional' writing and also insisted that literary success resulted from 'a convergence of intentions between author and reader'.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogously empirical studies of the sociology of the book trade were carried out by [[Lewis Coser]] in the United States and [[Peter H. Mann]] in Britain.

[[Lucien Febvre]] and Henri-Jean Martin's ''L'Apparition du livre'', first published in French 1958 and in English translation as ''The Coming of the Book'' in 1976, is strictly speaking a work of social history (Febvre was a leading figure in the ''Annales'' School of historiography). But it is deeply sociological in character - ''Annales'' history was determinedly social scientific - and provides a systematic account of the long-run development of the European book trade (the period covered is 1450–1800).

==Genetic structuralism==

Lucien Goldmann was Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and founding Director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels. Like Escarpit, Goldmann was influenced by Durkheim: hence, his definition of the subject matter of sociology as the 'study of the facts of consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, L. (1970). ''The Human Sciences and Philosophy'', trans. H.V. White and R. Anchor, London: Jonathan Cape, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also interested in developing a sociology of the text. The central task of the literary sociologist, he argued, was to bring out the objective meaning of the literary work by placing it in its historical context, studied as a whole. 

Goldmann defined the creating subject as transindividual, that is, as an instance of Durkheim's 'collective consciousness'. Following Marx and Lukács, however, Goldmann also assumed that group consciousness was normally class consciousnesses. The mediating agency between a social class and the work of literature then became the 'world vision', which binds the individual members of a social class together. ''Le Dieu caché'', his study of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jean Racine]], was published in French in 1955 and in English translation as ''The Hidden God'' in 1964. It identified 'structural homologies' between the Jansenist 'tragic vision', the textual structures of Pascal's ''Pensées'' and Racine's plays, and the social position of the seventeenth-century 'noblesse de robe'. Goldmann's structuralism was 'genetic' because it sought to trace the genesis of literary structures in extra-literary phenomena.

In 1964 Goldmann published ''Pour une Sociologie du Roman'' translated by Alan Sheridan as ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'' in 1974. Like Lukács, Goldmann sees the novel as revolving around the problematic hero's search for authentic values in a degraded society. But Goldmann also postulates a 'rigorous homology' between the literary form of the novel and the economic form of the commodity. The early novel, he argues, is concerned with individual biography and the problematic hero, but, as competitive capitalism evolves into monopoly capitalism, the problematic hero progressively disappears. The period between the First and Second World Wars witnesses a temporary experiment with the community as collective hero: Goldmann's example is [[André Malraux]]. But the main line of development is characterised by the effort to write the novel of 'the absence of subjects'. Here, Goldmann's example is the ''nouveau roman'' of [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[Nathalie Sarraute]].  

[[Andrew Milner]]'s ''John Milton and the English Revolution'' (1981) is essentially an application of Goldmann's genetic structuralism to the study of seventeenth-century English literature.

==Sociocriticism==

Goldmann's sociology of literature remains significant in itself and as a source of inspiration, both positive and negative, to the kind of 'sociocriticism' developed by Edmond Cros, Pierre Zima and their co-workers in France and Canada.

==Neo-Marxian ideology critique==

Marx used the term ideology to denote the inner connectedness of culture, including literature, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. and F. Engels (1970). ''The German Ideology'', Part 1, trans. W. Lough, C. dutt and C.P. Magill, London: Lawrence and Wishart, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Louis Althusser elaborated on this notion in the early 1970s, arguing that ideology functions so as to constitute biological individuals as social 'subjects' by representing their imaginary relation to their real conditions of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). 'Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Towards and Investigation' in ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays'', trans. B. Brewster, London: New Left Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Althusser himself art was not ideology. But his theory was applied to literature by Macherey in France, Eagleton in Britain and Jameson in the United States. The central novelty of Eagleton's ''Criticism and Ideology'' was its argument that literature could be understood as 'producing' ideology, in the sense of performing it.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, T. (1976). ''Criticism and Ideology'', London: New Left Books, pp. 64-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson's ''The Political Unconscious'' argued that literary analysis can be focussed on three distinct levels, 'text', 'ideologeme' and 'ideology of form', each of which has its socio-historical corollary, in the equivalent 'semantic horizon' of political history, society and mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, F. (1981), ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act'', London: Methuen, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The version of ideology Jameson applies to all three levels is essentially Althusserian. The novelty of his position, however, was to argue for a 'double hermeneutic' simultaneously concerned with ideology and [[utopia]].

Macherey, Eagleton and Jameson were literary critics by profession, but their applications of ideology-critique to literature are sociological in character, insofar as they seek to explain literary phenomena in extra-literary terms.

==Bourdieu==

Bourdieu was Professor of Sociology at the Collège de France and Director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne. His first major contribution to the sociology of literature (and other arts) was ''La Distinction'', published in French in 1979 and in English translation in 1984. It is based on detailed sociological surveys and ethnographic observation of the social distribution of cultural preferences. Bourdieu identified three main zones of taste, 'legitimate', 'middle-brow' and 'popular', which he found to be dominant respectively in the educated sections of the dominant class, the middle classes and the working classes. He described legitimate taste as centred on an 'aesthetic disposition' to assert the primacy of form over function. The 'popular aesthetic', by contrast, is based on continuity between art and life and 'a deep-rooted demand for participation'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, its hostility to representations of objects that in real life are either ugly or immoral. Artistic and social 'distinction' are inextricably interrelated, he concluded, because the 'pure gaze' implies a break with ordinary attitudes towards the world and, as such, is a 'social break'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rules of Art'' is more specifically focussed on literature, especially the significance of [[Gustave Flaubert]] for the making of modern French literature. Bourdieu postulated a model of 'the field of cultural production' as structured externally in relation to the 'field of power' and internally in relation to two 'principles of hierarchization', the heteronomous and the autonomous. The modern literary and artistic field is a site of contestation between the heteronomous principle, subordinating art to economy, and the autonomous, resisting such subordination. In Bourdieu's map of the French literary field in the late nineteenth century, the most autonomous genre, that is, the least economically profitable - poetry - is to the left, whilst the most heteronomous, the most economically profitable - drama - is to the right, with the novel located somewhere in between. Additionally, higher social status audiences govern the upper end of the field and lower status audiences the lower end.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1996). ''The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'', trans. S. Emanuel, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert's distinctive achievement in ''L'Éducation sentimentale'' was, in Bourdieu's account, to have understood and defined the rules of modern autonomous art.

==The rise of the novel==

One of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University. For Watt, the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism', the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His paradigmatic instances are [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also argued that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural materialism==

Raymond Williams was Professor of Drama at Cambridge University and one of the founders of contemporary cultural studies. He described his own distinctive approach as a 'cultural materialism', by which he meant a theory of culture 'as a (social and material) productive process' and of the arts 'as social uses of material means of production'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1980). ''Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays'', London: Verso, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clearly sociological, as distinct from literary-critical, perspective: hence, its most general exposition in the United States as ''The Sociology of Culture'' and in Britain as ''Culture'', a 1981 title in Fontana's New Sociology series. Although Williams's interests ranged widely across the whole field of literary and cultural studies, his major work was concentrated on literature and drama. He was thus a sociologist of culture, specialising in the sociology of literature. 

In ''The Long Revolution'' (1961), Williams developed pioneering accounts of the sociology of the book trade, the sociology of authorship and the sociology of the novel. In ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'' (1970), he argued that the modern novel articulated a distinctively modern 'structure of feeling', the key problem of which was the 'knowable community'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1974). ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'', London: Chatto and Windus, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Country and the City'' (1973) he developed a social history of English country-house poetry, aimed at demystifying the idealisations of rural life contained in the literature: 'It is what the poems are: not country life but social compliment; the familiar hyperboles of the aristocracy and its attendants'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1973). ''The Country and the City'', New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Marxism and Literature'' (1977) - simultaneously a critique of both Marxism and 'Literature' - is an extensive formal elaboration of Williams's own theoretical system.   

[[Alan Sinfield]]'s ''Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading'' (1992) and ''Literature, Politics and Culture in Postwar Britain'' (1997) are both clearly indebted to Williams. So, too, is Andrew Milner's ''Literature, Culture and Society'' (2005).

==World-systems theory==

Franco Moretti was, by turn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Salerno, of Comparative Literature at Verona University and of English and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His first book, ''Signs Taken for Wonders'' (1983) was subtitled ''Essays in the Sociology of Literary Forms'' and was essentially qualitative in method. His later work, however, became progressively more quantitative. 

Applying [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s [[world-systems theory]] to literature, Moretti argued, in ''Atlas of the European Novel'' (1998), that the nineteenth-century literary economy had comprised 'three Europes', with France and Britain at the core, most countries in the periphery and a variable semiperiphery located in between. Measured by the volume of translations in national bibliographies, he found that French novelists were more successful in the Catholic South and British in the Protestant North, but that the whole continent nonetheless read the leading figures from both.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, pp. 174, 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; London and Paris 'rule the entire continent for over a century', he concluded, publishing half or more of all European novels.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moretti's theses prompted much subsequent controversy, collected together in Christopher Prendergast's edited collection ''Debating World Literature'' (2004). Moretti himself expanded on the argument in his ''Distant Reading'' (2013).

==Recent developments==

Building on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics and cultural capital, the sociology of literature has recently concentrated on readers' construction of meaning. New developments include studying the relationship between literature and group identities; concerning institutional and reader-response analysis; reintroducing the role of intentions of the author in literature; reconsidering the role of ethics and morality in literature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recovering Morality: Pragmatic Sociology and Literary Studies | journal = New Literary History | first1 = S. M. | last1 = Dromi | first2 = E. | last2 = Illouz | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 351–369| id = | accessdate = 2011-03-09 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/v041/41.2.dromi.html | doi=10.1353/nlh.2010.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing a clearer understanding of how literature is and is not like other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recent Moves in the Sociology of Literature | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | last = Griswold | first = W. | volume = 19 | pages = 455–467| id = | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.19.080193.002323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociology of literature has also recently taken an interest in the global inequality between First-World and Third-World authors, where the latter tend to be strongly dependent on the editorial decisions of publishers in Paris, London or New York and are often excluded from participation in the global literary market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The World Republic of Letters |last1= Casanova |first1= Pascale |year= 2004 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/toc/nlh.41.2.html New Literary History] devoted a special issue to new approaches to the sociology of literature in Spring 2010.

'''Superflat''' is a [[postmodern art|postmodern]] [[art movement]], founded by the artist [[Takashi Murakami]], which is influenced by [[manga]] and [[anime]].&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Avella, ''Graphic Japan: From Woodblock and Zen to Manga and Kawaii'', Rotovision, 2004, p111. {{ISBN|2-88046-771-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a 2001 art exhibition, curated by Murakami, that toured [[West Hollywood]], [[Minneapolis]] and [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name=hauser&gt;Kitty Hauser, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_43/ai_n7069272/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 ''Superflat: Kitty Hauser on fan fare''], ''ArtForum'', Oct, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
"Superflat" is used by Murakami to refer to various flattened forms in Japanese graphic art, animation, pop culture and fine arts, as well as the "shallow emptiness of Japanese consumer culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/features/drohojowska-philp/drohojowska-philp1-18-01.asp Hunter Drohojowska-Philp, artnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Superflat has been embraced by American artists, who have created a hybrid called "[[SoFlo Superflat]]".&lt;ref name=hauser/&gt;

"Superflat" Artists include [[Chiho Aoshima]], [[Mahomi Kunikata]], [[Sayuri Michima]], [[Yoshitomo Nara]], [[Aya Takano]] and Takashi Murakami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/features/drohojowska-philp/drohojowska-philp1-18-01.asp|title=Superflat|publisher=artnet.com|date=2001-01-14|accessdate=27 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japansociety.org/little_boy_the_arts_of_japans_exploding_subculture|title=Little Boy: The Arts of Japan’s Exploding Subculture|publisher=japansociety.org|date=2005-04-08|accessdate=27 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some animators within ''[[anime]]'' and some [[Mangaka|manga artist]] have had their past and present work exhibited in Superflat exhibitions, especially [[Kōji Morimoto]], and the work of [[Hitoshi Tomizawa]], author of ''[[Alien Nine|Alien 9]]'' and ''[[Milk Closet]]''.

Murakami defines ''Superflat'' in broad terms, so the subject matter is very diverse. Some works explore the consumerism and sexual fetishism that is prevalent in post-war Japanese culture. This often includes ''[[lolicon]]'' art, which is parodied by works such as those by [[Henmaru Machino]]. These works are an exploration of ''otaku'' sexuality through grotesque and/or distorted images. Other works are more concerned with a fear of growing up. For example, Yoshitomo Nara’s work often features playful graffiti on old Japanese ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' executed in a childish manner. And some works focus on the structure and underlying desires that comprise ''otaku'' and overall post-war Japanese culture. Murakami is influenced by directors such as [[Hideaki Anno]].&lt;ref&gt;Frenchy Lunning, ''Emerging Worlds of Anime and Manga'', University of Minnesota Press, 2006, p133. {{ISBN|0-8166-4945-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subversive look at otakuism is not a defining factor of Kaikai Kiki's galleries; Bome, one of the most important artists involved with the very first Superflat exhibition, is a famous [[otaku]] figure sculptor and his work based on existing [[bishoujo]] anime characters has been showcased in multiple galleries including a solo exhibition in the Kaikai Kiki Gallery. The artist ''[[Mr. (artist)|Mr.]]'' is a self-described [[lolicon]] and views his artwork to be not a cultural commentary but a portrayal of his own personal fantasies.&lt;ref name=hint&gt;Chen, Aric.

'''''The Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes''''' is a 1939 children's [[picture book]] written by [[DuBose Heyward]] and illustrated by [[Marjorie Flack]].

The book, which has never been out of print, has come to be regarded as a [[feminist]] and [[anti-racist]] statement.&lt;ref name="TheNewYorker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bare|first1=Kelly|title=Read This Book If: You Like Finding Easter Eggs|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/read-this-book-if-you-like-finding-easter-eggs|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=The New Yorker|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheWashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devoark|first1=Petula|title=A brown feminist Easter Bunny’s inspiring triumph|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-brown-feminist-easter-bunnys-inspiring-triumph/2015/04/02/3fbfced6-d941-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to James Hutchisson, professor of English at [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], the book is probably based on a story made up by his mother, Jane Screven DuBose, and told to Heyward when he was a child.  Before turning it into a book, Heyward used to tell the story to his own children.&lt;ref name="TheWashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devoark|first1=Petula|title=A brown feminist Easter Bunny’s inspiring triumph|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-brown-feminist-easter-bunnys-inspiring-triumph/2015/04/02/3fbfced6-d941-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

It is the story of Cottontail, a small, brown female bunny who aspires to be an [[Easter Bunny]] which, in this telling, is a highly competitive position for which only 5 bunnies are selected each year.  She applies only to be scorned by the elite Easter bunnies, “big white bunnies who lived in fine houses” who tell her to “go back to the country and eat a carrot.”

She returns to the country where “by and by she had a husband and then one day, much to her surprise there were twenty-one Cottontail babies to take care of.”  She brings them up exceedingly well, teaching them to be responsible, self-reliant and cooperative by requiring them to help in the vegetable garden and with the housework.

Then, she returns to the big city where she not only aces the Easter-bunny job interview, but becomes one of the most celebrated Easter bunnies of all time, admired for her heroism and the skills she learned rearing 21 little bunnies.

==Feminist statement==
[[Caroline Kennedy]] calls the heroine of Country Bunny, "My all-time favorite character," form a childhood book, "I see her now as a woman who re-enters the work force after raising a family — “leans in,” and does it all — much better than the big Jack Rabbits."&lt;ref name="TheNewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Caroline|title=Caroline Kennedy: By the Book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/books/review/caroline-kennedy-by-the-book.html?_r=0|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Francis Itani]] also remembers it as a childhood favorite in which the Country Bunny, "goes on a quest to prove that she (as much as the male bunnies) can be wisest, swiftest and kindest."&lt;ref name="TheOttawaCitizen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robb|first1=Peter|title=Frances Itani finds satisfaction in children's literature|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/books/frances-itani-finds-satisfaction-in-childrens-literature|accessdate=7 April 2016|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fair deliberately distinguished itself by focusing on industry and labour.&lt;ref name="itworldturin" /&gt;

The fair was held in the [[Parco del Valentino]] (as were the three previous Turin fairs in 1884, 1885 and 1902 and the subsequent 1924 Turin fair).&lt;ref name="itworldturin" /&gt;

The '''''Weltalter''''' (sometimes '''''Die Weltalter'''''; "{{bracket|The}} Ages of the World") of [[Friedrich Schelling]] refers to a philosophical work of 1811, and its continuation in manuscript for many years after that. It was a long and unfinished project, sometimes identified with Schelling's  philosophical output from 1809 to 1827, the period beginning with his ''[[Freiheitsschrift]]''.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=Schelling |title=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling |last=Bowie  |first=Andrew|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Weltalter'' fragments==
Despite Schelling's years of work on the project, no definitive version of the ''Weltalter'' emerged. There were three drafts in a series: the later versions were not complete and are often referred to as fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alistair Welchman|title=The New Schelling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9LsLVpTrEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA18|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-6942-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work ''System der Weltalter'' from 1827/8 consists of Munich lecture notes taken by [[Ernst von Lasaulx]] from Schelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|title=System der Weltalter: Münchener Vorlesung 1827/28 in einer Nachschrift von Ernst von Lasaulx|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDu9GzwrtIC&amp;pg=PR30|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Vittorio Klostermann|isbn=978-3-465-02744-7|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was at that time a student also of [[Franz von Baader]] and [[Joseph Görres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:s:ADB:Lasaulx, Ernst von]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts, which no longer exist, are assigned to the periods 1811, 1813 and 1814/5. The 1814/5 manuscript was published posthumously; copies of the other two manuscripts, made by [[Manfred Schröter]] before the destruction of the originals by bombing in [[World War II]], were published in 1946, with some of Schelling's project notes.&lt;ref name="Vassányi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miklós Vassányi|title=Anima Mundi: The Rise of the World Soul Theory in Modern German Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtfOVk5zz1YC&amp;pg=PA387|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=3 December 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-8795-9|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Schelling works in the ''Weltalter'' with and from a theological idea of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Laughland|title=Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOzHYeFPNckC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6118-4|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is influenced by the formulations of [[Jakob Boehme]], and in general the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joris Geldhof|title=Revelation, Reason and Reality: Theological Encounters With Jaspers, Schelling and Baader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PS2to13BblAC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-1929-7|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken as a Romantic theory of the ''[[anima mundi]]'', the ''Weltalter'' writings call on, at least superficially, [[mysticism]] (both Jewish and Christian) and [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Vassányi2010"/&gt;

==Philosophical formulation==
Aside from the language used, there are a number of formulations explaining the problems Schelling was tackling in the ''Weltalter'' project. According to a 2010 paper,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Schelling sat down to write the ''Ages of the World'' he had a large number of seemingly contradictory philosophical commitments to reconcile. He wanted to avoid dualism and yet acknowledge the essential and irreducible roles of both spirit and matter. He wanted to give a law-like description of the creation of the world and yet preserve divine freedom. He wanted to treat God as perfect and self-sufficient and yet also account for the motive underlying God's decision to create the world. Perhaps most paradoxically of all, he wanted to explain what events led up to the creation of the past – what ‘caused’ time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://utsa.academia.edu/AlistairWelchman/Papers/193611/Creating_the_Past_Schellings_Ages_of_the_World Alistair Welchman, Judith Norman, ''Creating the Past: Schelling's Ages of the World'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1813 draft has been called the origin of [[dialectical materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelsey Wood|title=Zizek: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HRBODii6dcC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-26982-4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Žižek]] in explaining his attitude to the ''Weltalter'' and its theosophical leanings, however, states that "there is no way of throwing out the dirty bath water without losing the baby".&lt;ref name="Žižek1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slavoj Žižek|title=The Indivisible Remainder: An Essay on Schelling and Related Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K77t2XTpSeMC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1996|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-959-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Z-Squad'' first aired in [[South Korea]] on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] between December 2006 and June 2007.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; The series was later broadcast on Champ, [[Cartoon Network (South Korea)|Cartoon Network]], Anione and KT IPTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corusent.com/news/schoolgirl-super-heroines-of-the-z-squad-poised-for-action-at-mipcom/|title=Schoolgirl Super Heroines Of The Z-Squad Poised For Action At MIPCOM|publisher=[[Nelvana Limited]] (Press release)|date=2007-09-26|accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show had its English-language debut on [[Pop Girl]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in late 2008. Along with ''[[Di-Gata Defenders]]'', ''Z-Squad'' was introduced as part of the [[Syfy Kids]] block on the multi-national [[KidsCo]] network in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kidsco-launch-syfy-kids-genre-431290|title=KidsCo to Launch Syfy Kids Genre Block In June|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2013-03-27|accessdate=2018-10-24}} “The joint venture between NBCUniversal International and Canada’s Corus Entertainment has acquired a slew of kids titles for the Syfy Kids offering, including a first-run exclusive of Zuzu &amp; the Supernuffs from Matchbox Pictures, and Nelvana Enterprises’ Di-Gata Defenders and Z-Squad series.”&lt;/ref&gt; It was also one of the shows included when [[NBC]] ported Syfy Kids to Asia the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/04/16/kidsco-sends-syfy-kids-to-asia/|title=KidsCo sends new Syfy block to Asia|last=Ng-See-Quan|first=Danielle|publisher=[[KidScreen]]|date=2013-04-16|accessdate=2018-10-24}} “The Syfy Kids block will launch with a first-run exclusive of its original production Zuzu &amp; the Supernuffs from Matchbox Pictures. It will also feature the CG-animated Matt Hatter Chronicles, produced by Platinum Films and Toronto’s Dream Mill, with animation by Arc Productions; Z-Squad, from Corus’ Nelvana Enterprises and Enemes, and the Back to the Future animated series.”&lt;/ref&gt; It was aimed at ages 6–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/08/20/kidsco-acquires-sendokai-champions/|title=KidsCo acquires Sendokai Champions|last=Rusak|first=Gary|publisher=KidScreen|date=2013-08-20|accessdate=2018-10-24}} “The fully dubbed block airs at peak viewing times and targets a kids aged 6-10. demo Key titles on the block include: Matt Hatter Chronicles, ZuZu &amp; the Supernuffs, Z-Squad, The Future is Wild, Back to the Future and The Mummy.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial plans for a [[North America]]n broadcast reportedly included [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[Teletoon]] in [[Canada]], with [[Disney Channel]] on board in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hancinema.net/-crystal-fairy-z-squad-wins-at-asian-tv-awards-11643.html|title='Crystal Fairy Z-Squad' wins at Asian TV Awards|publisher=Han Cinema|date=2007-12-05|accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show would never air on linear television in either market, instead being limited to [[video-on-demand]] platforms. In Canada, the series was included as part of the Kids Suite service for [[Rogers Cable]] customers in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogersondemand.com/OnDemand/Show/z_squad?lang=en|title=Z-Squad|publisher=RogersOnDemand.Com|accessdate=2018-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710053212/http://www.rogersondemand.com/OnDemand/Show/z_squad?lang=en|archivedate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, ''Z-Squad'' is available to purchase on [[Amazon Video]] and stream on [[Tubi TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Z-Squad/dp/B00G03QGMM|title=Amazon.com: Z-Squad|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tubitv.com/series/2408/z_squad|title=Watch Z-Squad Online for Free|publisher=[[Tubi TV]]|accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
