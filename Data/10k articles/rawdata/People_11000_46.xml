==Career==

As a journalist, d'Adesky has been a [[foreign correspondent]] in Haiti working as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]''. She wrote about [[HIV/AIDS]] for various newspapers, including the ''[[New York Native]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'', and later, magazines including ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name="amfAR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anne-Christine d'Adesky  |url=http://www.amfar.org/cgi-bin/iowa/amfar/record.html?record=27 |publisher=[[amfAR]] |accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was senior editor at ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine in the mid-1990s in charge of health coverage, and also wrote investigative features and long-form profiles. In 1998, she launched [[LPI Media|''HIV Plus'']] magazine, where she served as founding editor in chief for two years before the magazine was sold to ''The Advocate''. She then turned to writing a series on global AIDS for the newsletter of the [[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research]]. She also wrote about AIDS for magazines such as ''[[Seed (magazine)|SEED]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', newspapers such as ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', and health agencies such as the [[World Health Organization]].

In 2003 she co-produced ''Pills, Profits, Protest: Chronicle of the Global AIDS Movement,'' a documentary about global AIDS treatment activism.&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{cite web|title=Anne-Christine d'Adesky |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0194862/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an activist, d'Adesky has been active in the peace and women's movements and attended the [[Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice]], where she protested the presence of nuclear cruise missiles on US soil. She was an early member of [[ACT UP]]&lt;ref name="amfAR"/&gt; who participated in the first Wall Street protest, and other famous actions, demanding faster access to life-saving HIV medications, and later, access to HIV drugs for people living in poor countries. She also joined Get Smart, an arts activist group.

D'Adesky is one of the six founders of The [[Lesbian Avengers]], which began in New York City in 1992 as "a direct action group focused on issues vital to lesbian survival and visibility."&lt;ref name="amfar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesbianavengers.com/about/history.shtml |title=A Brief History |publisher=Lesbian Avengers |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gvh.aphdigital.org/items/show/1277 |title=Greenwich Village History &amp;#124; Lesbian Avengers' Button |publisher=Gvh.aphdigital.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=lesbian+avenger+anne-christine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFHjngVhY5&amp;sig=5JVG1_lrTOgupbog2zZ9DYVcIC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RC9OUvDxJNLh4AOXjYDYBg&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=lesbian%20avenger%20anne-christine&amp;f=false |title=Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9tWZxId01wC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=lesbian+avenger+anne-christine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sGR1yKlkNd&amp;sig=4_9Mb_EuMQd4GWt9rg7ZowzvmoQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RC9OUvDxJNLh4AOXjYDYBg&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lesbian%20avenger%20anne-christine&amp;f=false |title=Heroic Desire: Lesbian Identity and Cultural Space - Sally Munt - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw9nhW4QeywC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=lesbian+avenger+anne-christine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sVgD1Ut_5q&amp;sig=3JdoT_2yNyAbT3YRalgEahJVXxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=my9OUtqsFpi54AOG3YDYCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=lesbian%20avenger%20anne-christine&amp;f=false |title=Acts of Gaiety: LGBT Performance and the Politics of Pleasure - Sara Warner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmPfyH8rBzkC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=lesbian+avenger+anne-christine+d'adesky&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tC9OUpW6Irf54AOGmoCwDA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=lesbian%20avenger%20anne-christine%20d'adesky&amp;f=false |title=AIDS and American Apocalypticism: The Cultural Semiotics of an Epidemic - Thomas L. Long - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, d'Adesky began humanitarian work in Africa, focusing on the issue of gender-based violence linked to HIV/AIDS and the use of rape in war in East Africa. She launched and served as co-founder and co-executive director of a global initiative WE-ACTx, based in [[San Francisco]] and [[Kigali]], that  helps [[Rwanda]]n women affected by HIV/AIDS who are survivors of genocidal rape, and orphans.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; [[WE-ACTx]] has provided free, comprehensive care to thousands of HIV-positive Rwandan women and children, and is today an all-Rwandan run program operating two clinics in Kigali. D'Adesky stepped down as co-Executive Director in 2008 to become a board member.

In 2010, d'Adesky flew to [[Haiti]] in the immediate aftermath of the January 10th earthquake, where she has longtime family roots. She began reporting for [[World Pulse]] and the [[Global Post]], and launched a blog on the post-quake humanitarian response, Haiti Vox. She also founded a feminist coalition with Haitian and diaspora women activists, [[PotoFanm+Fi]] (Women and Girls Pillar, in [[Haitian Creole]]), to promote the role, needs and voice of Haitian women in the rebuilding effort. In 2011, she launched the offshoot Haiti-based group, [[PotoFi]] (Girls Pillar) and worked to document the gender  dimensions of the earthquake and its impact on adolescent girls. She released a report in 2011 with PotoFi showing the teenage Haitian girls bore a disproportionate brunt of the disaster, evidenced by a tide of unplanned, early pregnancies linked to sexual violence, and a survival-based entry into prostitution, and displacement. In 2010, she published a comprehensive review of Haiti's cross-sectorial progress fighting gender violence and rape in a book, [[Beyond Shock: Charting the Landscape of Sexual Violence in Post-Quake Haiti]], published by the UC Santa Barbara Center for Black Studies Research.

From 2013-15, d'Adesky served as the Global Coordinator for Haiti for the [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]] [["One Billion Rising"]] (OBR) worldwide campaign against sexual violence. She helped organise a major Mardi Gras Carnaval float on gender justice in 2014 and led a grassroots effort to reduce the risk of rape and assaults during this annual event, to great success. With PotoFi, she also organised forums across Haiti on sexual violence and adolescents. In 2014, she organised a historic French/Haitian Creole production of The [[Vagina Monologues]] at Haiti's Parliament in 2014, and a year later, a major outdoor feminist event that included a free production of the play in the capital that drew a crowd of 6,000 people.

D'Adesky continues to advocate and report on Haiti, sexual violence and human rights issues, with a fresh focus on [[LGBT and women's asylum /refugee issues]] for various periodicals, including [[Pride Magazine|PRIDE]] magazine. She began tracking the resurgence of the far-Right in Europe for a recently completed 90s AIDS activist memoir.

'''August Suter''' (19 July 1887 – 28 November 1965) was one of the most prominent Swiss sculptors of European stature in the first half of the 20th century. His circle of friends included important literary figures like [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[James Joyce]].

==Life==

August Suter was born at [[Basel]], the son of Johannes Suter (1857–1907) a bookbinder from [[Eptingen]] and Katharina Suter-Schaub (1859–1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eptingen.ch/02_gemeinde/museum/museum_suter.htm|title=Gemeinde Eptingen - August Suter Museum|website=www.eptingen.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an apprenticeship as a bookbinder with his father and courses in painting and drawing at the Basel Gewerbeschule (vocational school) he worked for local sculptor Carl Gutknecht (1878–1970), before he went to the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F49744.php Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse, Suter]&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon became an independent artist there and formed lifelong friendships with the writer [[Blaise Cendrars]]&lt;ref&gt;Suter had known Fred Sauser (Cendrar's real name) from the late 1890s at the Realschule in Basel.&lt;/ref&gt; and the English painter [[Frank Budgen]], who worked as a model for him.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Budgen, ''Myselves When Young'', London: 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Cendrars was later to write a successful novel (''L'Or'') about Suter’s grandfather, [[John Sutter|Johann August]] of gold rush fame. [[Rodo]] (Auguste de Niederhäusern) advised him to whole-heartedly turn to sculpture. A long-standing friend was the Swiss poet and translator [[:de:Siegfried Lang|Siegfried Lang]]. Shortly before the War he also became acquainted with the German writer and anarchist [[:de:Johannes Nohl|Johannes Nohl]]. During the [[World War I]] Suter worked in Basel and [[Zurich]], where he, his brother Paul and Frank Budgen got to know the exiled Irish writer [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;August Suter, “Some Reminiscences of James Joyce”, ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;7, No.&amp;nbsp;3, Spring, 1970, pp.&amp;nbsp;191-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suter was one of the few people who attended Joyce’s funeral in war-locked Zurich in 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; He married singer Helene Moser (1893–1965) in 1917 and had three sons. From 1921 to 1939 Suter lived in Paris again and befriended the sculptor [[Charles Despiau]], whose studio lay next to his.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gotthard Jedlicka, "Der Bildhauer August Suter" in ''Das Werk'', Band 14, 1927, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]] he worked intermittently in Paris and Basel, where he died at the age of 79 just months after his wife.

==Work==

Suter's naturalistic work is dominated by male and female nudes, figure compositions, portrait busts and architectural sculpture. In 1925 [[:de:Ludwig Marcuse Ludwig Marcuse|Ludwig Marcuse]] called him “the most important sculptor of our time”.&lt;ref&gt;''Literatur-Geschichte der Gegenwart'', vol 1, Berlin 1925, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; At first he was influenced by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Antoine Bourdelle|Bourdelle]], but turned to [[Aristide Maillol|Maillol's]] classicism in the fourth decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Gantner-Schlee, Hildegard, Leaflet of the August-Suter-Museum at Eptingen&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[:de:Gotthard Jedlicka|Gotthard Jedlicka]] points out an important difference to Rodin: "where Rodin seizes impetuously, he waits calmly, and everytime he imbeds the unique rhythm of a particular life into the specific rhythm of his composition".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Suters most famous sculpture is the memorial “Prometheus and the Soul” for the Swiss Nobel Prize poet [[Carl Spitteler]] at Liestal near Basel, which he worked on from 1926 to 1931.

An unburned clay sculpture of [[James Joyce]] did not survive World War II.&lt;ref&gt;August Suter, “Some Reminiscences of James Joyce”, ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Vol. 7, No. 3, Spring, 1970, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter’s son Claude donated his father's artistic legacy to the Basel municipality of Eptingen where it is accessible on request (museum@eptingen.ch). The  August-Suter-Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eptingen.ch/02_gemeinde/museum/museum_suter.htm|title=Gemeinde Eptingen - August Suter Museum|website=www.eptingen.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; is situated at the old schoolhouse Schulstraße 5, Eptingen.

'''Israel ben Eliezer''' (born circa 1698,&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47272/Baal-Shem-Tov Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; died 22 May 1760), known as the '''Baal Shem Tov''' ({{lang-he-n|בעל שם טוב}}, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɑː|l|_|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|m|_|ˌ|t|ʊ|v|,_|ˌ|t|ʊ|f}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Jones |first = Daniel |author-link = Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title = English Pronouncing Dictionary |editors = Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter |place = Cambridge |publisher = Cambridge University Press |orig-year = 1917 |year = 2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the '''Besht''', was a [[Jewish mystical]] [[rabbi]] considered the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt; "Besht" is the acronym for '''B'''aal '''Sh'''em '''T'''ov, which means "Master of the Good Name" or "one with a good reputation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 409, ''The Light and Fire of the Baal Shem Tov'', Yitzhak Buxbaum. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The little biographical information about the Besht comes from oral traditions handed down by his students ([[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]] and others) and from the legendary tales about his life and behavior collected in ''Shivḥei ha-Besht'' (''In Praise of the Ba'al Shem Tov''; [[Kopys|Kapust]] and [[Berdychiv]], 1814–15).&lt;ref&gt;
ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 10, pg 743, Avraham Rubinstein&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidim approach these legends with a blend of suspicion and belief. [[Rebbe]] [[Shlomo Rabinowicz]] of [[Radomsk (Hasidic dynasty)|Rodomsk]] declared, "Whoever believes all the miracle stories about the Baal Shem Tov in ''Shivhei HaBaal Shem Tov'' is a fool, but whoever denies that he could have done them is an ''[[epikoros|apikoros]]'' [a heretic]". Similarly, the Rebbe Mordechai of Neshkiz explains, "Even if a story about him never actually occurred, and there was no such miracle, it was in the power of the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing for the life of the World-to-Come, to perform everything".&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, ''The Light and Fire of the Baal Shem Tov'', by Yitzhak Buxbaum. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A central tenet in the Baal Shem Tov's teaching is the direct connection with [[the Divine | the divine]], "dvekut", which is infused in every human activity and every waking hour. Prayer is of supreme importance, along with the mystical significance of  Hebrew letters and words. His innovation lies in "encouraging worshipers to follow their distracting thoughts to their roots in the divine".&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/the-brilliance-of-the-baal-shem-tov-now-in-english-1.459443 The brilliance of the Baal Shem Tov now in English, [[Haaretz]]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Those who follow his teachings regard him as descended from the [[Davidic line]] that traces its lineage to the [[dynasty |royal house]] of [[David]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Yisroel (Israel) was born to poor parents Eliezer and Sarah in a settlement near [[Okopy, Ternopil Oblast|Okopy Świętej Trójcy]], a newly built fortress close to [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kameniec]] in [[West Ukraine]], where [[Zbruch]] connects with [[Dniester]]. Today, Okopy is a village in the [[Borschiv Raion]] &lt;small&gt;([[Raion|district]])&lt;/small&gt; of the [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] [[Oblast]].

He died in [[Medzhybizh]]&lt;ref name=je/&gt; &lt;small&gt;({{lang-uk|Меджибіж}}, {{lang-pl|Międzybóż}}, {{lang-yi|מעזשביזש}})&lt;/small&gt;, which was part of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and today is situated in the [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast|Khmelnytskyi]] [[Oblast]] ([[Ukraine]]) (not to be confused with other cities of the same name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/wumag_old/archiv/1_99/medz.htm |title=Medzhybizh |publisher=Wumag.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703, Israel became an orphan, and was adopted by the Jewish community of [[Tovste (urban-type settlement)|Tluste]] (near [[Zalischyky]]).  It is reported that, after the conclusion of his studies at the local ''[[cheder]]'' (Jewish elementary school), he would often wander into the fields and forests that surrounded the village. In 1710, he finished ''cheder'' and became an assistant to a ''[[melamed]]'' (instructor in ''cheder''). Sometime in 1712 Israel became a ''[[gabbai|shammash]]'' ([[sexton (office)|sexton]]) of the local synagogue.

He was hired as a teacher's assistant in the ''cheders'' of the small villages through which they passed. He later related that he took great pleasure in accompanying the children to and from school, using this opportunity to recite prayers with them and tell them Torah stories. The Mezritcher Maggid, the Baal Shem Tov's successor, would later say, "If only we kissed a Torah scroll with the same love that my master [the Baal Shem Tov] kissed the children when he took them to cheder as a teacher's assistant!"&lt;ref&gt;''Hayom Yom'', Tammuz 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hasidic legend, the Baal Shem Tov would have visions in which the prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Achiya Hashiloni]] would appear to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golding |first=Peretz |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1208507/jewish/Biography.htm |title=The Baal Shem Tov—A Brief Biography – Jewish History |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1716 the Baal Shem Tov married, but soon his wife died and he went on traveling throughout [[Eastern Galicia]]. After serving for a long time as helper in various small communities of [[West Ukraine]], he settled as a ''[[melamed]]'' at Tluste.

The Besht was introduced to [[Kabbalah]] by Rabbi [[Adam Baal Shem]] of [[Ropczyce]] ({{lang-yi|ראָפּשיץ}}) who was a disciple of Rabbi [[Yoel Baal Shem (I)]] of [[Zamość]] ({{lang-yi|זאמושטש}}), the successor of Rabbi [[Eliyahu Baal Shem of Worms|Eliyahu Baal Shem]] of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] ({{lang-yi|ורמיזא, ורמישא}}).&lt;ref name="ref53259096"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?sits=1&amp;req=39166&amp;st=%u05D9%u05D5%u05D0%u05DC%20%u05D1%u05E2%u05DC%20%u05E9%u05DD|title=לקוטי דבורים – חלק ג – שניאורסון, יוסף יצחק, 1880–1950 (page 39 of 405)|publisher=hebrewbooks.org|accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Besht became the leader of this movement at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req%3D39166%26st%3D%D7%99%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C+%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%9D%26pgnum%3D42%26hilite%3De38977fb-dc8d-4e65-80bb-20ee1d6178cf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140217142603/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39166&amp;st=%D7%99%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C+%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%9D&amp;pgnum=42&amp;hilite=e38977fb-dc8d-4e65-80bb-20ee1d6178cf |archivedate=2014-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caring for the Jewish poor, the group of Tzadikim encouraged Jews to move to agrarian lifestyles as alternatives to the chronic poverty of city Jews. In continuation of this policy they decided that they needed to look after the educational needs of the children living in small farm communities. If a suitable teacher could not be sourced they themselves would provide one, and therefore the Baal Shem Tov became a teacher's assistant. He later commented "The most joyous time in my life was teaching the small children how to say Modeh Ani, Shema Yisrael and Kametz Alef Ah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req%3D39166%26st%3D%D7%99%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C+%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%9D%26pgnum%3D43%26hilite%3De38977fb-dc8d-4e65-80bb-20ee1d6178cf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140217142542/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39166&amp;st=%D7%99%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C+%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%9D&amp;pgnum=43&amp;hilite=e38977fb-dc8d-4e65-80bb-20ee1d6178cf |archivedate=2014-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chosen by people conducting suits against each other to act as their [[Arbitral tribunal|arbitrator]] and [[Mediation|mediator]]. His services were brought into frequent requisition because the Jews had their own [[Private law|civil courts]] in Poland.  He is said to have made such an impression on [[Ephraim of Brody|Ephraim]] of [[Brody]] that the latter promised the Besht his daughter Chana in marriage. The man died, however, without telling his daughter of her betrothal; but when she heard of her father's wishes, she agreed to comply with them.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

After their marriage the couple moved to a village in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] between [[Kuty]] and [[Kosiv|Kassowa]],&lt;ref name=je/&gt;  where their only income was from his work digging [[clay]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]], which his wife delivered to surrounding villages.  The couple had two children: Udl (born in 1720) and Zvi Hersh.

===Leadership===
[[File:Besht Siddur.jpg|thumb|The Baal Shem Tov's personal Siddur (now in [[Chabad library]] archive #1994)]]
The Besht later took a position as a [[shohet]] (ritual butcher) in [[Kshilowice]], near [[Yazlovets|Iaslowice]], which he soon gave up in order to manage a village tavern that his brother-in-law bought for him. During the many years that he lived in the woods and came into contact with the peasants, he had learned how to use plants for healing purposes. In fact, his first appearance in public was that of an  “ordinary” [[Baal Shem]]. He wrote [[amulet]]s and prescribed cures.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

After many trips in [[Podolia]] and [[Volhynia]] as a Baal Shem, Besht, considering his following large enough and his authority established, decided about 1740 to expound his teachings in the [[shtetl]] of [[Medzhybizh]] and people, mostly from the spiritual elite, came to listen to him. Medzhybizh became the seat of the movement and of the [[Mezhbizh (Hasidic dynasty)|Medzybizh]] Hasidic dynasty. His following gradually increased, and with it the hostility of the Talmudists. Nevertheless, Besht was supported at the beginning of his career by two prominent Talmudists, the brothers Meïr ([[Chief Rabbi|chief rabbi]] of [[Lemberg]] and later [[Ostroh]]a, and author of ''Meir Netivim'' (a work of halachic responsa) and other works) and Isaac Dov Margalios. Later he won over recognized rabbinic authorities who became his disciples and attested to his scholarship. These include Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne|Yaakov Yosef Hakohen]], rabbi of [[Polonne|Polnoy]]; Rabbi Dovid Halperin, rabbi of Ostroha; Rabbi Israel of [[Sataniv|Satinov]], author of ''Tiferet Yisrael''; Rabbi Yoseph Heilperin of Slosowitz; and  Rabbi [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Dov Ber of Mezrich]] (AKA the ''Maggid of Mezritch''). It is chiefly due to the later that Besht's doctrines (though in an essentially altered form) were introduced into learned Jewish religious circles.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Israel undertook journeys in which he is recorded as effecting  cures, and expelling demons and evil spirits (shaydim).  Later Hasidic tradition, however, downplayed the importance of these healing and magical practices, concentrating on his teachings, his charm, magnetism, and ecstatic personality.&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 10, pg 744, Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past few years, the "Agudas Ohalei Tzadikim"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otzadikim.com/AboutUs.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430214832/http://www.otzadikim.com/AboutUs.aspx |archivedate=2009-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; organization (based in Israel) has restored many graves of [[Tzadikim]] ([[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]]im) in Ukraine, including the Baal Shem Tov's. A guesthouse and synagogue are located next to the [[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Baal Shem Tov, and the Baal Shem Tov's synagogue in the village proper has been painstakingly restored. Both synagogues are used by the many visitors from all over the world who come to pray near the Baal Shem Tov's grave.

===Disputes with the Frankists ===
The Besht took sides with the Talmudists in their disputes against the Frankists ([[Jacob Frank]]'s cultist movement which regarded Frank as the [[Messiah]], modeled after [[Sabbatai Zevi]].) After the mass conversion of the Frankists, the Baal Shem Tov allegedly said that as long as a diseased limb is connected with the body, there is hope that it may be saved; but, once amputated, it is gone, and there is no hope.&lt;ref&gt;The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader, Immanuel Etke, UPNE, 2012 - Biography &amp; Autobiography, pg 95&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that he died out of grief that the Frankists left Judaism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macijeko |first=Pawel |date=2011 |title=The Mixed Multitude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Israel ben Eliezer left no books; for the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] commentary on Psalm 107, ascribed to him ([[Zhytomyr|Zhitomir]], 1804), ''Sefer mi-Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem-tov,'' may not be genuine. Therefore, the most reliable record of his teachings is in his utterances as recorded in the works of his disciples ([[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]). Most are found in the works of Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polnoy. But since Hasidism, immediately after the death of its founder, was divided into various parties, each claiming for itself the authority of Besht, the utmost of caution is necessary in judging as to the authenticity of utterances ascribed to Besht.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

[[File:Besht Shul1 Medzhibozh.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the Baal Shem Tov's synagogue in Medzhybizh, circa 1915. This shul no longer exists, having been destroyed by the Nazis. However, an exact replica was erected on its original site as a museum.]]
Some direct historical evidence remains of the Besht during the days he lived in Medzhybizh. Rosman discovered numerous legal documents that shed light on this period from the Polish [[Czartoryski family|Czartoryski]] [[Szlachta|noble family]] archives. The Besht's house is mentioned on several tax registers where it is recorded as having tax-free status. Several of the Besht's colleagues in his stories from Shivhei HaBesht also appear in Polish court records, notably, [[Ze'ev Wolf Kitzes]] and Dovid Purkes. Rosman contends that the Polish documents show the Besht and his followers were not outcasts or pariahs, but rather a respected part of  mainstream Jewish communal life.

Other [[direct evidence]] includes the Besht's daily prayer-book ([[siddur]], owned by the Agudas Chabad Library in New York) with his handwritten personal notes in the margins. His grave can be seen today in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh.

Chapin and Weinstock contend that the Besht was essentially the right person, in the right place, at the right time. 18th century [[Podolia]] was an ideal place to foster a sea-change in Jewish thinking. It had been depopulated one generation earlier due to the [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky|Khmelnitsky]] Massacres. A Turkish occupation of Podolia occurred within the Besht's lifetime and along with it the influence within this frontier territory of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] and his latter day spiritual descendants such as Malach and [[Jacob Frank]]. Once the Polish Magnates regained control from the Turks, Podolia went through an economic boom. The Magnates were benevolent to the economic benefits the Jews provided, and encouraged Jewish resettlement to help protect the frontier from future invasions. Thus, the Jewish community itself was essentially starting over. Within this context, the Jews of Podolia were open to new ideas. The Besht's refreshing new approaches to Judaism were welcome, expanding with little resistance in a community hungry for change.

==Practices==
The Besht was a mystic who claimed to have achieved ''[[devekut]]'' (“adhesion”), meaning that his soul had reached the high level where he could speak with the Messiah, and intervene between humans and God. He had the ability to protect the Jewish community from plague and persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities, Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 59&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a letter from the Besht's brother-in-law to the Besht himself—as interpreted by [[:pl:Moshe_Rosman|Moshe Rosman]]—the latter was a practitioner of prophecy, being able to see a messianic figure arrive in Jerusalem despite living far from the city; the brother-in-law claims to have inquired into the figure and discovered the Besht's vision to be true. This claim also supports the supposed belief that the Besht had the ability to see the souls of men, divining the messianic quality of the man despite only seeing him through a vision. Rosman also describes another letter written by the brother-in-law which claims that the Besht could travel to heaven and commune with God. This view is derived from a series of titles given to the Besht, attributing various religious achievements unto him such as understanding the mysteries of God. Similarly, Rosman—though now citing the writings of a Polish rabbi—says that it was believed the Besht was a great medical practitioner with vast knowledge regarding salves, balms, and similar medicants. Some aspects of his medical practice are said to have been mystic in nature, though the degree to which this is the case is not agreed upon. Some claim that the Besht could only heal others through prayer and similar acts: recitation of holy words. In other works, he is said to have less limitations on his supposed ability, allowing for more mystic methods to be practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44962956|title=Founder of Hasidism : a quest for the historical Ba'al Shem Tov|last=Jay.|first=Rosman, Murray|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520916760|location=Berkeley|oclc=44962956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core doctrines==
[[File:Besht well 2006.JPG|thumb|A well outside [[Medzhybizh]] thought to be hand-dug by the Baal Shem Tov that still contains fresh water.]]
Although the teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov derive to some extent from the Kabbalah and frequently employ kabbalistic terminology, he added an emphasis on personal existence and the salvation of the soul of the individual, as a requirement for the redemption of the world: “For before one prays for general redemption one must pray for the personal salvation of one’s own soul” (''Toledot Ya’akov Yosef'').  He emphasised the personal against a previous preoccupation on messianism.  In a letter to Abraham Gershon (dated 1751),  he describes his dialogue with the Messiah during a spiritual ascent on Rosh Ha-Shanah, 1747: “I asked the Messiah, ‘When will you come, master,’ and he answered me, ‘When your learning will be made known and revealed to the world and its source will spread and all can recite yiḥudim and experience spiritual ascent as you can…’ and I was astonished and deeply grieved by this, and wondered when this would come to pass” (''Ben Porat Yosef'').

At the core of the Besht's teaching is the principle of ''devekut'', and he demanded that ''devekut'' exist in all daily acts and in social contacts. Man must worship God not only when practicing religious acts and holy deeds, but also in his daily affairs, in his business, and in social contacts, for when a “man is occupied with material needs, and his thought cleaves to God, he will be blessed” (''Ketonet Passim'' (1866), 28a).  This belief is linked with the Lurianic doctrine of the raising of the holy sparks (niẓoẓot), though he limited this concept to the salvation of the individual soul.  Because of his emphasis on ''devekut'', he did not advocate withdrawal from daily life and society, and he  vigorously opposed fasts and asceticism.

He believed that physical pleasure can give rise to spiritual pleasure.  A physical act can become a religious act if it is performed as worship of God and the act is performed in a state of ''devekut''.

The study of Torah is of prime importance in his teachings, although he  interpreted the traditional ideal of “Torah for its own sake” as “for the sake of the letter.”  Through contemplation of the letters of the text man can open the divine worlds before him.  He based this belief on the assumption that the letters of the Torah evolved and descended from a heavenly source, and therefore by contemplating the letters, one can restore them to their spiritual, and divine source. The student thus becomes joined to their higher forms and receives mystical revelations.

Similarly, through prayer, a man can reach ''devekut'' and contact with the divine, by concentrating on the mystical meaning of the letters:
:According to what I learned from my master and teacher, the main occupation of Torah and prayer is that one should attach oneself to the spirituality of the light of the Ein Sof found in the letters of the Torah and prayer, which is called study for its own sake&lt;ref&gt;''Toledot Ya’akov Yosef'', p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Besht's concept of the [[zaddik]] is of the existence of superior individuals whose spiritual qualities are greater than those of other human beings and who are outstanding in their higher level of ''devekut''. These individuals influence society, and their task is to teach the people to worship God by means of ''devekut'' and to lead sinners to repent.&lt;ref name=ENCYCLOPAEDIAJUDAICA746&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 10, pg 746, Avraham Rubinstein&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Hasidism==
[[File:BaalShemMatzeivoh.JPG|thumb|250px|Gravestone of the Baal Shem Tov in Medzhybizh (before restoration in 2006–2008) bearing the inscription רבי ישראל בעל שם טוב]]
The later developments of Hasidism are unintelligible without consideration of Besht's opinion concerning man's proper relation with the universe. True worship of God, consists in the cleaving to, and the unification with, God. To use his own words, “the ideal of man is to be a revelation himself, clearly to recognize himself as a manifestation of God.” Mysticism, he said, is not the Kabbalah, which everyone may learn; but that sense of true oneness, which is usually as strange, unintelligible, and incomprehensible to mankind as dancing is to a dove. However, the man who is capable of this feeling is endowed with a genuine intuition, and it is the perception of such a man which is called prophecy, according to the degree of his insight. From this it results, in the first place, that the ideal man may lay claim to authority equal, in a certain sense, to the authority of the Prophets.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; This focus on oneness and personal revelation helps earn his mystical interpretation of Judaism the title of [[panentheism|Panentheism]].

A second and more important result of the doctrine is that through his oneness with God, man forms a connecting link between the Creator and creation. Thus, slightly modifying the Bible verse, [[Hab.]] {{bibleverse-nb|hab|2:4|JPS}}, Besht said, “The righteous can vivify by his faith.“ Besht's followers enlarged upon this idea and consistently deduced from it the source of divine mercy, of blessings, of life; and that therefore, if one love him, one may partake of God's mercy.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

On the opposite side of the coin, the Baal Shem Tov warned the Hasidim:
:[[Amalek]] is still alive today … Every time you experience a worry or doubt about how God is running the world—that’s Amalek launching an attack against your soul. We must wipe Amalek out of our hearts whenever—and wherever—he attacks so that we can serve God with complete joy.

It may be said of Hasidism that there is no other Jewish sect in which the founder is as important as his doctrines. Besht himself is still the real center for the Hasidim; his teachings have almost sunk into oblivion. As [[Solomon Schechter|Schechter]] (“''Studies in Judaism'',” p.&amp;nbsp;4) observes: “To the Hasidim, Baal-Shem [Besht] ... was the incarnation of a theory, and his whole life the revelation of a system.”&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

==Teaching methods==
Besht did not combat  [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinical Judaism]], but the spirit of its practice. His teachings being the result of a deep, religious temperament, he stressed the  spirit. Though he considered the Law to be holy and inviolable, and he emphasized the importance of Torah-study, he held that one's entire life should be a service of God.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; Hasidic legend tells of a woman whom her relatives sought to kill on account of her shameful life, but who was saved in body and soul by Besht. The story is said to be characteristic of Besht's activity in healing those in need of relief. More important to him than prayer was a friendly relationship with sinners. Unselfishness and high-minded benevolence are a motif in the legends about him.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Besht's methods of teaching differed from those of his opponents. He directed many satirical remarks at them, a characteristic one being his designation of the typical Talmudist of his day as “a man who through sheer study of the Law has no time to think about God”. Besht is reported to have illustrated his views of asceticism by the following parable:
:A thief once tried to break into a house, the owner of which, crying out, frightened the thief away. The same thief soon afterward broke into the house of a very strong man, who, on seeing him enter, kept quite still. When the thief had come near enough, the man caught him and put him in prison, thus depriving him of all opportunity to do further harm.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Besht held a firm conviction that God had entrusted him with a special mission to spread his doctrines. He believed that he had heavenly visions revealing this mission to him. For him every intuition was a [[Revelation|divine revelation]]; and divine messages were daily occurrences.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; An example of the power of his spiritual vision is found in the beginning of his grandson's work, ''Degel'', where he writes that his grandfather wrote to [[Abraham Gershon of Kitov|Gershon Kitover]] who lived in Israel, asking him why he was not in Israel that particular [[wikt:Shabbos|Shabbos]].

==Legends==
[[File:Besht Tax List 1758.jpg|thumb|150px|1758 Polish tax census of Medzhybizh showing "Baal Shem" as occupying house #95]]
In Hasidic tradition, there's a saying, “Someone who believes in all the stories of the Baal Shem Tov and the other mystics and holy men is a fool; someone who looks at any single story and says “That one could not be true” is a heretic.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meaningfullife.com/torah/concepts/Miracles/Miracles_-_with_Ken_Woodward.php |title=Meaningful Life Center |publisher=Meaningfullife.com |date=2000-07-23 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' the number of legends that are told relating to the  Ba’al Shem Tov have 'distorted his historical character.'&lt;ref name=ENCYCLOPAEDIAJUDAICA746/&gt;  An anthology of legends about him was first compiled by [[Dov ben Samuel Baer|Dov Baer b. Samuel]] of [[Illintsi|Linits]], who was the son-in-law of Alexander Shoḥat, who had acted for several years as the Besht's scribe. The collection was copied many times and over time it became filled with errors.  It was printed with the title, ''Shivḥei ha-Besht'' after Dov Baer's death.  It was published by Israel Jaffe who rewrote the first chapter, and removed what he considered to be the distortions caused by copyists.

This edition, printed in Kopys (Kapust) in 1814, contains 230 stories grouped by common themes, characters, and motifs.  Two editions also appeared in Yiddish that differ markedly from the Hebrew edition.

In the 19th century several further collections of legends about the Ba’al Shem Tov, and his followers appeared, in Hebrew and Yiddish, some of which repeated stories found in ''Shivḥei ha-Besht'' and some of which contained new stories.  According to the ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' only a few of these stories can actually be regarded as true.&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 10, pg 747, Avraham Rubinstein&lt;/ref&gt;

One legend tells that his father, Eliezer, was seized during an attack, carried from his home in [[Wallachia]], and sold as a slave to a prince. On account of his wisdom, he found favor with the prince, who gave him to the king to be his minister. During an expedition undertaken by the king, when other counsel failed, and all were disheartened, Eliezer's advice was accepted; and the result was a successful battle of decisive importance. Eliezer was made a [[General officer|general]] and afterward [[prime minister]], and the king gave him the daughter of the viceroy  in marriage. But, being mindful of his duty as a Jew and as he was already married, he married the princess only in name. After being questioned for a long time as to his strange conduct, he confessed to the princess that he was a Jew, who loaded him with costly presents and helped him escape to his own country.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

On the way, the prophet [[Elijah]] is said to have appeared to Eliezer and said: “On account of thy piety and steadfastness, thou wilt have a son who will lighten the eyes of all Israel; and Israel shall be his name, because in him shall be fulfilled the verse ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb|isaiah|49:3|JPS}}): ’Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’” Eliezer and his wife Sarah, however, reached old age childless and had given up all hope of ever having a child. But when they were nearly a hundred years old, the promised son (Besht) was born.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=BA'AL SHEM-ṬOB, ISRAEL B. ELIEZER|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2252-ba-al-shem-tob-israel-b-eliezer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheryl Perera''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Children's rights movement|children's rights activist]]. As a teenager, she founded '''OneChild''', a [[non-governmental organization]] which seeks to eliminate the [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] abroad. For her work, and in particular her achievements at a young age, Perera has received several accolades.

==Advocacy==
Perera first became involved in children's rights advocacy work after researching child sexual exploitation and [[sex tourism]] in [[Thailand]] for a high school class project.&lt;ref name=generationnext/&gt;&lt;ref name=samaritanmag&gt;{{cite web|website=SamaritanMag|url=http://www.samaritanmag.com/936/cheryl-perera%E2%80%99s-onechild-seeks-break-chains-child-sex-slavery|last=McLean|first=Steve|date=6 December 2011|title=Cheryl Perera's OneChild Seeks To Break The Chains Of Child Sex Slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, at 17, she took three-and-a-half months off from school to continue her research in her parents' home country, [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=generationnext/&gt;&lt;ref name=samaritanmag/&gt;&lt;ref name=one80&gt;{{cite web|website=One80|title=Innocence Lost|url=http://www.oneeighty.ca/newspaper/departments/justice/article.php?id=19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190944/http://www.oneeighty.ca/newspaper/departments/justice/article.php?id=19|archive-date=24 July 2011|last=Basit|first=Tasnia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shocked at the ease with which children could be exploited, she met with a Sri Lankan Presidential Advisor and the National Child Protection Authority to discuss the problems she saw.&lt;ref name=one80/&gt;&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{cite web|website=Canada.com|date=4 January 2008|title=Global National's Everyday Hero|url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/features/everyday_hero/story.html?id=c30f6073-691e-45d1-9727-7b14fed51331|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064155/http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/features/everyday_hero/story.html?id=c30f6073-691e-45d1-9727-7b14fed51331#|archive-date=2015-11-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meeting led her to serve as bait herself in a sting operation to catch a sexual predator.&lt;ref name=generationnext&gt;{{cite web|website=South Asian GenerationNext|date=11 November 2009|title=He is not going to hurt another child:Cheryl Perera – Founder and President of One Child|url=http://www.sagennext.com/2009/11/11/he-is-not-going-to-hurt-another-childcheryl-perera-founder-and-president-of-one-child/|last=Singh|first=Manjeet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite web|website=Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/giving/giving-news/starting-a-charity-at-8-meet-the-generation-taking-action/article2289201/|last=MacDonald|first=Gayle|title=Starting a charity at 8? Meet the generation taking action|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perera met with a man who had posted a solicitation for a 15-year-old girl on the Internet. After leading him to talk about his intentions on tape, they went to a nearby hotel where police were waiting to make the arrest.&lt;ref name=dailynews&gt;{{cite web|website=Daily News|title=Agony of the stars|date=5 June 2008|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2008/06/05/fea08.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Canada, Perera founded OneChild, a youth-driven and youth-run [[non-profit organization]], in 2005.&lt;ref name=samaritanmag/&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/Article/179191|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926121149/http://www.thestar.com/Article/179191|archive-date=26 September 2012|date=7 February 2007|title=Rescued sex worker 'an inspiration'|last=Weiss|first=Jordana}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was successful in lobbying the Canadian Tourism Board and the travel industry to take measures against child sexual tourism abroad, like showing a video about child sex tourism on some [[Air Canada]] flights.&lt;ref name=canada/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt;

Perera has taken her advocacy to several countries struggling with [[sex tourism]] and [[human trafficking]]. In 2006 she went with a group to the [[Philippines]] to meet with the People's Recovery, Empowerment and Development Assistance Foundation (PREDA), an organization which provides support for former sex workers, and to provide monetary support for the creation of a rehabilitation center for rescued children.&lt;ref name=one80/&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt; In 2010 she traveled to [[Pattaya, Thailand]] and other sex tourism destinations in Thailand and Southeast Asia, meeting with agencies to learn more about local issues, efforts, and where help is needed.&lt;ref name=utoronto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.utoronto.ca/all-about-alumni/katie-palmer-onechild-protecting-youth-from-sex-tourism/|date=2011|title=Warnings from the Red-Light Districts|website=UofTMagazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her activism and role in the law enforcement operation, Perera was given the title "President's Nominee on Child Protection", a permanent placement in the Presidential Secretariat.&lt;ref name=one80/&gt; Perera has been recognized as one of "Canada's Top 20 Under 20",&lt;ref name=top20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcanada.com/news_190.htm|title=Two of Canada's Top 20 Under 20 award recipients talk to school children  in Toronto on Thursday, May 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the 2005 Impact Entrepreneur of the Year award,&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impact.org/page.php?id=46|title=Impact - Awards|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630093521/http://www.impact.org/page.php?id=46|archive-date=30 June 2007|website=Impact}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named a BRICK Award Winner in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/do-something-brick-awards-winner-cheryl-perera.htm |title=BRICK Award Winner: Cheryl Perera|website=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4560">'''Child-Friendly Constituency''' (CFC) is an initiative to promote and strengthen child-sensitive public delivery systems in the [[India|Indian]] state of [[Odisha]]. This initiative was launched by [[Naveen Patnaik]], the Chief Minister of Odisha in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odishachannel.com/index.php/2807/naveen-patnaik-bats-for-child-rights/ Naveen Patnaik bats for Child Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; The first ever CFC on the ground, as a pilot, was launched in Khandapada in 2015 by [[Unicef]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicef.in/PressReleases/409/First-ever-Child-Friendly-Constituency-initiative-launched-in-Odisha UNICEF(2015) First ever ‘Child Friendly Constituency’ initiative launched in Odisha]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with [[Kalinga Kusum Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://kalingakusum.org/child-friendly-constituency.php Kalinga Kusum Initiative on Child Friendly Constituency]&lt;/ref&gt;. This is an [[Member of Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] led initiative. [[Khandapada]] MLA [[Anubhav Patnaik]] is leading the initiative. 

==Objective==
CFC has been designed to ensure that children’s four-fold rights, 1. Right to Survival, 2. Right to Development, 3. Right to Protection and Right to Participation are respected. This can only be done in collaboration with government and political leaders to effectively implement policies and schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odishawatch.in/children-participated-child-friendly-constituency-khadapada/ Children participated in ‘child-friendly constituency’ in Khandapada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the Initiative==
Five Government-sponsored child development programmes have been prioritized for this initiative. The five priorities are i) a reduction of neonatal deaths, ii) reduction of stunting, iii) reduction of open defecation, iv) enrollment of all children in school and learning institutes and v) protection of children from violence and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/child-friendly-constituency-drive-launched.html Child-Friendly Constituency Drive Launched]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khandapada Experience==
This is world’s one of such project which focuses on empowering children by sensitizing all stakeholders including parents, teachers, law enforcement, local government officials and elected public representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiaeducationdiary.in/child-friendly-constituency-kalinga-kusum-capacity-development-khandapada-odisha/ Child-Friendly Constituency: Kalinga Kusum does capacity development in Khandapada, Odisha]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the project, 126 children, and adolescent collectives have been formed in 40 panchayats and one urban local body of the Khandapada Assembly constituency. 40 GPRPs have been trained to create child clubs, disseminate information and train parents in [[child rights]]. These have become catalysts to ensure facilitation of child rights. They now plan to constitute child and adolescent organizations in all the 316 villages of the [[Khandapada (Odisha Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Khandapada]] Assembly constituency. Some representatives of these organizations of children and adolescents officially participated in special ‘[[Gram sabha|gram sabha]]’ meetings organized on 2 October 2016, the [[Gandhi Jayanti]] day.

'''David Alan''' "'''Kid'''" '''Jensen''' (born 4 July 1950) is a Canadian-born British [[radio DJ]].

==Early career==
Born into a [[Danish people|Danish]] family residing in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Jensen began his career in his home country at the age of sixteen playing jazz and classical music. He then joined [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] at the age of eighteen in November 1968, joining Paul Kay, [[Paul Burnett]], [[Noel Edmonds]] and Tony Prince as the resident DJ team.  His recruitment was part of the "all-live" initiative, bringing to an end most of the pre-recorded shows.

His initial slot was 1{{nbsp}}am to 3{{nbsp}}am Monday to Thursday, and 7{{nbsp}}pm to 9{{nbsp}}pm Sunday evenings, but was quickly promoted at the start of 1969 to an earlier slot, mostly starting at 9{{nbsp}}pm.  Being only 18 years old, Paul Burnett affectionately called him the "kid" and the name "Kid" Jensen was being widely used in newspaper listings by February 1969.  From May 1970 he presented a popular progressive rock show, typically broadcast at midnight or 1{{nbsp}}am, later billed as "Dimensions" which resulted in a big increase in listeners to this slot.

By 1974, Jensen was becoming a TV personality in Britain, hosting pop shows on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and in the mid-1970s he worked for the then-new [[Radio Trent]] (now [[Capital East Midlands]]) in [[Nottingham]], one of the first legal, land-based commercial radio stations in the UK. During the early part of his career he was billed as "Kid Jensen" and did not use his given name professionally until 1980.

==Broadcasting career==

===BBC Radio 1===
In 1976 he joined the BBC's pop network, [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], initially hosting a Saturday morning show from 10{{nbsp}}am to midday, but sitting in for many other DJs, and eventually graduating to a weekday late afternoon/early evening show in the spring of 1978 from 4:30 to 7:00{{nbsp}}pm. He kept his profile high through regular appearances presenting ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and championed many acts who went on to achieve huge commercial success, notably [[The Police]] and [[Gary Numan]].

In September 1980, Jensen left the BBC to work for the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|WTBS cable superstation]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] where he was host of the 10:00{{nbsp}}pm nightly news, but he returned a year later, presenting the Radio 1 weekday evening show from 8{{snd}}10{{nbsp}}pm; later extended to run from 7{{snd}}10{{nbsp}}pm. Soon afterwards he dropped the "Kid" name, although he would still be popularly known by it for many years to come. His mid-evening show was dominated by indie-rock, but also featured interviews with mainstream acts such as [[Duran Duran]], and was the first show to champion [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], before their commercial success. He remained a regular ''Top of the Pops'' presenter and struck up a famous partnership with [[John Peel]]. He also wrote a pop column for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.

'''Douglas James Kershaw''' (born January 24, 1936&lt;ref name="fiddle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCall-p263" /&gt;) is an American [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] player, singer and songwriter from [[Louisiana]]. Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo [[Rusty and Doug]], along with his brother, [[Rusty Kershaw]]. He had an extensive solo career that included fifteen albums and singles that charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. He is also a member of the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]], being inducted in 2009.

== Early life ==
Born in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]], Kershaw did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments.&lt;ref name = "CMT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |title=Doug Kershaw Bio |publisher=Cmt.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.&lt;ref name="LouisianaRocks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aswell|first1=Tom|title=Louisiana Rocks!: The True Genesis of Rock and Roll|date=2013|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455607839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSHTGsnI8skC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22Bucket+of+Blood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiproSWmunVAhWBJCYKHSlEBi8Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Doug%20Kershaw%22%20%2B%20%22Bucket%20of%20Blood%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family's [[houseboat]] in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.

=="Doug and Rusty"==
Doug grew up surrounded by [[Cajun music|Cajun]] fiddle and [[accordion]] music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson "Peewee" Kershaw in 1948.&lt;ref name="LouisianaRocks"/&gt; With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, [[Rusty &amp; Doug]] continued to perform as a duo. In 1955, when Kershaw was nineteen, he and Rusty performed on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' [[KWKH]] radio broadcast in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana.&lt;ref name="Stabler-p233"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|edition=3rd|page=233|isbn=978-0312264871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also performed at the WWVA Jamboree (later renamed [[Jamboree U.S.A.]]), in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dregni|first1=Michael|title=Rockabilly: The Twang Heard 'Round the World: The Illustrated History|date=2011|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9780760340622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06VWZ69WBAEC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22WWVA+jamboree%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj14ozNm-nVAhVLMSYKHUZhCKMQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Doug%20Kershaw%22%20%2B%20%22WWVA%20jamboree%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the brothers initially sang in French, [[J. D. "Jay" Miller]], owner of the [[Feature Records]] label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, "So Lovely, Baby." Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become cast members of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' cast. The Kershaws appeared at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.&lt;ref name = "CMT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in [[McNeese State University]], in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], where he earned an [[undergraduate degree]] in Mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.&lt;ref name="LouisianaRocks"/&gt;

== "Louisiana Man" and solo career ==
After fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded "[[Louisiana Man]]", an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies but over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music.&lt;ref name="Woodstra-p255"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodstra|first=Chris|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings|publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=1st|year=1997|page=255|isbn=978-0879304751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was eventually [[cover version|covered]] by more than 800 artists.

There were three albums released by the duo on [[Hickory Records]], only one being released before they split up. The first was ''Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man'' (LPM 103) in 1961. ''Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)'' (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. ''Louisiana Man'' (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. It took another three years before Kershaw signed a songwriters' contract with BMI, in 1967.

In June 1969, Kershaw made his first network television appearance on the debut of the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash Show]]''.&lt;ref name="LouisianaRocks"/&gt; He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City's [[Fillmore East]] as opening act for [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Derek and the Dominos]]. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early '60s with his brother, Rusty. "Louisiana Man" had been a Top 10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, "Diggy Liggy Lo", had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to [[Warner Bros. Records]] signing him to a long-term contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard De La Font Agency, Inc: Doug Kershaw|url=http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/doug-kershaw.htm|publisher=Delafont.com|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1969, he performed at the Newport folk festival with peers Joni Mitchell, Arlo Guthrie, Ramblin Jack Elliott, Big Mama Thornton, and Mimi Fariña, among others. Newcomers that year were Don McLean, James Taylor, and Jerry Jeff Walker. In November 1969, "Louisiana Man"  was broadcast back to earth by the crew of the [[Apollo 12]] moon mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Born on the Bayou: Exploring Louisiana in 18 Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/born-on-the-bayou-exploring-louisiana-in-18-songs-20120611|accessdate=21 August 2017|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the southern venues, Kershaw became widely known in mainstream America as he played at major urban concert halls.

In 1970, Kershaw contributed a violin part to Arlo Guthrie's [[Single (music)|record single]] Alice's Rock and Roll Restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Arlo-Guthrie-Alices-Rock-And-Roll-Restaurant-Ring-Around-A-Rosy-Rag/release/2544222 |title=Arlo Guthrie - Alice's Rock And Roll Restaurant / Ring-Around-A-Rosy Rag (Vinyl) |publisher=[[Discogs]] |date= |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Kershaw had a musical cameo in the [[Western (genre)|Western film]] ''[[Zachariah (1971 film)|Zachariah]]'', starring [[Don Johnson]] and [[John Rubinstein]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Kershaw played electric fiddle in Grand Funk's "Flight of the Phoenix" off their LP Phoenix. Capitol SMAS 11099&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Grand-Funk-Phoenix/release/1441635 |title=Grand Funk* - Phoenix (Vinyl, LP, Album) |publisher=[[Discogs]] |date= |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==

Despite the success of his solo career, Kershaw was plagued by depression and [[sadness|sorrow]]. His father had committed suicide when he was only seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Tanya|title=100 Ways to Beat the Blues: An Uplifting Book for Anyone Who's Down|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439106020|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6REhl5DWDwwC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+suicide&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B6SCcDBHzH&amp;sig=mfOcgzoV-x1mWw_Sgu8jsnAqLJM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiurNDwqOnVAhXJLSYKHSAUA3YQ6AEIVTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Doug%20Kershaw%22%20%2B%20suicide&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marrying his wife, Pam, at the [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]] on June 21, 1975, Kershaw began raising his own family that included five sons – Douglas, Victor, Zachary, Tyler, and Elijah; and two grandsons and a granddaughter. His son, Tyler, plays drums in his band as well as manages his shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doug Kershaw and Steve Riley|url=http://fqfi.org/frenchquarter/artists/detail/674/Doug-Kershaw-and-Steve-Riley|accessdate=21 August 2017|publisher=French Quarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kershaw rebounded with his biggest selling hit, "Hello Woman", which reached the country music Top 40. By 1984, Kershaw's battle with [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol abuse]] came to a close and his previously erratic behavior changed for the better.&lt;ref name="CMT"/&gt;

In 1988, he recorded a duet, "Cajun Baby", with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]],&lt;ref name="LouisianaRocks"/&gt; that became a Top 50 country hit. Kershaw released a French-language album, ''Two Step Fever'', in 1999, and Michael Doucet of Beausoleil is featured on the duet "Fievre De Deux Etapes". ''Hot Diggity Doug'' was released in mid-2000 and ''Still Cajun After All These Years'' followed in early 2001.  His brother Rusty died on October 23, 2001.&lt;ref name="cmt-rusty"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Edward|title=CMT: Rusty Kershaw, of Rusty &amp; Doug, Dead at 63|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1450284/rusty-kershaw-of-rusty-doug-dead-at-63.jhtml|publisher=Cmt.com|date=October 23, 2001|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw formerly owned and operated The Bayou House, a restaurant in Lucerne, Colorado, but parted ways with his partners in 2007 due to his displeasure with management and ambiance.&lt;ref name="greeley"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kyle|last=Haas|url=http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20080528/BUSINESS/642059053|title=Bayou House closes its doors|publisher=Greeley Tribune|date=May 28, 2008|accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Doug was inducted into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=D.L.

== Notes ==
:1.{{note|a}} This recording of "Louisiana Sun" dates from the 1960's, and likely features an uncredited [[Rusty Kershaw]].
:2.{{note|b}} Promo copies exist with a re-recording of the song as "Don't Mess With My Popeye's", done specially for the fast food chain.

'''''Duce''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈduːtʃe}}, "leader") is an [[Italian language|Italian]] title, derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[dux]]'', and [[cognate]] with ''[[duke]]''. [[National Fascist Party]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was identified by Fascists as ''Il Duce'' ("The [[Supreme leader|Leader]]") of the movement. In 1925 it became a reference to the [[dictator]]ial position of ''Sua Eccellenza Benito Mussolini, Capo del Governo, Duce del Fascismo e Fondatore dell'Impero'' ("''His Excellency Benito Mussolini, Head of Government, Leader of Fascism and Founder of the Empire''").&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:Mussoliniposter.jpg|Image Description: Propaganda poster of Benito Mussolini, with caption "His Excellency Benito Mussolini, Head of Government, Leader of Fascism, and Founder of the Empire&amp;nbsp;...".]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini held this title together with that of [[President of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|President of the Council of Ministers]]: this was the constitutional position which entitled him to rule Italy on behalf of the [[King of Italy]]. ''Founder of the Empire'' was added for the exclusive use by Mussolini in recognition of his founding of an official legal entity of the [[Italian Empire]] on behalf of the King in 1936 following Italy's victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. The position was held by Mussolini until 1943, when he was [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|removed from office by the King]] and the position of "Duce" was dismantled, while [[Marshal of Italy|Marshal]] [[Pietro Badoglio, 1st Duke of Addis Abeba|The 1st Duke of Addis Abeba]] was appointed ''Presidente del Consiglio''.

This position was the model which other [[Fascism|fascist]] leaders adopted, such as the position of ''[[Führer]]'' by [[Adolf Hitler]]. In September 1943, Mussolini styled himself as the "Duce of the [[Italian Social Republic]]" ({{lang-it|Duce della Repubblica Sociale Italiana}}), and held the position until the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|collapse]] of the Italian Social Republic and [[Death of Benito Mussolini|his death]] in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Quartermaine, L. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vwx6hN8zyIsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22italian+social+republic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5iLjT7L0Ic7ItAa_qL3FBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22italian%20social%20republic%22&amp;f=false Mussolini's Last Republic: Propaganda and Politics in the Italian Social Republic]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The title was used outside its traditional noble sense in some of the publications praising [[Garibaldi]] during the [[Unification of Italy]] in 1860, though not taken up officially by Garibaldi himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Riall, "Garibaldi, Invention of a Hero", London, 2007, Ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'Duce Supremo' ("Supreme Leader") was more formally used by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] in 1915, during World War I, referring to his role as the commander in chief of the armed forces. The term was also used by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] as [[dictator]] of the self-proclaimed [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] in 1920, and most significantly by the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. The painting 'Il Duce' by [[Gerardo Dottori]] represents Mussolini. Because the title 'Il Duce' has become associated with [[Fascism]], it is no longer in common use other than in reference to him. Because of modern anti-fascist sentiment, Italian speakers in general now use other words for leader, mainly including the English loanword. However, the term ''duce'' survives as an [[antonomasia]] for Benito Mussolini.

==Succession==
Mussolini intended that the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] would choose a successor from a list of three men chosen by him, and submit the name for approval by the king. As of 1940 he may have been preparing his son-in-law [[Galeazzo Ciano]] for the role.&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n277/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=255,257-258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elijah ben Moses Ashkenazi Loans''' (1555 &amp;ndash; July 1636) was a German [[rabbi]] and [[Kabbalist]]. 

He was born in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]. He belonged to the Rashi family, and on his mother's side was the grandson of [[Johanan Luria]], and on his father's of [[Josel of Rosheim]]. After having studied in his native city under the direction of [[Jacob Ginzburg]] and [[Akiba Frankfort]], Loans went to [[Cracow]], where he attended the lectures of [[Menahem Mendel]]. While there he prepared for publication the "''Darke Mosheh''" of [[Moses Isserles]]. At the beginning of the seventeenth century Loans was called to the rabbinate of [[Fulda]], which he left in 1612, occupying successively the rabbinates of [[Hanau]], [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] (1620), and Worms (1630), in which last-named city he remained until his death.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia/&gt;

Loans was a diligent student of Kabbalah, and for this reason was surnamed "Ba'al Shem." He was also accomplished in music and [[calligraphy]], and various legends circulated regarding his personality. He was the author of the following works: ''Rinnat Dodim'' ([[Basel]], 1600), a commentary on [[Canticles]]; ''Miklol Yofi'' (Amsterdam, 1695), a commentary on [[Ecclesiastes]]; ''Wikkuaḥ Yayin 'im ha-Mayim'' (Amsterdam, 1757), a poem with a commentary; ''Ma'agle Ẓedeḳ'' (Neubauer, "''Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian Library''" No. 1832), a commentary on Baḥya's "''Ḥobot ha-Lebabot''"; ''Ẓofnat Pa'aneaḥ'' (Neubauer, "''Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian Library''" No. 1830), a commentary on the "''Tiḳḳune Zohar''"; a commentary on ''Genesis Rabbah'' (Neubauer, "''Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian Library''" No. 149); and ''Adderet Eliyahu'' (Neubauer, "''Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian Library''" No. 1829), a commentary on the ''[[Zohar]]''.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia/&gt;

Loans also edited the "''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ammude Shelomoh''" of [[Solomon Luria]] on the "''[[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy#Works|Semag]]''" (Basel, 1599), and the "''Sha'are Dura''" of [[Isaac ben Meïr of Dueren]], to which he wrote a preface (Neubauer, "''Catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. in the Bodleian Library''" No. 1600).&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=484&amp;letter=L&amp;search=elijah%20loans|title=Loans, Elijah ben Moses Ashkenazi|author=K.

'''Fergus Henderson''', MBE (born 31 July 1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title = Birthdays
 | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]
 | pages = 33
 
 | date = 31 July 2014
 | accessdate = 31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[chef]] who founded the restaurant [[St John (restaurant)|St John]] on St John Street in London. He is often noted for his use of [[offal]] and other neglected cuts of meat as a consequence of his philosophy of [[The Whole Beast: Nose to Tail Eating|nose to tail eating]].  Following in the footsteps of his parents, Brian and Elizabeth Henderson, he trained as an architect at the [[Architectural Association]] in London. Most of his dishes are derived from traditional [[British cuisine]] and the wines are all French.

Chefs [[Anthony Bourdain]] and [[Mario Batali]] have both praised Henderson for his dishes, which optimise [[British food]] while making full use of the whole animal. [[A. A. Gill]] famously retracted his initial hostility to St John in the ''[[Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Heilpern|title=Out to Lunch with Fergus Henderson|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/10/fergus-henderson-interview|work=Vanity Fair|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergus is married to fellow chef [[Margot Henderson]]; the couple have three children; Francis, Owen and Hector.

== Career ==
Henderson had no formal training in cooking, and has never worked under any other chef. In 1992 Henderson and his wife, Margot, opened the French House Dining Room at Soho's [[The French House, Soho|French House]] pub before he left to open the [[St. John (restaurant)|St. John restaurant]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=GuardAug12&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/19/margot-henderson-rochelle-canteen-interview|title=Margot Henderson: British food's best-kept secret|author=[[Rachel Cooke]]|date=19 August 2012|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The menu at St. John changes daily, but almost always includes roast bone marrow and parsley salad. It was awarded a [[Michelin star]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michelin.co.uk/michelinuk/en/more/news-home/news/20080225133153/24305.html|title=New Michelin Guide Great Britain &amp; Ireland 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he opened St John Bread and Wine in [[Spitalfields]], London. A second St John restaurant located within the hotel in Chinatown was awarded a [[Michelin star]] in 2009. This venue is no longer open.

== ''Nose to Tail'' Books ==
In 1999 Henderson published ''[[Nose to Tail Eating: A Kind of British Cooking]]'' in which he provides recipes incorporating [[Pig's trotters|trotters]], [[tripe]], [[kidney]]s, [[chitterlings]] and other animal parts.&lt;ref name=n2t&gt;{{cite book |author= Henderson, Fergus |title=Nose to Tail Eating: A Kind of British Cooking |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |date=September 2004 |isbn=0-7475-7257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explains the philosophy behind his cooking explaining that "it seems common sense and even polite to the animal to use all of it. Rather than being testosterone-fuelled blood-lust, it actually seems to be a gentle approach to meat eating."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Ian, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (25 October 2004). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3315464/Swine-of-the-times.html Swine of the Times]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he published a sequel, ''Beyond Nose To Tail'', and in 2012 ''The Complete Nose to Tail: A Kind of British Cooking''.

== Hotel ==
Henderson opened a hotel in spring 2011 that was described by his business partner Trevor Gulliver as being 'in the St John vernacular'.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Kerstin, caterersearch.com (9 October 2009)[http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2009/10/12/330334/St-John-team-to-launch-hotel-in-Londons-West-End.htm St John Team to Launch Hotel in London's West End]&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in [[London's Chinatown]] district near [[Leicester Square]] 1 Leicester Street. However, the hotel went into administration in October 2012, and was sold and subsequently closed.

==Diagnosis with Parkinson's disease and recognition==
Henderson's stoic approach to [[Parkinson's Disease]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/feb/26/foodanddrink.features6&lt;/ref&gt; with which he was diagnosed in 1998, increased the regard in which he was held and he was awarded an [[MBE]] in 2005. The same year he underwent innovative [[Deep Brain Stimulation]] which vastly improved his mobility.&lt;ref name=GuardAug12/&gt;

'''Frank Chodorov''' (February 15, 1887 – December 28, 1966) was an American member of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], a group of [[libertarianism|libertarian]] thinkers who were [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] in foreign policy and opposed to both the American entry into [[World War II]] and the [[New Deal]]. He was called by [[Ralph Raico]] "the last of the Old Right greats."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (March 29, 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Fishel Chodorowsky on the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|Lower West Side]] of [[New York City]] on February 15, 1887, he was the eleventh child of Russian [[Jewish]] immigrants. He graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1907, then worked at a number of jobs around the country. Working in Chicago (1912–17), he read [[Henry George]]'s ''[[Progress and Poverty]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fugitive Essays: Selected Writings of Frank Chodorov |last=Chodorov |first=Frank |authorlink= |editor= Charles H. Hamilton |year=1980 |publisher=Liberty Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=0-913966-72-X|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chodorov wrote that he "read the book several times, and each time I felt myself slipping into a cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Step: The Autobiography of an Individualist |last=Chodorov |first=Frank |authorlink= |year=1962 |publisher=Devin-Adair |location=New York |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chodorov:
{{quote|George is the apostle of [[individualism]]; he teaches the [[ethics|ethical]] basis of [[private property]]; he stresses the function of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in an advancing civilization; he emphasizes the greater productivity of voluntary cooperation in a [[free market]] economy, the moral degeneration of a people subjected to state direction and [[socialism|socialistic]] conformity. His is the philosophy of [[free enterprise]], [[free trade]], free men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chodorov |first=Frank |year=1941 |title=Education for a Free Society |journal=Scribner's Commentator |publisher=Scribner's |volume=9 |issue=February |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Henry George School==
In 1937, Chodorov became director of the [[Henry George School of Social Science]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://henrygeorgeschool.org/ Henry George School of Social Science]&lt;/ref&gt; There, he established (with Will Lissner) and edited a school paper, ''[[The Freeman]]''. It published articles by [[Albert Jay Nock]] (founder of an earlier journal also called ''The Freeman''), as well as such leading figures of the day as [[John Dewey]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Lincoln Steffens]] and [[Thorsten Veblen]]. Chodorov used the magazine to express his antiwar views:
{{quote|Every day we must repeat to ourselves as a liturgy, the truth that war is caused by the conditions that bring about poverty; that no war is justified; that no war benefits the people; that war is an instrument whereby the haves increase their hold on the have-nots; that war destroys liberty.}}

With the coming of [[World War II]], such views were no longer tolerated: Chodorov was ousted from the school in 1942. He wrote that "it seemed to me then that the only thing for me to do was to blow my brains out, which I might have done if I had not had Albert Jay Nock by my side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fugitive Essays: Selected Writings of Frank Chodorov |last=Chodorov |first=Frank |authorlink= |editor=Charles H. Hamilton |year=1980 |publisher=Liberty Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=0-913966-72-X|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nock had weathered similar "war fever" during [[World War I]] when as editor of the antiwar journal ''[[The Nation]]'', he had seen that magazine banned from the US mails by the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Betrayal of the American Right |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |year=2007 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, AL |isbn=978-1-933550-13-8 |page=5|url=https://mises.org/books/betrayal.pdf|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Analysis''==
Chodorov published articles in a variety of magazines, including [[H.L. Mencken]]'s ''[[American Mercury]]'', the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]''. In 1944, he launched a four-page monthly broadsheet called ''analysis'', described as "an individualistic publication—the only one of its kind in America." [[Murray Rothbard]] called it "one of the best, though undoubtedly the most neglected, of the 'little magazines' that has ever been published in the United States."&lt;ref name="mises"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |year=1967 |title=Frank Chodorov, R.I.P |journal=Left &amp; Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought |publisher=Murray N. Rothbard |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–8 |url=https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Nock's works, Chodorov was influenced by [[Franz Oppenheimer]]'s ''The State'':&lt;ref&gt;''[https://mises.org/books/the_state_oppenheimer.pdf The State]''&lt;/ref&gt; "between the state and the individual there is always a tug-of-war," wrote Chodorov, "whatever power one acquires must be to the detriment of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chodorov |first=Frank |year=1949 |title=The Cardinal Crime |journal=Analysis |publisher=Frank Chodorov |volume=1949 |issue=March |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Freeman''==
In 1954, Chodorov again became editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'', in its new incarnation, revived under the auspices of [[Foundation for Economic Education]] (FEE). He contributed several articles over the years to its ''Essays in Liberty'' series, beginning with Volume 1 in 1952. He engaged with [[William F. Buckley]] and [[Willi Schlamm]] on the question of whether individualists should support interventionism to aid people resisting communist aggression. Chodorov continued to advocate nonintervention, but as the [[Cold War]] continued, he lost influence: the American [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] movement came to be a bastion of [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] in combating Soviet expansionism.

==Intercollegiate Society of Individualists==
In 1953, Chodorov founded the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute|Intercollegiate Society of Individualists]] (ISI), with Buckley as president, becoming the first national conservative student organization, reaching 50,000 members by the end of the century. In later years, ISI became extremely influential as a clearinghouse of conservative publications and as a locus of the conservative intellectual movement in America. It later evolved into the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.

Chodorov was a major influence on many of those who would go on to lead the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] movements, including Buckley, [[M. Stanton Evans]], [[Murray Rothbard]], Edmund A. Opitz, and [[James J. Martin]]. Rothbard, an economist, wrote:
{{quote|I shall never forget the profound thrill—a thrill of intellectual liberation—that ran through me when I first encountered the name of Frank Chodorov, months before we were to meet in person. As a young graduate student in economics, I had always believed in the free market, and had become increasingly libertarian over the years, but this sentiment was as nothing to the headline that burst forth in the title of a pamphlet that I chanced upon at the university bookstore: ''Taxation is Robbery'', by Frank Chodorov. There it was; simple perhaps, but how many of us, let alone how many professors of the economics of taxation, have ever given utterance to this shattering and demolishing truth?&lt;ref name="mises" /&gt;}}

==Later years==
A secular [[Jew]], Chodorov gained a greater appreciation for religious thought in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Chodorov, How a Jew Came to God&lt;/ref&gt; He was an avid fan of [[western (genre)|westerns]].&lt;ref&gt;Chodorov, Frank, [https://mises.org/daily/4930/I-Watch-Westerns I Watch Westerns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914004019/https://mises.org/daily/4930/I-Watch-Westerns |date=September 14, 2014 }}, ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the [[North American Confederacy]] [[alternate history]] series by [[L. Neil Smith]], in which the United States becomes a [[libertarian]] state after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, Frank Chodorov was chosen by the [[Continental Congress]] to be [[H. L. Mencken]]'s successor after his assassination in a duel in 1933. He served as the 20th President of the North American Confederacy from 1933 to 1940. He was succeeded by [[Rose Wilder Lane]], who served as the 21st president from 1940 to 1952.

'''Ioan Constantin Filitti''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon konstanˈtin fiˈliti}}, first name also '''Ion'''; [[Francization|Francized]] ''Jean C. Filitti''; May 8, 1879 – September 21, 1945) was a [[Romania]]n historian, diplomat and [[Conservatism|conservative]] theorist, best remembered for his contribution to [[social history]], [[legal history]], [[genealogy]] and [[heraldry]]. A member of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] and an assistant of its senior leader [[Titu Maiorescu]], he had aristocratic ([[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]]) origins and an [[Elitism|elitist]] perspective. Among his diverse contributions, several focus on 19th-century [[modernization]] under the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, during which Romania was ruled upon by the [[Russian Empire]]. As a historian, Filitti is noted for his perfectionism, and for constantly revising his own works.

I. C. Filitti had an auspicious debut in diplomacy and politics, but his career was mired in controversy. A "[[Germanophile]]" by the start of [[World War I]], he secretly opposed the pact between Romania and the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], and opted to stay behind in [[Romania in World War I|German-occupied territory]]. He fell into disgrace for serving the [[collaborationist]] [[Lupu Kostaki]] as [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] and head of the [[National Theater Bucharest|National Theater]], although he eventually managed to overturn his [[Capital punishment in Romania|death sentence]] for treason. Filitti became a recluse, focusing on his scholarship and press polemics, but was allowed to serve on the [[Legislative Council (Romania)|Legislative Council]] after 1926.

In his political tracts, written well after the Conservative Party's demise, I. C. Filitti preserves the orthodox conservative principles of Maiorescu. His attachment to boyar tradition was expanded into a critique of [[centralized government]], [[etatism]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]]. Toward the end of his life, he supported the dictatorial regime known as [[National Renaissance Front]].

==Biography==

===Origin and early life===
Through his paternal family, Filitti descended from historical figures whose careers were intertwined with the history of [[Wallachia]], the Romanian subregion and former autonomous state. It originated with [[Greeks in Romania|ethnic Greek]] migrants from the [[Epirus]]—where the Filitti family was known to be residing in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan Stanca|Stanca, Dan]] and Filitti, Georgeta, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/cultura/aldine/pecetea-nobletei-este-educatia-100994.html "Pecetea nobleței este educația"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', July 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The main settlers were male monks, whose presence was attested in [[Buzău County]] around 1786: rising through the ranks of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], [[Dositei Filitti]] served as [[Patriarch of Romania|Wallachian Metropolitan Bishop]], assigning nephew Constandie to preside over the [[Diocese of Buzău]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Although his Epirote father was a noted [[Russophilia|Russophile]], the Metropolitan regarded himself as a liberal-minded Wallachian patriot: he founded the local school of divinity, provided scholarships to young Wallachians,&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.158, 313&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored the growing printing industry.&lt;ref name="lgconvorbire"&gt;{{ro icon}} Laura Guțanu, [http://www.romlit.ro/o_convorbire_cu_georgeta_filitti "O convorbire cu Georgeta Filitti"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2003&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, he spoke out against the [[Slavery in Romania|practice of slavery]], protecting [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani women]] from their Wallachian masters&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.270-271&lt;/ref&gt; and donating money for the release of ''[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|devșirme]]'' victims.&lt;ref name="lgconvorbire"/&gt; During times of turmoil, when Wallachia effectively became a dominion of the Russian Empire, Dositei was swiftly deposed on Russian orders.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian claimed lineage from the non-monastic branch of the Filitti clan. A Silvestru Filitti, active ca. 1810, was among the first private practitioners in Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.198, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Fully [[Romanianization|Romanianized]],&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt; 20th-century Filittis were still members of Romania's privileged class. A native of [[Bucharest]], Ioan C. was the son of Colonel Constantin Filitti, a former Ordinance Officer of the Romanian ''[[Domnitor]]i''.&lt;ref name="gf(08)11"&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the family owned a country estate, at [[Alexeni]], [[Ialomița County]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The Filittis preserved strong connections with the Ialomița region, where Colonel Filitti had twice served as Prefect.&lt;ref name="gf(08)13"&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Ioan inherited from him a deep dislike and mistrust toward the dominant [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), sentiments which carried him into Conservative politics: Constantin regarded himself as a political victim of the PNL establishment, and in particular of the [[Brătianu family]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)45"&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Filitti had another son, Alexandru—better known under the moniker ''Filitti-Robănești''.&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Filitti family coat of arms.svg|thumb|250px|Filitti family coat of arms]]
The mother, Elena, was born into the [[Ghica family]]. Her father, Mihail Ghica, was a staff officer of the [[Romanian Armed Forces|Royal Army]], who had been married for a while to writer [[Elena Văcărescu]].&lt;ref name="mf&amp;lg30"&gt;Filitti, M. &amp; Guțanu, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Thorough his mother's other relatives, Ioan also descended from the eponymous boyar line of [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]] (the Slătineanus).&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.47; (2008), p.11-12; Filitti, M. &amp; Guțanu, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

I. C. Filitti studied at [[Saint Sava National College]], where he was colleagues with future politician (and adversary) [[Ion G. Duca]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)45"/&gt; He was an eminent student, who earned top distinctions annually, and moved on to study at the ''[[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]'' in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)45"/&gt; His first ever published work as a historian was a [[French-language]] tome, ''Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821'' ("The Diplomatic Role of [[Phanariotes]] from 1700 to 1821"). Signed ''Jean C. Filitti'',&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; it was probably his ''[[Licence ès Lettres]]'', and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its author in his official résumés.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.46&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Doctor of Law]] in 1904, when he published the first draft of his study about ''Regulamentul Organic'' as the first ever [[Constitution of Romania|Romanian constitution]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt;

===Entry into public life===
Young Filitti made a remarkably early entry into the diplomatic corps, and stayed on with the [[Romanian Ambassador in France|Romanian Legation]] in [[France]]. In this capacity, he purposefully embarrassed PNL [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] by not sending in all Legation employees to receive him during an official visit.&lt;ref name="gf(95)45"/&gt; During his return trips to Romania, Filitti was focusing on researching his own family archives, and, in 1910, published the volume ''Așezământul cultural al mitropolitului Dosit[h]ei Filitti, de la înființare până azi'' ("Metropolitan Dosit[h]ei Filitti's Cultural Foundation, from Its Establishment to the Present Day"). In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and from Romanian diplomats working in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; In a show of perfectionism, Filitti constantly revised the work as new data surfaced, and, in 1936, declared the 1910 edition to be entirely unusable.&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt;

Filitti was soon drawn into the Conservative establishment, by politics and family connections. His wife Alexandrina ("Sanda"), descending from another branch of the Ghica clan, was a distant relative of two Conservative potentates and doyens of the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzino]] political family: [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino|Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino-Nababul]], who was twice the [[Prime Minister of Romania]], and newspaper magnate [[Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino|Grigore Gh. Cantacuzino]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; She brought in considerable wealth.&lt;ref name="gf(08)14"&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti was by then also in contact with ''[[Junimea]]'', an inner-Conservative club dedicated to cultural criticism, presided upon by the aged literary patron Titu Maiorescu. As noted in 2008 by political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]], the young diplomat was "an orthodox ''Junimist'' who survived the end of his world."&lt;ref name="is130"&gt;Stanomir, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; Like other historiographers and doctrinaires raised by ''Junimea'', Filitti the scholar firmly believed in the preservation of boyar ''[[demesne]]s'' and, as political scientist Victor Rizescu suggests, took part in the century-long debate opposing elitist historians to the advocates of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="vrideol"&gt;{{ro icon}} Rizescu, Victor, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=11589 "Ideologii și istorii ideologice: tradiția românească"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 377, November 2008 (republished by ''[http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ România Culturală] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }}'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Filitti's biographer and posthumous daughter-in-law, Georgeta Penelea-Filitti, also writes that, even in the 1910s, he had become a Conservative apologist, who felt compelled to justify the party line in a "trenchant and unresponsive" manner.&lt;ref name="gf(08)11"/&gt; Like senior ''Junimists'' Maiorescu and [[Petre P. Carp]], Filitti reserved contempt for [[Take Ionescu]], the rising star of Romanian conservatism, whom he depicted as a manipulator with no actual convictions.&lt;ref name="gf(08)10"&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Filitti's first important postings were received from the Conservative cabinet of P. P. Carp, wherein Titu Maiorescu held the Foreign Affairs portfolio. After 1910, Maiorescu appointed Filitti head of the Ministry's Political Section in Bucharest, and then granted him supervision of the Consular and Litigation sections.&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.45; (2008), p.10, 11. See also Boia, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti was also sent on regular missions to France, [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.45-46, 47&lt;/ref&gt; The missions allowed Filitti to expand his activity as a historiographer and archivist. The main stimulus of this activity was, according to Filitti's son Manole, a sense of filial duty: "since destiny wished for his parents to have such assets as would allow him to study in Paris for a couple of years, [my father] felt compelled to repay them by publishing works which would live up to that degree of education."&lt;ref name="mf&amp;lg30"/&gt; According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], although "non-academic", Filitti's work has earned deserved praise from within the scholarly community.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.108, 216&lt;/ref&gt; Georgeta Penelea-Filitti argues that I. C. Filitti's work, indicative of his personality, covers an impressively "large horizon."&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt;

On May 8, 1913, shortly before the [[Second Balkan War]], Filitti began keeping a diary, which records the political intrigues of his age, and offers insight into Conservative affairs.&lt;ref name="gf(08)10"/&gt; One of the first events recorded there is the August 1913 [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Peace Conference of Bucharest]]. Filitti was the official Secretary during the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.216; Filitti, G. (2008), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, he also helped Titu Maiorescu with drafting ''Cartea Verde'' ("The Green Book"), that is the official justification of Romanian foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, he recalled that the congress had been a magnificent affair, noting especially the triumphant arrival of [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], that "old [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of European monarchs".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.70-71&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference, he recalled, "was the [[swan song]] of the old Conservative Party."&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

His services during the Conference earned him public praise from Maiorescu,&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and Filitti, who feared for his prospects, was kept on at the Ministry even after the National Liberal [[Emanuel Porumbaru]] became Minister in January 1914.&lt;ref name="lb216"&gt;Boia, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with his diplomatic endeavors, he spent time researching at the [[Vatican Library]] in [[Rome]]. As noted by Manole Filitti, Ioan C. received "special recommendations", which allowed him entry into the less accessible archives of the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="mf&amp;lg30"/&gt; Such study trips resulted in a two-volume anthology of historical sources, ''Din arhivele Vaticanului'' ("From the Vatican Archives", 1913 and 1914).&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G.(1995), p.47; Filitti, M. &amp; Guțanu, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanophile polemicist and ''Domniile române...''===
World War I was a turning point in Filitti's diplomatic career. Like many of his fellow Conservatives, and against the lobby which dominated the PNL, he believed in tying Romania to the [[Central Powers]], especially to the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] alternative, he argued, was bankrupt, because Romania would find herself manipulated by a hostile Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.54, 216-217; Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.11, 12, 14&lt;/ref&gt; His core idea, paraphrased by Georgeta Filitti, was that: "Any entente, any attempt to collaborate, any concession made to [Russia] would sooner or later turn against us."&lt;ref name="gf(08)11"/&gt; The diplomat witnessed with alarm that public opinion was against him, either because of seductive [[Francophilia]], or because a war on Austria-Hungary could bring Romania [[Transylvania]] region and other [[Irredentism|irredenta]]: "The Russian gold has bought off the press and many private persons. Others are guided by sentimentality".&lt;ref name="lb54"&gt;Boia, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; In restaurants such as [[Casa Capșa]], "Franco-hysteria and Russo-Frenchitude [have reached] a peak", and "people of no significance" were even proposing to assassinate the Germanophile King Carol.&lt;ref name="lb54"/&gt; In this context, he believed, Transylvania could only stand to lose its character if ever governed from Bucharest.&lt;ref name="gf(08)11"/&gt;

At around that time, Filitti issued at his expense the Germanophile brochure ''Cu Tripla Alianță'' ("With the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]"). He prudently signed it with the fake initials ''F. K.''&lt;ref name="lb216"/&gt; In it, Filitti spoke out at length about containing [[Pan-Slavism]], more important a priority than "the nation's other aspirations" (in Transylvania): "The best thing one may wish upon Romania is that the Muscovite Empire be evicted as far away as possible from the heart of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.216-217&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet was also noted for its unfulfilled prophecy that Italy would also join the war as a German ally, and for arguing that, either way, Austria-Hungary was set to collapse after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.216, 217. See also Filitti, G. (2008), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The text's reception, he noted, was disastrous: no reviews were printed, almost no bookstores would sell it, and the few who looked over it attributed it to an [[agent of influence]] or to some "paid-off [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jew]]".&lt;ref name="lb54"/&gt; In ''Cu Tripla Alianță'' and in his diary, the diplomat continued to complain that the Francophile mood was irrational, since France and the Entente as a whole only "love [Romanians] when they need us", which was "only natural".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, his diary documents earlier instances where (he argued) France had gambled with Romania's independence.&lt;ref name="gf(08)11"/&gt;

In his more public existence, I. C. Filitti was still regarded with sympathy by the entire political and cultural establishment. In 1915, he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.216; Filitti, G. (1995), p.48; (2008), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The institution also granted him its prestigious Năsturel Herescu Award.&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; This was in recognition of his groundbreaking [[monograph]] on [[modernization]] under the ''Regulamentul'' regime: ''Domniile române sub Regulamentul Organic'' ("Romanian Reigns under ''Regulamentul Organic''"). It described in some detail the [[culture shock]] of the 1830s, when the [[Westernization|Westernized]] elites reversed a process of [[Turkification]], and noted the ambivalent policies of Russian governors.&lt;ref&gt;Mârza, p.85-86, 88&lt;/ref&gt; The book also speaks about the 1832 manhunt for, and forced [[sedentarization]] of, Wallachia's Romani people, both the [[fugitive slave]]s and the free nomads.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Manole, Petre Florin, [http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_bcss/bcss_12/Studii_articole/7%20Petre_Florin_Manole.pdf "Expulzarea romilor nomazi netoți, din Țara Românească, în perioada 1831-1834"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|1 December University of Alba Iulia]] ''Buletinul Cercurilor Științifice Studențești, Arheologie - Istorie - Muzeologie'', Nr. 12, 2006, p.107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

''Domniile române...'' was simultaneously published in Bucharest (by [[Editura Socec]]), [[Leipzig]] ([[Otto Harrassowitz]]) and [[Vienna]] ([[Carl Gerold]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mârza, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; It was then reprinted by the official [[Editura Academiei]] press, under the supervision of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]. The encounter was confrontational: Iorga decided to cut out entire passages where, he argued, the author had gone into too much detail.&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; The intervention was unwittingly destructive, as part of the documents cited by Filitti, and only by him, have since been destroyed.&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt;

It was also in 1915 that Filitti contributed his views on the thorny issue of "[[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations]]", contracts reputedly signed by two [[Danubian Principalities]] (Wallachia and [[Moldavia]]) when they first came under the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[suzerainty]]. The author postulated that the Capitulations regulated the status of foreigners living in ancient Romania, exempting them from the consequences of common law, and creating major legal problems after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Ulinici, p.110, 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; His research produced the article ''România față de capitulațiile Turciei'' ("Romania in Relation to the Turkish Capitulations"), taken up by the Academy's official yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;Ulinici, p.110. See also Filitti, G. (1995), p.46&lt;/ref&gt; It saw print at the same time as his new collection of documents, sampling the archives of [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|French Ambassadors to the Porte]]: ''Lettres et extraits concernant les relations des principautés roumaines avec la France, 1728-1810'' ("Letters and Excerpts on the Relations between the Romanian Principalities and France").&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt;

===Filitti and the Kostaki administration===
I. C. Filitti was not in a celebratory mood as the National Liberals publicized their [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|August 1916 Treaty]], when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that the decades of PNL rule had left the military ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.11, 12&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon after drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]], as officer of the [[Second Army (Romania)|Second Field Army]], and stationed in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="lb218"&gt;Boia, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' [[Romania in World War I|occupation of southern Romania]], Filitti took his most controversial decision. In circumstances that are largely unknown, he opted to stay behind in occupied territory, and greeted the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.26, 217&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as [[liaison officer]], the other to stay behind in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.&lt;ref name="lb218"/&gt;

The Filitti family had by then divided its loyalties: judge [[Ioan D. Filitti]], formerly a PNL politico, followed the Germanophile line;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.220-221&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Ioan C.'s own brother Alexandru entered history when he led a cavalry charge on a German machine gun [[turret]], located outside of [[Balș]].&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt;

At the time, [[Lupu Kostaki]] was organizing left-behind Conservatives and forming a provisional administration, answering to the German command. Filitti served Kostaki as Head of the [[National Theater Bucharest]]. Under his management, the Theater took on some 67 new productions of [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian plays]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; The Germans also assigned him to an administrative position, making him the Prefect of Ialomița County.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.218; Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.10, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; However, Filitti himself was troubled by his association with the puppet regime. According to Georgeta Filitti, the diary he kept shows "the efforts to interpose himself between the foreign military authorities and his own administrators, to alleviate the unbearable regime of requisitions, the abuse and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] arrogance, [efforts which] were, for the most part, ineffectual."&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; Like other Germanophiles, Filitti justified himself as a protector of Romanian interests during times of chaos, and was discouraged to find out that the German regime regarded him as a servant.&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He had similar trouble getting along with some of his Romanian colleagues, in particular [[Virgil Arion]], the phantom Minister of Education (whom he described as [[Nepotism|nepotistic]], aloof, and especially "lazy").&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of his assignments failed to satisfy him: he was, according to Boia, a "strange" choice for the Theater leadership, and gave up on this office in April 1917; Filitti himself viewed his Prefect's job as inane, and repeatedly presented his resignation (only accepted in February 1918).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.218, 284. See also Filitti, G. (2008), p.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; His departure from the Theater was in fact hastened by the Germans, who took over the location for their own purposes. Filitti informed the troupe members that they had to pay rent, and they moved out in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Molea, Vera, [http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads/mai2011.pdf "Teatrul Odeon la aniversarea unui secol de existență"], in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 5/2011, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; While in Ialomița, Filitti combined his administrative missions (retold as short notes in his diaries) with historical research, and tapped into a documentary fund at Alexeni.&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Although only a junior member of the administrative staff, Filitti aimed for a position at the core of government, and demanded from Kostaki a post better suited to his intelligence, "in Bucharest".&lt;ref name="lb218"/&gt; He noted that the death of Maiorescu in June 1917 had stripped him of political support inside the Conservative Party, and had derailed his steady advancement.&lt;ref name="lb218-219"&gt;Boia, p.218-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the legitimate government had relocated to [[Iași]], in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it [[court-martial]]led Filitti ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and [[Capital punishment in Romania|sentenced him to death]] for the crime of high treason.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.218, 219; Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: "I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, to take me with him. He says that he'll take along his son. I note that one does not exclude the other. He agrees" (January 12, 1918).&lt;ref name="lb218"/&gt; Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty]], and noted that the Ententist King, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], "made it hard" for him to be accepted back into the diplomatic corps.&lt;ref name="lb218-219"/&gt; As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand [[veto]]ed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.&lt;ref name="gf(08)14"/&gt;

In June 1918, I. C. Filitti handed himself in to the authorities in Moldavia, and, upon retrial, was acquitted of treason.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.219; Filitti, G. (1995), p.46; (2008), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to presenting evidence of his efforts to curb German excesses, he enlisted the testimony of Ialomița citizens, who vouched for him.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; However, Boia concludes, the retrial itself was a sham: "A rehabilitation as politicized in the new context as had been his sentencing at the end of 1916."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1918 controversy===
Upon the end of 1918, when the Central Powers succumbed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the pro-Entente forces regained power. I. C. Filitti faced the political repercussions: blocked out of the Foreign Ministry and diplomatic corps, he had to reinvent himself as a full-time historian, publicist and essayist.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.26, 359; Filitti, G. (1995), p.46-48; (2008), p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt; He largely immersed himself in his decades-long work, in effect a multilevel historical narrative covering the history of the Danubian Principalities, from the [[foundation of Wallachia]] (14th century) to the emergence of [[United Principalities|United Romania]] (1859). Much of his interest, marked by what Georgeta Filitti calls "excessive accuracy",&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; was in reviewing the intricate boyar genealogies. He substantiated the various inheritance claims, and, in addition, painstakingly retraced the borders of Wallachia's oldest ''demesnes''.&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; During his retrial, facing the possibility of execution, Filitti also turned his attention to the philosophy of history, reading profusely from [[Ernest Renan]] and [[Hippolyte Taine]].&lt;ref name="gf(08)13"/&gt;

According to Filitti, the war spelled out the end of Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the ''[[nouveaux riches]]'' and the neo-[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (2008), p.10, 11-12, 13&lt;/ref&gt; As the Conservative Party itself collapsed into obscurity, he remained largely cut off from the outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in [[dip pen]], and never watched a motion picture.&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"/&gt; After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a [[broker]], who gambled it away and then committed suicide.&lt;ref name="gf(08)14"/&gt;

Filitti lived secluded in a townhouse on Oltarului Street, in the Bucharest quarter of [[Moșilor]]. He repeatedly complained about street noises, confiscated the footballs of neighborhood children, and eventually received (from [[Romanian Police]] chief [[Gavrilă Marinescu]]) a permanent guard to protect him from distractions.&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"/&gt; Filitti had few visiting friends, among them Alexandru Filitti-Robănești, teacher Alexandru Pisoschi, historians [[Emanoil Hagi-Moscu]] and G. D. Florescu.&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"/&gt; He was however in constant correspondence with other scholars who shared his passions, including Greek jurist [[Panagiotis Zepos]], His Majesty's Antiquarian [[G. T. Kirileanu]], bibliophile [[Constantin Karadja]], regional historian G. Poboran, academician-priest [[Nicolae M. Popescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.47, 48&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] archivist [[Endre Veress|Endre (Andrei) Veress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Pecican|Pecican, Ovidiu]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna124.pdf "Uitat, dar important"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 124, November 2007, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the anti-Germanophile Nicolae Iorga, his rivals in academia included a new generation of leading historians, who were targets of his polemical articles: [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]], [[George Fotino]], [[Constantin C. Giurescu]] and [[P. P. Panaitescu]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"/&gt; The latter was however influenced by Filitti's ideas on the sources of landed property, and incorporated them into his own historical narrative.&lt;ref name="vrideol"/&gt;

An early product of Filitti's interest in genealogy was a 1919 book about his relatives, the Cantacuzinos: ''Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino'' ("The Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino Archive"). It refers to the documents collected by Cantacuzino-Nababul, whom the book describes as: "Good and kind, a self-effacing host, confident of the nation's faculties."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Munteanu, Irina, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/conservatorul-milionar-31682.htm "Conservatorul milionar"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', December 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The author tracked down Nababul's origins to Michael "Șeytanoğlu" Kantakouzenos, a [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] in Ottoman service, active around 1580.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasiu, p.30-31, 32, 33&lt;/ref&gt; The factual errors of this study caused Filitti great distress, to the point where he planned to entirely revise his version of the Cantacuzino [[family tree]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; The book is still considered a particularly relevant source on the obscure genealogies of some high-ranking Greek-Romanian families: [[Karajan (surname)|Cara(g)iani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rădulescu, Mihai Sorin, [http://www.romlit.ro/despre_un_portret_al_domniei_zoe_ghika "Despre un portret al domniței Zoe Ghika"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 38/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Filodor,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rădulescu, Mihai Sorin, [http://www.romlit.ro/o_scrisoare_de_la__diplomatul_lucian_blaga "O scrisoare de la diplomatul Lucian Blaga"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 12/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Gheraki&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rădulescu, Mihai Sorin, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/56_viata-romaneasca-12-2008/10_cronica-literara/199_un-turcolog-uitat-si-o-carte-reprezentativa.html "Un turcolog uitat și o carte reprezentativă"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 12/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and Plagino.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rădulescu, Mihai Sorin, [http://www.romlit.ro/o_prezen_romneasc_n_nordul_africii "O prezență românească în Nordul Africii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Filitti the politician returned in 1921 with an extended ''[[List of Latin phrases: P#pro domo|pro domo]]'' covering his wartime stances: ''{{lang|ro|Rusia, Austro-Ungaria și Germania față de România}}'' ("Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany Confront Romania").&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; The same year, in May, Iași's ''[[Viața Românească]]'' review hosted his tract on administrative reform, whereby he criticized attempts to impose [[centralized government]] on post-war [[Greater Romania]]. He proposed three essential policies: decentralization, the depoliticization of [[public administration]], and enhanced executive powers for the prefects. These prolonged P. P. Carp's ideas on local autonomy and, in addition, attempted to protect the existing local government of the newly united Transylvania, Bessarabia and [[Bukovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cezar Petrescu|Petrescu, Cezar]], [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/6902/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1921_1922_001_004.pdf "Cărți și reviste"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 4/1921, p.95-96 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

He still struggled with prejudice against Germanophiles: also in 1921, he tried to obtain the History Chair at the [[University of Iași]], but lost once his old adversary Iorga intervened against him.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46-47"&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.46, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he was present at the funeral ceremony of [[Dimitrie Onciul]], a fellow historian and ''Junimist''. Onciul, whose Germanophila had been the topic of a major scandal in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.352-353&lt;/ref&gt; was honored by Filitti with a funeral oration. It stated: "All of us, we are what our known or unknown ancestors have accumulated in our beings; we are that which preceding generations have planted in us; we are the echo of our dead."&lt;ref name="gf(95)45"/&gt;

===Recovery===
[[File:Interbelic Brasov County CoA.png|thumb|250px|[[Brașov County]] [[coat of arms]], as redesigned in the 1930s. Here, the [[Steel Crown of Romania|Steel Crown]] replaces the earlier royal crown of [[Brassó County]]]]
In the early 1920s, I. C. Filitti worked with the formerly ''Junimist'' tribune ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist [[Costache Negruzzi]] (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.989, 999&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti subsequently turned his attention to some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of [[Radu Negru|Negru Vodă]] (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Lord]] [[Matei Basarab]].&lt;ref&gt;Cârciumaru, Radu, [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/files/CC15/02_Carciumaru.pdf "Negru-Vodă and Dragoș. Legend and Historical Truth at the beginning of the Romanian Statality"] [sic], in the [[Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava]] [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/ ''Codrul Cosminului''], Nr. 15 (2009), p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he returned to social history, with the book ''Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc'' ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of [[knighthood]], as all boyars were defined by their ''demesnes''.&lt;ref&gt;Nedeloiu, Paul Daniel, [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/CC16/2/boyars.pdf "Neamț County Boyars - Part of the Moldavian Elite"], in the [[Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava]] [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/ ''Codrul Cosminului''], Nr. 2 (2010), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, in 1926, King Ferdinand allowed Filitti to resume his political career, making him a member of the [[Legislative Council (Romania)|Romanian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, G. (1995), p.46. See also Stanomir, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; An emanation of the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]], it comprised experts tasked with reviewing laws endorsed by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], and whose exact role sparked a series of controversies.&lt;ref&gt;Mâță, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti was among those who described the Council as a necessary branch of the legislature, rather than as an organ of the executive.&lt;ref name="dcm201"&gt;Mâță, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1926, Filitti was one of the authors of a [[legal history]] overview, ''Contribuții la istoria justiției penale în Principatele române'' ("Contributions to the History of Penal Justice in the Romanian Principalities").&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; By means of Iorga's academic journal ''Revista Istorică'', he also publicized his discovery of a 17th-century [[Romanian lexis|Romanian glossary]], which emissaries of the [[Holy See]] used on their missions to the Danubian Principalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Panataleoni, Daniele, [http://www.philologica-jassyensia.ro/upload/III_1_Pantaleoni.pdf "Observații asupră textelor românești vechi cu alfabet latin (1570 - 1703)"], in the [[University of Iași]] ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 1/2007, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in 1927 with a work tracing the very history of the Legislative Council: ''Originea și menirea Consiliului Legislativ'' ("The Origin and Purpose of the Legislative Council").&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt;

Filitti ended the 13th and final notebook of his diary on March 6, 1928.&lt;ref name="gf(08)10"/&gt; By 1929, he turned his attention to the [[history of medicine]] in Wallachia, publishing a study of medical practice between 1784 and 1828.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; The same year, he edited the critical edition of the 1829 boyar register (''catagrafie''), originally compiled by Russian authorities under ''Regulamentul'' provisions. It notably showed the division of aristocracy into three classes, with only 70 entries in the top, "great boyars", category.&lt;ref&gt;Columbeanu, Sergiu, "Research Prospects in Rumanian Historiography: Wallachia (1770—1830)", in [[Keith Hitchins|Hitchins, Keith]] (ed.), ''Rumanian Studies. Vol. III'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 1973, p.134. {{ISBN|90-04-03639-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti demonstrated that, at only 4.6 ‰ of the Wallachian population, Wallachian boyars formed one of the thinnest layers of European aristocrats proportional to the respective population.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.49, 347&lt;/ref&gt;

While still involved in the disputes over Legislative Council attributions,&lt;ref name="dcm201"/&gt; Filitti was a member, and later President, of the state's Heraldry and Genealogy Commission.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; The appointment again brought him into disagreement with the Romanian monarch, this time involving the heraldic symbols of Greater Romania. Filitti and Kirileanu suggested redesigned [[coats of arms]] of the [[Counties of Romania|Romanian counties]], each bearing the [[Steel Crown of Romania|Steel Crown]], as a show of national unity; Ferdinand disagreed, and the counties were only allowed their simple [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; He was turning his attention to the Slătineanu branch of his family, and completed a biographical study on Ion Slătineanu, governor of [[Brăila]] in the 1830s (hosted by the magazine ''Analele Brăilei'', 1/1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} I.

Some of Filitti's biographical work was dedicated to the 16th-century Wallachian hero [[Michael the Brave]]. In 1931, he published an investigation of Michael's early career as titular [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of [[Oltenia]].&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; A year later, he detailed Michael's introduction of [[serfdom]] in Wallachia: ''Despre "legătura" lui Mihai Viteazul'' ("On 'Bondage' under Michael the Brave").&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; Between these, the academic review ''Analele Economice și Statistice'', Vol. XIV, reissued the 1857 count of emancipated [[Slavery in Romania|Romani slaves]], annotated by Filitti.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Achim, Venera, [http://www.iini-minorities.ro/docs/Ven.Achim_Statistica_2005.pdf "Statistica țiganilor în Principatele Române în perioada 1830–1860"], in ''Revista Istorică'', Nr. 3-4 (2005), p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, returning to the history of Oltenian Bans, he gave an account on the [[Craiovești]] family history, taken up by ''Arhivele Olteniei'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie, Marius Liviu, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/anuare/AnuarBaritHistorica2009/02%20Marius%20Liviu%20Ilie.pdf "Domnia și 'casa domniei' în Țara Românească.

Series Historica'', 2009, p.37, 38&lt;/ref&gt; His ongoing research into social issues of the early 19th century produced another book, ''Frământări politice și sociale în Principatele române de la 1821 la 1828'' ("Political and Social Turmoil in the Romanian Principalities from 1821 to 1828", [[Cartea Românească]], 1932). It has been described as a "non-partisan analysis" of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and its reverberations,&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; and features detail on the property dispute between local Orthodox monks and their [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Beguni, p.120, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative theories and ''Principatele române...''===
By 1928, I. C. Filitti's writing was moving from sheer historical research, as he was taking a stand in political theory. As noted by Ioan Stanomir, Filitti's evolution in this direction marks a final cycle in the history of classical, "[[Edmund Burke|Burkean]]", conservatism in Romania, which did not have a political aspect, but was complementary and contemporary with the views of his rival Nicolae Iorga.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.6-7&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stanomir, the objectivity professed by Filitti the historiographer was at odds with his ambition to rehabilitate ''Junimea'' and the Conservative cause, to prolong their relevancy into the 1930s.&lt;ref name="is130"/&gt; Some of his core ideas were updated versions of 19th-century ''Junimist'' concepts: the praise of moderation and organicity, the rejection of [[state capitalism]] and its "pseudo-[[bourgeoisie]]", and in particular the critique of generous [[Land reform in Romania|land reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.130-137&lt;/ref&gt; Directly influenced by the agrarian skepticism of Carp and Maiorescu, Filitti argued that the division of large estates into non-lucrative plots had only enhanced endemic problems, such as poverty or an unskilled workforce, and had prevented an organic growth toward [[good governance]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.131-135, 137&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti's diary chides the political establishment of Greater Romania for not obtaining sufficient guarantees of territorial integrity—particularly so against Russia's successor, the [[Soviet Union]]—and for deprofessionalizing the diplomatic corps.&lt;ref name="gf(08)14"/&gt;

From Maiorescu, Filitti borrowed the essential sociological concept of "forms without content", criticizing all modernization which did not take into account local realities, writing: "After seven decades of bourgeois forms, without a bourgeoisie, with all that maelstrom of laws and regulations, which has grown to cover 20,000 pages [...], the tally shows that [...] the villages of all places have registered no profit, although [...] Romania is, at heart, nothing but one giant village."&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; In his post-''Junimist'' studies, Filitti angrily noted that the PNL regime had only increased the ranks of the bureaucracy (and implicitly enlarged their [[political machine]]), perpetuating [[etatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.134-136&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed measures to counter this trend by encouraging a "rural bourgeoisie", "self-reliant", determined to reemerge "from the darkness and routine" of country life, and, in time, capable of supporting a national industry.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Filitti, who kept a vivid interest in Romanian Orthodox history, published ''Biserici și ctitori'' ("Churches and ''[[Ktitor]]s''").&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; He was preoccupied with similar thoughts when he decided to sponsor the rebuilding and refurbishing of two ancestral churches: the Dormition Church in Slatina, originally built by his Slătineanu relatives (whom he commemorated with a coat of arms, displayed over the church entrance); and the ''Sfântul Dumitru de Jurământ'' [[Metochion]] of Constandie Filitti (whom he had reburied on church premises).&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt;

It was in 1934 that I. C. Filitti registered one of his greatest successes, when he published a revised and extended version of his 1904 study: ''Principatele române de la 1828 la 1834. Ocupațiunea rusească și Regulamentul Organic'' ("The Romanian Principalities from 1828 to 1834. The Russian Occupation and ''Regulamentul Organic''"). The study even earned him accolades from Iorga, who called it "an extraordinarily rich work of pragmatic history".&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; The work mainly documents the emergence of a civic consciousness, called "public spirit" by Filitti, over the years when ''Regulamentul'' was in force, and speaks about how the Moldo-Wallachian Russophile class turned [[Russophobia|Russophobic]] as it became acquainted with [[Tsarist autocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mârza, p.83, 85, 86, 87-88. See also Beguni, p.114, 126&lt;/ref&gt; ''Principatele române...'' includes additional data on the rift between the liberal youth, with its ideal of [[National awakening of Romania|national liberation]], and the peasantry, more determined to terminate the ''[[corvée]]'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Balan, Dinu, [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/CC10/unire.pdf "Națiunea și societatea.

In 1935, Filitti completed his ''Proprietatea solului în Principatele române până la 1864'' ("Land Ownership in the Romanian Principalities to 1864") and ''Contribuții la istoria diplomatică a României în secolul al XIX-lea'' ("Contributions to the Diplomatic History of Romania in the 19th Century").&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; In ''Vechea organizare fiscală a Principatelor Române până la Regulamentul Organic'' ("On the Ancient Fiscal Order of the Romanian Principalities to ''Regulamentul Organic''"), he discussed the proliferation of state taxes over the centuries, and the measure to which the Orthodox clergy was exempted.&lt;ref&gt;Beguni, p.110, 125&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth book, on literary history, saw print with the title ''Cărți vechi privitoare la români'' ("Old Books Relating to the Romanians").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Lemny, Doina, [http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads/Biblioteca_Bucurestilor_2000_nr5.pdf "Știri despre români în două dicționare istorice din secolul al XVIII-lea"], in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 6/2000, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1935, he released a selection of his memoirs, as ''Câteva amintiri'' ("Some Recollections"), and set in print his conferences for the state [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Company]]: ''Dezvoltarea politică a României moderne'' ("The Political Development of Modern Romania").&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.70-71, 311, 132-133&lt;/ref&gt; Building on his previous research in ''Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino'', Filitti also contributed an article about the Romanian origins of French diplomat [[Maurice Paléologue]] (''[[Adevărul]]'' daily, September 29, 1935)&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; and edited for print the letters of Oltenian engineer [[Petrache Poenaru]] (''Arhivele Olteniei'', 74-76/1934).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Armeanca, E., [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandromanesc/1935/BCUCLUJ_FP_BALP73_1935_003_001.pdf "Mișcarea culturală.

His other contribution for 1935 was a collection of texts on [[political history]], called ''Pagini din istoria României moderne'' ("Pages from the History of Modern Romania"). The volume criticized the PNL's historical narrative, Romania's answer to [[Whig history|Whiggishness]], and noted that, from the beginning, the Conservatives were closer to the models of [[classical liberalism]] than their revolutionist opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.52-53&lt;/ref&gt; Published with the ''[[Lupta]]'' Graphic Arts Institute in 1936, Filitti's new essay revisited the birth and evolution of conservatism in the Danubian Principalities and then Romania: ''Conservatori și junimiști în viața politică românească'' ("Conservatives and ''Junimists'' in Romanian Political Life"). The work postulated that local conservatism had in fact originated within the first phase of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]], grouping opponents of the "extremist", "utopian", "exulted" force which became the National Liberal elite.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.47-48, 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, since the National Liberals had become the establishment and did away with their republican agenda, the Conservatives, "in reality moderate liberals", came to be falsely depicted as "[[Reactionary|reactionaries]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p.60-61&lt;/ref&gt; His retrospective portrait of ''Junimea'' was, according to Stanomir, particularly "melancholy", his own ''Junimism'' "never abjured".&lt;ref name="is130"/&gt;

===Final years===
In 1936, I. C. Filitti wrote an article defining the scope and history of the Legislative Council. It was featured in the anniversary collection of articles published by Council President [[Ioan Ionescu-Dolj]].&lt;ref&gt;Mâță, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; His revised work on the Cantacuzinos, published in Bucharest as ''Notice sur les Cantacuzène du XIe au XVIIe siècles'' ("Note on the Cantacuzinos from the 11th to the 14th Century"), traced the family links between Cantacuzino-Nababul and 14th-century [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[John VI Kantakouzenos|John VI]], whom Filitti identified as a usurper.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasiu, p.29, 33&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, he republished a political pamphlet by the 18th-century poet [[Alecu Văcărescu]], with the journal ''Preocupări Literare''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.981&lt;/ref&gt;

Filitti was preparing his retirement from public life, and designated his only son Manole as a curator of the Filitti Archive.&lt;ref name="mf&amp;lg31"&gt;Filitti, M. &amp; Guțanu, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Filitti Jr was a lawyer, financier and amateur [[Rugby union in Romania|rugby footballer]], who would later serve as manager of the Phoenix Oil Factory.&lt;ref name="lgconvorbire"/&gt; Married to actress Mimi Enăceanu,&lt;ref name="lgconvorbire"/&gt; he was for long based in Iași, sharing a villa with the poet [[Mihail Codreanu]]. It was there that Ioan C.'s grandson Ion was born in 1936. His baptism was a public affair involving some of the established aristocratic houses, and one of the last functions ever attended by Filitti Sr (who met and befriended Codreanu on the occasion).&lt;ref name="mf&amp;lg31"/&gt;

The [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship, with King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] at its helm, put an end to democratic rule in Greater Romania. Under these circumstances, I. C. Filitti was recovered by the official school of historians. From 1938, sociologist [[Dimitrie Gusti]] employed Filitti as an external contributor to the standard Romanian dictionary, ''[[Enciclopedia României]]''. His "fundamental" contribution was, according to Stanomir, the "Legislative Council" entry, included in Volume I.&lt;ref name="is130"/&gt; Together with I. C. Vântu, Filitti also wrote the section on the [[Former administrative divisions of Romania|administrative reform]], whereby Carol had replaced the counties with larger ''ținuturi''. This entry justified Carol's ideas on territorial division, describing the new regions as organic, "moral, cultural, economic and financial" units.&lt;ref&gt;Păunoiu, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; The two authors offered praise to the supposedly increased representative powers of [[Commune in Romania|communes]], and to the laws protecting private property within urban domains.&lt;ref&gt;Păunoiu, p.98-99&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Georgeta Filitti, I. C. Filitti was again dissatisfied with the finished product: "The [''Enciclopedia''] copy he left comprises numerous rectifications to his own entries and observations made on those of other authors, which would be welcomed for any future reediting."&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt; Filitti's other contribution for 1938 is an eponymous volume about the 1821 Wallachian revolutionist [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], with the subtitle: ''Rostul răscoalei lui'' ("The Purpose of His Revolt").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.984&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 1938, Filitti was also General Administrative Inspector of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Armand Călinescu]], Al. Gh. Savu, ''Însemnări politice 1916–1939'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1990, p.395.  {{ISBN|973-28-0164-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of [[World War II]] again pushed him away from public life. Romania was an [[Axis Powers|Axis country]], and, as such, Bucharest endured [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|heavy bombardments]] by the [[United States Air Force]]. The air attack of April 4, 1944, effectively destroyed the Filitti residence, its art collection (including [[Murano glass]]ware) and scores of unedited documents.&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"/&gt; The historian survived, but, according to Georgeta Filitti, the incident "hastened his death".&lt;ref name="gf(95)48"/&gt;

I. C. Filitti died in September 1945, almost a year after [[King Michael's Coup]] broke with the Axis. By his own account, he had published 82 volumes, 267 topical articles, and completed some 700 [[family tree]]s.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46-47"/&gt; Many of these texts were circular of "rectifications" to previous editions, addressed to the community of scientists at large.&lt;ref name="gf(95)47"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Filitti's death occurred shortly before a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]] came into existence. He was survived by his wife and son. An aristocrats by blood and conservatives by conviction, Ioan C.'s descendants and relatives suffered heavily as a result of the new policies: the outspoken [[anti-communist]] Filitti-Robănești became a [[political prisoner]], as did his cousin Puiu Filitti, who had been the King's [[Adjutant]].&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt; Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]], but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti took it upon himself to face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt;

Upon release, Manole and part of the Filitti clan moved into a single Bucharest home, located near the [[Darvari Skete]]. Reintegrated as a clerk for nationalized enterprises, he remarried, in 1985, to historian Georgeta Penelea.&lt;ref name="lgconvorbire"/&gt; Of [[Croats of Romania|Croat]] and [[Istro-Romanians|Istro-Romanian]] ancestry, she is related to prestigious woman reporter [[Mihaela Catargi]].&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt; Manole's son Ion had a career in engineering, but could not advance professionally due to his aristocratic lineage.&lt;ref name="trcealalta"&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu, Tania, [http://www.revista22.ro/cealalta-romanie-1323.html "Cealaltă Românie"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 768, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to [[West Germany]], where a branch of the Filittis still resides.&lt;ref name="trcealalta"/&gt;

Although [[Censorship in Communist Romania|officially censored]], Filitti's work was not entirely inaccessible. As indicated by Victor Rizescu, under orthodox [[Marxism-Leninism]], the idea of boyar precedence in the early Danubian Principalities was not discarded, but rather integrated within a "[[modes of production]]" theory.&lt;ref name="vrideol"/&gt; Some of Filitti's books were reprinted in the 1980s, when [[national communism]] allowed selective exposure to Romania's conservative schools of thought. As noted by historian [[Ovidiu Pecican]], the regime was trying to encourage "[[Autarky|autarkic]] [[xenophobia]]", preventing intellectuals from receiving Western ideas, but in exchange allowing them a selective recovery of old ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Pecican|Pecican, Ovidiu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/AVALON.-Trecut-si-viitor-istoriografic*articleID_25930-articles_details.html "Avalon. Trecut și viitor istoriografic"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 594, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, ''Proprietatea solului...'', ''Frământări politice și sociale...'' and ''România față de capitulațiile Turciei'' were reissued in critical editions.&lt;ref name="gf(95)46"/&gt; On the academic side, the main contributor to this particular recovery project was Georgeta Penelea-Filitti, also distinguished as the editor of books by Iorga, [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], and other intellectual figures.&lt;ref name="dsgfpecetea"/&gt;

The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] resulted in more consideration being granted to I. C. Filitti, as both researcher and polemicist. The Filitti Archive, preserved by Manole Filitti, was divided into separate funds, and divided between several institutions: the [[Romanian Academy Library]], the [[National Archives of Romania|National Archives]], the [[Cotroceni Palace]] collection, and the Ialomița County Museum.&lt;ref name="mf&amp;lg31"/&gt; Selections from the historian's diaries were published by Georgeta Filitti as fascicles in the academic review ''Revista Istorică'', during the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.54, 157, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning 2008, she published the diary in book form, with the Ialomița Museum press and Cetatea de Scaun company of [[Târgoviște]].&lt;ref name="gf(08)14"/&gt;

Romania's academic community was thus prompted to reassess the overall value of Ioan C. Filitti's work. The popular history review ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'' grants an I. C. Filitti Award as one of its four annual distinctions for exceptional research and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitrescu, Valentin, [http://www.revista22.ro/conferintele-teatrului-national-11747.html "Conferințele Teatrului Național"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1129, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Editura Compania]] company published historian [[Dan Berindei]]'s book of scholarly biographies, which notably includes a chapter on Filitti. According to Boia, Berindei bracketed out Filitti's entire career in occupied Romania, while expressing a vague regret that Filitti never reached his full potential in diplomacy. Boia asks rhetorically: "the historian knows [the reason for this], shouldn't the reader also find it out?"&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist Cristian Cercel, Ioan Stanomir takes credit for having helped recover Filitti's contributions as conservative theorist, which had been "all too soon forgotten."&lt;ref name="ccconsaut"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cercel, Cristian, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Conservatorismul-autohton-ieri-si-azi*articleID_14449-articles_details.html "Conservatorismul autohton, ieri și azi"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 298, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2004 book ''Conștiința conservatoare'' ("The Conservative Consciousness"), Stanomir places Filitti alongside [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Alexandru Duțu]] and [[Virgil Nemoianu]], as one of the intellectuals who preserved a place for ''Junimist'' conservatism into the latter 20th century and beyond.&lt;ref name="ccconsaut"/&gt;

'''Jim Falk''' (born {{Birth date|df=yes|1946|10|26}}) is a physicist and academic researcher on [[science and technology studies]].

==Background==
Falk was born in Oxford, England. His father was the philosopher Werner D. Falk (latterly professor at the University of North Carolina&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/17/obituaries/werner-d-falk-85-philosophy-professor.html&lt;/ref&gt;), and his mother an Australian, Dr. Barbara Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;http://genealogy.metastudies.net/PS01/PS01_001.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Falk had fled Germany prior to World War II and was studying and lecturing at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;http://metastudies.net/genealogy/ZDocs/WDFALK/FALKCH.html&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Australia when Jim Falk was young, when his father worked at the University of Melbourne. Falk attended [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] from 1952 to 1964, graduated with first class honours in physics at [[Monash University]] in 1968, and received his PhD from Monash in theoretical quantum physics in 1974. His late partner for 47 years was Emeritus Professor Sue Rowley (1948-2016), with whom he had two children.&lt;ref&gt;http://memories-of-sue.metastudies.net&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Falk lives in Melbourne as do his now adult children and their families.

Positions held:
*1976–1979 Lecturer (P/T), [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] and Swinburne College of Advanced Education
*1979 Research officer, Senator Arthur Gietzelt (Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs)
*1980–1996 Lecturer to professor, Department of History and Philosophy of Science/Science and Technology Studies, [[University of Wollongong]]
*1996–2000 Professor of Science and Technology Studies and pro vice-chancellor, [[University of Western Sydney]]
*2000–2004 Professor of Science and Technology Studies and deputy vice-chancellor [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]], Melbourne
*2005–2010 Foundation director, Australian Centre for Science, Innovation and Society, and professorial fellow, The [[University of Melbourne]]

In December 2010 he retired, but remained an honorary professorial fellow in the [[Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute]], at [[The University of Melbourne]].  He was the founding director of Climate Change research for the [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities World Institute]], and holds appointments also of visiting professor to the [[Institute of Advanced Studies of Sustainability at the United Nations University]] (in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]]), and emeritus professor at the University of Wollongong.

==Scholarly contributions==

For over 35 years Falk has studied science and technology in their social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;http://metastudies.net/Site_Introduction/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked towards advancing understanding of the political, economic and cultural factors which constrain or facilitate the exercise of social control over technological change, latterly in relation to climate change and information technology but particularly [[nuclear technology]], arms races and [[militarisation]].  Most recently he has focussed on the broad issues of human governance (including what needs to be done to respond to challenges faced by humanity from climate change, to energy policy, and to significant issues associated with information flows and military threats).

Falk's most recent book, co-authored with Joseph Camilleri, was launched by UNDP head, the Hon Helen Clark, in Sydney, Australia in February 2010.  The book "Worlds in Transition: Evolving Governance Across a Stressed Planet", Edward Elgar, UK, is a synoptic overview of the way in which humans have come to collectively seek to shape their futures, and the challenges posed to that in a time of rapid transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1794209.htm Nuclear opponents criticise report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aussmc.org.au/Australias_uranium_resources.php Rapid Roundup: New uranium report – scientists comment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719164610/http://www.aussmc.org.au/Australias_uranium_resources.php |date=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falk has made a number of media appearances in relation to the nuclear accidents at Fukushima and the implications for future energy policy.  Jim Falk has recently authored a short e-book "Things that Count: the rise and fall of calculators" on the social history of calculation technology.  It can be downloaded from a website he maintains on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://things-that-count.net http://things-that-count.net]&lt;/ref&gt; His current scholarly work is on the proposals associated with geoengineering, which were the subject of a seminar he presented at the United Nations University Institute of Advanced Studies in Yokohama, Japan, in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unu.edu/events/archive/seminar/geo-engineering-proposals-and-climate-change.html#overviewa seminar he presented at the United Nations University Institute of Advanced Studies in Yokohama, Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joanelle Romero''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[humanitarian]], [[filmmaker]], actress, recording artist and entrepreneur. She is the founder of [[Red Nation Media]], an internet and television channel. In 2007 she was designated a [[Women's History Month]] Honoree by the [[National Women's History Project]].&lt;ref name="WHM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=Joanelle Romero | work=Women's History Month | publisher=[[National Women's History Project]] | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/romero_bio.php | accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Joanelle Romero was born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], in 1957. She was raised in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt;

==Professional career==

In 1991 Romero founded Spirit World Productions, a Native American television, film and music production company. She was inspired to create Spirit World Productions due to the lack of Native voice in the entertainment industry. Spirit World released ''American Holocaust: When It’s All Over I’ll Still Be Indian'', a [[documentary film]] narrated by [[Ed Asner]]. Romero directed, produced, wrote and scored the music for the film that compares the [[Holocaust]] with the United States governments treatment of American Indians and the lasting effects on contemporary culture.&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt;

Joanelle Romero founded the non-profit organization [[Red Nation Celebration]] (RNC) in 1995 with the goal of exploring, presenting and promoting contemporary and traditional Native American performing arts internationally. In 2006 she founded Red Nation Media Internet and Television Channel with all Native American programming.&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt; In 2005 she was the recipient of the [[Armin T. Wegner|Armin T. Wegner Humanitarian Award]] for "the vision to see the truth…and the courage to speak it." Romero started the first [[Native American Heritage Month]] in Los Angeles in November 2005, garnering her the title "The First Lady" of American Indian Heritage Month.&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt;

As an actress, Romero has appeared in the films ''[[The Girl Called Hatter Fox]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076087/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm The Girl Called Hatter Fox: Full Cast &amp; Crew] IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; (1977 TV movie based on the novel by [[Marilyn Harris (writer)|Marilyn Harris]], which marked the first time a Native American actress played a leading role), ''[[Barbarosa]]'', ''[[Parasite (film)|Parasite]]'' and ''[[Powwow Highway]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Joanelle Romero | work=Movies | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/1136703/Joanelle-Romero | accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a singer and a songwriter she worked with [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Sinead O'Connor]], and [[Michael Jackson]]. She performs traditional spiritual and country blues songs.

'''John F. Carroll''' (1932–1969) is one of [[List of tallest people|17 known people]] in medical history to have reached a height of {{convert|8|ft|m}} or more. He suffered from severe, [[2-dimensional]] spinal curvature ([[Kyphoscoliosis]]) and [[Acromegaly|acromegalic]] gigantism. He had a standing height of 244 centimeters (8 feet 0 inches) on October 14,1959 at age 27  but his height would have been 264 centimeters (8 feet 7¾ inches), assuming normal curvature of the spine. He was later measured at 239 centimeters (7 feet 10½inches) in 1968, having shrunk in stature due to his worsening spinal condition.

Shortly before Carroll's death in 1969 his standing height was 234 centimeters (7 feet 8¼ inches). His corrected height was not recorded but may have been close to nine feet.

Carroll was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] and also known as the Buffalo Giant in medical literature. He was third in stature only to [[Robert Wadlow]] and [[John Rogan]]. His extraordinary growth started at the age of sixteen and continued until his death, despite extensive treatments at Mercy Hospital. At one point he grew eight inches in height in a year. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in [[Lackawanna, New York]].

'''Count Josip Jelačić von [[Bužim]]''' (16 October 1801{{snd}}20 May 1859;&lt;ref name="HBL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jelačić, Josip|encyclopedia=Hrvatski biografski leksikon|url=http://hbl.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=135|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]]|year=2005|language=hr|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled ''Jellachich'',&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt; ''Jellačić''&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt; or {{lang|hu|Jellasics}}; in Croatian: ''Josip grof Jelačić Bužimski'') was the [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of [[Croatia]] between 23 March 1848 and 19 May 1859. He was a member of the [[House of Jelačić]] and a noted army general, remembered for his military campaigns during the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and for his abolition of [[serfdom]] in Croatia.

== Early life and military ==
The son of Croatian Baron [[Franjo Jelačić|Franjo Jelačić Bužimski]] (or in other documents, {{lang|de|Franz Freiherr Jelačić von [[Bužim]]}}) (1746–1810), a lieutenant [[Field Marshal]], and Austrian mother [[Anna Portner von Höflein]], Jelačić was born in the town of [[Petrovaradin]], at the time part of the [[Slavonian Military Frontier]] of the [[Habsburg Empire]] (today part of [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]]). He was educated in [[Vienna]] at the [[Theresian Military Academy]], where he received a versatile education, showing particular interest in history and foreign languages. He entrained in the Austrian army on 11 March 1819 with the rank of lieutenant [[Vinko Freiherr von Knežević]] Regiment, named for his uncle. He was fluent in all South-Slavic languages, as well as German, [[Italian language|Italian]], and French.

On 1 May 1825 he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]], and to [[Captain (land)|captain]] by 1 September 1830 in [[Karlovac]], Croatia.

On 17 October 1835, he led a military campaign against Bosnian [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops in [[Velika Kladuša]] for which he received a medal.{{Which|date=December 2009}} He was promoted to major on 20 February 1837 in the [[Freiherr von Gollner]] regiment, and on the first of May in 1841 to [[lieutenant colonel]] in the 1st Croatian Frontier Guard Regiment in [[Glina, Croatia]], then promoted to [[colonel]] on October 18.

On 22 March, Jelačić was promoted to [[major-general]], and simultaneously the [[Sabor]] (the National Assembly of Croatia) elected him as [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of Croatia. The Sabor also declared that the first elections or representatives to the assembly would be held in May 1848.

Jelačić was promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal on 7 April 1848, becoming the commander of all Habsburg troops in Croatia.

In 1850 he married [[s:hr:Sofija Jelačić|Sofija Stockau]], daughter of Count Georg Stockau, in [[Napajedla]].

== Hungarian Revolution of 1848 ==
[[File:Ban standard.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Flag of Ban Josip Jelačić, 1848]]

{{Main|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}
{{See also|Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas}}

Jelačić supported independence for Croatia from the Austrian throne.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  However, in pursuit of this goal Jelačić sought to support this goal by ingratiating himself with the Austrian throne by actively supporting Austrian interests in putting down revolutionary movements in northern Italy in 1848 and in actively opposing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848–1849.  Consequently, Jelačić's, reputation differs in [[Austria]] where he was looked upon as a rebel seeking to break up the Austrian Empire, [[Croatia]] where he is a national hero, and [[Hungary]] where he looked up as a traitor to the Hungarian Revolution for independence from Austrian throne.{{Why?|date=December 2009}}

He traveled to [[Vienna]] to take oaths to become counsel of Austrian Emperor, [[Ferdinand I of Austria]], but refused to take the oath as Ban of Croatia, because it was a Hungarian [[dependent territory]]. The relations between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] deteriorated after the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 15 March 1848&lt;!-- does this need saying? They were hardly likely to be friends --&gt;. But he later took the oath as Ban of Croatia on 5 June 1848. Because of the absence of Bishop [[Juraj Haulik]], he took the oath before the Orthodox Patriarch [[Josif Rajačić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jelačić, now Ban, supported the Croatian aim to maintain autonomy from the Kingdom of Hungary. Jelačić proceeded to sever all official ties of Croatia from Hungary. The Austrian Imperial Court initially opposed this act as one of disobedience and separatism, declaring him to be a rebel and the Sabor to be illegitimate. But the court soon realized Jelačić and his Croatian army were a support against the newly formed [[Batthyány Government]]. Traveling back to [[Zagreb]] in April, Jelačić refused to cede to this new government, refused any cooperation, and called for elections to the Sabor on 25 March 1848.

== Croatian Parliament, the Sabor ==
[[File:Abolition of serfdom in Croatia.jpg|thumb|250px|Ban Josip Jelačić's proclamation abolishing serfdom]]
The Sabor – now acting as the National Assembly – declared the following demands to the Habsburg emperor:

# The union of all Croatian provinces (Croatian-Slavonian Kingdom, [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]).
# Separation from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].
# Abolition of [[serfdom]].
# Full civil rights.
# Affirmation of the equality of nations.

Many of his points about civil rights were part of the Hungarian [[twelve points]], and were already enacted by the [[Batthyány Government]].

The Sabor strongly opposed the "massive nationalist [[Magyarization]] politics of the Kingdom of Hungary from the [[Carpathians]] to [[Adria]], which the newly formed government represents, especially [[Lajos Kossuth]]."

On 8 April Jelačić took his banal oath and was appointed a field-marshal-lieutenant and made commander of the Military Frontier.&lt;ref name=Tanner&gt;Tanner, Marcus (2001). Croatia : a nation forged in war (2nd ed.). New Haven; London: Yale University Press, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 1848 Jelačić proclaimed the union of Croatian provinces, and the separation from the Kingdom of Hungary. At the same time, he proclaimed unconditional loyalty to the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. The [[Croatian Constitution]] of 24 April 1848 declared "languages of all ethnicities should be inviolable".

On serfdom, it was apparent that changing the status of the Croatian [[peasantry]] would have to wait until the end of the revolution. Jelačić kept up the institution of the [[Military Frontier]] so he could draft more soldiers. The people in the region protested to this, but Ban Jelačić quashed the dissent by summary [[court-martial|courts martial]] and by executing many dissenters.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In May, Jelačić established the ''Bansko Vijeće'' ("Ban Council"). Its scope of authority covered ministerial tasks including Internal Affairs, Justice, Schools and Education, Religion, Finance, and Defense, so this council was acting as a governing body in Croatia. The new Sabor was summoned on 5 June.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;

== Intermediary discussions ==
The Austrian emperor called Jelačić to [[Innsbruck]], to which the Imperial Court had fled, and the Emperor there told him that the Croatian and Slavonian troops in the Italian provinces wanted to join forces with those in Croatia, but that this would weaken the forces in Italy. So Jelačić called on all troops stationed in the Italian provinces to remain calm and to stay put.

The Austrian court did not grant the separation of Croatia from Hungary. During his travels back to Zagreb, Jelačić read in the [[Lienz]] railway station that on 10 June the Emperor had relieved him of all his positions. But Jelačić was still loyal to the Emperor, and kept relations with the Imperial Court, especially with [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophia]], the mother of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].

Immediately after arriving at Zagreb, Jelačić got the order to join the discussions with the Hungarian government in [[Vienna]]. During these, Jelačić stated that his position was derived from the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], while [[Lajos Batthyány]] called him "a separatist" seeking to break away from the Habsburg Monarchy. Jelačić called this a "rebellion". Batthyány warned Jelačić that this could mean war. Jelačić stopped the discussions, saying that "civil war is the worst that could happen" – but that he "would not be intimidated by this, however shocking it might be to hear". Negotiations were closed with Batthyány saying "see you (on the river) Drava" and with Jelačić responding "no need to tire yourself. See you on the Danube."

Jelačić returned to Croatia. Hungarian troops had gathered on the border and hostile proclamations were made against him.{{Who|date=December 2009}}

== War against the Kingdom of Hungary ==
In August, Jelačić proclaimed a decree for the Croatians, where he denied accusations of separating Croatia in the name of [[Panslavism]]. In the decree he said
{{quote|Being a son of the [Croatian] nation, being the supporter of liberty, and being subject to Austria, I am faithfully committed to the constitutional Emperor of the Empire and its Kings, and I long for a great, free Austria}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

His closing words were:

{{quote|The Hungarian Government, as it is evident, would not like to agree on this; they insist on their separatist moves, which means they struggle to dismantle our Empire. It is the command of our duty and honour to go till the ultimate and to call for arms against them. And we, not sparing our wealth, blood and life, will stand for our rightful demands and sacred deeds.}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Jelačić felt disorder growing in the Austrian Empire, and decided on immediate action. On 11 September at [[Varaždin]] he crossed the River [[Drava]] with 45,000 soldiers, and auxiliary troops (another 8,000 soldiers), led by [[Brigadier]] [[Karl Roth]],{{Who|date=December 2009}} crossed the Drava lower down.

Jelačić occupied [[Međimurje]] ({{lang-hu|Muraköz}}), which was mostly Croatian. The two forces were poorly armed because of the rapid engagement. [[Materiel]] was not well organised, so the advance into Hungarian territory was difficult. Supplies were taken from the local population.

The Hungarian squadrons led by Count [[Ladislaus von Wrbna-Freudenthal]],{{Who|date=December 2009}} Baron [[Karl Freiherr Kreß von Kressenstein]]{{Who|date=December 2009}} and Count [[Heinrich Graf zu Hardegg]]{{Who|date=December 2009}} joined Jelačić's troops.

The enthusiasm of the Croatian troops grew when at [[Siófok]] the Ban received a letter from Ferdinand I cancelling the decree removing him from all positions, also promoting him to be general commander of all troops in Hungary.

During his march toward Pest and Buda (now conjoined as the towns of [[Budapest]]), Jelačić got a message from Archduke Stephen, situated in [[Veszprém]], to inform him of the decision of the Emperor that Lajos Batthyány was approved to set up a new government, and calling him to stop the troops, and to discuss further actions at his office. Jelačić replied he could not stop his army then, but was prepared for discussions with the archduke at the port of [[Balatonszemes]]. The meeting did not take place. According to Austrian sources,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} advisors to Jelačić persuaded him not to attend, because of a threat of assassination by agents of the Hungarian Government. After this fiasco, Palatine Stephen resigned and left Hungary, under the Emperor's orders.

=== Battle of Pákozd ===
[[File:Pakozdi csata EN.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The battle in the Pákozd triangle]]
{{Main|Battle of Pákozd}}

Jelačić's army occupied [[Székesfehérvár]] on 26 September 1848. The same day the Emperor appointed lieutenant-general [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] as general commanding all troops in Hungary, but this was annulled by the Hungarian Parliament. [[Lajos Kossuth]] called the Hungarians for resistance, and the ''Országos Honvédelmi Bizottmány'' (National Homeguarding Committee) was given the power of execution. Lamberg, trying to take over the command of the Hungarian troops was identified and killed.

Jelačić advanced onward, reached [[Lake Velence]] on 29 September, where he met Hungarian troops. After the first strikes, lieutenant-general [[János Móga]] withdrew to north to [[Sukoró]]. Jelačić demanded Móga stand against the rebels, and "get back to the road of honour and duty", but Móga refused, and his army attacked Jelačić between his position and Pákozd.&lt;ref name="museum.hu"&gt;[http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331 Pákozd-Sukoró Battle 1848 Exhibition],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://masprogram.freeweb.hu/kep/kep6/pakoz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after, 30 September, Jelačić asked for a three-day ceasefire; he wanted to use these days to wait for Roth's army. He assessed the greater numbers of the Hungarian troops and the poor armaments and tiredness of his own troops. On 1 October the supply routes to Croatia were cut by rebels, so he advanced toward [[Vienna]]. On 3 October Móga was pursuing after Jelačić, but did not want to make an attack.

On 4 October, [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] reappointed Jelačić as the general commander of all troops in Hungary, and dissolved the Hungarian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]].

=== Vienna Revolt ===
{{main|Vienna Uprising}}
Austrian Minister of War [[Theodor Baillet von Latour]] called the guards in Vienna to join the troops of Jelačić, but this caused a riot in Vienna on 6 October in which Latour was killed.

On 7 October Hungarian General [[Mór Perczel]] defeated the armies of General Roth and [[Josip Filipović]], and took them prisoner. The Hungarian Parliament annulled the Emperor's decree of October 4.

Jelačić moved onward to Vienna to join the troops around the city. Under Lieutenant-General Todorović, he organised a body of 14,000 soldiers to move south to Stayer{{Where|date=July 2011}} to protect Croatia.

The Viennese revolution committee called for aid from the Hungarian Government. On 10 October at [[Laaer Berg]] near Vienna, Jelačić joined Austrian troops led by Auersperg, and the army was strengthened with troops from [[Bratislava]], a regiment of [[Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn]] and [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]'s regiment. Jelačić's forces were soon under Field Marshal [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz|Windisch-Grätz]]. On 21 October, seeing trouble ahead, Móga stopped at the Austrian border, and the revolution in Vienna was suppressed. Jelačić's forces were fighting in the Landstrasse, Erdberg and Weissgerber suburbs.

=== The winter campaign of Windisch-Grätz ===
[[File:Téli hadjárat 1848 49 2.png|thumb|left|200px|Movements in the Winter Campaign]]
{{Main|Battle of Schwechat}}
{{See also|Battle of Mór}}

On 21 October – too late – [[Lajos Kossuth]] ordered Móga to turn back to Vienna, they met forces of Jelačić at [[Schwechat]] on 30 October. A day of artillery fighting broke out, and Jelačić initiated a counterattack in the evening. Led by General {{ill|Karl von Zeisberg|de}}, the attack pushed back the Hungarian forces and defeated them. After this defeat, Móga stepped down as general commander, and Kossuth nominated general [[Artúr Görgey]] in his place.

On 2 December 1848 [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] abdicated, and [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] was installed as Emperor. On 13 December Windisch-Grätz crossed the Hungarian border. On 16 December, Jelačić also crossed the border and defeated Hungarian troops at [[Parndorf]], later occupying [[Mosonmagyaróvár]] and [[Győr]]. Being informed that [[Mór Perczel]] was stationed at [[Mór]], Jelačić made a detour toward this city and defeated the Hungarian troops there, taking into custody 23 officers and 2,000 [[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|honvéd]]. With this battle, [[Budapest|Pest-Buda]] became vulnerable, so the Hungarian government fled to [[Debrecen]]. Görgey could resist the march of Jelačić at [[Tétény]] for some time, but on 5 January Windisch-Grätz, together with Jelačić occupied Pest-Buda.

=== Later military campaigns ===
{{Main|Battle of Kápolna}}

After the occupation of Pest and [[Buda]] the larger campaigns were over. Windischgrätz declared a military dictatorship, caught the Hungarian leader [[Lajos Batthyány]] and asked for surrender. He moved to [[Debrecen]] but was stopped by Perczel at [[Szolnok]] and [[Abony]]. Kossuth nominated [[Henryk Dembiński]] to replace [[Artúr Görgey]], and started a strategic counterattack but was defeated near Kápolna.

Windisch-Grätz ordered Jelačić to quick march to [[Jászfényszaru]]. On 4 April [[György Klapka|Klapka]] attacked him but at [[Tápióbicske]] the bayonets of Jelačić pushed them back. On 5 March Damjanich reoccupied Szolnok. Jelačić now got a new order to turn from Jászfényszaru and head to [[Gödöllő]]. On 2 April Jelačić met [[János Damjanich]] at [[Tápióbicske]] and was defeated. On 6 April Windisch-Grätz and Jelačić, were defeated in the [[Battle of Isaszeg (1849)|Battle of Isaszeg]], retreating to [[Rákospatak]], a suburb of Pest-Buda.

After the defeat, Windisch-Grätz was relieved of general command, and was replaced by General Welden and later [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]]. Jelačić was ordered to gather the scattered troops in southern Hungary and to organise an army. This consisted of 15,800 infantry, 5,100 cavalry and 74 cannon, and moved to [[Osijek]] immediately. During his march south, Jelačić had to suppress rebellions, especially in [[Pécs]]. After a series of wrong decisions, Jelačić's army could not join up with the Emperor's, so it was put to defensive fights.

=== Battles in Slavonia ===
{{See also|Battle of Temesvár}}
In May, 1849 Jelačić moved from [[Osijek]] to [[Vukovar]], [[Ilok]], [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Tovarnik]] and [[Irig, Serbia|Irig]]. He set up base at [[Ruma]].

He was in a bad situation, as the Austrians were calling for the help of [[Russian Empire]] to suppress the Hungarians and the support from Vienna dissolved. Jelačić was lacking proper [[materiel]], and many of his troops died of [[cholera]].

The Serbian troops, led by [[Kuzman Todorović]], had to surrender strategic points to the honvédség (Hungarian Army). The Hungarians occupied and fortified Petrovaradin, where the troops received supplies because the population supported the Hungarian revolution. In April, Mór Perczel occupied [[Srbobran]] and broke up the [[encirclement]] of [[Petrovaradin]], defeated Todorović so he could occupy [[Pančevo]] and finally, together with [[Józef Bem]], occupied Temes County (now [[Timiş County]], Romania).

Jelačić, cut off from all supplies, fortified his armies for defense and fought small battles in Slavonia. The supplies from the Austrian Empire were stuck at [[Stari Slankamen]]. In June he decided to break out and advance to [[Sombor]] – [[Dunaföldvár]]. During his march, on 6 June, Perczel attacked him near [[Kać]] and [[Žabalj]]. He defeated Perczel, marched forward, but could not occupy [[Novi Sad]].

On 24 June he successfully occupied Óbecse, but was retaken by Hungarians on 28th. This way Jelačić could not dislodge the Hungarian forces from [[Bačka]]. On 6 July [[Richard Guyon]] drove out the Croatian troops at [[Mali Iđoš]]. On 14 July Hungarians took control over [[Feketić]] and [[Lovćenac]], defeating Jelačić in the [[Battle of Hegyes]]. Jelačić had to retreat. This was the last battle in the region.

After [[Timişoara]] fell, Jelačić joined Haynau's troops, and after the end of revolution, he traveled to Vienna to take part in discussions of reorganising Croatia, Slavonia and the frontier regions.

== After the Revolution ==
When peace was restored, Jelačić returned to Croatia where he was treated as national hero, the saviour of the homeland.

[[File:Funeral of Josip Jelačić.jpg|thumb|250px|Funeral procession in Zagreb]]
After the war the Empire's new constitution stripped the local authorities in Hungary of their political power, but this punishment also affected Croatia despite its assistance to the imperial cause during the revolution. Nevertheless, Jelačić implemented the new Constitution (published 4 March 1849), and proceeded to outlaw various newspapers that published anti-Austrian opinions. In 1851, when [[Baron Alexander von Bach]] came to power in the Kingdom of Hungary, Jelačić worked under him and made no objections to the [[Germanization]] of Croatia. He remained in office until his death.

He died on 20 May 1859 in [[Zagreb]], after an illness. He is buried in [[Zaprešić]], in a grave near his castle.

In his time and shortly after, Jelačić was a fairly unpopular figure among the Croatian political elite, including [[Ante Starčević]] and others, and especially among the people who suffered losses due to his military campaigns and had little benefit from his economic measures.

Today, Jelačić is considered an important and admirable figure in Croatian history, alongside [[Ante Starčević]], and [[Stjepan Radić]], the Croatian political leader until 1928. The central square of the city of [[Zagreb]] was named [[Ban Jelačić Square]] in 1848, and a statue of him by [[Anton Dominik Fernkorn]] was erected in the square in 1866, removed under Communist rule in 1947, and reinstalled in 1990, after the fall of Communism.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

The patriotic song "[[Ustani bane]]" (''Rise, Ban'') was written to glorify Jelačić.

In Hungary, he is a very unpopular historical figure. He is often referred to as "Jelasics the coward," who "runs back to Vienna with his army beaten", quote from [[Sándor Petőfi]]'s poem ''A vén zászlótartó''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magyar-irodalom.elte.hu/sulinet/igyjo/setup/portrek/petofi/venzasz.htm Petőfi Sándor: A vén zászlótartó]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jelačić's portrait is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Croatian 20 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] banknote, issued in 1993 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Karol Aída Cariola Oliva''' (born April 1, 1987) is a Chilean [[midwife]], and former president of the ''Federación de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Concepción'' ([[University of Concepción]] Student Federation) for 2010. She was elected [[General Secretary]] of the [[Juventudes Comunistas de Chile]], abbr. JJ.CC., (the youth wing of the [[Communist Party of Chile]]) at the organizations ''XIII Congress'' held in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=6 October 2011|url=http://www.tercerainformacion.es/spip.php?article29385|title=Dirigenta estudiantil, Karol Cariola, es la nueva Secretaria General de la JJ.CC.|publisher=Tercera Informacion Spain|last=|first=|accessdate=23 October 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cariola is the second woman to hold this post in the Communist Youth of Chile after the late communist leader [[Gladys Marin]] (1941-2005).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=3 October 2011|url=http://www.cnnchile.com/nacional/2011/10/03/el-partido-comunista-y-su-recambio-generacional/|title=El Partido Comunista y su recambio generacional|publisher=CNN Chile|last=|first=|accessdate=23 October 2011|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401011515/http://www.cnnchile.com/nacional/2011/10/03/el-partido-comunista-y-su-recambio-generacional/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August the 4th, 2013 Cariola emerged as the leading congressional candidate in the [[New Majority (Chile)|New Majority]] coalition's primary elections for the electoral district of [[Recoleta, Chile|Recoleta]] and [[Independencia, Chile|Independencia]].

Subsequently, during the [[Chilean general election, 2013|Chilean general election]] held on November 17, 2013 she won 38.47% of the votes and became the deputy-elect for the 19th electoral [[Santiago]] district of [[Recoleta, Chile|Recoleta]] and [[Independencia, Chile|Independencia]]. She commenced to serve a four-year term in the [[Chilean Congress]] on 11 March 2014.&lt;ref name=PCCh.CL&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| date =18 November 2013| title =Resultados electorales del PC| url =http://www.pcchile.cl/?p=8399| work =| publisher =PCCh.cl| accessdate =28 November 2013| language =es| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20131128044616/http://www.pcchile.cl/?p=8399| archivedate =28 November 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emol/&gt;

==Student movement for public education==
Cariola was elected General Secretary of the JJ.CC. amidst one of the most significant mass social mobilization in recent Chilean history – referred by the media as the [[2011 Chilean protests|Chilean Winter]]. This mobilization saw students across Chile refuse to return to school or university, from April 2011 to the end of the academic year, in protest and to demand an end to the [[privatization]] of education.  Cariola has stated that the student mobilization, protests and strikes had a political nature and she refuted the statement made by the [[Sebastián Piñera|Chilean government]] spokesperson [[Andrés Chadwick]] that the ''CONFECH'' (Chile’s Confederation of Student Unions) has been taken over by extremist elements.

In an interview with [[CNN Chile]] Cariola stated that it was a grave mistake to refer to the student movement in that manner: 
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:65%"&gt;“''I think our country is at a historic moment, that it is necessary to generate structural changes….We have had a process that has led this country to develop a new consciousness. Chile today is not the same that it was 6 months ago, there is an eagerness to generate changes and the need to do so''.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=10 October 2011|url=http://www.cnnchile.com/nacional/2011/10/10/es-un-desacierto-del-gobierno-pronunciarse-asi-frente-a-este-movimiento/|title=Es un desacierto del Gobierno pronunciarse así frente a este movimiento|publisher=CNN Chile|last=|first=|accessdate=2 November 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parliamentary candidature and general elections==
Cariola has stated that "Chile and its people have to draft a new constitution"&lt;ref name=Publimetro&gt;{{cite web | last = Saleh| first = Felipe| date= 19 July 2013 
 | title = Karol Cariola: "Tengo mucho en qué contribuir"

 | work =   | publisher = Publimetro| accessdate = 12 August 2013|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that within the [[New Majority (Chile)|Nueva Mayoria]] coalition she intends to fight for a [[Constituent Assembly]] to oversee a change to the existing Chilean Constitution. Cariola - in line with the leader of the ''Nueva Mayoria'', [[Michelle Bachelet]] - believes that the [[Constitution of Chile|Chilean Constitution]] is illegitimate because it was introduced in the absence of political democracy by the Pinochet regime on September 11, 1980.&lt;ref name=LaRazon&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | date= 11 June 2013

===New Majority coalition's primary elections===
The [[primary elections]] for the [[New Majority (Chile)|New Majority]] coalition commenced on August 4, 2013. These parliamentary primaries were set to determine which two candidates from the Nueva Mayoria pact in a given electorate will stand for the Chilean elections in November 2013. In the primary election for the 19th Santiago electorate of Recoleta-Independencia Cariola received the highest number of votes from the local constituents.&lt;ref name=24HRS&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | date= 4 August 2013

==Criticism==
Karol Cariola is currently a candidate for the Chilean parliamentary elections to be held in 2013. This strategy to reach political power by Cariola and other members of the Communist Youth and ex-leaders of the educational social mobilizations such as [[Camila Vallejo]] and [[Camilo Ballesteros]], has been bitterly questioned by some student factions who consider it a [[betrayal]] to the principles of the mobilizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publimetro.cl/nota/cronica/eloisa-gonzalez-camila-vallejo-representa-al-pc-no-al-movimiento-estudiantil/xIQmcy!7NXmHtO3bGewY/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://redprisma.org/latam/index.php/entrevistas-politica/3292-karol-cariola-qentramos-al-sistema-porque-queremos-cambiarloq&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics point to her explicit support for the governments of [[Fidel Castro]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2012/04/05/karol-cariola-y-camila-vallejo-las-reflexiones-de-fidel-son-luz-y-esperanza-para-chile-video/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hugo Chavez]].&lt;ref&gt;http://radiokabudari.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/camila-vallejo-karol-cariola-y-claudia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SamNeill08TIFF.jpg|right|thumb|New Zealand actor [[Sam Neill]] owns a winery in the [[Central Otago]] region of New Zealand.]]
The trend of '''celebrities owning wineries and vineyards''' is not a recent phenomenon, though it has certainly garnered more attention in today's [[Information Age]]. In [[ancient Greek (wine)|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman (wine)|Roman]] times, the leading [[philosopher]]s, [[playwrights]], [[politician]]s and [[general]]s of the day often owned vineyards for personal use.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 35-90"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Johnson | first = Hugh |title = Vintage: The Story of Wine | publisher = Simon and Schuster| year = 1989| location = New York | pages = 35–90| isbn = 0-671-68702-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually celebrities have a large amount of wealth accumulated, which makes the significant investment of opening a [[winery]] or [[vineyard]] negligible.

There are many reasons that celebrities gravitate to the world of [[wine]]. Starting a winery or vineyard, as with nearly any business, can offer some tax benefits. Some celebrities, such as the Italian-American director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], come from a family with a long history of winemaking. Some, such as the British singer [[Cliff Richard]], have been lifelong wine enthusiasts and enter the wine industry in order to do something that they enjoy. Others like the challenge of a new enterprise. Some celebrities enter the wine industry simply because they can.&lt;ref name="Miscellany pg 76-80"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Harding | first = Graham| title = A Wine Miscellany| publisher = Clarkson Potter| year = 2005| location = New York| pages = 76–80| isbn = 0-307-34635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some celebrities, such as the American actors [[Brad Pitt]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Johnny Depp]], British association football star [[David Beckham]] and his wife [[Victoria Beckham]], own vineyards and wine estates solely for personal use, some celebrities leverage their name recognition as a selling tool in the wine industry. Today celebrity-owned wineries can be lucrative business endeavors. In 2007, [[Nielsen research]] of [[supermarket]] wine purchases showed that sales of celebrity wines were up 19% over previous years.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Kung, Michelle, ''Forbes Magazine'' (August 4, 2008). [http://staging.forbestraveler.com/celebrity/celebrity-owned-vineyards-story.html Top Celebrity Vineyards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219070142/http://staging.forbestraveler.com/celebrity/celebrity-owned-vineyards-story.html |date=2011-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of celebrity involvement==
[[File:DaveMatthews2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Americans|American]] musician [[Dave Matthews]] owns a winery in [[Virginia]].]]
Celebrities have different degrees of involvement in their wineries and vineyards. Nearly all of them partner, in some form of collaboration, with a winery or winemaker who is already established in the industry. An example of this is retired American football player [[Joe Montana]], who partnered with longtime [[Beringer wine]]maker [[Ed Sbragia]] to make their joint venture wine Montagia. While Sbragia oversees most of the [[viticultural]] and [[winemaking]] tasks, Montana is involved in deciding on the overall "vision" of the wine and participates in tasting and blending trials.&lt;ref name="Miscellany pg 76-80"/&gt;

Similarly, the celebrity may own their own "wine brand" which is produced with their collaborating winery instead of owning a physical winery or wine estate itself. An example of this is the brand Mike Ditka Wines, owned by former American football coach [[Mike Ditka]]. The wine is produced in partnership at the physical winemaking facilities of the [[Mendocino Wine Company]]. While it could be described as a "winery", technically Mike Ditka Wines is a "wine brand" owned by Ditka, who participates in blending and tasting trials.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Eric, ''Wine Spectator'' (January 30, 2007). [http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Wine-Talk-Mike-Ditka_3369 Wine Talk: Mike Ditka]&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities, such as French actor [[Gérard Depardieu]], are very active in both the production and business dealings of the winery. Depardieu, who owns wineries in several countries across the globe, even has his passport listing his occupation as ''[[vigneron]]''.&lt;ref name="Miscellany pg 76-80"/&gt;

[[File:Nancy Pelosi.jpeg|right|thumb|Former [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] owns two vineyards that sell grapes to California producers.]]
Some celebrities may only have "legacy" attachments to the wines that bear their names. One example is the [[Gallo wine brand]] MacMurray Ranch, which uses some grapes grown on a California ranch that was once owned by the American actor [[Fred MacMurray]]. Under his ownership, the ranch was dedicated mostly to raising horses.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Press ''[http://ucpress.edu/books/pages/10940/MacMurray.pdf MacMurray Ranch] pg 1, Accessed: December 14th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After MacMurray died, his family sold most of the land to the Gallo family, and has little connection to the wine brand.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; 

Another "legacy" celebrity who was more intimately connected with the winery that now carries his name was the American actor [[Raymond Burr]]. Burr bought the ranch with his [[domestic partner]] and planted [[grapevine]]s for wine production before he died in 1993. His partner, Robert Benevides, renamed the estate after Burr and continued making wines featuring his name.&lt;ref&gt;Mersmann, Andrew, ''Passport Magazine'' [http://www.passportmagazine.com/businessclass/RobertBenevides.php?rand=1 Robert Benevides, Raymond Burr Vineyards Sonoma County, California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050837/http://www.passportmagazine.com/businessclass/RobertBenevides.php?rand=1 |date=2011-07-15 }}. Accessed: December 14th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some celebrities lend their names to a winery for a special one-time wine production. Mexican-American musician [[Carlos Santana]] partnered with the [[Champagne house]] [[G.H. Mumm]] to create a [[sparkling wine]] in 2005 titled Santana DVX.&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;D. Grossman "[http://www.winecountry.com/magazine/2007_SpringSummer/CelebrityWineWorld.html Wine Stars]" ''Wine Country Magazine'' Spring 2007/Summer 2007 issue&lt;/ref&gt; While Santana helped select the final blend and received [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for the use of his name and image, he doesn't particularly "own" the brand nor does he continue to be involved in the wine industry.

American musician [[Bob Dylan]] participated in a similar arrangement with the [[Italian wine]]ry [[Fattoria Le Terrazze]]. Dylan gave permission for the winery to use his name, likeness and album art to create a wine that pays tribute to his 1974 album ''[[Planet Waves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Eric, ''The New York Times'': The Pour (May 18, 2006). [http://thepour.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/expecting-wine/ "Wine on the Tracks"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, American entrepreneur [[Martha Stewart]] announced a collaboration with the American winery Gallo to produce value-marketed wines to be sold at [[Kmart]], which also featured her Martha Stewart Living line of housewares.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle Staff/Associated Press ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (September 15, 2007). [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/14/BU5VS6IA8.DTL "Stewart to market $15 wine"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, British chef [[Gordon Ramsay]] allowed a [[Bordeaux wine]]ry to use his name, without royalties, to celebrate the release of their 10th [[vintage]].&lt;ref&gt;Anson, Jane, ''Decanter.com'' (April 24, 2009). [http://www.decanter.com/news/281379.html "Gordon Ramsay lends his name to a Bordeaux wine"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, actor [[Gianni Russo]] launched his wine brand, [[Gianni Russo Wines]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://italialiving.com/articles/food-wine/the-intriguing-life-of-gianni-russo-beyond-the-godfather/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13896">Numerous notable people have had some form of [[anxiety disorder]]. This is a list of people accompanied by verifiable source associating them with one or more anxiety-based mental health disorders based on their own public statements; this discussion is sometimes tied to the larger topic of [[creativity and mental illness]]. In the case of dead people only, individuals with a [[Retrospective diagnosis|speculative or retrospective]] diagnosis should only be listed if they are accompanied by a source reflective of the mainstream, academic view. Individuals should not be added to this list unless the disorder is regularly and commonly mentioned in mainstream, reliable sources.

'''Majak Daw''' (born 11 March 1991) is a professional [[Football]]er playing for the [[North Melbourne Kangaroos ]] in the [[Australian Football League ]] (AFL). Daw and his family in Australia are [[refugee]]s from the [[Refugees of Sudan|civil wars in Sudan]]. Daw became the first [[Sudanese Australian]] to be [[AFL Draft|drafted]] to an AFL club when he was contracted to North Melbourne in the [[2009 AFL Draft]]. Daw's drafting gained international attention; it was reported by the [[BBC]] and the [[Voice of America]]. Majak Daw made his first appearance for North Melbourne in a [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|NAB Cup]] match on 20 February 2011.

==Early life==
Daw was born in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], the third of his parents' nine children.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald Sun - 20Feb2011 - Majak Daw's big move "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/majak-daws-big-move/story-e6frf9jf-1226008867303|title=Majak Daw's big move |last=McFarlane |first=Glenn|date=20 February 2011|work=[[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]]|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family fled the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], living in [[Egypt]] for three years, then moved to Australia in 2003.&lt;ref name="RealFooty_TheAge21Jun2009_PeterHanlon_MajakDaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VOA - 16Dec2009 - Sudanese Teenager Makes Sports History in Australia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/sports/Sudanese-Teenager-Makes-Sports-History-in-Australia-79401327.html|title=Sudanese Teenager Makes Sports History in Australia|last=Mercer|first=Phil|date=16 December 2009|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TAC Cup years==
Playing for the [[Western Jets]] Daw was identified as a future "key position" player by North Melbourne and the [[Western Bulldogs]].&lt;ref name="CourierMail_20110AFLDraft_MajakDaw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,26454890-5016196,00.html|title=Roos, Dogs believe in Majak |last=Gullam|first=Scott|date=7 December 2009|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Daw went to the 2009 Victorian Screening portion of the AFL pre-draft testing.
He impressed with a 13.6 in the [[beep test]] and 3.03 seconds in a 20-metre sprint along with a standing jump of 70 centimetres.&lt;ref name="AFL - 08Dec2009 - Majak Daw profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=87936|title=Majak Daw profile|date=8 December 2009|publisher=[[Australian Football League]]|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of 11 young Australian rules footballers to be given 2010 [[AFL Players Association awards#Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarships|Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarships]] awarded by the [[AFL Players Association]], and accepted the awards on behalf of the other players.&lt;ref name="AFLPA - 14Sep2009 - 2010 Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarships announced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aflpa.com.au/articleimage/2010-mike-fitzpatrick-scholarships-announced|title=2010 Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarships announced|last=Murnane|first=Jason|date=14 September 2009|publisher=[[AFL Players Association]]|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AFL career==
===Draft to North Melbourne===
Daw was picked up with the ninth pick in the 2010 rookie draft.&lt;ref name="ABCNewsAustralia_15Dec2009_AFL_MajakDaw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/15/2772003.htm|title=Power spring Harding surprise|date=15 December 2009|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His draft pick gained international media attention.&lt;ref name="VOA - 16Dec2009 - Sudanese Teenager Makes Sports History in Australia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News - 16Dec2009 - Australian Rules Football picks first black African "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8415988.stm|title=Australian Rules Football picks first black African |last=Mercer|first=Phil|date=16 December 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His career at North Melbourne began with playing for VFL club [[Werribee Football Club|Werribee]], where he continued to develop his game. He made his first appearance for North Melbourne in a pre-season NAB cup match against the Western Bulldogs on 20 February 2011.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald Sun - 20Feb2011 - Majak Daw's big move "/&gt; In April 2011, playing for Werribee, Daw kicked an impressive running goal from beyond 50&amp;nbsp;m out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diamond|first1=Brent|title=Majak display nothing short of Daw-some|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/majak-display-nothing-short-of-dawsome-20110416-1ditw.html|accessdate=20 January 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting calls for his inclusion to the senior team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/daw-is-just-what-the-roos-need-20110418-1dlon.html Daw is just what the Roos need], The Age, Retrieved 22 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===VFL racism incident===
On 4 June 2011, Majak Daw was racially abused by a [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] supporter, while he was playing for the [[Werribee Tigers]] in the VFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Andrew|title=Swans crush lame Lions|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/swans-crush-lame-lions-20110604-1fmno.html|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daw stated that it "made [him] feel really small".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daw says abuse made him feel 'small'&amp;thinsp;|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/daw-says-abuse-made-him-feel-small-20110606-1fo0q.html|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=6 June 2011|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man has since been banned from all VFL games until he completes an anti-racism workshop and formally apologises to Daw for the slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flower|first=Wayne|title=VFL footy fan banned for season in wake of Majak Daw race abuse|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/eddie-furious-as-racism-hits-footy/story-e6frf9jf-1226069402111|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has led to renewed calls to stamp out racism in sport, with former Victorian Premier, [[Ted Baillieu]], calling Daw a hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Langmaid|first=Aaron|last2=Flower|first2=Wayne|title=Majak Daw hailed for action against racist slur|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/eddie-furious-as-racism-hits-footy/story-e6frf9jf-1226070488790|accessdate=7 June 2011|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension from North Melbourne senior team===
Daw was suspended from North Melbourne in February 2012 and remanded to the [[Werribee Football Club|Werribee Tigers]] for an indefinite period for lying to the club and coach [[Brad Scott (Australian footballer)|Brad Scott]] about a "night on the town" during a period in which he was recovering from knee surgery.&lt;ref name="The Age - 09Feb2012 - Sliding Daw: Majak's lies, debts and teammate's ex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/sliding-daw-majaks-lies-debts-and-teammates-ex-20120208-1reyt.html|title=Sliding Daw: Majak's lies, debts and teammate's ex|last=Pierik|first=Jon|date=9 February 2012|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=4 April 2012|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald Sun - 09Feb2012 - Majak Daw banned for lying to Roos coach"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/majak-daw-banned-for-lying-to-roos-coach/story-e6frf9jf-1226266218198|title=Majak Daw banned for lying to Roos coach|last=Warner|first=Michael|date=9 February 2012|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFL debut===
In 2013, Daw had an excellent showing in the [[2013 NAB Cup]] which prompted calls for his inclusion in the Senior Side. When tall forward Robbie Tarrant went down with a thigh injury, Daw was brought in to replace him and make his debut in Round 4 against the [[Brisbane Lions]]. In the first minute of the game, Daw marked the ball inside 50, and kicked his first AFL goal with his first AFL kick. However, his debut ended on a sour note when he collided with teammate [[Ben Cunnington (Australian footballer)|Ben Cunnington]] and suffered a concussion before quarter time, and took no further part in the game. North went on to win the game by 63 points.

Daw held his spot and played the next week, scoring no goals but three behinds against Hawthorn. In Round 7 against the [[Western Bulldogs]], Majak had a breakout performance in just his fourth career game, kicking a game-high 6 goals in North's 54 point win. After the match, North Melbourne coach [[Brad Scott (Australian footballer)|Brad Scott]] said of Majak: "'Maj' is a good example of what you can do with really hard work. Hard work trumps talent any day of the week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Ben|title=Hype similar, but Daw a long way from Nic Nat: Scott|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-05-11/brad-scott|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=AFL Website|date=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–''present''===

He was delisted in October 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-29/roo-harper-shown-the-door-in-latest-list-change-at-north|title=Door left ajar for Majak as Roos confirm list changes|last1=Cleary|first1=Mitch|last2=Sutton|first2=Ben|date=29 October 2015|work=AFL.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he was re-drafted in the [[2015 AFL draft|2016 rookie draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2015-11-27/daw-added-as-rookie|title=Daw added as rookie|date=27 November 2015|work=nmfc.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, Majak Daw won mark of the year after taking a [[specky]] against Collingwood. Majak played the most games in a season in his career at that point with nine in addition to playing in his first final, which was in the elimination final against {{AFL Ade}} and kicking four goals despite North Melbourne losing 141–79.

In 2017, after having a season full of injuries and only managing to play seven games in total, at the end of the [[2017 AFL season]] Daw eyed versatility as an AFL player, "it's a unique position{{clarify|date=May 2018}}. There aren't many players who can do that role well. It’s challenging, because you’ve got to be able to play both positions well."

In the 2018 offseason, Daw daw changed his position from a forward to a defender. Daw sought this change as he thought it was his last chance at thriving in the AFL. Majak played his first game as a defender against {{AFL Car}} in the [[AFLX]] series. Later on in round 3 against {{AFL Mel}}, Daw officially played his first game as a defender. Ever since debuting in his first game as a defender Daw has lead North Melbourne to the number 2 defense in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] making his change from a forward to a defender a successful move in his career and for the promising future of [[North Melbourne Football Club]].

==Sexual assault charge==

On 1 July 2014, Daw was charged with three counts of rape relating to an alleged sexual assault incident in [[Altona North]] in 2007. He had been previously arrested and interviewed over the allegations in May 2014. Daw denied the allegations, while North Melbourne stated that he would remain available for selection.&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/north-melbourne-footballer-majak-daw-charged-with-rape-20140701-zsrod.html|title=North Melbourne footballer Majak Daw charged with rape|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2015, Daw was found not guilty on all counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Adam|title=AFL footballer Majak Daw not guilty of raping 15-year-old girl  |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/afl-footballer-majak-daw-not-guilty-of-raping-15yearold-girl-20151202-gle37o.html|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=The Age|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21481">'''Martin Parmer''' (born '''Martin Palmer''' June 4, 1778 &amp;ndash; March 2, 1850) was an eccentric 19th-century [[United States|American]] frontiersman, statesman, politician and soldier.

[[Image:Autograph of Martin Parmer.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Martin Parmer, Agent for Texas.'' Autograph of Republic of Texas statesman, Martin Parmer, appearing on scrip issued by Parmer in 1836 during the Texas Revolution.]]

==Early years==

The [[Virginia]]-born Palmer, (who would later change the spelling of his surname to Parmer) made a name for himself as an Indian fighter in the [[Missouri Territory]] prior to Missouri's admission as a State in the Union. During this time he acquired his [[sobriquet]], "The Ringtailed Panther," by which he would be known throughout [[Missouri]] and later [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=parmer3&gt;Parmer (1874), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cantrell183&gt;Cantrell (1999), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=james201&gt;James (1999), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; When Missouri became a state, Parmer was elected a State Representative to the First [[Missouri General Assembly]]. Later Parmer was elected a State Senator to the Third [[Missouri General Assembly]]. While serving as a State Senator, [[William Clark (explorer)]] appointed Martin Parmer as an [[Indian sub-agent]] to the [[Ioway]] Indians.

==Moving to Texas==

[[Image:Martin Parmer - Gone to Texas.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Article from the December 29, 1825 edition of the ''National Gazette and Literary Register'' published in Philadelphia reporting that Missouri Senator Col. Palmer [Martin Parmer] "is said to have taken [[French leave]] and [[gone to Texas]].".]]
Martin Parmer first came to Texas in the 1825 as part of [[Haden Edwards]]'s colony.  Conditions between the settlers Edwards had relocated in Texas and older settlers in the area steadily deteriorated. On October 15, 1826, Otto Askins swore out an affidavit stating that Parmer had murdered his brother Moton Askins:&lt;ref name=blake205&gt;Blake (1958-1959), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=State of Coahuila and Texas

District of Nacogdoches

  this day Otto Askins personally apeared Before me Samuel Norriss Alcalde of said District and being sworn sayeth that he has Just Cause to Believe Martin Parmer Did Shoot Moton Askins near the house of Daniel Clark on the Angelline and that said Moten Askins Died on the 13th of the same month of said wound as Given under my hand this 15th of October 1826.

Otto his X mark Askins

   Sworn to and subscribed to before me Oct. 15th Nacogdoches 1826.

:Samuel Norriss,

:Alcalde of Nacogdoches.}}

Samuel Norris, the [[Alcalde]] of [[Nacogdoches]], issued a warrant for Parmer's arrest:&lt;ref name=blake206&gt;Blake (1958-1959), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=State of Coahuila and Texas                 ()                To the Sheriff Samuel Mactor.

  Whereas Othe [Otto] Askins has this day complained on oath that Martin Parmer did on the 10th of Instant Shoot Motin Askins with a pistol in the area near the house of Daniel Clark and Died on the 13th of the Same Instant of said wound.

  this is to Command you in the name of the State to take the Body of the Said Martin Parmer and bring him forthwith before me so as he may be delt with as the Law directs in case of murder wherein fail not as given under my hand this 15th Oct. 1826.

Samuel Norriss.}}

With the issuance of the arrest warrant for murder, Parmer would normally have had two options, 1) He could flee back into the United States, or 2) He could allow himself to be arrested and stand trial for murder.  Neither of these options appealed to Parmer, so six weeks later, on November 23, 1826, Martin Parmer rode into Nacogdoches at the head of a force of men from the Ayish Bayou District and arrested all the government officials including Samuel Norris and [[Hayden Edwards]] and assumed control of the local government. One of Parmer's first actions was to order that all Americans in Nacogdoches be compelled to bear arms.

{{Quote|text=You are commanded to bring forthwith every American in the village and compel him to bear arms- if he refuses, put him under arrest.

::Martin Parmer
::
::Col. Commander in Chief
::
::November 23, 1826}}

Parmer conducted a "Courts Martial" of the local government officials for which he sat as the [[Judge]]. With the exception of Hayden Edwards, Martin Parmer found all the government officials guilty and sentenced them to death.  He commuted their sentences on the promise of each that they would leave Texas and never return. Following the trial, Parmer left Joseph Durst in charge as the [[Alcalde]] in [[Nacogdoches]] and returned to Ayish Bayou.

[[Image:Fredonian Rebellion Flag of 1826.svg|thumb|right|300px|Flag of the Fredonian Republic.  Martin Parmer was the President.]]
In December 1826, Parmer led the [[Fredonian Rebellion]], declaring the area around [[Nacogdoches, TX|Nacogdoches]] the independent Republic of Fredonia. The preamble of the Fredonian Declaration of Independence set out the grievances of the parties:

{{Quote|text=Whereas, the Government of the Mexican United States, have by repeated insults, treachery and oppression, reduced the White and Red immigrants from the United States of North America, now living in the Province of Texas, within the Territory of the said Government, into which they have been deluded by promises solemnly made, and most basely broken, to the dreadful alternative of either submitting their freeborn necks to the yoke of an imbecile, faithless, and despotic government, miscalled a Republic; or of taking up arms in defence of their unalienable rights and asserting their Independence; They—viz:—The White emigrants now assembled in the town of Nacogdoches, around the Independent Standard, on the one part, and the Red emigrants who have espoused the same holy cause, on the other, in order to prosecute more speedily and effectually the War of independence, they have mutually undertaken, to a successful issue, and to bind themselves by the ligaments of reciprocal interests and obligations, have resolved to form a Treaty of Union, League and Confederation.}}

The Fredonian Declaration of Independence was signed as follows:

{{Quote|text=In faith whereof the Agents of the respective contracting parties hereunto affix their names.  Done in the Town of Nacogdoches, this twenty-first day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six.

Empresario [[Stephen F. Austin]] strongly opposed the Fredonian rebels and encouraged the settlers in his colony to fight on behalf of Mexico in the conflict. In a letter to his colonists dated January 1, 1827, Stephen F. Austin mentioned Martin Parmer's role as leader of the rebellion:

{{Quote|text=A small party of infatuated madmen at Nacogdoches have declared Independence and invited the Indians from the Sabine to the Rio Grande to join them and wage a war of Murder, plunder and desolation on the innocent inhabitants of the frontier--The leader of this party is Martin Parmer...|sign=''Stephen F. Austin to the Citizens of Victoria''}}

The Fredonian Republic stood for just over a month; Parmer fled to Louisiana when the Mexican army arrived in Nacogdoches at the end of January 1827.

==Texas Revolution==

[[Image:Washington on the Brazos Monument.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Replica of the building where the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] was signed at [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas]].]]

Parmer returned to Texas in 1831 and was an early figure in the history of the [[Republic of Texas]].&lt;ref name=davis292&gt;Davis (1998), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank W. Johnson, a leader in the Texas Revolution, provided the following account of Parmer's return to Texas in 1831 in the company of James Bowie:

{{Quote|text=Colonel Martin Parmer, a prominent actor in the Fredonian affair, who had left the country in consequence, returned, and as if to beard the lion in his den, in company with Colonel James Bowie visited San Antonio.  Popular as Bowie was at that time with the Mexicans, he could not disabuse them of the jealousy and fears of Parmer. Parmer, finding his situation unpleasant if not dangerous, soon returned.  An order was immediately directed to the alcalde asking the arrest of Parmer. Accompanying this was a subaltern officer and file of men, who reported themselves to the alcalde and held themselves subject to his order.  Without unnecessary delay, yet sufficient to enable Parmer’s friends to give him notice of the unfriendly intention of the Mexican authorities, the necessary writ for the arrest of Parmer was placed in the hands of the deputy sheriff, Captain Francis Adams, friend and associate of Parmer.  Accompanied by the officer and his squad of men Adams proceeded to make diligent search for Parmer, but the bird had flown, the search was unsuccessful, the party returned and reported, much disappointed, and the officer somewhat chopfallen.  Thus, again, were the colonists relieved of another unpleasant affair.  Small as these things were in themselves, they were fair and true instances of the feelings indulged toward the Anglo-Americans by the Mexican authority.  They first took alarm at the rising at Nacogdoches in 1826 ...which may be said to be the germ seed of their subsequent troubles, and the war of independence.|sign=Frank W. Johnson|source=A History of Texas and Texans, Volume I}}

During the [[Texas Revolution]], Parmer served as a delegate from the District of Teneha to the Consultation of 1835 at San Felipe.&lt;ref name=jenkins245-286&gt;Jenkins (1973), p. 245-286.&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as a delegate to the [[Consultation (Texas)]], Parmer placed Henry Smith's name into nomination for Governor of Texas.&lt;ref name=jenkins271&gt;Jenkins (1973), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)]] was elected Governor of Texas by the Consultation becoming the first American-born Governor of the Mexican territory of Texas. Later, at the Consultation, Parmer was elected a member of the General Council of Texas.&lt;ref name=jenkins272&gt;Jenkins (1973), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Parmer was elected a delegate from the Municipality of San Augustine to the Convention at [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]] which began on March 1, 1836.&lt;ref name=jenkins289-370&gt;Jenkins (1973), p. 289-370.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 1836, delegate [[Sam Houston]] moved for the adoption of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] and Martin Parmer seconded the motion.

{{Quote|text=Washington, Texas, March 2, 1836.

To Col. Millard -

Dir Sir: The Convention was organized yesterday, and during the first day, matters looked squally, and disagreeable. That body was intent on making a Declaration of Independence to hurl into the teeth of Santa Anna and his [[myrmidons]]. They accordingly appointed a committee to report a Declaration of Independence; and this morning after the Convention assembled, the committee reported a very able one. Its adoption was moved by Gen. Houston, and seconded by Col. Palmer of the Bayou - and after a splendid speech from the General, it was unanimously adopted. Not one dissenting voice...

[[Image:Nilesweeklyregister1836parmercrockett.jpg|thumb|right|350px|March 6, 1836 letter written by Martin Parmer to his wife from the Convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos on the day that [[The Alamo]] fell. This letter is from the April 9, 1836 edition of the ''Niles' Weekly Register''. Immediately below the letter is the report of the famous Davy Crockett story regarding the voters of his Congressional district and how Crockett said that if they failed to re-elect him that "they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas."]]
The Declaration of Independence was unanimously approved by the Convention and Parmer signed the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico. Parmer was chairman of the committee that drafted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas]].&lt;ref name="jenkins300, 325 and 357"&gt;Jenkins (1973), p. 300, 325 and 357.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1836, the day [[the Alamo]] fell, Martin Parmer penned a letter to his wife from the Convention at Washington:

{{Quote|text=''Committee room, Washington, Texas, March 6,'' 1836.
Dear wife:
I am well and we are getting along very well. We have three or four committees who are preparing a constitution, and we will have it ready soon.  I shall be at home in ten or fifteen days, we have alarming news continually from the west; Frank Johnsons division is all killed but five, it is supposed. [H]e saw two shot begging for quarters. Dr. Grant with a company of men is supposed to be all slain.

Travis last express states [[San Antonio]] was strongly besieged; it is much feared that Travis and company are all massacred, as despatches have been due from that place three days and none have arrived yet. The frontiers are breaking up, Gonzales must be sacked, and its inhabitants murdered and defiled unless they get immediate aid. The last accounts, the Mexicans were to a considerable number between Gonzales and San Antonio. Fanning [Fannin] is at La Badia [La Bahia] with about 500 men, and is in daily expectation of a visit from Santa Anna. Texas has been declared free and independent, but unless we have a general turn out and every man lay his helping hand too, we are lost. Santa Anna and his vassals are now in our borders, and the declaration of our freedom, unless it is sealed with blood, is of no force. I say again that nothing will save Texas but a general turn out. You all know my views with regard to our condition; I have given you the facts, judge for yourselves. I wish a copy of this letter sent immediately to capt. Bailey Anderson and col. S.A. Lublett [Sublett], and publicly read in San Augustine. Travis closes his last express with these words - Help! O my country.

|sign=''MARTIN PALMER''|source=Niles' Weekly Register, Baltimore, Maryland, April 9, 1836}}

[[Charles B. Stewart]], a delegate from the Municipality of Austin to the Convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos, was attributed the following quote regarding Martin Parmer:&lt;ref name=dixon149&gt;Dixon (1924), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Mr. Parmer, gave an interesting account to his friends at Old Washington in 1836 of his escape from San Antonio. He was a wonderfully fascinating talker and his recital of this even greatly amused those who heard him. He was a man absolutely without fear and held the Mexicans in contempt.}}

Stephen W. Blount, another delegate to the Convention from the Municipality of San Augustine, gave the following account of Martin Parmer:&lt;ref name=dixon154&gt;Dixon (1924), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Martin Parmer was of a nervous temperament. He had a stubborn and determined will and showed impatience of delays. Many interesting stories were told of his prowess among the Indians. He was an interesting talker and was frequently seen in the midst of an admiring group, relating incidents of his adventures. He was a unique character but with all he was a man with the best of impulses - honest, brave and heroic.}}

Parmer's activities during the Texas Revolution did not end with his services at the Convention. On March 16, 1836, as the Convention neared its conclusion, delegate [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]], the newly appointed Secretary of War, wishing to alleviate the shortage of supplies within the Texas army, proposed the following resolution giving Martin Parmer some rather extraordinary powers:

{{Quote|text=Mr. Rusk introduced the following resolution. - Resolved: That Col. Martin Parmer be, and he is hereby authorized to demand, receive, and dispose of as the exigencies of circumstances may require any and all public property, whether money, provisions, horses, waggons, and teams, arms and other munitions of war to be found within the Municipalities of Nacogdoches, or of San Augustine, giving the corresponding receipts, and that he be also: fully authorized within said municipalities to make requisitions for, horses waggons and teams, arms and other munitions of war not the property of the public, as may be needful for the efficient equipment and sustenance of the army, or any portion thereof, rendering the proper vouchers to individuals and being accountable to the Government for what he may do in pursuance of this Constitution. - Which was adopted.}}

Parmer issued scrip for all the property he received on behalf of the new Republic of Texas. He signed the scrip: ''Martin Parmer, Agent for Texas.''

==Republic of Texas==

[[Image:Parmer County, Texas Sheriff's Department Patch.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sheriff's Department patch for Parmer County, Texas named in honor of Martin Parmer.]]

In 1839, Republic of Texas President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] appointed Martin Parmer Chief Justice of [[Jasper County, Texas]]. Parmer died in [[Jasper County, Texas]] on [[Texas Independence Day]] March 2, 1850. His body was re-interred in the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in 1936 at the time of the Texas Centennial. He was buried some thirty feet away from the grave of [[Stephen F. Austin]] who had so vigorously opposed Parmer's early attempt to declare Texas independent of Mexico during the [[Fredonian Rebellion]].

In 1874, Tom Parmer published a biographical booklet about the adventures of his father, Martin Parmer, on the Missouri frontier titled ''Fifty-Five Years Ago in the Wilderness or The Old Ringtail Panther of Missouri''. Martin Parmer appeared as a major character in [[Joseph Alexander Altsheler]]'s Texan historical fiction series: ''The Texan Star, the story of a great fight for liberty'' (1912); ''The Texan Scouts, the story of the Alamo and Goliad'' (1913); and ''The Texan Triumph, a romance of the San Jacinto campaign'' (1913).  In 1966, Martin Parmer appeared as a character in [[Giles A. Lutz]]'s book ''The Hardy Breed'' an [[historical fiction]] about the [[Fredonian Rebellion]].

The [[Texas Legislature]] established [[Parmer County, Texas]] in 1876.  Parmer County is named in honor of Martin Parmer "an eccentric Texan of olden time, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Texas Independence." In January 1882, the Capitol Syndicate agreed to build the [[Texas State Capitol]] in return for 3,000,000 acres of land in West Texas. Parmer County lay entirely within the lands granted to the Chicago Syndicate for its huge [[XIT Ranch]].

'''Matsyendra''', '''Matsyendranātha''', '''Macchindranāth''' or '''Mīnanātha''' (early 10th century) was a [[saint]] and [[yogi]] in a number of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu traditions]]. He is traditionally considered the founder of [[hatha yoga]] as well as the author of some of its earliest texts. He is also seen as the founder of the [[natha]] ''[[sampradaya]]'', having received the teachings from [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (2013-09-11). The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice (Kindle Locations 12788-12789). Hohm Press. Kindle Edition. "Matsyendra was a chief representative, if not the originator, of what is known as Nâthism. But Shiva himself is considered as the source of the Nâtha lineage and is invoked as Adinâtha or 'Primordial Lord.'" (Kindle Locations 12825-12827). "Using his third eye, Shiva gazed straight through the mountain of flesh into the fish’s stomach, where he saw Mina. He was thrilled at the discovery, saying, “Now I see who my real disciple is.” Turning to his sleepy spouse, he said: “I will initiate him rather than you.”"&lt;/ref&gt; He is especially associated with [[Kaula (Hinduism)|kaula]] [[shaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (2013-09-11). The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice (Kindle Locations 12803-12804). Hohm Press. Kindle Edition. "He is specifically associated with the Kaula sect of the Siddha movement, within which he may have founded the Yoginî-Kaula branch."&lt;/ref&gt; He is also one of the eighty-four mahasiddhas and considered the guru of [[Gorakshanath]], another important figure in early hatha yoga. He is revered by both Hindus and Buddhists and is sometimes regarded as an incarnation of [[Avalokiteśvara]].

==Early life==
Little is known about the life of Matsyendra: his son is Minanatha and he is also associated with Lui-Pa, all of whose names translate as 'Lord of the Fishes'. Legends vary in describing his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India" by David Gordon White, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Tucci]] states, on the authority of two Tibetan works - the ''Siddha'' ({{bo|w=grub thob}}) and [[Taranatha]]'s "Possessing the Seven Transmissions" ({{bo|w=bka' babs bdun ldan}}) - that Matsyendranāth, who is seen in Tibet as an avatar of Avalokiteśvara, was a fisherman from [[Kamrup region|Kamarupa]].&lt;ref name="JPASB"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Asiatic Society (Calcutta, India)|work=Journal and Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal |volume=XXVI |year=1930 |number=1 |pages=133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indian_Civilization_and_Culture_-_Page_441 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamrupa Anusandhana Samiti (1984), ''Readings in the History &amp; Culture of Assam'',p.201 it is stated that a Siddha, named Minanatha, was a fisherman from Kamarupa&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (1996), ''Contributions to Nepalese Studies - Volumes 23-24'',Page 93 Matsyendra was a resident of Kamrup-Kamakhya (today's Assam in East India).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. M. |last1=Pandit |first2=H. P. |last2=Shastri |title=Bauddha Gan O Doha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources give his birthplace as Bengal.&lt;ref name=Indian_Civilization_and_Culture_-_Page_441 /&gt;&lt;ref name="GFeuerstein yoga tradition" /&gt; The Newar people of Nepal claim his birthplace is [[Bungamati]] near [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;Rato Matsyendranath of Patan and Bungamati, Tribhuvan University. Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies, 1973 by John Kerr Locke&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in the ''Sabaratantra'' as one of the twenty-four [[Kapalika]] Siddhas.&lt;ref name="JPASB"/&gt;

== Legend ==
Legends tell that Matsyendra was born under an inauspicious star. This warranted his parents to throw the baby into the ocean. It is here that the baby was swallowed by a fish where he lived for many years. The fish swam to the bottom of the ocean where [[Shiva]] was imparting the secrets of yoga to his consort, [[Parvati]]. Upon overhearing the secrets of yoga, Matsyendra began to practice yoga [[sadhana]] inside the fish's belly. After twelve years he finally emerged as an enlightened [[Siddha]]. This is often given as the origin of his name 'Lord of the Fishes' or 'He Whose Lord is the Lord of the Fishes'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lorinroche.com/yoga/yoga/matsyendra.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions of the legend exist, including one in which Matsyendra was born as a fish and turned into a Siddha by Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Light on Yoga, BKS Iyengar&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan renditions of the story tell of a fisherman turned Siddha named Mina who is eaten by a fish while working in the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (2013-09-11). The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice (Kindle Locations 12817-12820). Hohm Press. Kindle Edition. "In the Tibetan hagiography of the eighty-four mahâ-siddhas, the following story is told of Mina Nâtha (who probably is identical with Matsyendra). The fisherman spent most of his time in his small boat in the Bay of Bengal. One day, he hooked a huge fish that pulled so hard on his fishing line that he was thrown overboard. Like Jonah in the biblical story, Mina ended up in the fish’s enormous stomach, protected by his good karma."&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars draw parallels between this legend and the Biblical story of [[Jonah and the Whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Reflections By Lama Anagarika Govinda, Maurice O'Connell, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1169-0}}, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend says that, when [[Gorakshanath]] visited Patan, he captured all the rain-showering serpents of Patan and started to meditate after he was disappointed by the locals as they did not grant him any alms on his request. As a result, Patan faced drought for a long time. The king of Patan, on the advice of his advisers, invited Matsyendranath, Gorakshanath's guru, to Patan. When Gorakshanath learned that his teacher was in Patan, he released all the rain showering serpents and went to see him. As soon as the rain showering serpents were set free, Patan again got plenty of rainfall every year. After that day, the locals of Patan worshiped Matsyendranath as the god of rain.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rato machendraNath Festival: Month-long chariot procession over. (2011, 26 June).

Yet another legend{{Citation needed|reason=This entire legend, original written as "actual tale" bears no citations to sourced|date=February 2018}} says, the Virya or Sperm of Brahma is responsible for birth of various saints and prophets on earth. The Brahma Virya is unlike human beings. It was said to fertilise any living form and carried within it the utmost principles and moral values. It fell on various parts of earth at the advent of [[Kali Yuga]] (i.e. age of machines in Hindu scriptures).
It was decided so to spread moral values on earth by the Supreme Godhead, Brahma. The Virya fell into the mouth of a fish and it became pregnant. Once inside the egg, flowing through the river, the fish and egg inside reached to a secluded spot where Lord Rudra Shankar was teaching the principles of creation to Mother Parvati. When Parvati asked
Shankara, "What is the base of all Illusionary Creation", an answer came from the Egg, "Brahma Tatva" or "God Element". Stumped by the right answer, Lord Shankara started looking into the river, and he saw the child inside the egg. He immediately recognised the child as "Kavi Narayan", the poetic Avatar of Lord Krishna or Hari. He then blessed the child and told him that he would give him the benediction once he was 12 years old.
When its egg was fertilised, the fish was washed ashore on the banks of a sea in Maharashtra. A fisherman couple who had no child saw the egg being pecked by storks. As soon as the egg cracked the baby came out crying loudly.
The fisher man then realised this miracle and with compassion in his mind, took the baby home. The baby was named Machhindranath - Macch (meaning) fish, Indra means (God Indra) Nath (meaning) Lord - thus lord of the Sea Fish. 
Machhindranath grew up to be compassionate, aloof from material things. His fisherman foster father insulted him once over throwing caught fish back into water. He said to him that he would become a beggar if he didn't know how to make a living. The enlightened child judged it better to beg and eat sinless food then to make a sinful living in killing. After that Machhindranath ran away from home and went to Badrinath and meditated there living on fruits and water for 12 years continuously. What remained out of him was his skin sucked-up to his skeleton. Then he was greeted by Lord Datta and Lord Shiva (Rudra) and taught all mystics of warfare and miracles which he used for uplifting mankind and saving them from evil that Kali Yuga has spread. From then on, Machhindranath became a Siddha who could see Time from Time Beginning till Time End.

==Works==
Matsyendra is credited with composing Hatha and Tantric works such as the ''Kaulajñānanirnāya'' ("Discussion of the Knowledge Pertaining to the Kaula Tradition"),&lt;ref name=bhattacharya&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=edited by Gerald James Larson, Ram Shankar|title=Yoga : India's philosophy of meditation|date=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|location=Delhi [India]|isbn=978-8120833494|page=436|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Matsyendrasamhita and "Akula-Viratantra", some of the earliest texts on [[hatha yoga]] in Sanskrit in the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=Indian_Civilization_and_Culture_-_Page_441 /&gt; James Mallinson, [[Alexis Sanderson]], [[David Gordon White]] and others theorize that many works were attributed to him posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;"Hathayoga's Philosophy: A Fortuitous Union of Non-Dualities" by James Mallinson, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Saktism and Hatha yoga" by James Mallinson, 6th March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciples==
Matsyendranath is typically listed as having eight disciples. The list of his disciples varies between different temples and lineages,&lt;ref&gt;The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India" by David Gordon White, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; but commonly includes [[Gorakshanath]], Jalandharnath, [[Kanifnath]] (Kanhoba), Gahininath, Bhartrinath, [[Revan Nath]], Charpatinath and Naganath. Along with Matsyendranath, they are called the [[Navnath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Frydman |first=Maurice |year=1987 |chapter=Navanath Sampradaya |title=I Am That: Talks With Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj |editor=Dikshit, Sudhakar S. |publisher=Acorn Press |isbn=9780893860462}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gorkshanath is generally considered a direct disciple of Matsyendranath, it is likely they lived hundreds of years apart.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The most important event connected with the deity is the annual chariot procession known as Bunga Dyah Jatra or Rato Macchindranath Jatra. Each year, the locals of [[Patan, Lalitpur]] celebrate the festival in order to show respect to the rain god.

It is celebrated just before the monsoon season starts so that the city will get plenty rainfall for good growth of crops. During the procession, the image of Bunga Dyah is placed on a tall chariot about 65 feet high and pulled in stages through the streets of Patan for a month.

Before the chariot festival starts the ritual of Mahasnana is conducted in an auspicious hour as indicated by the astrologers about 15 days before the chariot festival. The deity is taken to a platform at Lagankhel which is about 200 meters away from the temple of Machindranath at Ta: bahal Lalitpur. There in front of a huge crowd, the god is given a bath with the sacred water mixture of honey, milk, and water fetched by the panejus or priests in the four silver kalasa(vessel). The four priests then pour the sacred water or jal from four directions in the platform to the deity and it is believed that from whichever direction 1st the jal touches the deity from the same direction monsoon will start or first rain will be granted.

After the mahasnana, the repairs are done to the idol of the deity if required and the new face is painted. After the face painting is over various ritual are performed to the deity-like Bareychukegu; Ihi;  Bara tyegu as done to a human and at the end Dashakarma vidhi is performed.
While these all are going to the temple premises, the chariot or ratha is made at Pulchowk by the Barahi and Yawal clans, amongst which one only does the rope work and other only the woodwork. In the construction of the chariot, no nails are used to connect the joints of the huge chariot but are only tied with ropes and veds. The only part that uses an iron to hold are the four wheels. After the construction is finished the deity is ascended in the divine vehicle i.e. 3 days before the pulling of the chariot.

The route of the chariot procession starts at Pulchwok and passes through Gabahal, Sundhara, Lagankhel and ends at [[Jawalakhel]].Previously the festival was called the festival of three states viz. Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur as the deity was brought by the alliance of these three states. So, previously the 1st day of the festival was to be carried on by people of Kathmandu then by Bhaktapur and then 3rd by Lalitpur, and on last day all three sister cities come together for Jawalakhel Jatra with other nearby city people from Kirtipur and others from the valley.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;

After the chariot reached Jawalakhel, this festival concludes with Bhoto Jatra, which literally means "vest festival". During the ceremony, a government official holds up a sacred jewel-studded black vest from the four sides of the chariot so that all the people gathered around can have a look at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Bhoto Jatra marked amid much fanfare |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/06/28/nation/bhoto-jatra-marked-amid-much-fanfare/223391.html |accessdate=23 May 2013 |newspaper=The Kathmandu Post |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the festival, the chariot is dismantled and Rato Macchindranath is taken to a temple in the nearby village of [[Bungamati]], also known as the second home of the rain god. Rato Macchindranath spends the next six months in that temple.&lt;ref name = d&gt;Rato (Red) Machhendranath. (n.d.).

'''Michael Edward Love''' (born March 15, 1941) is an American singer and songwriter who co-founded [[&lt;!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE --&gt;the Beach Boys]]. Characterised by his nasal and sometimes [[baritone]] singing, Love has been one of the band's vocalists and lyricists for their entire career, contributing to each of their [[studio album]]s. He is often regarded as a malign figure in the band's history, a reputation he acknowledges: "For those who believe that [[Brian Wilson|Brian [Wilson]]] walks on water, I will always be the [[Antichrist]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Wolgolf|first1=James|title=Brian Wilson, Mike Love, and the Psychodrama Behind the Beach Boys' Sun-Streaked Legacy|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/08/brian-wilson-mike-love-and-the-psychodrama-behind-the-beach-boys-legacy|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Love was one of Wilson's collaborators during a string of US top 10 singles for the Beach Boys, including "[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]" (1964), "[[California Girls]]" (1965), and "[[Good Vibrations]]" (1966). His lyrics primarily reflected the youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, which helped fashion pop culture's perception of the "[[California Myth|California Dream]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudak |first=Joseph |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-beach-boys-20110420 |title=The Beach Boys – 100 Greatest Artists |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1968, Love was a student of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] (TM) under [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], and became a TM teacher in 1971. The experience influenced his lyrics to take on themes of astrology, meditation, politics and ecology. In the late 1970s, Love began working on solo albums, releasing his first in 1981:  ''[[Looking Back with Love]]''. In 1988, he, along with the other founding members of the Beach Boys, was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The same year, the song, "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]", co-written by Love, reached number one in the United States and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].

Many of Love's contributions to the group's hits were not officially recognized until the 1990s, when he [[Love v. Wilson|successfully sued for writing credits]] on 35 songs. He remains uncredited for another 44 Beach Boys songs he alleged to have co-written. In 1998, following the death of cousin [[Carl Wilson]], Love was given an [[The Beach Boys live performances|exclusive license to tour under the name the Beach Boys]]. His surviving bandmates, Brian Wilson and [[Al Jardine]], embarked on solo endeavors. In 2011, the group reunited to produce a new album and embark on a tour for their 50th anniversary. Following the 50th anniversary reunion shows, Love resumed touring only with [[Bruce Johnston]].

==Early life==
Love's mother, Emily (known as "Glee") Wilson, was the sister of Mary and [[Murry Wilson]], a family resident in [[Los Angeles]] since the early 1920s. Glee married Edward Milton Love, the son of the founder of the Love Sheet Metal Company, in 1938. Michael Edward, the first of six children, was born in the [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]] district of Los Angeles, in 1941; thereafter the family moved to the upmarket View Park area. Mike attended [[Susan Miller Dorsey High School|Dorsey High School]] and graduated in 1959. Unsure of a career direction, he pumped gas and briefly joined his father's company, whose fortunes dramatically declined in the late 1950s. Both Milt and Glee Love were active in sports, and Glee had a distinct interest in painting and the arts. Like her brother, Murry, however, she was also strong-willed and, according to her husband, a dominant personality. The family was close-knit and regularly socialized with Murry and Audree Wilson and their sons. Murry Wilson was a part-time songwriter.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp={{page needed|date=October 2018}}}}

Mike Love often sang at family get-togethers at his cousins, the Wilsons', home in nearby [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], especially at Christmas. It was here, under the vocal harmony guidance of Brian Wilson, that the Beach Boys sound was established, predominantly influenced by Brian's devotion to the [[Four Freshmen]]'s arrangements. Musical accompaniment during this formative phase was solely Brian's self-taught piano, but this was quickly expanded by the guitar contributions of Brian's college friend [[Al Jardine]] (whose fundamental interest was [[folk music]]) and [[Carl Wilson]] (whose idol was [[Chuck Berry]]).{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=10–11}} With the failure of Love Sheet Metal, the family was forced to move to a modest two-bedroom house in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], closer to the Wilsons.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=53}}

He would bring out the funkier approaches, whether to go ''shoo-boo-bop'' or ''bom-bom-did-di-did-did''. It makes a big difference, because it can change the whole rhythm, the whole color and tone of it."{{sfn|McKeen|2017|p=131}} He also credited Love, an avid fan of [[doo-wop]] combos, with influencing Brian to listen to black [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] records. Writer Geoffrey Himes stated that without "Mike's R&amp;B influence ... Brian couldn’t have possibly become 'Brian Wilson.'"&lt;ref name="HimeSurf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To write many of the Beach Boys songs, Love drew inspiration from the lyrics of Chuck Berry along with [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]], who wrote many of [[the Everly Brothers]]' songs including "[[Devoted to You (song)|Devoted to You]]" and "[[All I Have to Do is Dream]]". He explained, "They were both the fun, descriptive pictorial vignettes as well as the more sweet, romantic and devotional lyrics. ...

[[File:Dennis Wilson.gif|thumb|left|Love, 1966]]

In early 1964, Brian Wilson began shifting the Beach Boys away from beach-themed music.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=28}} That November, Love told a ''[[Melody Maker]]'' reporter that he and his band mates wanted to look beyond [[surf music]] and avoid living in the past or resting on the band's laurels.&lt;ref name=Welch1964&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Welch|first1=C|title=Beach Boys Brought their own vegetables – so audiences beware!|magazine=[[Melody Maker]]|date=November 14, 1964|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love is also credited with naming their album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gilstrap |first1=Peter |title=The epic tale of the Beach Boys and the 'Pet Sounds' goats |url=http://curious.kcrw.com/2016/06/the-epic-tale-of-the-beach-boys-and-the-pet-sounds-goats |website=[[KCRW]] |date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has also been reported as resisting the group's new direction. In a 1971 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, business associate [[David Anderle]] quoted Love saying "[[don't fuck with the formula]]". Over the ensuing years, the quote was repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=164}} In the description of music journalist Erik Hedegaard, Love gathered a reputation as "one of the biggest assholes in the history of rock &amp; roll" due to such accusations.&lt;ref name="BalladofMikeLove"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedegaard|first=Erik|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=The Ballad of Mike Love|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-ballad-of-mike-love-20160217|date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderle later said that his statement about "the formula" had been misinterpreted, explaining that the quote was in reference to affairs related to the band's management, not their artistic direction.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=164}} Love dismissed most of the reported claims as hyperbole: "I never said anything bad about any of the tracks. I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''".&lt;ref name="BalladofMikeLove"/&gt; Brian said that he requested Capitol to keep the ''Smile'' album unreleased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masley|first1=Ed|title=Nearly 45 years later, Beach Boys' 'Smile' complete|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/20111020beach-boys-smile-album-cd-complete-finished.html#ixzz3JVEAd8RG|publisher=AZ Central|accessdate=November 19, 2014|location=Arizona|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was not influenced by Love's opposition to the lyrics.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=163–164}} Session musician [[Van Dyke Parks]], who was hired by Brian as the album's lyricist, blamed Love with putting "a stop" on the album and said that he realized "my opportunity to do this little American quilt work with him called ''Smile'' was over and done with" once Brian came to be "surrounded by so many people".&lt;ref name="Holdship2000"/&gt;

Love returned to co-writing with Brian for the Beach Boys' 1967 album ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'', the group's first foray into [[R&amp;B]].{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=164–165}} That same year, Love became one of the many rock musicians who discovered the teachings of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] following [[the Beatles]]' public endorsement of his [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique]] in August 1967. In December, Love and his bandmates attended a lecture by the Maharishi at a [[UNICEF]] Variety Gala in Paris,{{sfn|Love|2016|p=176}} and were moved by the simplicity and effectiveness of his meditation process as a means to obtaining inner peace.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=208}} In January 1968, the Beach Boys attended the Maharishi's public appearances in New York{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=212}} and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], after which he invited Love to join the Beatles at his training seminar in [[Rishikesh]] in northern India.{{sfn|Shumsky|2018|p=225}} Love stayed there from February 28 to March 15.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=212}} He later recalled helping [[Paul McCartney]] with the lyrics of "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]", recorded for the Beatles' [[White Album]] (1968).{{sfn|Love|2016|p=186}}

While in Rishikesh, Love planned a US concert tour that would feature the Beach Boys and the Maharishi as co-headliners.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=195–196}}{{sfn|Morgan|2015|p=147}} The tour begun in May 1968 ended abruptly after five shows due to the disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's subsequent withdrawal to fulfill film contracts.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=195–197}}  In his 2016 autobiography, Love wrote: "I take responsibility for an idea that didn't work. But I don't regret it. I thought I could do some good for people who were lost, confused, or troubled, particularly those who were young and idealistic but also vulnerable, and I thought that was true for a whole bunch of us."{{sfn|Love|2016|p=199}} Despite the ignominy of the tour, the Beach Boys remained ardent supporters of the Maharishi and TM.{{sfn|Shumsky|2018|pp=161–162}}  He became a TM initiator in 1972 and later progressed to more advanced levels such as the TM-Sidhi Course.{{sfn|Shumsky|2018|pp=161–62}}

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Love wrote the words and music of several Beach Boys songs, including "Big Sur" (1973), "Everyone's in Love With You" (1976) and "Sumahama" (1978).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1978, he co-founded the band [[Celebration (1970s band)|Celebration]], which achieved the US top 30 hit single "Almost Summer" (co-written with Brian Wilson and Jardine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=AllMusic |title=Celebration |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/celebration-mn0001009926 |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he released his first solo album, ''[[Looking Back with Love]]'' (1981), with production by [[Curt Boettcher]].

In 1988, the group had a US number 1 hit with "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]", the only number 1 the band achieved without Brian's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Scott |title=The truth behind that annoying hit song ''Kokomo'' |url=https://ew.com/article/2004/05/28/truth-behind-annoying-hit-song-kokomo/ |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=28 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love (along with "Kokomo" co-writers [[Scott McKenzie]], [[Terry Melcher]], and [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]]) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award (1988) in the Original Song category, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for "Kokomo".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Also in 1988, Love was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] along with the other founding members of the Beach Boys. At the induction ceremony Love delivered a hostile speech, criticizing, among others, [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-mike-love-rages-at-the-1988-rock-hall-ceremony-20141216 |title=Flashback: Mike Love Rages at the 1988 Rock Hall Ceremony |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=December 16, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in 2016 if he regretted anything about the night, Love said "Yeah, I regret that I didn't meditate [earlier that day]."&lt;ref name="BalladofMikeLove"/&gt;

In 1992, Love, along with Al Jardine and several of Wilson's family members, sued Brian for [[defamation]] regarding claims made in the 1991 memoir ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]''. The case was settled out of court by publisher [[HarperCollins]], who awarded Love $1.5 million. It was the first of numerous lawsuits that Love would file against Brian.&lt;ref name="BalladofMikeLove"/&gt; Two years later, Love won a legal proceeding to establish what he considered to be proper authorship credit for many of the Beach Boys songs he co-wrote. Love successfully argued that [[Murry Wilson]] avoided crediting him with his early lyrical contributions to Brian's songs, denying Love accrued royalties.&lt;ref name="BalladofMikeLove"/&gt; He later called it "almost certainly the largest case of fraud in music history".{{sfn|Love|2016|p=373}}

===2000s–2010s===
[[File:The Beach Boys concierto.jpg|thumb|right|The touring line-up of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston's "the Beach Boys Band", plus guest member David Marks, in 2008]]

After the death of Carl Wilson in 1998, Love continued to tour with the Beach Boys, along with Bruce Johnston and a supporting band of new musicians, occasionally including actor [[John Stamos]]. He leased exclusive rights to tour under the Beach Boys name in a boardroom settlement with Brother Records, the Beach Boys' company.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 2000, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] premiered a two-part television miniseries, ''[[The Beach Boys: An American Family]]'', that dramatized the Beach Boys' story. It was produced by [[John Stamos]], and was criticized for historical inaccuracies. Love was as an advisor to the film. Some critics accused him of having the film overstate his role in the group and portray negative depictions of Brian and ''Smile'' collaborator Van Dyke Parks.&lt;ref name="Holdship2000"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holdship|first1=Bill|title=Heroes and Villains|url=http://smileysmile.net/board/index.php?topic=2371.25|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc, Inc.]]|date=April 6, 2000|accessdate=July 7, 2016|location=[[Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2005 Love sued Brian and ''[[The Mail On Sunday]]'' newspaper because the Beach Boys' name and Love's image were used in a promotional CD that was given free with the paper to promote the 2004 ''[[Brian Wilson presents Smile]]'' release. Love argued that the unauthorized (by [[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc.]]) free CD resulted in loss of income for the band. The lawsuit was dismissed on May 16, 2007 on the grounds that it was without merit.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=QUICK TAKES; Beach Boys lawsuit dismissed (HOME EDITION)|url=http://www.proquest.com/|accessdate=27 June 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=16 May 2007|page=E.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2012}}

In 2011, Love reunited with Brian, Jardine, Johnston and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] for a [[That's Why God Made the Radio|new Beach Boys album]] and [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour beginning in 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Doyle|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-mike-love-talks-beach-boys-50th-anniversary-tour-20111219#ixzz1h6j7dhlS|title=Exclusive: Mike Love 'Looking Forward' to Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour|work=Rolling Stone|date=2011-12-19|accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Love and Bruce Johnston announced via a press release that following the end of the reunion tour the Beach Boys would revert to the Love/Johnston lineup, without Wilson, Jardine or Marks, all of whom expressed surprise. Although such dates were noted in a late June issue of ''Rolling Stone'', it was widely reported that the three had been "fired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/09/entertainment/la-et-ms-brian-wilson-al-jardine-respond-to-mike-love-on-beach-boys-flap-20121008|title='It kinda feels like getting fired' -- Brian Wilson to Mike Love|first=Brian|last=Wilson|date=9 October 2012|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His autobiography, ''[[Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy]]'', was published on September 13, 2016. Love wrote the book as a response to "many inaccuracies" that had been said about him over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibula|first1=Gary|title=Beach Boy Mike Love brings 'good vibrations' to Naperville|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/ct-nvs-mike-love-book-naperville-st-1012-20161011-story.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published one month before the release of Wilson's autobiography, ''[[I Am Brian Wilson: A Memoir]]''.

Love describes himself as a [[Progressivism|progressive]], although a photographed handshake between him and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s led many to label him as a [[political conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steel|first1=Gary|title=Endless Summer: Brian Wilson vs Mike Love in the battle for the Beach Boys' soul|url=http://thespinoff.co.nz/books/10-01-2017/endless-summer-brian-wilson-vs-mike-love-in-the-battle-for-the-beach-boys-soul/|website=[[The Spinoff]]|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
Love has been a longtime supporter of environmental causes and was among speakers at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and [[Earth Day#Earth Day 2000|Earth Day 2000]] on the Mall in Washington, DC. Love was instrumental in forming StarServe ("Students Taking Action and Responsibility to Serve") which enlisted high-profile celebrities to inspire America's youth to help serve their communities.&lt;ref name="SevenGenerations"/&gt; He also created the Love Foundation, which supports national environmental and educational initiatives.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Love personally donated $100,000 to the [[American Red Cross]] to benefit the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and helped the foundation raise an additional $250,000.

The conflict between the Persian Empire &amp; the [[Lezgian people|Lezgins]] and a myriad of other Caucasian tribes in the north was intermittently fought through the mid-1730s during Nader's first short expedition in the Caucasus until the very last years of his reign and assassination in 1747 with minor skirmishes and raids. The incredibly difficult terrain of the northern Caucasus region made the task of subduing the Lezgins an extremely challenging one. Despite this [[Nader Shah]] gained numerous strongholds and fortresses from the Dagestan people and pushed them to the very verge of defeat. The Lezgins however held on in the northernmost reaches of Dagestan and continued to defy Persian domination.

The conflict was fought over many years and only included a few years of actual hard fighting, usually when Nader himself was present, but otherwise consisted of skirmishes and raids throughout. The majority of the Persian casualties were from the extremity of the weather as well as the outbreak of disease, all of which combined with the indomitable will of the Lezgins to wage an insurgency and retreat to their distant strongholds when threatened with a pitched battle made the entire war a quagmire for Nader's forces. Ultimately the Lezgins who had held on in the northern fortresses marched south upon hearing of Nader's assassination and reclaimed most of their lost territories as the Persian empire crumbled.

In 1741, an attempt was made on Nāder’s life near [[Derbent|Darband]]. When the would-be assassin claimed that he had been recruited by [[Reza Qoli Mirza Afshar|Reza Qoli]], the shah had his son blinded in retaliation, an act for which he later felt great remorse. Marvi reported that Nāder began to manifest signs of physical deterioration and mental instability. Finally, the shah was forced to reinstate taxes due to insufficient funds, and the heavy levies sparked numerous rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nader-shah&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
After Nader's successful campaign in 1735 against the Ottomans, he lingered on appointing new governors to his newly acquired cities and kingdoms before setting out against the Lezgians in northern Daghestan. The Tatars who had marched all the way from Crimea, on receiving news of Koprulu Pasha's demise at the [[Battle of Yeghevārd]], turned and hastened back north along the black sea coast. The Lezgians however were determined to fight, especially with the advent of the winter snow in the tight restricted mountain passes of northern [[Daghestan]]. The Lezgian leader suffered a crippling defeat in June 1736 and fled to the Avars with many of his subjects making peace with Nader.&lt;ref&gt;Axworthy, Michael (2009). ''The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant'', p. 206. I. B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1739, during [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire]], his brother, [[Ebrahim Khan Afshar]], launched a campaign to subdue the Lezgins in Dagestan. Events initially unfolded very favourably, with the Lezgins being defeated decisively in a pitched battle. However, Ebrahim Khan and a small group of his retainers were ambushed when they were passing through a valley. The Lezgins killed Ebrahim Khan and desecrated his corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Floor, Wiilem(2009). ''The rise &amp; fall of Nader Shah: Dutch East India Company Reports 1730-1747'', Mage Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign of 1741==
Nader recruited for the occasion 100,000-150,000 soldiers from all parts of Iran, but also Tatars and Uzbeks. Many Dagestan tribes came south to Nader's camp to submit and pay tribute, though others prepared for resistance. The prominent [[Georgians|Georgian]] nobleman [[Givi Amilakhvari]], who was appointed as a governor (''wakil'') of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] for the shah of Iran and reconfirmed as Prince of Saamilakhoro and Duke (''[[eristavi]]'') of Ksani in the same year of 1741, took part in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442241466|page=120|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=JNNQCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nader+shah+givi&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader first sent 10,000 mounted [[Military of the Afsharid dynasty of Persia#Tofangchi|Tofangchi]] led by Mir Alam Khan Khazime, Esmail Beig Minbâshi and Zaman Beig Minbâshi Mashhadi to subdue the Lezgins. However, they failed to defeat the 30,000 Lezgin warriors, most of whom were musketeers, and were driven back. Nader then ordered Rahim Khan Uzbek and his troop composed between 10,000 and 11,000 [[Military of the Afsharid dynasty of Persia#Tofangchi|Tofangchi]] from different tribes to reinforce the engaged Persian troops. Together, they devastated the Lezgin army, killing 5,000 men. The rest of Lezgins took refuge in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teheran.ir/spip.php?article1970#gsc.tab=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Nader eventually reached the last fortress of the Lezgins in northern Dagestan and laid siege to it. But because of the early arrival of winter and outbreak of disease as well as the difficult logistical situation Nader chose to withdraw. This could also have been due to Nader's deteriorating health which made the climate more insufferable. Nader's columns was [[Battle of Andalal|constantly harassed on their way south]] and Nader could not bring the Lezgins to commit in a set piece battle despite trying to do so numerous times. The Persian army suffered great casualties and many of the tribes which had initially submitted to Persian suzerainty rebelled again. It was during this campaign that an attempted assassination of Nader Shah failed. Suspecting his eldest son, Mirza Rezâ gholi, took out his eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Axworthy. "Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nader's last campaign==
After negotiations had broken down with the Istanbul, Nader declared war against the Ottomans and invaded Mesopotamia again. However, because of the lengthy siege of Mosul and numerous rebellions throughout the interior of Persia the campaign was indecisive and Nader withdrew after coming to terms with the Ottoman negotiators. Later he launched another campaign in Dagestan. The tribes refused to be drawn into any set piece battles as they again took to the hills and forests in the mountainous terrain of the north Caucasus. Nader's invasion made even less progress this time around and no conclusive result came of this last expedition in Dagestan. This expedition was notorious for its bloodthirsty nature with many villages and towns razed to the ground and their inhabitants slain or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Axworthy. "Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant" p234–238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
Nader Shah's ultimately failed attempts at annexing Dagestan became a source for legends, myths and folk-tales amongst the people of the north [[Caucasus]]. The Avar epic ''Srazhenie s Nadir Shakhom'', (The battle with Nāder Shah), and the ''Lak Pesnya o geroe Murtazaali'', (Epic of the hero Mortażā ʿAlī), provide a vivid and colourful picture of the triumph over “the scourge of the universe.” These works represent the pinnacle of the Dāḡestānī epic genre; their significance to the mountain peoples “can be compared to that of ''Slovo o polku Igoreve'' (The lay of the army of Igor) in Russian epic poetry”.&lt;ref&gt;N. V. Kapieva, Pesni narodov Dagestana (Songs of the peoples of Dāḡestān), Leningrad, 1970. page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicola Edgington''' (born 1980){{cn|date=November 2018}} is a [[British people|British]] woman convicted of [[manslaughter]] due to [[diminished responsibility]], [[attempted murder]] and [[murder]]. 

==Early history==
Edgington has a younger brother and younger sister and attended [[Sackville School, East Grinstead|Sackville School]].&lt;ref name="Sis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastgrinsteadcourier.co.uk/East-Grinstead-pupil-accused-murder/story-13543361-detail/story.html|title=Sussex News - Latest local news, pictures, video - Kent Live|website=www.eastgrinsteadcourier.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgington told police that she was abused by her father when younger.&lt;ref name="IPCC report"&gt;[http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/hodkin_investigation_report.pdf Independent Police Complaints Commission report] 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She shoplifted during her adolescence and used violence against her brother and mother since childhood.&lt;ref name="Sis"/&gt; She had stays in [[Foster care in the United Kingdom|care homes]] at times.

==Killing of her mother==
On 4 November 2005, Edgington stabbed her 60-year-old mother, Marion, nine times in [[Forest Row]], [[East Sussex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1532219/Psychotic-daughter-killed-mother-in-frenzied-knife-attack.html|title=Psychotic daughter killed mother in frenzied knife attack|first=David|last=Sapsted|date=23 October 2006|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM released"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2275138/Nicola-Edgington-Schizophrenic-decapitated-innocent-grandmother-street-12in-butchers-knife-guilty-murder.html|title='The last time I felt like this I killed my mum': Schizophrenic's FIVE desperate 999 calls for help before decapitating grandmother|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she was convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility (based on diagnoses of [[schizophrenia]] and [[borderline personality disorder|emotionally unstable personality traits]]&lt;ref name="IPCC report"/&gt;) at Lewes Crown Court on 23 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/07/nicola-edgington-guilty-murder-stranger|title=Freed killer found guilty of murdering stranger in knife attack|first=Press|last=Association|date=7 February 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was detained indefinitely under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] and, following treatment and psychiatric evaluation, was released conditionally in September 2009,&lt;ref name="BBC g"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-21195602|title=Freed killer guilty of street murder|date=7 February 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving into a [[Greenwich]] flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-21653018|title='Mistakes made' on freed killer|date=4 March 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing and attempted killing of strangers==
===Build-up===
In September 2011, Edgington sent a message via [[Facebook]] to her brother saying she was not getting the help she needed, missed her mother, and had had a [[miscarriage]]. She left her phone number and asked him not to tell their father, Harry, that she had made contact. Her brother replied that she killed their mother and he found the body, that the miscarriage was good news, and that she should kill herself by cutting her wrists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/10170020.Bexleyheath_murder_accused_Nicola_Edgington_told_to__cut_wrists__by_her_brother/ Bexleyheath murder accused Nicola Edgington told to 'cut wrists' by her brother] 17 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgington sought help from the controversial [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]] prior to the attacks, as she had prior to the killing of her mother, which may have disturbed her further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/crime/bexleyheath_knife_murder/10214593.Bexleyheath_murderer_Nicola_Edgington_s_religious_delusions/ Bexleyheath murderer Nicola Edgington's religious delusions] 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6, 7 and 9 October, Edgington contacted police several times by phone and once in person reporting that individuals were making death threats against her (naming one individual), and later that two cocaine users were refusing to leave her flat and may have stolen from her. Despite initially being graded as serious and requiring police attendance, no police were dispatched to investigate.&lt;ref name="IPCC report"/&gt;

On the morning of 10 October 2011, Edgington pleaded numerous times with police and local mental health services to physically detain her under their legal powers as she felt she was having another [[psychotic]] breakdown, saying she had killed someone before and that the more scared she became the more dangerous she could be. Although taken to Queen Elizabeth hospital, she was left there by police prior to being securely admitted, and the psychiatric staff decided they were only going to admit her on a voluntary basis despite her risk profile and secure care plan being in her psychiatric file.&lt;ref name="IPCC report"/&gt; 

===Attacks===
Later in the morning of 10 October 2011, while waiting for staff to change shift and admit her, Edgington left the hospital through a door that should have been locked, took two buses, and stabbed two strangers in the street in separate attacks in [[Bexleyheath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/2013/02/07/nicola-edgington-freed-killer-who-decapitated-woman-with-butcher-knife-jailed-3398364/|title=Freed killer 'decapitated' woman in knife rampage|date=7 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bought a knife from [[Asda]] with which she tried to kill 22-year-old Kerry Clark, who survived and a member of the public took the knife off her. Edgington subsequently stole a knife from a butcher's shop and stabbed and beheaded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/new-probe-in-case-of-psychiatric-patient-who-beheaded-woman-a3760316.html|title=New probe in case of psychiatric patient who beheaded woman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 58-year-old Sally Hodkin, who died of her injuries within minutes.&lt;ref name="BBC g"/&gt; Edgington was arrested later the same morning.

===Judgement===
According to psychiatrists, Edgington was suffering from paranoid [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]], with a religious [[subtext]]. She believed a 100-eyed monster was guarding the throne of God against enemies, and saw shops looking like a nuclear holocaust had taken place; she believed Jesus had come back to save everyone's souls except hers which she couldn't understand as she loved God. She also felt she was in a computer simulation and had various bizarre beliefs relating to famous figures and films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/crime/bexleyheath_knife_murder/10189819.Nicola_Edgington_had__delusions_of_100_eyed_monster__before_Bexleyheath_stabbings/ Nicola Edgington had 'delusions of 100-eyed monster' before Bexleyheath stabbings] 28 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 February 2013 at the [[Old Bailey]], Edgington was convicted by jury of the attempted murder of Clark and of the murder of Hodkin.&lt;ref name="BBC g"/&gt; Judge [[Brian Barker]] jailed her for life on 4 March 2013, with a minimum tariff of 37 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-21653018|title='Mistakes made' on freed killer|date=4 March 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barker wrote that despite Edgington's firm long-standing diagnosis of schizophrenia and probable psychosis around the time of the attacks, he believed the over-riding factor was [[borderline personality disorder]] (in the UK usually referred to in ICD terms as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Borderline Type) with rational ability. He referred to a recent medical report indicating no need for hospital treatment for Edgington. Despite Edgington having sought multiple times to have herself detained by the police or medical services prior to her actions, Barker stated that the killing was premeditated in a way that showed a "consistent and calculated course of criminal conduct". Barker included the random and unprovoked nature of the attacks as [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating factors]] indicating more guilt, while disregarding the [[Mitigation (law)|mitigating]] factor of mental disability since the psychiatric authorities disagreed about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Judgments/sentencing-remarks-r-v-edgington.pdf Sentencing Remarks of Judge Brian Barker] 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Ogawa}}
{{nihongo|'''Ogawa Jihei VII'''|小川治兵衛|Ogawa Jihei|extra= May 25, 1860 – December 2, 1933}}, also known under his titular name as the seventh '''Ueji''' (植治), was a [[Japanese garden]] architect of the [[Meiji era]] and [[Taishō era]] of modern Japan. 

== Biography ==
He was born Yamamoto Gennosuke and adopted into the Ogawa family at the age of 17 with his marriage to Ogawa Mitsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.japantravel.com/kyoto/kyoto-murin-an-villa/7998|title=Kyoto Murin-an Villa|author=Tomoko Kamishima|date=December 2013|work=JapanTravel}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sudden death of the sixth Ueji, he became the head of the family with 19 years. The ''Ueji'' title is a name that was given to the heads of the Ogawa family, who specialised since generations in gardening and [[landscape architecture]] for clients around [[Kyoto]], the old capital city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyoto-info.com/kyoto/shigoto/shousai/english_u.html|title=Ueji, The Genius of Water and Stone|author=|date=|work=kyoto-info.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of the company that is still led by the family today. 
[[File:Murinan01r.jpg|thumb|Garden of Murin-an with the Higashiyama in the background, designed by him in 1894–1898]]
Ueji grew up in a time when the country was rapidly changing and leaving the [[Edo period]] behind to westernise. In this uncertain time he was given the commission by statesman [[Yamagata Aritomo]], an important figure in the political and military fields, to create the garden for his [[Murin-an]] villa in Kyoto. It was built from 1894–1898. The garden is considered one of the masterpieces of Japanese landscape architecture and has been registered by the government as an [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Property]].&lt;ref name="robertketchell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertketchell.blogspot.ch/2014/12/ogawa-jihei-japanese-garden-genius.html|title=Ogawa Jihei, Japanese Garden Genius|author=Robert Ketchell|date= 27 December 2014|work=robertketchell.blogspot.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter William Coonan''' (born '''Peter William Sutcliffe'''; 2 June 1946) is an English [[serial killer]] who was dubbed the "'''Yorkshire Ripper'''" by the press. In 1981, Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others.

Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]]. When interviewed by authorities, he claimed that the [[voice of God]] had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. Sutcliffe carried out his murder spree over five years, during which time the public were especially shocked by the murders of women who were not prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper: The In-Depth Study of a Mass Killer and His Methods'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest for driving with false [[Vehicle registration plate|number plate]]s in January 1981, the police questioned him about the killings and he confessed to being the perpetrator.

At his trial in 1981, he pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of [[diminished responsibility]] after a diagnosis of [[Paranoid Schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenia]] but his defence was rejected by a majority of the jury. He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of [[life imprisonment]]. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother's maiden name and became known as Peter William Coonan.

[[West Yorkshire Police]] were criticised for the time taken in apprehending Sutcliffe despite interviewing him nine times during the murder hunt. Because of the sensational nature of the case, the police handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading (including a [[Wearside Jack|hoax recorded message]] and letters purporting to be from the "Ripper"). The 1982 Byford Report of the official inquiry (made public in 2006) confirmed the validity of the criticism.

The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales#Whole life order|whole life order]] and never be released from custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/470615/Peter-Sutcliffe-Yorkshire-Ripper-Elvis-statue-prison-for-wife|title=Peter Sutcliffe: Yorkshire Ripper makes Elvis statue for his wife|accessdate=8 July 2016|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred from prison to a [[Broadmoor Hospital|high-security psychiatric hospital]] in March 1984. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and was transferred that month to [[HM Prison Frankland]] in Durham.

==Early life==
Sutcliffe was born in [[Bingley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] to a [[working-class]] family. He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yallop|first=David|title=Deliver us from Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7_QBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT210|year=2014|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-47211-658-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (née Coonan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html|title=A Killer's Mask|work=trutv.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321003633/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html|archivedate=21 March 2009|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and  had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a [[gravedigger]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Stephen|title=Who is the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe?

He left this position when he was asked to go on the road as a salesman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper: The In-Depth Study of a Mass Killer and His Methods'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Baird Television, he worked nightshifts at the Britannia Works of Anderton International from April 1973. In February 1975, he took [[Voluntary Redundancy|redundancy]] and used half of the £400 pay-off to train as a [[Large Goods Vehicle|heavy goods vehicle (HGV)]] driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gordon |last=Burn |authorlink=Gordon Burn |year=1993 |title=Somebody's Husband, Somebody's Son: The Story of Peter Sutcliffe |publisher=Mandarin |isbn=978-0-7493-1331-9 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 1976, he was dismissed for the theft of used tyres. He was unemployed until October 1976, when he found a job as an HGV driver for T.&amp; W.H. Clark (Holdings) Ltd. on the Canal Road [[Industrial Estate]] in [[Bradford]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper: The In-Depth Study of a Mass Killer and His Methods'' {{ISBN|978-0586-05526-7}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe, by some reports, used prostitutes as a young man, and it has been speculated that he had a bad experience during which he was conned out of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/54/biography/1/Peter_Sutcliffe_The_Yorkshire_Ripper.htm "Peter Sutcliffe: The Yorkshire Ripper – Famous Criminal",] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620054640/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/54/biography/1/Peter_Sutcliffe_The_Yorkshire_Ripper.htm |date=20 June 2008 }} ''Crime And Investigation Network''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}} Other analyses of his actions have not found evidence that he actually sought their services although he clearly expressed unusual behaviour{{clarify|reason=Expressed? + What behaviour?|date=June 2018}} before the killings.&lt;ref name=grisly/&gt;

He met [[Sonia Sutcliffe|Sonia Szurma]] on [[St Valentine's Day|14 February]] 1967; they married on 10 August 1974. She suffered several miscarriages and they were informed that she would not be able to have children. She resumed a teacher training course, during which time she had an affair with an ice-cream van driver. When she completed the course in 1977 and began teaching, she and Sutcliffe used her salary to buy a house in [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]], [[Bradford]], which they moved into on 26 September 1977, and where they lived at the time of Sutcliffe's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html "Peter Sutcliffe" "A Killer's Mask"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321003633/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html |date=21 March 2009 }}, by Fiona Steel for Trutv.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his childhood and his early adolescence, Sutcliffe showed no signs of abnormality. Later, in part related to his occupation as a gravedigger, he developed an unhealthy, macabre sense of humour. In his late adolescence, he developed a growing obsession with voyeurism and spent much time spying on prostitutes and the men seeking their services.&lt;ref name=grisly&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Serial Killer Investigations: The Grisly Business Unit|author1=Robert D. Keppel|author2=William J. Birnes|pages=32|publisher=Academic Press|date=2003|isbn=9780124042605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks and murders==

===1969===
Sutcliffe assaulted a prostitute he had met while searching for a woman who had tricked him out of money. He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running. He told Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went back to the car and got in it".&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim01.htm |title=Stone-in-sock attack |publisher=Execulink.com |date=29 September 1969 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police visited his home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's [[vehicle registration plate]]. Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand. The police told him he was "very lucky" as the woman did not want anything more to do with the incident – she was a known prostitute, and her husband was serving a jail term for assault.&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"/&gt;

===1975===
Sutcliffe committed his second assault on the night of 5 July 1975 in [[Keighley]]. He attacked Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a [[ball-peen hammer]] and slashing her stomach with a knife. Disturbed by a neighbour, he left without killing her. Rogulskyj survived after extensive medical intervention but was [[Psychological trauma|psychologically traumatised]] by the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/life_2.html TruTV.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001184952/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/life_2.html |date=1 October 2012 }} Fiona Steel; retrieved 25 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe attacked Olive Smelt in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in August. Employing the same ''[[modus operandi]]'', he struck her from behind and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including [[clinical depression]]. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in [[Silsden]]. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off when he saw the lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Yallop|Yallop, David]]. ''Deliver Us From Evil''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ISBN# needed, originally published 1981 so cannot support the date unless from a later edition. --&gt;

The first victim to lose her life in a Sutcliffe attack was Wilma McCann on 30 October. McCann, from [[Chapeltown, West Yorkshire|Chapeltown]] in [[Leeds]], was a mother of four. Sutcliffe struck her twice with a hammer before stabbing her 15 times in the neck, chest and abdomen. An extensive inquiry, involving 150 police officers and 11,000 interviews, failed to find the culprit. One of McCann's daughters died by suicide in December 2007, reportedly after suffering years of depression over her mother's death.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton, Allegra. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/27/ukcrime.uk "Daughter Of Ripper Victim Kills Herself",] ''The Guardian''. 27 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976===
Sutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds in January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Jackson 52 times. In dire financial straits, Jackson had been using the family van to exchange sexual favours for money. Sutcliffe picked up Jackson who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, he then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim07.htm|title=THE ATTACKS AND MURDERS - EMILY JACKSON|website=www.execulink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe hit her on the head with a hammer, and then dragged her body into a rubbish strewn yard and used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen. Sutcliffe stamped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim07.htm |title=Emily Jackson |publisher=Execulink.com |date=20 January 1976 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe attacked 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in [[Roundhay Park]], Leeds, on 9 May. Walking home from a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When she got out of the car to urinate, Sutcliffe hit her from behind with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At the time of this attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

===1977===
On 5 February Sutcliffe attacked Irene Richardson, a Chapeltown prostitute, in Roundhay Park. Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer. Once she was dead, he mutilated her corpse with a knife. Tyre&lt;!-- Please retain British English spelling 'tyre' in this sentence --&gt; tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0586-05526-7}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, on 23 April, Sutcliffe killed Patricia "Tina" Atkinson, a prostitute from Bradford, in her flat, where police found a bootprint on the bedclothes. Two months later on 26 June, he murdered 16-year-old Jayne MacDonald in Chapeltown. She was not a prostitute and, in the public perception, showed that all women were potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim11.htm |title=Jayne MacDonald |publisher=Execulink.com |date=26 June 1977 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe seriously assaulted Maureen Long in Bradford in July. He was interrupted and left her for dead. A witness misidentified the make of his car. More than 300 police officers collected 12,500 statements and checked thousands of cars, without success. On 1 October 1977 Sutcliffe murdered Jean Jordan, a prostitute from [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cross| first = Roger| title = Yorkshire Ripper| year = 1981| publisher = HarperCollins UK| isbn = 978-0-586-05526-7| page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was found 10 days later and had been moved several days after her death. In a confession, Sutcliffe said he had realised the new £5 note he had given her was traceable. After hosting a family party at his new home, he returned to the wasteland behind Manchester's [[Southern Cemetery, Manchester|Southern Cemetery]], where he had left the body, to retrieve the note. Unable to find it, he mutilated Jordan's corpse and moved it.&lt;ref name="execulink.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim13.htm |title=Jean Jordan |publisher=Execulink.com |date=1 October 1977 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Jordan's body was discovered by a local dairy worker, [[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]], who had an [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] on land adjoining the site where the body was found and was searching for house bricks when he made the discovery. The £5 note, hidden in a secret compartment in Jordan's handbag, was traced to branches of the [[Midland Bank]] in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] and [[Bingley]]. Police analysis of bank operations allowed them to narrow their field of inquiry to 8,000 employees who could have received it in their wage packet. Over three months the police interviewed 5,000 men, including Sutcliffe. The police found that the alibi given for Sutcliffe's whereabouts was credible; he had indeed spent much of the evening of the killing at a family party. Weeks of intense investigations pertaining to the origins of the £5 note led to nothing, leaving police officers frustrated that they collected an important clue, but had been unable to trace the actual firm (or employee within the firm) to which the note had been issued.&lt;ref name=shook&gt;"The Yorkshire Ripper". ''Crimes That Shook Britain'': Season 4, Episode 4. (6 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December, Sutcliffe attacked Marilyn Moore, another prostitute from Leeds. She survived and provided police with a description of her attacker.&lt;!-- Please retain British English spelling 'tyre' in following sentence --&gt; Tyre tracks found at the scene matched those from an earlier attack.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

===1978===
The police discontinued the search for the person who received the £5 note in January 1978. Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about it, he was not investigated further (he was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper Squad on several further occasions). That month, Sutcliffe killed again. His victim was Yvonne Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford. He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-pein hammer then jumped on her chest before stuffing horse-hair into her mouth from a discarded sofa under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was not found until 26 March.

Ten days later, he killed Helen Rytka, an 18-year-old prostitute from [[Huddersfield]]. He struck Rytka on the head five times as she exited his vehicle, before stripping many of her clothes from her body (although her bra and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts), before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest. Her body was found beneath railway arches in the timber-yard to which he had driven her three days later.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, Sutcliffe killed Vera Millward in an attack in the car park of [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim17.htm |title=website |publisher=Execulink.com |date=16 May 1978 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979===
On 4 April 1979, Sutcliffe killed Josephine Whitaker, a 19-year-old building society clerk whom he attacked on Saville Park Moor in Halifax as she was walking home. Despite forensic evidence, police efforts were diverted for several months following receipt of a taped message purporting to be from the murderer taunting Assistant Chief Constable [[George Oldfield (detective)|George Oldfield]], who was leading the investigation. The tape contained a man's voice saying "I'm Jack. I see you're having no luck catching me. I have the greatest respect for you, George, but Lord, you're no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started."&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes'' by Martin Fido&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the recorded message, police began searching for a man with a [[Wearside]] accent, which linguists narrowed down to the [[Castletown, Tyne and Wear|Castletown]] area of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The hoaxer, dubbed "[[Wearside Jack]]", sent two letters to police and ''The Daily Mirror'' in March 1978 boasting of his crimes. The letters, signed "[[Jack the Ripper]]", claimed responsibility for the murder of 26-year-old Joan Harrison in [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in November 1975. At the time, police mistakenly believed that the Preston murder was not public knowledge.
(The hoaxer case was re-opened in 2005, and DNA taken from envelopes was entered into the national database. On 20 October 2005, [[John Samuel Humble]], an unemployed alcoholic and long-time resident of the [[Ford Estate]] in Sunderland – a few miles from Castletown – was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice for sending the hoax letters and tape. Humble, whose DNA had been taken following a drunk and disorderly offence in 2001, was remanded in custody and on 21 March 2006 was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herbert|first1=Ian|title=Wearside Jack: I deserve to go to jail for 'evil' Ripper hoax|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/wearside-jack-i-deserve-to-go-to-jail-for-evil-ripper-hoax-6106028.html|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=The Independent|date=21 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Barbara Leach, a [[University of Bradford|Bradford University]] student. Her body was dumped at the rear of 13 Ashgrove under a pile of bricks, close to the university and her lodgings. It was his 16th attack. The murder of a woman who was not a prostitute again alarmed the public and prompted an expensive publicity campaign emphasising the Wearside connection. Despite the false lead, Sutcliffe was interviewed on at least two other occasions in 1979. Despite matching several forensic clues and being on the list of 300 names in connection with the £5 note, he was not strongly suspected. Sutcliffe was interviewed by police nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/intervws.htm |title=Vera Millward |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980===
In April 1980 Sutcliffe was arrested for drunk-driving. While awaiting trial, he killed two more women. He murdered 47-year-old Marguerite Walls on the night of 20 August, and 20-year-old Jacqueline Hill, a student at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]], on the night of 17 November. Hill's body was found in the grounds of the Lupton Residences. He attacked three other women who survived; Dr Uphadya Bandara in Leeds on 24 September, Maureen Lea (known as Mo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cocozza|first=Paula|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/05/mo-lea-artist-yorkshire-ripper-peter-sutcliffe|title='I've turned the tables on Peter Sutcliffe': artist Mo Lea on why she finally drew her attacker|work=The Guardian|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an art student attacked in the grounds of Leeds University on 25 October and 16-year-old Theresa Sykes, attacked in Huddersfield on the night of 5 November. On 25 November Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe, reported him to the police as a suspect but the information vanished into the paperwork already accumulated.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
[[File:Milgarth Police Station, Leeds.jpg|thumb|right|Millgarth Police Station in [[Leeds city centre]], where the Yorkshire Ripper police investigation was conducted.]]

On 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers in the driveway of Light Trades House in Melbourne Avenue, [[Broomhill (ward)|Broomhill]], [[Sheffield]]. A police check by probationary constable Robert Hydes revealed his car had false number plates and Sutcliffe was arrested and transferred to [[Dewsbury]] Police Station. At Dewsbury he was questioned in relation to the Yorkshire Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics. The next day police returned to the scene of the arrest and discovered a knife, hammer and rope he had discarded when he briefly slipped away from the police after telling them he was "bursting for a pee". Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet. The police obtained a [[search warrant]] for his home at 6 Garden Lane in Heaton, Bradford and brought his wife in for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/arrest.htm |title=Arrest and confession |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sutcliffe was stripped at the police station he was wearing an inverted V-neck sweater under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs and the V-neck exposed his genital area. The front of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims' corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not made public until the 2003 book, ''Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper'', by Michael Bilton was published. After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper. Over the next day, Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks. Weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder the women. He displayed emotion only when telling of the killing of his youngest victim, Jayne MacDonald, and when questioned about the murder of Joan Harrison, which he vehemently denied committing. Harrison's murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by the "Wearside Jack" claim, and in 2011, [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] proved it had been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who had died in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DNA helps police 'solve' 1975 Joan Harrison murder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-12396506|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe was charged at Dewsbury on 5 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/confessn.htm |title=Statement |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial, he pleaded not guilty to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]]. The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe claimed to have heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger. He said the voices originated from a headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial04.htm "The Trial: Week Two"], Trial of Peter Sutcliffe&lt;/ref&gt; and that the voices were that of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2833589.stm "MP's Ripper prison demand",] ''BBC World News''. 9 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527001131/http://www.crimeandjustice.us/forums/lofiversion/index.php?t6951.html "Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe's Weight-Gain Strategy in Latest Bid for Freedom",] ''New Criminologist''. 25 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He pleaded guilty to seven charges of attempted murder. The prosecution intended to accept Sutcliffe's plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] but the trial judge, Mr Justice Boreham, demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution reasoning. After a two-hour representation by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] [[Michael Havers|Sir Michael Havers]], a 90-minute lunch break and another 40&amp;nbsp;minutes of legal discussion, the judge rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the psychiatrists, insisting that the case should be dealt with by a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5 May 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial01.htm Execulink.com website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial03.htm |title=Trial: week 1 |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted two weeks and despite the efforts of his counsel [[James Chadwin|James Chadwin QC]], Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and was sentenced to 20 concurrent sentences of [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/22/newsid_2504000/2504409.stm "1981: Yorkshire Ripper jailed for life"], BBC On This Day, 22 May&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judge said Sutcliffe was beyond redemption, and hoped he would never leave prison. He recommended a minimum term of 30 years to be served before parole could be considered meaning Sutcliffe would have been unlikely to be freed until at least 2011. On 16 July 2010, the [[High Court]] issued Sutcliffe with a [[whole life tariff]], meaning  he is unlikely ever to be released. The whole life tariff was introduced by the government in 1983, and over the next 20 years it was reported that Sutcliffe was among the small group of prisoners to have been issued with a whole life tariff. Politicians were stripped of their powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners in November 2002, and the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner can serve has since rested with the High Court.

After his trial, Sutcliffe admitted two other attacks. It was decided that prosecution for these offences was "not in the public interest". [[West Yorkshire Police]] made it clear that the victims wished to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/otherv.htm Execulink.com website]; retrieved 25 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of West Yorkshire Police==
West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34615802|title=
One Girl's Life in the Ripper Years|accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=BBC|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. The 1982 Byford report into the investigation concluded 'The ineffectiveness of the major incident room was a serious handicap to the Ripper investigation. While it should have been the effective nerve centre of the whole police operation, the backlog of unprocessed information resulted in the failure to connect vital pieces of related information. This serious fault in the central index system allowed Peter Sutcliffe to continually slip through the net'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/byfdsamp.htm|title=BYFORD AND SAMPSON REPORTS|website=www.execulink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/15/story-of-yorkshire-ripper-hoaxer-wearside-jack-to-be-made-into-movie|title=Story of Yorkshire Ripper Hoaxer 'Wearside Jack' to be Made into Movie |accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the [[FBI]], plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis,&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that "Wearside Jack" was a blatant hoaxer.{{refn|group=n|George Oldfield and other senior individuals involved in the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper had consulted senior [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|Special Agent]]s [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]] and [[Robert Ressler]] in an effort to construct a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the Yorkshire Ripper in 1979. After playing the hoax tape to Ressler and Douglas, Ressler said to Oldfield: "You do realise, of course, that the man on the tape is not the killer, don't you?" Oldfield chose to ignore this observation.&lt;ref&gt;Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp. 260–261&lt;/ref&gt;}} The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The "Wearside Jack" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the [[Home Office Large Major Enquiry System]], the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In response to the police reaction to the murders, the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] organised a number of '[[Reclaim the Night]]' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in ''[[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire]]''.  The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that the [[Chief Constable]] of West Yorkshire did not owe a [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]] to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the [[Caparo test|''Caparo'' test]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050421/brooks-1.htm "Judgments – Brooks (FC) (Respondent) v.

==Byford Report==
The [[Inspector of Constabulary]] Sir Lawrence Byford's 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case was not released by the Home Office until 1 June 2006. The sections  "Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults" and parts of the section on Sutcliffe's "immediate associates" were not disclosed by the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/mistakes-that-left-ripper-on-the-loose-1-2372470|title= Mistakes that left Ripper on the loose|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of the murder of Wilma McCann, the report states: "There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities" and "it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas but also in other parts of the country".&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Rob|last2=Campbell|first2=Duncan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/02/freedomofinformation.ukcrime|title=Ripper guilty of additional crimes, says secret report|work=The Guardian|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 Sutcliffe, described in the Byford Report as an "otherwise unremarkable young man", came to the notice of police on two occasions over incidents with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/ripper-may-have-attacked-more/2006/06/02/1148956547934.html|title=Ripper may have attacked more|work=Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Reuters|date=3 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norfolk|first=Andrew|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article2461911.ece|title=Peter Sutcliffe, the bullied mummy’s boy who gave millions nightmares|work=The Times|location=London|date=2 March 2010|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also arrested in Bradford's [[red light district]] for being in possession of a hammer, an offensive weapon, but he was charged with "going equipped for stealing" as it was assumed he was a potential burglar.&lt;ref name="home office"&gt;"Sir Lawrence Byford report into the police handling of the Yorkshire Ripper case", ''Home Office''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; The report said that it was clear he had on at least one occasion attacked a Bradford prostitute with a [[Club (weapon)|cosh]].&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Byford's report states:

{{quote|We feel it is highly improbable that the crimes in respect of which Sutcliffe has been charged and convicted are the only ones attributable to him. This feeling is reinforced by examining the details of a number of assaults on women since 1969 which, in some ways, clearly fall into the established pattern of Sutcliffe's overall modus operandi. I hasten to add that I feel sure that the senior police officers in the areas concerned are also mindful of this possibility but, in order to ensure full account is taken of all the information available, I have arranged for an effective liaison to take place.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

Police identified a number of attacks which matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes.

The Byford Report's major findings were contained in a summary published by the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Whitelaw]], the first time precise details of the bungled police investigation had been disclosed. Sir Lawrence described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe since 1966. On 25 November 1980, Birdsall sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows:

{{quote|I have good reason to {{sic|now}} the man you are looking for in the Ripper case. This man {{sic|as|nolink=yes}} dealings with prostitutes and always had a thing about them… His name and address is Peter Sutcliffe, 6 Garden Lane, Heaton, Bradford. Works for Clarke's Transport, Shipley.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

This letter was marked "Priority No 1". An index card was created on the basis of the letter and a policewoman found Sutcliffe already had three existing index cards in the records. But "for some inexplicable reason", said the Byford Report, the papers remained in a filing tray in the incident room until the murderer's arrest on 2 January the following year.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;

Birdsall visited Bradford Police Station the day after sending the letter to repeat his misgivings about Sutcliffe. He added that he was with Sutcliffe when he got out of a car to pursue a woman with whom he had had a bar room dispute in Halifax on 16 August 1975. This was the date and place of the Olive Smelt attack. A report compiled on the visit was lost, despite a "comprehensive search" which took place after Sutcliffe's arrest, according to the report.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt; Byford said:

{{quote|The failure to take advantage of Birdsall's anonymous letter and his visit to the police station was yet again a stark illustration of the progressive decline in the overall efficiency of the major incident room. It resulted in Sutcliffe being at liberty for more than a month when he might conceivably have been in custody. Thankfully, there is no reason to think he committed any further murderous assaults within that period.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

==Custody==
===Prison and Broadmoor Hospital===
Following his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDQ0Mg==|title=74 Adjudication|work=News &amp; Features|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|date=29 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207144321/http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDQ0Mg%3D%3D|archivedate=7 December 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his sentence at [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|HMP Parkhurst]] on 22 May 1981. Despite being found sane at his trial, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked. While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence. On 10 January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into the recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst Prison and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe's face, creating four wounds requiring 30 stitches.&lt;ref name="Brannen"&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/attackps.htm "Attacks on Peter Sutcliffe",] ''The Yorkshire Ripper''.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1984 Sutcliffe was sent to [[Broadmoor Hospital]], under Section 47 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/peter-sutcliffe-yorkshire-ripper-moved-from-broadmoor-psychiatric-hospital-to-prison-a7210211.html|title=Yorkshire Ripper moved back to prison after 32 years in Broadmoor|publisher=|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife obtained a separation from him in 1982 and a divorce in April 1994. On 23 February 1996, Sutcliffe was attacked in his room in Broadmoor Hospital's Henley Ward. Paul Wilson, a convicted robber, asked to borrow a videotape before attempting to strangle him with the cable from a pair of stereo headphones. Two other convicted murderers, [[Kenneth Erskine]] and Jamie Devitt, intervened on hearing screams.&lt;ref name="Brannen"/&gt;

After an attack with a pen by fellow inmate Ian Kay on 10 March 1997, Sutcliffe lost the vision in his left eye, and his right eye was severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/yorkshireripper1.shtml|title= Crime Case Closed: Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127141209/http://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/yorkshireripper1.shtml|archivedate=27 January 2007|work=BBC News|date=27 January 2007|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay admitted trying to kill Sutcliffe, and was ordered to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anon|title=Deranged killer admits Yorkshire Ripper blinding|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/51090.stm|accessdate=6 January 2018|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 it was reported that Sutcliffe had developed diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/archive/2003/08/30/Bradford+District+Archive/8010330.Ripper_Sutcliffe_has_diabetes/ "Ripper Sutcliffe has diabetes",] ''Craven Herald and Pioneer'', 30 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe's father died in 2004 and was cremated. On 17 January 2005 Sutcliffe was allowed to visit [[Grange-over-Sands]] where the ashes had been scattered. The decision to allow the temporary release was initiated by [[David Blunkett]] and ratified by [[Charles Clarke]] when he became Home Secretary. Sutcliffe was accompanied by four members of the hospital staff. Despite the passage of 25 years since the Ripper murders, Sutcliffe's visit was the focus of front-page tabloid headlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4190525.stm "Ripper visits father's ashes site",] ''BBC News Online''. 20 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2007, Sutcliffe was attacked by fellow inmate Patrick Sureda, who lunged at him with a metal cutlery knife while shouting "You fucking raping, murdering bastard, I'll blind your fucking other one". Sutcliffe flung himself backwards and the blade missed his right eye, stabbing him in the cheek.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/24/ukcrime1 "Yorkshire Ripper stabbed in face"], ''The Guardian'', 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2009, it was reported&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4684906/Yorkshire-Ripper-Peter-Sutcliffe-fit-to-be-freed-from-Broadmoor.html "Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe 'fit to be freed from Broadmoor'."] ''Daily Telegraph''. 17 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that Sutcliffe was "fit to leave Broadmoor". On 23 March 2010, the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], [[Jack Straw]], was questioned by [[Julie Kirkbride]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Bromsgrove]], in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, "that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/8583782.stm|title='No release' for Yorkshire Ripper, says Jack Straw|publisher=BBC News|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This was a campaign of murder which terrorised the population of a large part of Yorkshire for several years.

==Legacy==
On 26 August 2016 the police investigation was the subject of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''The Reunion''. [[Sue MacGregor]] discussed the investigation with John Domaille, who later became assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police; Andy Laptew, who was a junior detective who interviewed Sutcliffe; Elaine Benson, who worked in the incident room and interviewed suspects; David Zackrisson, who investigated the "Wearside Jack" tape and letters in Sunderland and [[Christa Ackroyd]], a local journalist in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pdd7r|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Investigation, The Reunion – BBC Radio 4|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall&lt;!--This correct; it is NOT Paintball!--&gt; to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964. This inquiry also looked at the killings of two sex workers in southern Sweden in 1980. As Sutcliffe was a lorry driver, it was theorised that he had been in Denmark and Sweden, making use of the ferry across the [[Oresund Strait]]. West Yorkshire Police later stated that they were "absolutely certain" that Sutcliffe had never been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Joan|title=The Yorkshire Ripper was not a 'prostitute killer' – now his forgotten victims need justice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/yorkshire-ripper-not-prostitute-killer-forgotten-victims-need/|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jolly|first1=Joanna|title=The Ripper and the Swedish murders|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_ripper_and_the_swedish_murders|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=BBC News|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Maillet was born in [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/robert.maillet.3?fref=ts&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year later, Maillet's family moved to [[Ste-Marie-de-Kent, New Brunswick|Ste-Marie-de-Kent]], [[New Brunswick]], a French-Acadian village where he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizardworld.com/robertmaillet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180705/http://www.wizardworld.com/robertmaillet.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Maillet made an initial appearance in the WWF on November 11, 1991 when he wrestled as The Cajun Giant, defeating [[Bob Bradley (wrestler)|Bob Bradley]] in a dark match at a television taping in Utica, NY.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent some time in Japan working for the W*ING promotion as '''Goliath El Gigante'''. He was signed to the [[WWE|WWF]] in 1997, alongside [[Don Callis|The Jackyl]], as a member of [[The Truth Commission]]. He was billed as '''The Interrogator'''. The group was sent to the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) before being called up to the main WWF roster, where Maillet's ring name evolved into '''Kurrgan The Interrogator''' (whose name was inspired by [[The Kurgan]], and was occasionally referred to as '''The Kurrgan''' on television). Under the tutelage of The Jackyl, a charismatic cult leader, Kurrgan was a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] known for applying the [[Professional wrestling holds|Iron Claw]] to his opponents and not breaking the hold until The Jackyl slapped him across the face.

After The Truth Commission disbanded, Maillet (now billed simply as '''Kurrgan''') continued as a singles wrestler managed by The Jackyl. He later went on to be part of [[The Oddities (professional wrestling)|The Oddities]], The Jackyl's new stable; however, once The Jackyl was removed as the advisor of The Oddities and replaced by the [[Insane Clown Posse]], The Oddities turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] and became fan favourites. Maillet later worked for [[Jacques Rougeau]]'s wrestling events as Kurgan. On July 8, 2005, he wrestled [[Jim Duggan]] during the half-time show of a [[Canadian Football League]] game in [[Montreal]]. Using the name '''Giant Kurgan''', he worked for Emile Dupre's [[Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling]] (AGPW) and the [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]-based Legend City Wrestling (LCW).

==Acting career==
Maillet appeared in the 2006 film ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] graphic novel of the [[300 (comics)|same name]]. He played the Über-Immortal, a savage [[berserker]] who was part of the enemy's [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|imperial guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/03/09/nb-maillet300.html | work=CBC News | title=N.B. wrestler makes Hollywood debut in 300 | date=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, during a fight scene for the 2009 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', he accidentally punched [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in the face, bloodying Downey and knocking him down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yvon Gauvin|title=New Brunswick actor knocks down star|work=[[Times &amp; Transcript]]|date=2009-01-05|url=http://timestranscript.canadaeast.com/news/article/529930|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downey later stated on an episode of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' that Maillet was "10 times more upset about it" than he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|title=Robert Downey Jr. on David Letterman|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzfsSAlRLco|series=''Late Show with David Letterman''|serieslink=CBS|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, he appeared in the film ''[[Monster Brawl]]'' as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]] in a wrestling tournament of eight classic monsters that fight to the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1716753|Monster Brawl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played  [[Polyphemus]] in the 2013 film ''[[Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters]]'', Blackwell in the 2013 film adaptation of ''[[The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones]]'', and the executioner in the 2014 film ''[[Hercules (2014 film)|Hercules]]''.

He also had a recurring role on the Syfy original series ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]'' billed as a "Heavy", a thug for the series antagonist. In 2018, Maillet had a small part in the superhero film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' as Sluggo, a mutant mercenary who is in prison alongside the titular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/robert-maillet-deadpool-actor-new-brunswick-1.4677557|title=Actor, former wrestler Robert Maillet lands role in Deadpool 2|last=Blanch|first=Vanessa|date=May 26, 2018|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a part in the 2018 Netflix film ''[[Game Over, Man!]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1266">'''Ruhe''' (? - 1865) was a [[Māori people|Māori]] chief of the [[Ngāpuhi]] [[iwi]] (tribe) in northern [[New Zealand]]. He lived at [[Kaikohe]].

At the first signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] on 6 February 1840, Ruhe gave a concerted physical display and speech against the treaty. He would go on to sign the Treaty of Waitangi later that day. Next to his name was the statement in [[Māori language|Māori]] "''Te Tohu o Ruhe te tamaiti o Kopiri''", meaning "The mark of Ruhe the son of Kōpiri". 

In 1841, Ruhe's son [[Maketu Wharetotara|Maketū Wharetotara]] was accused of the murder of five people on [[Motuarohia Island]]. After being found guilty, Maketū Wharetotara became the first person executed under British law in New Zealand.

It was said that Ruhe suffered severe grief after his son died. Ruhe committed suicide in 1865 by shooting himself.&lt;ref name="Ruhe_nzhistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruhe|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/signatory/1-24|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2799">'''Charles Allan 'Skeeter' Skelton''' (May 1, 1928 &amp;ndash; January 17, 1988) was an American lawman and firearms writer.  After serving in the [[US Marine Corps]] from 1945-46 he began a law enforcement career which included service with the [[US Border Patrol]],  a term as Sheriff of [[Deaf Smith County, Texas]], and investigator with both the [[US Customs Service]] and Special Agent in Charge with [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. After his first nationally published article hit newsstands in September 1959, Skelton began writing part-time for firearms periodicals. In 1974 he retired from the DEA and concentrated full-time on his writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taffin|first=John|title=Single Action Sixguns |authorlink= John Taffin|publisher= Krause Publications|year= 2005 |page=121|ISBN =978-0-87349-953-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Skelton wrote his first article for ''Shooting Times'' in 1966, in 1967 he became the handgun editor for the magazine until his death in 1988.  His periodical articles were collected in ''Good Friends, Good Guns, Good Whiskey: Selected Works of Skeeter Skelton'' and ''Hoglegs, Hipshots and Jalapeños : Selected Works of Skeeter Skelton''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skelton|first=Skeeter|title=Good Friends, Good Guns, Good Whiskey: Selected Works of Skeeter Skelton|publisher= = PJS Publications|year= 1988|ISBN= 978-0-9621148-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skelton|first=Skeeter|title=Hoglegs, Hipshots and Jalapeños : Selected Works of Skeeter Skelton|publisher= = PJS Publications|year= 1991|ISBN= 978-0-9621148-6-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a contemporary of [[Bill Jordan (Marine)|Bill Jordan]], [[Charles Askins]] and [[Elmer Keith]].

Skelton's work frequently poked fun at himself. His "Me and Joe" stories of his Depression-era youth, while including references to period firearms, were character-oriented rather than technical pieces. His 'Dobe Grant' and 'Jug Johnson' short stories were perhaps the only fiction routinely published by a popular shooting magazine.  His son [[Bart Skelton]] is a gun writer.

''Shooting Times'' magazine is currently reprinting past "Hip Shots" articles by Skelton.

==Legacy==
Skelton is credited by firearms writer [[John Taffin]] with the revival of the [[.44 Special]] round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taffin|first =John|title =Gun Digest Book of the .44 |authorlink= John Taffin |publisher =Gun Digest Books|year= 2006 |pages=65, 72|ISBN =978-0-89689-416-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2156">[[File:Trieste-Canal Grande-DSCF1420.JPG|right|thumb|Palazzo Gopcevich in Trieste]]
'''Spiridione Gopcevich''' ({{lang-sr|Spiridon Gopčević}}, [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic]]: Спиридон Гопчевић, Trieste, 1815-1861) was  an ethnic-[[Serb]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artearti.net/magazine/articolo/genti_di_san_spiridione_i_serbi_a_trieste_1751-1914&lt;/ref&gt; shipowner from [[Trieste]].

==Biography==
His father, Christopher Gopcevich, born in 1765, originated from the village of Podi near [[Herceg Novi]], in [[Boka Kotorska]] (modern [[Montenegro]]), which had been annexed by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1815 from the [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro]]. The mother was Sofia Kvekich (Herceg Novi 1792 - Trieste 1854).

Spiridione  was sent to [[Vienna]] to be educated. He spoke fluently thirteen languages and become a great shipowner in [[Trieste]], then [[Austrian Littoral]] (modern [[Italy]]) and in [[Odessa]], [[Imperial Russia]]. His ships traded on the Mediterranean and the Black Sea routes, and he was in contact with the British Prime Minister [[William Gladstone]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. A ruinous crash suffered after reckless speculation during the [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856), prompted him to suicide in 1861.&lt;ref name="comune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retecivica.trieste.it/triestecultura/new/serbiatrieste/default.asp?pagina=gopcevich|title=Gopcevich|publisher=Commune of Trieste|language=Italian|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Spiridon Gopčević]] (1855 Trieste-Vienna 1936) was a political journalist and world-renowned astronomer.

Another illustrious descendant of the family was [[Marino Gopcevich]] (1899-1965), a neurologist, who in 1945 founded the Neurological division of the  Hospital in Trieste.

Gopcevich built the [[Palazzo Gopcevich]] in Trieste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4543">'''Stephen Tanzer''' is an [[United States|American]] [[wine]] critic and editor at [http://vinous.com/ Vinous].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=244089450|title=Vinous Media LLC: CEO and Executives - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1985 until he joined Vinous in 2014, Tanzer was the publisher of the critically acclaimed bimonthly ''International Wine Cellar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= ''Forbes.com''| title=  Stephen Tanzer's International Wine Cellar |url= https://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=7246}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an independent journal read by wine professionals and other wine lovers in all 50 U.S. states and 34 countries, and the first American wine periodical to be translated into French and Japanese. Tanzer has particular expertise on the wines of [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], as well as other prominent wine regions, including [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], [[California wine|California]], Washington State, and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/critics-11-stephen+tanzer|title=Stephen Tanzer, IWC Archive|website=www.wine-searcher.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanzer has written wine columns for ''[[Food &amp; Wine Magazine]]'' and ''[[Forbes|Forbes FYI]]''. Among his books are ''[https://www.amazon.com/WineAccess-Buyers-Guide-Worlds-Wines/dp/1402728166 The WineAccess Buyer's Guide]'' and [https://www.amazon.ca/Food-Wine-Magazines-Official-Guide/dp/0312179707 ''Food and Wine Magazine's Official Wine Guide''.]

Tanzer's '' International Wine Cellar'', which employed a modern [[wine rating]] system on a 70-100 point quality scale, was considered in direct competition with [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]]'s ''[[The Wine Advocate]]'',&lt;ref name="jr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/critics-11-stephen+tanzer|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Tanzer's "controlled prose" is in contrast to the more flamboyant style of Parker.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last =Asimov |first =Eric ''The New York Times'' |title = Settling in, Glass in Hand, to Read of Wine |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/06pour.html |date =December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzer still uses this scale in his ratings and reviews with Vinous.

In February 2010, Tanzer launched the website "Winophilia" in the wine [[blog]] format, which published short articles by Tanzer, ''IWC'' collaborator Josh Raynolds, and other ''IWC'' contributors.

Tanzer's wine reviews are available to [[CellarTracker]] users who are also subscribers to [http://vinous.com/ Vinous].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vinous.com/statics/iwcfaq|title=IWC FAQ {{!}} Vinous - Explore All Things Wine|website=vinous.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 18, 2014 Vinous, founded by [[Antonio Galloni]], announced it had agreed to acquire Stephen Tanzer's IWC and in late 2014 IWC's archive had been transferred in a combined site home, available to both Vinous and IWC readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciaadamczyk/2014/11/18/wine-publishing-platform-vinous-acquires-critically-acclaimed-international-wine-cellar/#71ec053d2aab|title=Wine Publishing Platform Vinous Acquires Critically Acclaimed International Wine Cellar|last=Adamczyk|first=Alicia|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; IWC team members Ian D'Agata and Josh Raynolds are also part of the [http://vinous.com/statics/about Vinous team].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vinous.com/statics/about|title=About {{!}} Vinous - Explore All Things Wine|website=vinous.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanzer samples well over 10,000 wines annually, spending several months each year tasting and discussing wines with their makers, both in the U.S. and abroad.

'''''The Generations Project''''' is a [[Reality television|reality]] television series produced by and shown on [[BYU Television]] that helps those who have questions about their [[family history]] investigate their own identities by embarking on a journey to uncover the lives and stories of their ancestors. During this journey each participant attempts to retrace their ancestors footsteps often participating in immersion experiences, meeting experts, and even sometimes connecting with family they never knew they had. As each participant on the show sets out on their journey they discover new details about the lives of their ancestors, answer questions about identity, about time and place, and even discover things about themselves. Overall this journey helps participants learn where they have been and make their own conclusions about where they are going. It premiered on January 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byutv.org/thegenerationsproject/ |title=The Generations Project |publisher=BYUtv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/GenerationsProject?v=info&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|January 2012}} the show is in its third season, with a total 33 shows produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byutv.org/thegenerationsproject |title=The Generations Project |publisher=BYUtv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Three Musketeers'''" was the nickname given to three liberal members during the 1932–37 terms of the [[United States Supreme Court]], who generally supported the [[New Deal]] agenda of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. They were [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], and [[Harlan Fiske Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;White, at 81.&lt;/ref&gt; They were opposed by the [[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|Four Horsemen]], consisting of Justices [[James Clark McReynolds]], [[George Sutherland]], [[Willis Van Devanter]], and [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]]. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Justice [[Owen J. Roberts]] controlled the balance.

During the 1935 term, the Four Horsemen would often ride together to and from Court in order to coordinate their positions. To counter them, the Three Musketeers started meeting at Brandeis's apartment on Friday afternoons. However, the Four Horsemen held sway, leading to Roosevelt's [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing scheme]]. In 1937, in the "[[The switch in time that saved nine|switch in time that saved nine]]," Roberts and Hughes switched to the liberal side in several key decisions; within a year, Van Devanter and Sutherland retired to be replaced by [[Hugo Black]] and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], strong New Dealers. This ended the Four Horsemen's sway. By 1941, Brandeis, Cardozo, Butler, McReynolds, and Hughes were also gone. Only Stone and Roberts remained, and by then Stone had been elevated to the position of Chief Justice.

'''Thomas King Forçade''' (September 11, 1945 – November 17, 1978), also known as '''Gary Goodson''',&lt;ref name="gross1991"&gt;Gross, Michael (February 18, 1991). Ivana's avenger. ''[[New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[underground journalist]] and [[cannabis rights]] [[activist]] in the 1970s. For many years he ran the [[Underground Press Syndicate]] (later called the Alternative Press Syndicate), and was the founder in summer 1974 of ''[[High Times]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Bienenstock, David; and editors of ''[[High Times]]'' magazine (2008). [http://www.hightimes.com/microsites/handbook/chap1p3.inc.php Chapter 1 HIGHstory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062624/http://www.hightimes.com/microsites/handbook/chap1p3.inc.php |date=2014-04-07 }}. ''The Official High Times Pot Smokers Handbook: Featuring 420 Things to do When You're Stoned.'' [[Chronicle Books]]. {{ISBN|0811862054}}. {{ISBN|9780811862059}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''High Times'' ran articles calling [[marijuana]] a "medical wonder drug" and ridiculing the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. ''High Times'' became a huge success with a circulation of more than 500,000 copies a month and revenues approaching $10 million by 1977 and embraced by the young adult market as the bible of the alternative life culture.  By 1977 ''High Times'' was selling as many copies an issue as'' Rolling Stone ''and ''National Lampoon.  ''Forcade published several other publications such as'' Stoned, National Weed, Dealer'' and others that always were laced with some of the best humor, pop culture and a forum for some of the best writers, artists and political savvy mostly veiled as the counter culture entertainment magazine.  Many of the writers went on to be published in premiere papers and magazines in North America.

==Life and career==

He was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. His father, engineer and [[hot rod]] enthusiast Kenneth Goodson, died in a car crash when Forçade was a child.

Forçade graduated from the [[University of Utah]] in 1967 with a degree in business administration. He went into the [[United States Air Force]] but was discharged after a few months. He used the skills he learned, however, to fly across the border for several years trafficking drugs from Mexico and Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacklistedjournalist.com/column68b.html|title=Tom Forcade, Social Architect|author=[[Al Aronowitz]]|website=The Blacklisted Journalist|access-date=2002-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used his proceeds to form a hippie commune and underground magazine called Orpheus.  After this, he moved to [[New York City]], where he became famous for founding ''[[High Times]]'' as well as contributing funding to the [[Yippie]] newspaper, ''Yipster Times'',&lt;ref name=Yippie&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68, to 1984 | author=New Yippie Book Collective | isbn=9780912873008 |publisher=Bleecker Publishing|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-SG3oWUjhMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=yippie+concerts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G51pTNsBrI&amp;sig=Nw23nlCkXEYVzpaoavv6qR1lqng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9xeXXvOTWAhWC5iYKHWPjD_YQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=yippie%20concerts&amp;f=false|title=Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana - Medical, Recreational and Scientific|author=Martin A.

In 1970, Forcade was the first documented activist to use [[pieing]] as a form of protest, hitting Chairman [[Otto Larsen (sociology)|Otto Larsen]] during the [[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/weekinreview/take-sugar-eggs-beliefs-and-aim.html|website=New York Times|title=Take Sugar, Eggs, Beliefs . . .

It’s Also Art.|author=[[Anthony Haden-Guest]]|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1990 nonfiction book ''12 Days on the Road: The Sex Pistols and America'', by Noel E. Monk and Jimmy Guterman, Forcade and his film crew followed the [[Sex Pistols]] through their chaotic January 1978 concerts of the U.S. South and West, using high-pressure tactics in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the band's management and record company to let him document the tour.

Forcade was a co-founder of the [[Underground Press Syndicate]], which he ran for many years. The name was changed to the Alternative Press Syndicate in 1973.

==Death==
Forçade committed suicide by gunshot to the head in November 1978 in his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment after the death of his best friend, Jack Coombs.&lt;ref name="Torgoff2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Torgoff |authorlink=Martin Torgoff |title=Can't Find My Way Home: America in the Great Stoned Age, 1945–2000 |year=2004 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7432-5863-0 |page=269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpqQTLE_qBEC&amp;pg=PA269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forcade had attempted suicide before and bequeathed [[trusts]] to benefit ''High Times'' and [[NORML]].

=== Music videos ===
Sivan's music videos frequently feature LGBTQ relationships between the characters. ''TRXYE''{{'}}s trilogy followed the narrative of two gay teenagers in a secret relationship while "Wild" featured Sivan with another male love interest. His music video for "Heaven ft. Betty Who" features footage of historical LGBTQ movements and couples, as well as sensual shots with him and an anonymous man with the running tagline "Without losing a piece of me, how do I get to Heaven?" and "If I'm losing a piece of me, maybe I don't want Heaven". The singer says these portrayals are important to him, especially when he considers his younger life when he remembers "such vivid memories of the few times I saw any type of LGBTQ relationship on TV or in music videos".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kitchenerpost.ca/whatson-story/6955732-q-a-troye-sivan-on-coming-out-canadian-popstars/ |title=Q&amp;A: Troye Sivan on coming out, Canadian popstars |last=Friend |first=David |date=9 November 2016 |work=Kitchener Post |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the second son of [[Richard White, 1st Earl of Bantry]] and Lady Margaret Anne Hare. In 1840 he took the additional surname of Hedges after inheriting the estates of his great-uncle, Robert Hedges Eyre.&lt;ref&gt;John Bernard Burke, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZfdRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=earl+of+bantry+peerage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ArPKTbR2Do&amp;sig=dCe6USRMeuE7wzcSaqK1LU7E5LY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje0M_I04vNAhVmKsAKHSd9Cbw4ChDoAQgkMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=earl%20of%20bantry%20peerage&amp;f=false ''A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire''] (H. Colburn, 1845), p.64 (Retrieved 3 June 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[High Sheriff of County Cork]] in 1848. He succeeded his elder brother as [[Earl of Bantry]] following his death in 1868. On 6 July 1869 Lord Bantry was elected as an Irish [[representative peer]] and took his seat in the [[House of Lords]].

On 16 Apr 1845 he married Jane Herbert, and together they had six children.

He died in 1884 and was succeeded by his only son, William Hedges-White.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25490|date=14 July 1885|page=3262}}&lt;/ref&gt;
