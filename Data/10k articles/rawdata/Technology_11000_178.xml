Having been acquired by Comverse, Inc. on 6 August 2015,&lt;ref name="globenewswire.com"&gt;http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/08/06/758646/10145059/en/Comverse-Completes-Acquisition-of-Acision-Creating-a-Leader-in-Digital-Communication-Services.html&lt;/ref&gt; '''Acision''' was known as Xura,&lt;ref name="prnewswire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xura.com"&gt;http://www.xura.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a new company launched on 9 September 2015 combining both companies.&lt;ref name="prnewswire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xura.com"/&gt; In 2017, Xura became [[Mavenir]] after Xura acquired a start up called Ranzure and [[Mavenir Systems]]. Prior to this, it was a privately held [[mobile communications]] software company specialising in messaging systems that enable popular services such as text messaging or [[Short Message Service]] (SMS), [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS), [[voicemail]], IP Messaging, Mobile Value Added Services and Enterprise Mobility [[Solution]]s.

==History==
Before Xura, Inc. Acision's roots came from two companies:
# The Wireless Data Services (WDS) division of Anglo-Dutch consultancy and telecommunications company CMG.
# The Irish mobile telecommunications pioneers [[Aldiscon]].

In 1997, [[Aldiscon]] was acquired by UK-based [[Logica]], which merged with [[CMG (company)|CMG]] in 2002 to form [[LogicaCMG]]. Both company's wireless divisions merged into [[LogicaCMG]] Wireless Networks. Acision was born on February 20, 2007, when [[LogicaCMG]] Wireless Networks was sold for £265m (US $525m) to private investors [[Atlantic Bridge Ventures]] and [[Access Industries]] and became known as Acision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilecowboys.com/news/55 ] LogicaCMG sells Telecom Products&lt;/ref&gt; The lead investor at [[Atlantic Bridge Ventures|Atlantic Bridge]] (and now executive chairman at Acision), Laurence Quinn, was one of the founders of [[Aldiscon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobileeurope.co.uk/news_analysis/112676/Mighty_Quinn_back_on_top_at_Logica.html] Mighty Quinn back on top at Logica, Mobile Europe, Feb. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Acision was acquired by [[Comverse]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/06/15/744526/10138408/en/Comverse-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Acision-Combined-Company-to-Extend-Global-Leadership-in-Next-Generation-Digital-Service-Solutions.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="globenewswire.com"/&gt;{{sps|date=December 2016}}

In September 2015, Xura, Inc. was launched.&lt;ref name="globenewswire.com"/&gt;  The new joint entity changed its name to Xura, Inc.&lt;ref name="prnewswire.com"&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-xura-comverse-and-acision-launch-new-global-company-fresh-brand-reflects-digital-communications-leadership-525842251.html&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Xura' was supposedly adapted from the word 'Aura'.&lt;ref name="prnewswire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/09/09/comverse-no-not-the-shoe-guys-changes-name-to-xura/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aluminium foil''' (or '''aluminum foil'''), often referred to with the [[misnomer]] [[tin foil]], is [[aluminium]] prepared in thin [[metal leaf|metal leaves]] with a thickness less than {{convert|0.2|mm|mil|abbr=on}}; thinner gauges down to {{convert|6|micrometre|mil}} are also commonly used.&lt;ref name="EAFA facts1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alufoil.org/facts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325000221/http://www.alufoil.org/facts.html |archivedate=2016-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, foils are commonly gauged in thousandths of an inch or [[Thousandth of an inch|mils]]. Standard household foil is typically {{convert|0.016|mm|mil|abbr=on}} thick, and heavy duty household foil is typically {{convert|0.024|mm|mil|abbr=on}}. The [[Foil (metal)|foil]] is pliable, and can be readily bent or wrapped around objects. Thin foils are fragile and are sometimes [[laminate]]d to other materials such as [[plastic]]s or [[paper]] to make them more useful. Aluminium foil supplanted [[tin foil]] in the mid 20th century.

Annual production of aluminium foil was approximately {{convert|800,000|tonne}} in Europe&lt;ref name="EAFA facts1"/&gt; and {{convert|600,000|tonne}} in the U.S. in 2003.&lt;ref name=aausa&gt;[http://www.aluminum.org/Content/ContentGroups/Tech_Q_and_A/New_Aluminum_Foil_Manual_Covers_It_All.htm Aluminum Association (USA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227184227/http://www.aluminum.org/Content/ContentGroups/Tech_Q_and_A/New_Aluminum_Foil_Manual_Covers_It_All.htm |date=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 75% of aluminium foil is used for [[packaging]] of [[food]]s, [[cosmetics]], and chemical products, and 25% used for industrial applications (e.g. thermal insulation, cables and electronics).&lt;ref name=aausa/&gt; It can be [[Aluminium recycling|recycled]].
 
In [[North America]], aluminium foil is known as aluminum foil. It was popularised by [[Reynolds Metals]], the leading manufacturer in North America. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] it is, informally, widely called tin foil, for historical reasons (similar to how [[aluminium can]]s are often still called ("[[tin can]]s"). [[Metallised film]]s are sometimes mistaken for aluminium foil, but are actually polymer films [[thin-film deposition|coated]] with a thin layer of aluminium. In [[Australia]], aluminium foil is widely called alfoil.

== History ==

===Before aluminium foil===
Foil made from a thin leaf of [[tin]] was commercially available before its aluminium counterpart. [[Tin foil]] was marketed commercially from the late nineteenth into the early twentieth century.  The term "tin foil" survives in the English language as a term for the newer aluminium foil. Tin foil is less [[ductility|malleable]] than aluminium foil and tends to give a slight tin taste to food wrapped in it.  Tin foil has been supplanted by aluminium and other materials for wrapping food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berger |first=Kenneth R. |title=A Brief History of Packaging |url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00001524/00001 |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=24 September 2014 |date=December 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909204256/http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00001524/00001 |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first audio recordings on [[phonograph cylinders]] were made on tin foil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tinfoil Recordings |url=http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/history-tinfoil.php |work=Cylinder Recordings: A Primer |publisher=University of California at Santa Barbara |accessdate=17 October 2011 |author=Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project, UCSB |format=web page |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016155323/http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/history-tinfoil.php |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first aluminium foil===
Tin was first replaced by aluminium in 1910, when the first aluminium foil rolling plant, "Dr. Lauber, Neher &amp; Cie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blaluminum.htm |title=Charles Martin Hall - The History of Aluminum |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was opened in [[Kreuzlingen|Emmishofen]], [[Switzerland]]. The plant, owned by J.G. Neher &amp; Sons, the aluminium manufacturers, started in 1886 in [[Schaffhausen]], Switzerland, at the foot of the [[Rhine Falls]], capturing the falls' energy to process aluminium. Neher's sons, together with Dr. Lauber, discovered the endless rolling process and the use of aluminium foil as a protective barrier in December 1907.

In 1911, Bern-based Tobler began wrapping its chocolate bars in aluminium foil, including the unique [[Triangular prism|triangular]] chocolate bar, [[Toblerone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.alufoil.org/history.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512075406/http://www.alufoil.org/history.html|archivedate=2015-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, aluminium foil was being used by [[Maggi]] (today a Nestlé brand) to pack soups and stock cubes.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} 

The first use of foil in the United States was in 1913 for wrapping [[Life Savers]], candy bars, and gum.&lt;ref name="Hanlon"&gt;Hanlon, J. (1992). 1st ed. Handbook of Package Engineering, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Technomic Publishing: {{ISBN|0-87762-924-2}}. Chapter 3 Films and Foils.&lt;/ref&gt; Processes evolved over time to include the use of print, colour, lacquer, laminate and the [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]] of the aluminium.

== Manufacture ==
[[File:Aluminium foil micrometer.jpg|thumb|250px|A roll of aluminium foil, with [[micrometer]] showing a thickness of {{convert|13|µm|mil|lk=out|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}]]
{{see also|Rolling (metalworking)}}

Aluminium foil is produced by rolling sheet [[ingots]] cast from molten [[Aluminium#Production and refinement|billet aluminium]], then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, [[beta radiation]] is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has become too thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner.

The continuous casting method is much less energy intensive and has become the preferred process.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;Robertson, G. (2006). 2nd ed. Food Packaging, Principles and Practise, Boca Raton, FL, Taylor &amp; Francis Group: {{ISBN|0-8493-3775-5}}. Chapter 7 Metal Packaging Materials.&lt;/ref&gt; For thicknesses below {{convert|0.025|mm|mil|lk=out|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, two layers are usually put together for the final pass and afterwards separated which produces foil with one bright side and one matte side.&lt;ref name=degarmo/&gt; The two sides in contact with each other are matte and the exterior sides become bright; this is done to reduce tearing, increase production rates, control thickness, and get around the need for a smaller diameter roller.&lt;ref name=degarmo&gt;{{Cite book | last = Degarmo | first = E. Paul | last2 = Black | first2 = J T. | last3 = Kohser | first3 = Ronald A. | title = Materials and Processes in Manufacturing | publisher = Wiley | page = 386 | year = 2003 | edition = 9th | isbn = 0-471-65653-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[lubrication]] is needed during the rolling stages; otherwise, the foil surface can become marked with a [[herringbone pattern]]. These lubricants are sprayed on the foil surface before passing through the mill rolls. [[Kerosene]] based lubricants are commonly used, although oils approved for food contact must be used for foil intended for food packaging.

Aluminium becomes work hardened during the cold rolling process and is [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] for most purposes. The rolls of foil are heated until the degree of softness is reached, which may be up to {{convert|340|C}} for 12 hours. During this heating, the lubricating oils are burned off, leaving a dry surface. Lubricant oils may not be completely burnt off for hard temper rolls, which can make subsequent coating or printing more difficult.

The rolls of aluminium foil are then slit on [[slitter|slitter rewinding]] machines into smaller rolls. Roll slitting and rewinding is an essential part of the finishing process.

== Properties ==
[[File:Rubber with sodium silicate beads 6 alu backside.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[photomicrograph|Microscopic close-up]] of aluminium foil on the back of an [[intumescent]] rubber strip.]]

Aluminium foils thicker than {{convert|25|µm|mil|lk=out|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} are impermeable to oxygen and water. Foils thinner than this become slightly permeable due to minute pinholes caused by the production process.

Aluminium foil has a shiny side and a matte side. The shiny side is produced when the aluminium is rolled during the final pass. It is difficult to produce rollers with a gap fine enough to cope with the foil gauge, therefore, for the final pass, two sheets are rolled at the same time, doubling the thickness of the gauge at entry to the rollers. When the sheets are later separated, the inside surface is dull, and the outside surface is shiny. This difference in the finish has led to the perception that favouring a side has an effect when cooking. While many believe (wrongly) that the different properties keep heat out when wrapped with the shiny finish facing out, and keep heat in with the shiny finish facing inwards, the actual difference is imperceptible without instrumentation. Increased reflectivity decreases both absorption and [[Black-body_radiation|emission]] of radiation. Foil may have a non-stick coating on only one side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/media/10246730/reynolds_wrap_faq.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2014-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021084635/http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/media/10246730/reynolds_wrap_faq.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reflectivity]] of bright aluminium foil is 88% while dull embossed foil is about 80%.&lt;ref name="Hanlon"/&gt;

==Uses==

=== Packaging ===
[[File:Reese's peanut butter cups.jpg|thumb|250px|Chocolates in aluminium foil packaging]]

Aluminium is used for packaging as it is highly malleable: it can be easily converted to thin sheets and folded, rolled or packed. Aluminium foil acts as a total barrier to light and oxygen (which cause fats to oxidise or become rancid), odours and flavours, moistness, and germs, and so it is used broadly in food and pharmaceutical packaging, including long-life packs ([[aseptic processing|aseptic packaging]]) for drinks and dairy goods, which allows storing without refrigeration. Aluminium foil containers and trays are used to bake pies and to pack [[Take-out|takeaway]] meals, ready snacks and long life [[pet]] foods.

Aluminium foil is widely sold into the [[consumer]] market, often in rolls of {{convert|500|mm|abbr=on}} width and several metres in length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reynoldspkg.com/reynoldskitchens/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=1337 Examples of products]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218165509/http://www.reynoldspkg.com/reynoldskitchens/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=1337 |date=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for wrapping food in order to preserve it, for example, when storing leftover food in a [[refrigerator]] (where it serves the additional purpose of preventing odour exchange), when taking [[sandwich]]es on a journey, when baking, or when selling some kinds of [[take-away]] or [[fast food]]. [[Tex-Mex]] restaurants in the [[United States]], for example, typically provide take-away [[burrito]]s wrapped in aluminium foil.

=== Insulation ===
Aluminium foil is widely used for radiation shield (barrier and reflectivity), heat exchangers ([[heat conduction]]) and cable liners (barrier and [[electrical conductivity]]). Aluminium foil's heat conductive qualities make it a common accessory in [[hookah]] smoking: a sheet of perforated aluminium foil is frequently placed between the coal and the tobacco, allowing the tobacco to be heated without coming into direct contact with the burning coal.

=== Electromagnetic shielding ===
The [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding effectiveness]] of aluminium foil depends upon the type of incident field (electric, magnetic, or plane wave), the thickness of the foil, and the frequency (which determines the [[skin depth]]). Shielding effectiveness is usually broken down into a reflection loss (the energy bounces off the shield rather than penetrates it) and an absorption loss (the energy is dissipated within the shield).

Although aluminium is non-magnetic, it is a good conductor, so even a thin sheet reflects almost all of an incident electric wave. At frequencies more than 100&amp;nbsp;MHz, the ''transmitted'' electric field is attenuated by more than 80 [[decibel]]s (dB) (less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00000001 of the power gets through) &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ott |first=Henry |title=Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems |year=1976 |publisher=Wiley Interscience |isbn=0-471-65726-3 |doi= }}. {{Harvtxt|Ott|1976|loc=figure 6-13}} graphs reflection loss for copper, and shows electric field and plane wave losses at greater than 90&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;/ref&gt; -- however actual energy absorption is minimal:  the remaining high-frequency rf energy is almost perfectly reflected from uniform flat aluminium surface, and thus, reflected signal may continue to propagate internally, and if holes or passages of suitable geometry exist in the shield, signal propagation may continue out through those, the aluminium being good material for implementation of a microwave-frequency [[waveguide]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Thin sheets of aluminium are not very effective at attenuating low-frequency magnetic fields.  The shielding effectiveness is dependent upon the skin depth. A field travelling through one skin depth will lose about 63 per cent of its energy (it is attenuated to 1/e = 1/2.718... of its original energy).  Thin shields also have internal reflections that reduce the shielding effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ott|1976|pp=155&amp;ndash;156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For effective shielding from a magnetic field, the shield should be several skin depths thick.  Aluminium foil is about {{convert|1|mil|um}}; a thickness of {{convert|10|mil|um}} (ten times thicker) offers less than 1&amp;nbsp;dB of shielding at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, about 8&amp;nbsp;dB at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, and about 25&amp;nbsp;dB at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.  At these frequencies a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic material]] such as [[mild steel]] is much more effective, due to different and complementary [[Permeability_(electromagnetism)|electromagnetic permeability]] properties, and common practical shielding implementations utilise both an inner high-frequency reflective material such as aluminium, preferably bonded (via [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] or [[electroplating]], done to avoid capacitance between separated layers), to a more substantial structural ferromagnetic shell, usually mild steel (in specialized applications, more expensive, less structurally useful and less workable materials may be preferred.)  Despite the relative low mass density of aluminium, this design is usually both lighter and more effective than an equivalently absorptive design utilizing aluminium alone (although with poorer heat dissipative properties, typically accommodated by improved ventilation, which itself needs careful consideration in order to preserve the desired shielding effectiveness).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Aluminium foil is also used for [[barbecue|barbecuing]] delicate foods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXm8ccnB0P8C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=Aluminium+foil+is+used+for+barbecuing+delicate+foods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjkLH6r9nUAhUI6mMKHdTmBmEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20foil%20is%20used%20for%20barbecuing%20delicate%20foods&amp;f=false|title=Kitchen on Fire!: Mastering the Art of Cooking in 12 Weeks (or Less)|last=Said|first=Olivier|last2=MikeC|first2=Chef|date=2011-11-22|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780738214535|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022234134/https://books.google.com/books?id=zXm8ccnB0P8C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=Aluminium+foil+is+used+for+barbecuing+delicate+foods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjkLH6r9nUAhUI6mMKHdTmBmEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20foil%20is%20used%20for%20barbecuing%20delicate%20foods&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as mushrooms and vegetables. Using this method, sometimes called a '''hobo pack''', food is wrapped in foil, then placed on the grill, preventing loss of moisture that may result in a less appealing texture.

As is the case with all metallic items, aluminium foil reacts to being placed in a [[microwave oven]]. This is because of the [[electromagnetic field]]s of the microwaves inducing electric currents in the foil and high [[voltage|potentials]] at the sharp points of the foil sheet; if the potential is sufficiently high, it will cause [[electric arc]]ing to areas with lower potential, even to the air surrounding the sheet.  Modern microwave ovens have been designed to prevent damage to the [[cavity magnetron]] tube from microwave energy reflection, and aluminium packages designed for microwave heating are available.&lt;ref&gt;Huss, G. (1997) Microwaveable Packaging and Dual-Ovenable Materials in The Wiley Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology, 2nd ed., edited by Brody, A. and Marsch, K. New York, John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and decoration ===
Heavier foils made of aluminium are used for art, decoration, and crafts, especially in bright metallic colours. Metallic aluminium, normally silvery in colour, can be made to take on other colours through [[anodization|anodisation]]. Anodising creates an oxide layer on the aluminium surface that can accept coloured dyes or metallic salts, depending on the process used. In this way, aluminium is used to create an inexpensive gold foil that actually contains no gold, and many other bright metallic colours. These foils are sometimes used in distinctive packaging.

=== Geochemical sampling ===
Foil is used by organic/petroleum geochemists for protecting rock samples taken from the fields and in the labs where the sample is subject to [[biomarker]] analysis. While plastic or cloth bags are normally used for a geological sampling exercise, cloth bags are permeable and may allow organic solvents or oils (such as oils imparted from the skin) to taint the sample, and traces of the plastics from plastic bags may also taint the sample. Foil provides a seal to the ingress of organic solvents and does not taint the sample. Foil is also used extensively in geochemical laboratories to provide a barrier for the geochemist, and for sample storage.

=== Ribbon microphones ===
The material used in many [[ribbon microphone]]s is aluminium leaf, or "[[Metal leaf|imitation silver leaf]]", as it is sometimes called. This is pure aluminium and is around 0.6 to 2.0 micrometres thick. It is virtually the same material that the BBC used on [[Coles 4038|Coles ribbon]]s, with the exception that they also hand beat the leaf even thinner. They did this by sandwiching the ribbon between toilet paper and beating with a [[ball-peen hammer]]. This "cold forges" the leaf. The aluminium leaf was then annealed for an hour in an oven to restore flexibility. Corrugations must also be imparted into the ribbon: Coles used 25 per inch (1&amp;nbsp;mm cycle). RCA 44BX has 19 corrugations per inch (0.7&amp;nbsp;mm cycle) and is around {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} long; RCA 77 has 13 corrugations per inch (0.5&amp;nbsp;mm cycle). RCA ribbon material is around 1 to 1.5 micrometres (0.00005&amp;nbsp;inch) thick. The new Nady ribbon plus AEA both state that they use 2 micrometre aluminium ribbon in their microphones.{{Vague|date=March 2013}}

== Environmental issues ==
{{See also|Aluminium recycling}}

Some aluminium foil products can be [[recycling|recycled]] at around 5% of the original [[energy]] cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]]|url=http://asiapacificpartnership.org/english/tf_aluminium.aspx|title=Action Plan, page 5, table 2: 4.2 vs. 0.19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406032451/http://www.asiapacificpartnership.org/english/tf_aluminium.aspx|archivedate=2009-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many aluminium laminates are not recycled due to difficulties in separating the components and low yield of aluminium metal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10306">The '''Automatic Picture Transmission''' (APT) system is an analog image transmission system developed for use on [[weather satellites]]. It was introduced in the 1960s and over four decades has provided image data to relatively low-cost user stations at locations in most countries of the world. A user station anywhere in the world can receive local data at least twice a day from each satellite as it passes nearly overhead.

== Transmission ==
[[Image:NOAA APT Frame Format.gif|right|thumb|300px|The APT transmission format]]
&lt;!-- Note, this image is set to 300px to ensure its details are visible, as allowed by WP:STYLE --&gt;

=== Structure ===
The broadcast transmission is composed of two image channels, [[telemetry]] information, and synchronization data, with the image channels typically referred to as Video A and Video B. All this data is transmitted as a horizontal scan line. A complete line is 2080 [[pixels]] long, with each image using 909 pixels and the remainder going to the telemetry and synchronization. Lines are transmitted at 2 per second, which equates to a 4160 words per second, or 4160 [[baud]].

=== Images ===
On NOAA [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]] system satellites, the two images are 4&amp;nbsp;km / pixel smoothed 8-bit images derived from two channels of the [[advanced very-high-resolution radiometer]] (AVHRR) sensor. The images are corrected for nearly constant geometric resolution prior to being broadcast; as such, the images are free of distortion caused by the curvature of the Earth.

Of the two images, one is typically long-wave [[infrared]] (10.8 [[micrometers]]) with the second switching between near-visible (0.86 micrometers) and mid-wave infrared (3.75 micrometers) depending on whether the ground is illuminated by sunlight. However, NOAA can configure the satellite to transmit any two of the AVHRR's image channels.

=== Synchronization and telemetry ===
Included in the transmission are a series of [[Synchronization in telecommunications|synchronization]] pulses, minute markers, and telemetry information.

The synchronization information, transmitted at the start of each video channel, allows the receiving software to align its sampling with the baud rate of the signal, which can vary slightly over time. The minute markers are four lines of alternating black then white lines which repeat every 60 seconds (120 lines).

The telemetry section is composed of sixteen blocks, each 8 lines long, which are used as reference values to decode the image channels. The first eight blocks, called "wedges," begin at 1/8 max intensity and successively increase by 1/8 to full intensity in the eighth wedge, with the ninth being zero intensity. Blocks ten through fifteen each encode a calibration value for the sensor. The sixteenth block identifies which sensor channel was used for the preceding image channel by matching the intensity of one of the wedges one through six. Video channel A typically matches either wedge two or three, channel B matches wedge four.

The first fourteen blocks should be identical for both channels. The sixteen telemetry blocks repeat every 128 lines, and these 128 lines are referred to as a frame.

=== Broadcast signal ===
The signal itself is a 256-level [[amplitude modulated]] 2400[[Hertz|Hz]] [[subcarrier]], which is then [[frequency modulated]] onto the 137&amp;nbsp;MHz-band [[Carrier wave|RF carrier]]. Maximum subcarrier modulation is 87% (±5%), and overall [[RF]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is 34&amp;nbsp;kHz. On NOAA POES vehicles, the signal is broadcast at approximately 37[[dBm]] (5 watts)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/c4/sec4-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[effective radiated power]].

== Receiving images ==
&lt;!-- Get picture of a QRH antenna or similar --&gt;
An APT signal is continuously broadcast, with reception beginning at the start of the next line when the receiver is within radio range. Images can be received in real-time by relatively unsophisticated, inexpensive receivers during the time the satellite is within radio range, which typically lasts 8 to 15 minutes.

{{As of|2004}} there were almost 5,000 APT receiving stations registered with the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). It is unclear what percent of the total user-base this represents, since registration is not a requirement, and was only available after 1996.

=== Radio receiver ===
The bandwidth required to receive APT transmissions is approximately 34&amp;nbsp;kHz. Most older scanners (police and fire type receivers) are the standard 15&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth which were designed to support voice transmissions. Newer VHF general coverage receivers are equipped with multiple IF bandpasses; some are, but not limited to: 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, 15&amp;nbsp;kHz 50&amp;nbsp;kHz &amp; 230&amp;nbsp;kHz(broadcast FM). Use of a receiver with too narrow a bandwidth will produce pictures that are saturated in the blacks and whites, as well as possible inversion. Too wide, and the noise floor of the receiver will be too high to acquire a good picture. For the amateur enthusiast, a computer controller receiver is the best option to allow the software to automatically tune and set the required modes for proper reception. There are also dedicated APT receivers made specifically for computer control and APT reception. Specifically, [[Icom Incorporated|ICOM]] PCR1000, PCR1500 &amp; PCR2500 will produce excellent results. Searching on the web for "NOAA APT (RECEPTION or RECEIVER)" will produce a wealth of information on receivers, software, and antennas.

=== Antenna ===
APT images from weather satellites can be received with a right-hand [[circular polarization|circular polarized]], 137&amp;nbsp;MHz antenna. Normally, there is no need to have the antenna follow the satellite and a fixed position antenna will provide good results.

The two most frequently recommended antennas are the [[turnstile antenna|crossed dipole]] and the [[helical antenna|quadrifilar helix antenna]] (QHA).

=== Displaying the images ===
Years ago,{{when|date=January 2015}} to receive APT images, a specialized decoder was required in addition to the receiver to display or print images, much like HF [[WEFAX]] (serving the maritime community). Often both receiver and decoder were combined into one unit.

Today,{{when|date=January 2015}} with the advent of personal computers, all that is required is dedicated software{{which|date=January 2015}} (many of which offer "free" versions [http://www.geo-web.org.uk/soft.php]) and a sound card. The sound card acquires and digitizes the [[Slow-scan television|slow scan]] video (in the audible range) coming from the speaker, phones, or line-out of the receiver, and then the software will process the various visible and infrared channels of the AVHRR sensor. Most software will automatically save every image and publish processed image onto the website of choice, putting up a new image on every pass of an APT satellite.

==== Enhanced images ====
Since each channel of the AVHRR sensor is sensitive to only one [[wavelength]] of light, each of the two images is [[luminance]] only, also known as [[grayscale]]. However, different materials tend to emit or reflect with a consistent relative intensity. This has enabled the development of software that can apply a color palette to the images which simulates visible light coloring. If the decoding software knows exactly where the satellite was, it can also overlay outlines and boundaries to help in utilizing the resulting images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3443">The '''Barcelona International Centre of Photography''' (El ''Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona'', in [[Catalan language]], CIFB) was a singular initiative in the photographic culture of [[Spain]] in the second half of the 1970s, becoming a pioneering institution in the formation, study, exhibition, distribution and production of the photographic image. 

The professional career of its initiator, [[Albert Guspi]] (1943-1985), an important innovator and central figure within the new photographic scene of the seventies, culminated in the creation of the CIFB. Despite its brief five-year existence, the CIFB became a reference in the reformation of photographic culture during the Spanish transition to [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macba.cat/en/calalogue-centre-internacional-fotografia-barcelona Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona (1978-1983)] at [[MACBA]] in Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
In the heart of the [[Raval]], at Carrer Aurora 11 bis, we can still find the building that once housed the Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona, CIFB. On its façade, an icon of the renovation of the neighbourhood, we can still see the paintings by [[Arranz Bravo]] and [[Bartolozzi]], restored in 1997. 

The CIFB was a short-lived experiment in the process of institutionalisation of photographic culture during [[Spain's democratic Transition]]. The current study of this experiment, little known and almost forgotten despite its nearness in time and space, should be understood from a double perspective: local and global. On the one hand, this is a local study of a process that was taking place at an international level during the seventies: the re-composition of the cultural field within the new cultural industries following a post-industrial economic model. This was a moment of great expansion for the art market, with photography becoming part of it to an unprecedented degree. The seventies marked the beginning of a great international resurgence of institutions, festivals, academic programmes, galleries and publications that laid down the conditions for the interpenetration of culture and economy as it is known today. On the other hand, this is a study of how such generalised historical conditions took on a specific, local and very concrete form in the field of photography in Barcelona during the Transition. In this sense, the study sheds a different light on the period, allowing us to understand how disparate photographic practices and traditions, which have since become separate, were able to coexist at the time. The multiplicity of the seventies eventually lost ground when faced with a visualist conception of creative photography, whose hegemony began to establish itself after the Jornades Catalanes de Fotografia, which took place at the Fundació Joan Miró in 1980, and which, in retrospect, are still regarded as photography's official entry into the new cultural policies. The CIFB declined to take part in the Jornades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-international-center Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona (1978-1983)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Binder clip.JPG|thumb|right|A single, large sized binder clip.]]

A '''binder clip''', less commonly known as a '''banker's clip''' or '''foldover clip''', is a simple device for binding sheets of paper together.  It leaves the paper intact and can be removed quickly and easily, unlike the [[Staple (fastener)|staple]]. The term ''"foldback clip"'' is used in the United Kingdom to describe this invention (not to be confused with a [[Bulldog clip]], an older device with the same function, which is stronger and has rigid rather than folding handles). It is also sometimes referred to as a "handbag clip" because, when not in use, its clip can be folded up to look like a handbag.

==Characteristics and methods of use==
[[Image:Three binder clips.jpg|thumb|right|The handles can be folded down once the clip has been attached, and can also be removed for a semi-permanent binding.]]
[[Image:Binder clips.JPG|thumb|right|An assortment of binder clips, with an [[AA battery]] for scale]]
A binder clip is a strip of [[spring steel]] bent into the shape of an [[isosceles triangle]] with loops at the [[Wiktionary:apex|apex]].  [[Tensile stress|Tension]] along the base of the triangle forces the two sides closed, and the loops prevent the sharp steel edges from cutting into the paper. The loops also serve to hold two pieces of stiff [[wire]], which are used as handles and allow the clip to be opened.  The two slots cut in each loop are shaped so that the wire handles can be folded down once the clip has been attached, and the spring force of the wire holds them down on the surface of the paper.  This holds the clip relatively flat, for easier stacking of paper. One handle can also be folded down while the other remains up to allow the stack of papers to be hung up. The handles can also be removed altogether by squeezing them sideways and pulling them out, allowing for more permanent binding. As compared to a [[paper clip]], the binder clip is able to bind sheets of paper more securely, and is also resistant to rust.

There are several sizes of binder clips, ranging from a base size of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;5&amp;nbsp;millimetres&amp;nbsp;(0.2&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;50&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;(1.97&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;/span&gt;. The sheet steel portion is customarily [[black oxide]] coated, but a variety of decorative painted color schemes are also available. The sheet steel portion is occasionally made of stainless steel, the more typical spring steel can also be finished in nickel, silver or gold. The handles are normally [[Nickel electroplating|nickel-plated]].

==Uses==
The binder clip is in common use in the modern office. It can hold a few to many sheets of paper, and is usually used in place of the paper clip for large volumes of paper. Various practical (and sometimes whimsical) alternative uses have been proposed. These include holding pieces of quilt together, creating a "beer pyramid" in a refrigerator with wire shelves, serving as a bookmark, a cheap alternative to a [[money clip]] or preventing computer cables from slipping behind desks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5499838/binder-clips-as-cable-catchers-redux |title=Binder Clips as Cable Catchers Redux |last=Purdy |first=Kevin |publisher=Lifehacker |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller sized clips have been commonly used as "quick fix" fitting and sizing solutions in the fashion industry.

In 1966, test pilot [[Joseph F. Cotton]] used the shiny metal portion of such a clip to short-circuit an electrical circuit panel to force the landing gear of the [[XB-70]] bomber on a flight.

==History==
The binder clip was invented in 1910 by Washington resident Louis E. Baltzley, who ultimately was granted {{US patent|1139627}} for his invention.&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = A Big Clip Job? Think Washington
  | first = Linda
  | last = Hales
  | date = 20 May 2006

  | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/19/AR2006051901923.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the method of binding sheets of paper together was to punch holes in them and sew them together, making it tedious to remove a single sheet of paper.

Louis Baltzley invented the binder clip to help his father, Edwin Baltzey, a writer and inventor, hold his manuscripts together easily. While the original design has since been changed five times, the basic mechanism has remained the same.&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;

Baltzey initially produced his invention through the L.E.B. Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;  These earliest binder clips are stamped "L.E.B." on one side of the sheet steel. Manufacturing rights were later licensed to other companies.

=== Business model ===
{{See also|Bench to bedside|Proof of concept}}
BioLine's [[business model]] consists of three stages. In the first stage, called the ''bench'' stage, the potential drug candidate is evaluated "from both scientific and marketing perspectives." In the second stage, called the ''bedside'' stage, BioLine accompanies the drug through early [[clinical trial]]s. In the third stage, the ''partner'' stage, BioLine enters into strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company to see the drug through its advanced clinical trials and bring it to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BioLineRx—Overview |url=http://www.biolinerx.com/default.asp?pageid=11 |publisher=BioLineRx |accessdate=28 November 2011 |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925064030/http://www.biolinerx.com/default.asp?pageid=11 |archivedate=25 September 2011 |df= }}{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''centre stick''' (or '''center stick''' in the United States), or simply '''control stick''' is an aircraft [[cockpit]] arrangement where the control column (or [[joystick]]) is located in the center of the cockpit between the [[Aviator|pilot]]'s legs. Since the throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot, the right hand is used for the stick, although left-hand or both-hands operation is possible if required.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 132. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre stick is a part of an aircraft's [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], and is typically linked to its [[aileron]]s and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]s, or alternatively to its [[elevon]]s, by control rods or control cables on basic aircraft. On heavier, faster, more advanced aircraft the centre stick may also control power-assist modules.  Modern aircraft centre sticks are also usually equipped with a number of electrical control switches within easy finger reach, in order to reduce the pilot's workload.

The centre stick is used in many military fighter jets such as [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and the [[Mirage III]], but also in [[light aircraft]] such as [[Piper Cub]]s and the [[Diamond Aircraft]] line of products such as the [[DA20]], [[DA40]] and [[DA42]].

This arrangement contrasts with the more recently developed "[[side-stick]]" which is used in such military fighter jets as the [[F-16]], the [[F-35 Lightning II]] and [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and also on civil aircraft such as the [[Airbus A320]].

== History ==

The centre stick originated at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1900 [[Wilhelm Kress]] of [[Austria]] developed a control stick for aircraft, but did not apply for a patent. Instead, a patent was awarded to the [[France|French]] aviator, [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] who applied for it in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Connections (TV series)|''Connections'']], Episode 6 Part 5 of 5 (1976).&lt;br&gt;Also: {{cite book | last = Burke | first = James | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-316-11681-5 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This post is on a footpath in Wormley Wood, Hertfordshire]]

'''Coal-tax posts''' are [[Boundary marker|boundary marker posts]] found in southern England. They were erected in the 1860s and form an irregular loop between 12 and 18 miles from [[London]] to mark the points where taxes on [[coal]] were due to the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]. There were originally around 280 posts of which around 210 remain. 

==History==
Coal imported into the [[City of London]] had been taxed since medieval times and, as it was originally all brought by sea to riverside wharfs, the collection of the duties was relatively easy. The city is a small (one square mile) but influential and rich part of London. The [[Port of London]], within which the duties were payable, stretched far beyond the boundaries of the City, all the way along the Thames from Yantlet Creek (downstream from [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]]) to [[Staines]].

By the 19th century, however, there was increasing trade by canal and rail, and various [[Acts of Parliament]] extended the catchment area to include these new modes of transport. In 1845 the boundary was set at a radius of 20 miles from the [[General Post Office, London|General Post Office]], [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;8 &amp; 9 Victoria, Cap 101: "…to any Place within the distance of Twenty Miles of the General Post Office within the City of ''London''…"&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] in the west to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] in the east and from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] in the north to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] in the south. In 1851 an Act permitted the erection of boundary markers to indicate where this boundary lay; and about fifty markers, inscribed with a reference to the Act, were erected.

In 1861 a further Act – the [[London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act 1861]] – was passed, reducing the area to that of the [[Metropolitan Police District]] plus the City of London. This stretched from [[Colnbrook]] in the west to Crayford Ness, at the mouth of the [[River Darent]], in the east, and from [[Wormley, Hertfordshire]] in the north to [[Banstead]] Heath, Surrey in the south. New marker posts (about 280) were erected to show the boundary within which the duty was payable. These again cite the Act by [[regnal year]] and chapter number, i.e. 24 &amp; 25 VICT CAP 42. In some cases, notably on railways and canals, markers made for earlier acts were reused on the new boundary. Most (over 200) of these posts survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coaldutyposts.org.uk/today/list.html|title=The boundary marks today: List of extant marks|last=Nail|first=Martin|work=City posts: the coal duties of the City of London and their boundary marks|accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the title of the Act refers to wine duties, these were collected only in the Port of London: the boundary marks have no connection with the wine duties and it is incorrect to call them "coal and wine duty posts".

The purpose of the posts was to give notice of where the boundary ran so that no-one could claim ignorance of liability to pay the duties. However, in general, duties were not actually collected on the boundary. The one known exception was the [[Grand Junction Canal]]: originally customs officers collected the duties at Grove Park, Hertfordshire. After the boundary was changed in 1861 a permanent house for the collector was built at Stockers Lock near [[Rickmansworth]].&lt;ref name =BBChistory&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/making_history_winter2003.shtml ''Making History''], BBC Radio 4, broadcast 23 December 2003, commencing 3′ 50″. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/ram/making_history_20031223.ram RealPlayer audio accessed 16 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases the railway and canal companies or local [[coal merchant]]s calculated the sums due and paid the money to the Corporation. The railway companies were initially allowed some coal free of duty for their engines.

==Types of post==
There are five different forms of coal duty boundary markers in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[London Archaeologist]]|date=Spring 1969|issue=1|pages=27–30|last=Bawtree|first=Maurice|title=The City of London coal duties and their boundary marks|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-457-1/dissemination/pdf/vol01/vol01_02/01_02_027_030.pdf|publisher=(6MB download from the Archaeology Data Service, University of York Department of Archaeology)|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nail|first=Martin|title=Types of boundary mark|url=http://www.coaldutyposts.org.uk/types/typesintro.html|work=City posts: the coal duties of the City of London and their boundary marks|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Granite obelisks, about 1.2 metres high, erected beside canals and navigable rivers.
# Cast-iron posts about 1.2 metres high. These form the majority of posts and are found beside roads – and also beside tracks and footpaths, sometimes in open countryside.
# Cast-iron boxes or plates, about 230&amp;nbsp;mm square, built into parapets of road bridges.
# Stone or cast-iron obelisks, about 4.5 metres high, found beside railways. Originally erected on previous boundaries and reused on the  1861 boundary.
# Cast-iron obelisks, about 1.75 metres high, erected on railways after 1865.
Almost all bear the City's shield or in some cases the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|full coat of arms]]. Most of the cast-iron posts are painted white, with the cross and sword of the shield picked out in red, but the stone ones are often of a sombre black, still bearing the stains accumulated on the smoky trackside.  Most of the posts are Grade II [[listed building]]s.&lt;ref name="BBChistory" /&gt;

== How the duties were used ==
The City of London had the right to collect dues for weighing and measuring coal entering the Port of London since medieval times.  After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, Acts of Parliament imposed further duties to help pay for the rebuilding.  Although some of the proceeds were for general rebuilding purposes, most was to cover the costs of rebuilding [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and the City churches.  After the completion of St Paul's, the duties were paid to the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches]]. In 1718 the duty was converted into a Government duty, though some was still used for ecclesiastical purposes, such as the rebuilding of [[St George's Church, Gravesend|Gravesend Church]] in 1730. During the [[Napoleonic wars]], the duty was increased several times to help pay for the wars.  Government duties on coal were abolished in 1831.

At the end of the 17th century, the City of London owed large sums, notably to the funds which they held on trust for the orphans of City Freemen. In 1694 the City persuaded Parliament to pass an Act for the Relief of the Orphans and other Creditors of the City of London which allowed it to raise money in various ways, including the imposition of duties on coal. This Act was the ancestor of the ones which set up the posts.  In the middle of the 18th century the income from the duties started to be used to finance public works in London, not only in the City itself but also in surrounding areas such as the [[West End of London|West End]], [[Southwark]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These included bridges such as [[Blackfriars Bridge]], roads improvements such as at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] and the [[Ratcliffe Highway]], and court buildings such as the [[Old Bailey]] and the [[Middlesex Sessions House]] in Clerkenwell.  In 1803 a further duty was introduced to pay for the expenses of the [[Coal Exchange (London)|coal market in London]].

The use of the coal duties to pay for public works continued in the nineteenth century: for example they paid for the rebuilding of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and the construction of [[New Oxford Street]].  After creation of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] (MBW) in 1855 the major part of duties went to the Board and were used to pay for the creation of a unified sewerage system in London and the construction of the [[Thames Embankment|Thames embankments]]. The City's portion of the duties paid for the building of [[Cannon Street]], and later of [[Holborn Viaduct]].

In the 1870s the duties were used to free from toll a number of bridges on the Thames: [[Kew Bridge|Kew]], [[Kingston Bridge, London|Kingston upon Thames]], [[Hampton Court Bridge|Hampton Court]], [[Walton Bridge|Walton upon Thames]], and [[Staines Bridge|Staines]], together with Chingford, and Tottenham Mills on the Lea.

== The end of the duties ==
The coal duties had always been unpopular and were the subject of attacks by pamphleteers (for example [[Joseph Bottomley Firth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Firth|first=Joseph Firth Bottomley|title=The coal and wine dues: the history of the London coal tax, and the arguments for and against its renewal|year=1887|publisher=The Anti-coal Tax Committee|location=London|accessdate=2012-01-30 |url=https://archive.org/details/coalwinedueshist00firtiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1887) etc. throughout their life. Objection was taken to a tax on a basic necessity and the anomaly of a tax in London which did not apply to the rest of the country.  The greater anomaly was that the area of collection – the Metropolitan Police District – was so much larger than the area in which they were spent: the Metropolitan Board of Works covered much the same area as its successor the London County Council. With the growth of the outer suburbs, their residents resented paying a tax which had very little direct benefit for them. This is why in 1868 Parliament decided that the duties were to be used to free from toll the bridges in outer London mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Free opening of Kew Bridge|journal=Illustrated London news|date=February 1873|page=159 |url=http://www.web40571.clarahost.co.uk/Strand/Kew2BridgeTollfree.htm|accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s the City and the MBW wanted the duties to continue, in the face of growing opposition from the public and national politicians, but when the MBW was replaced by the [[London County Council]] in 1889, the new council declined to support renewal. An act was passed in that year abolishing the duties, the last of which was collected in 1890. The abolition was opposed with some underhand tactics: a parliamentary [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] sitting in 1887 found that signatures on a petition in support of keeping the tax had been forged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Special report from the Select Committee on Public Petitions|journal=House of Commons Sessional Papers |year=1873|volume=XI|issue=175|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The posts thus represent the final phase of the duties in the face of growing opposition. They had been collected for over 300 years but within 30 years of the posts going up were abolished.

A '''creepmeter''' is an instrument that monitors the slow surface displacement of an active [[geologic fault]] in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring Instruments|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/deformation/data/instruments.php|website=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function is to record the slow, [[aseismic creep]] between [[earthquake]]s. The measurement range of a creepmeter is usually limited to 10–30&amp;nbsp;mm. Approximately 40 creepmeters are in operation in [[California]]—most are operated by the [[United States Geological Survey ]] (USGS), but nine are maintained by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].

The '''dematerialization''' of a product literally means less, or better yet, no material is used to deliver the same level of functionality to the user. Sharing, borrowing and the organization of group services that facilitate and cater for communities needs could alleviate the requirement of [[ownership]] of many products.

In his book ‘'In the Bubble: designing in a complex world'’, John Thakara states that "the average consumer power tool is used for ten minutes in its entire life - but it takes hundreds of times its own weight to [[manufacture]] such an object”. A [[product service system]] with shared tools could simply offer access to them when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World
 |last=Thakara
 |first=John |author-link=John Thackara |year=2005 |publisher=The MIT Press
|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-262-20157-7 |page=18-19
| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift from a reliance on [[Product (business)|products]] to [[Service (economics)|services]] is the process of dematerialization. Digital music distribution systems, car clubs, bike hire schemes and laundry services are all examples of dematerialization.

'''Design Studies''' is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that pursues a critical understanding of [[design]] and its effects through analytical and practical modes of inquiry. Its origins can be traced to [[design history]] where the field first got its start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Richard|title=Design Research and the New Learning|journal=Design Issues|date=2001|volume=17,|issue=4|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; before slowly expanding to include larger themes and more varied subject matters. In that light, Victor Margolin, one of the founders of the discipline in the US, proposes Design Studies as a term that comprises various design researches and relates them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field, Design Studies references many scholarship paradigms and focuses on how design knowledge is developed, articulated and communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Design Research: A Disciplined Conversation|date=1999|volume=15|issue=02|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore incorporates an expansive set of evolving methodologies and theories that are drawn from key thinkers and theorists from the field itself (such as [[Victor Margolin]], Clive Dilnot, and [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]), but also from several related fields such as, the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[art]], [[Visual Studies|visual studies]], [[cultural studies]]), the [[social science]]s ([[anthropology]], [[political science]]s, and [[sociology]]), the [[science]]s ([[engineering]], [[Materials science|material]] studies, [[neurology]], [[technology]] studies). Design Studies also generates scholarly work in the fields of [[architecture]], [[urban planning]] and [[Urban policy|policy]], and spatial studies. Design Studies not only considers objects, places and systems, it investigates their meanings, contexts, possibilities and consequences.

Design Studies recognizes that design, as a practice, is merely one facet of a much larger paradigm. It examines, probes, and questions the role of design in shaping past and present personal and cultural values, especially in light of how they shape the future. The subjects of Design Studies are inherently fluid while being anchored to a core body of work and scholarship that revolves around broader themes such as [[ethics]], environmental sustainment, and [[social sustainability]].

The American author, editor and educator Susan Yelavich, encapsulates the terrain of Design Studies as embracing "two broad perspectives—one that focuses inward on the nature of design and one that looks outward to the circumstances that shape it, and conversely, the circumstances design changes, intentionally or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/double_profile_of_design_studie/|title=The Double Profile of Design Studies - Design Studies|website=adht.parsons.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of Design Studies ===
The history of the field of Design Studies can be traced to the early 1960s in England. In 1962, a “Conference on Design Methods” held in London led to the emergence of the [[Design Research Society]], bringing together academics and practitioners who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Forty Years of Design Research|journal=Design Studies|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about|website=Design Research Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a series of conferences were held that helped continue the development of the [http://www.drs2016.org/222/ Design Methods Movement (DMM)]— a product of the post-war optimism of the 1950s, cancelled in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement focused on the comparison between science and design and tried to determine methods that distinguished design as an important academic field apart from the realm of art and art history. However, in 1980 at the Design Research Society’s [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005784314 Design:Science:Method] conference concluded that there was not much for design to learn from science, instead, science had something to learn from design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, design became a discipline of study “based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them.” This stance was promulgated in the first issue of ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies]'' with the launch of a series of articles in its pages called “Design as a Discipline''.''”&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"/&gt; (''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies, The Interdisciplinary Journal of Design Research]'' as it is now known, was first published as Design Studies 1, no.1 in July 1979. Produced by the publisher Reed Elsevier known since 2015 as [[Elsevier]]). The series began with [[L. Bruce Archer|Bruce Archer]], and his 1979 essay, “Whatever became of Design Methodology?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying article from the same issue titled "The Three Rs," Archer places [[Design]] with a capital D as a third extreme in an education triangle with the [[Science]]s and [[Humanities]] situating design, though not exclusively, within acts of configuration, composition, meaning, value, and purpose in man-made phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=The Three Rs|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about the discipline of design and design research continued through the 1980s and were significantly reignited in 1995 when [[Victor Margolin]], an American scholar who contributed to the development of design history, argued for a new approach to “Design Studies.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|page=14|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin referred to the "dynamic crossings of intellectual boundaries" when describing the interdisciplinary nature of intellectual practice at the time. He felt that early design historians should question "whether design history as it [had] been constituted...[was] a viable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=v|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooding, J. V., “Design History in Britain From the 1970's to 2012: Context, Formation and Development, Ph.D. Dissertation University of Northumbria, Newcastle (January 2012) p. 200-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin defines design studies as a field of inquiry that addresses how we make and use products and how we have done so in the past. These products compromise the domain in the artificial. Design studies addresses ideas of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use. It considers these topics in the present as well as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=The Politics of the Artificial: essays on design and design studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin's position triggered counter arguments about how to characterize the study of design. A battle in print began with his article titled, “Design history or design studies: subject matter and methods” published in the international journal ''Design Studies (Design Studies was the journal of the [[Design Research Society]], founded in the UK in 1966; the journal itself has been in publication since 1979).'' This controversial topic had resonance in Britain where [[Adrian Forty]]’s response appeared in the pages of the ''[[Journal of Design History]]'', in which he argued in favor of research that led to the understanding of quality judgements defining good design "as an entirely legitimate field for design historical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DEBATE: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Journal of Design History|date=1 January 1993|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this debate was made clear by the fact that it was reprinted in a special issue of ''[[Design Issues]]'' in 1995 where it refocused attention on "some of the controversies and problems that surround the seemingly simple task of telling the history of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan, Doordan &amp; Margolin|first1=Richard, Dennis, Victor|title=Introduction|journal=v|date=Spring 1995|volume=11|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from Design History to Design Studies started to occur as the research and approaches to the field began to focus on broader questions of meaning, authority and power, in other words, with the dynamics surrounding and enabling the practice of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|pages=38–42|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization came that Design History is only “but one component of what goes on in studying design, and to claim that all that is going on now could use the umbrella term 'design history’ is not tenable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|page=40|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of Design Studies would now include not only design history, but also allow for a dialogue about “issues of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use” in a historical and contemporary context.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Foundational Figures ===
[[L. Bruce Archer]]. (1922-2005) was a British mechanical engineer and later Professor of [[Design Research]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] who championed research in design, and helped to establish design as an academic discipline. Archer trained a generation of design researchers, showing them how the procedures of scholarly research based on well-founded evidence and systematic analysis were as applicable in design as in the more traditional academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=A View of the Nature of Design Research Design:Science:Method|date=1981|publisher=Westbury House|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he helped to found the cross-disciplinary [[Design Research Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce, ‘A View of the Nature of Design Research’, in Jacques, R and Powell, J (eds), Design:Science:Method, Westbury House, Guildford, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian academic, Cameron Tonkinwise has a background in philosophy, with a particular emphasis on Heidegger's genealogy of thought and its informing design practice. Having worked closely with Tony Fry at the [http://www.changedesign.org/ Ecodesign Foundation] in the 1990s, Tonkinwise later headed initiatives in sustainability at Parsons, The New School, and later became chair of design studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where he set up the [https://design.cmu.edu/content/phd PhD programs] in [http://transitiondesign.net/ Transition Design] and Design Studies. Cameron's primary area of research is sustainable design and designing for socio-technical transitions - in particular, he focuses on the design of systems that lower societal materials intensity, primarily by decoupling use and ownership, i.e systems of shared use.

[[Adrian Forty]]: (born 1948) was Professor of Architectural History at The Bartlett, The Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London.

[[John Heskett]] (1937-2014) In the late 1970s, Heskett became a prominent member of a group of academics based in several of Britain's art schools (then part of the polytechnics) who helped develop the discipline of design history and theory, later to become subsumed under the broader banner of Design Studies. In subsequent years, as design became a global practice increasingly valued by corporations and governments alike, design history became, along with design pedagogy, one of the nation's most successful academic exports. Heskett brought his deep knowledge of economics, politics and history to the project and worked alongside scholars from other disciplines to communicate the meaning and function of that increasingly important concept, "design", both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparke|first1=Penny|title=John Heskett obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/john-heskett|website=the guardian|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Outside Anglo-Saxon ===
According to Ahmed Ansari, Danah Abdulla, Ece Canli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Matthew Kiem, Pedro Oliveira, Luiza Prado, and Tristan Schultz who make up the ''[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design Group]'', “Coloniality is not an abstract concept nor is it a subject to be examined from a comfortable distance. It is something that affects our communities, our countries and our peoples every single day. It is a continuous process of domination and violence to which we are submitted. It demeans our knowledge, subjugates our bodies, and renders our lives arduous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established via their online blog “[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design],” this collective of design researchers, academics, and practitioners working in and with the fields of Design Studies and Design Research firmly believe that “decolonisation is imperative for survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Decolonising Design Group's effort was born from their frustrations with academia during the events that led up to their withdrawal from the 2016 Design Research Society Conference and driven by their desire to engage in a profound debate of the colonial ethos of design and research. The collective believes it is, “not sufficient for design studies and design research to simply include a greater ‘diversity of perspectives’ as a means to delay and offset demands for radical systemic change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purpose of transforming the agenda of design studies and design research, the group organized a symposium on decolonization titled “Intersectional Perspectives on Design, Politics &amp; Power” which was held at the School of Arts and Communication, Malmö University, Sweden on 14–15 November 2016. For these [relatively] young academics, the field of design studies is not “geared towards delivering the kinds of knowledge and understanding that are adequate to addressing the systemic problems that arise from the coloniality of power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Statement|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that design history and design research tends to have the most influence from the triad of Western Europe, North America, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Matthew|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford:|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect tends to be in line with the notion that history is written by the victors and thus design history is written by the economically powerful.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; They point to concurrent histories outside of the western context. For instance, Hong Kong has a unique system of design that was established prior to the economic growth of the Pearl River delta which can be found in the continuities of design in product types and styles, manufacturing and printing companies, and families of artist-designers.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; Or in Cuba for instance, where the origins of design was influenced by the crisis of “modern movement ideology and the ideologies oh how to escape underdevelopment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries lie on the periphery of the westernized view of design history and design studies and in some instances may have suffered in their adaptation of European modernity. As such, [[Gui Bonsiepe]], a German designer, teacher, and writer, suggested that “Decolonization in all its manifestations, economic, technological and cultural, should be the goal of project activity in the periphery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for understanding design as a global and multicultural phenomenon is also argued by Jonathan M. Woodham, [[Victor Margolin]], and Anna Calvera in Denise Whitehouse’s collection of essays.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=54–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together their aim is to “create a theoretical narrative that brings intellectual logic to the multiple stories of how different countries… have negotiated the process of Westernization and the idea of design according to their specific economic, geographical, political, and cultural circumstances.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As Whitehouse points out, “While many countries produce local histories of design, the output is uneven and often driven by nationalist and trade agendas.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Academic groups like the Japanese [http://www.designhistoryforum.org/ Design History Forum] and [http://www.ub.edu/icdhs/ The International Committee for Design History and Studies (ICDHS)] draw together both western and non-western, post-communist, postcolonial, Asian, and Southern Hemisphere, “to remap the scope and narrative concerns of design history.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Approaches and Scope ==
Design Studies thinks ambitiously about design, beyond its professional enclaves, and studies the significance and consequences of design activity in the modern world. It looks at design as a complex and multifarious activity and examines the forces that design exerts in, and on, the world—forces design sets in motion but does not control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|website=|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Design Studies views design as both the embodiment of the imminent future (by virtue of behaviors it triggers and resources it depletes) and as a means of envisioning alternative futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Design Studies is interdisciplinary (moving between disciplines), multi-disciplinary (utilizing multiple disciplines in its process and methods) and transdisciplinary (combining disciplines in creating new disciplinary structures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NC State|title=What is Design Studies, Anyway?|url=https://design.ncsu.edu/design-studies/|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  its approaches and scopes are not constrained by any boundaries of academic disciplines. It is promiscuous and draws on the knowledge of philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, cultural theory, politics and the sciences to ask questions of what is design, and how can we comprehend its acting in the world by analyzing its possibilities and limits.

As an organized field of study, Design Studies is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourse and theoretical perspectives concerning the ways we think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It focuses on describing the why, the how and the what of design. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve and uses varied methodologies to explore the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, critical theory and design practice. Its scholars explore the coherent structures and intellectual parameters of how design is encountered in the world, as well as analyze which different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures.

== Subject(s) of Design Studies ==
As an organized field of study, Design Studies is a discipline concerned with design as a practice and as an intervention in the world. It is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourses and theoretical perspectives concerning ways to think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve by using various methodologies to analyze the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, design practice and critical theory.

Design Studies analyzes how different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures using approaches such as those conventions listed under [[design]] as well as:

== Issues and Concepts in Design Studies ==
Design Studies asks us to think about the meaning of design. It studies the influence of designers and the effects design has on citizens and the environment.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268792485|title=Design studies : a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|others=Clark, Hazel., Brody, David Eric.|isbn=9781847882363|edition=English|location=Oxford|oclc=268792485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Margolin distinguishes a degree in Design from a degree in Design Studies by saying that “the former is about producing design, while the latter is about reflecting on design as it has been practiced, is currently practiced, and how it might be practiced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drs2016.org/009/|title=Design Research: What is it?

Design Studies urges to rethink design as a process, as a practice, and as a generator or products and systems that gives lives meaning and sustains our economic and political systems. Design thinking invites to explore the complexities inherent to the task of thinking about design.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt; Design Studies is concerned with the relationship between design and gender, design and race, and design and culture. It studies issues such as ethics, sustainment (social and environmental) and works with concepts such as agency and the artificial.

=== Issues ===

==== Ethics ====
Design has the capacity of structuring life in certain ways and thus design should result in the greater good for individuals and society but it doesn’t always do so. Ethics deals with how our actions affect others. Design Studies sees ethics as central to design. Tony Fry, a leading figure in Design Studies claims, “Design is quintessentially an ethical process but despite this recognition that ethics is integral to design in many ways, design ethics remains ‘massively underdeveloped and even in its crudest forms remains marginal within design education.” It is important to involve ethics in the design process, especially as the world we inhabit is increasingly becoming artificial.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

Clive Dilnot’s essay, [https://www.amazon.com/Design-Studies-Reader-Hazel-Clark/dp/1847882366 ''Ethics in Design –'' ''Ten Questions'']'','' explores why we need ethics in design, what is the relationship between design and ethics. Dilnot writes that ethics should as a responsibility, as the ability of the designer to address the public as citizens and not as consumers or as the infusing of “humane intelligence” into the made environment, assume the possibility of truly human – humane, sustainable ways or making and remaking the world.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

==== Sustainment: Environmental and Social ====

=== Concepts ===
==== The Artificial ====
Clive Dilnot goes further and clarifies that the artificial is by no means confined to technology. Today, it is combination of technical systems, the symbolic realm, including mind and the realm of our transformations and transmutations of nature. He gives the example of a [[genetically modified tomato]] that is neither purely natural nor purely artificial. It belongs rather to the extended realms of living things that are, as human beings ourselves are, a hybrid between these conditions – Neither nature nor the artificial nor the human are today pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858895940|title=Design as future-making|others=Yelavich, Susan,|isbn=9780857858399|location=London|oclc=858895940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies scholars also reference sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] when investigating the dynamics of the artificial. Latour's concept of [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]] (ANT) portrays the social as an interdependent network of human individual actors and actants, which are non-human, non-individual entities. ANT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latour|first=Bruno|date=1996|title=On actor-network theory: A few clarifications|jstor=40878163|journal=Soziale Welt|volume=47|issue=4|pages=369–381|doi=10.2307/40878163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Agency ====
Design plays a constitutive role in everyday life. We engage design with all of our senses – The things we see and read, the objects we use, and the places we inhabit are all designed. These products (all artificial because they are catalyzed by people) constitute an increasingly large part of the world. The built environment is the physical infrastructure that enables behavior, activity, routines, habits, and rituals, which affect our agency. Jamer Hunt defines the built environment as the combination of all design work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51931174|title=Strangely familiar : design and everyday life|date=2003|publisher=Walker Art Center|others=Blauvelt, Andrew, 1964-, Walker Art Center., Carnegie Museum of Art., Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse.|isbn=9780935640755|edition=1st|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|oclc=51931174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Methods  ==
=== Design Ethnography  ===

This form of research requires the scholar to partake in the use of, or observe others use, a designed object or system. Design-based Ethnography has become a common tool where design is observed as a social practice. It describes a process in which a researcher will partake in traditional observant style ethnography, and observe potential users complete activities that can inform design opportunities and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=5467|title=Design's Ethnographic Turn|work=Design Observer|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ethnographic techniques used by Design Studies scholars would fall more in line with anthropologists usage of the method. These techniques are observant and [[Participant observation|participant ethnography]]. The observant style requires the scholar to observe in an unobtrusive manner. Observations are recorded and further analyzed. The participant style requires the scholar to partake in the activities with their subject. This tactic enables the scholar to record what they see, but also what they themselves experience.

=== Actor-Network Theory  ===

While it remains a broader theory or concept Actor-Network theory can be used by Design Studies scholars as a research framework. When using this method, scholars will assess a designed object and consider the physical and nonphysical interactions which revolve around the object. The scholar will analyze what the object’s impact is on psychological, societal, economical, and political worlds. This widened viewpoint allows the researcher to explore and map out the objects many interactions, identify its role within the network, and in what ways it is connected to stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Callon M. (1986) The Sociology of an Actor-Network: The Case of the Electric Vehicle. In: Callon M., Law J., Rip A. (eds) Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiotics, Rhetorical Analysis, and Discourse Theory  ===

Design Studies scholars may also analyze or research a designed object or system by studying it in terms of images and their various meanings. Based in [[representation (arts)|representation]] and meaning-making, semiotics as pertinent design as an act of communication between the designer, the thing, and the user or users. This concept branches out into a rhetorical analysis of the designed thing. Scholars such as [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]], argue that design can be studied in such a way due to the existence of a design argument.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Richard|date=1985|title=Declaration by Design: Rhetoric, Argument, and Demonstration in Design Practice|url=|journal=Design Issues|volume=2|pages=4–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design argument is made up by the designer, the user, and the applicability to “practical life.”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The scholar would pull these segments apart and thoroughly analyze each component and their interactions. Finally, [[discourse analysis]] or a [[Foucauldian discourse analysis]] can be adopted by the Design Studies scholar to further explore the above components. A Foucauldian approach specifically will analyze the power structures put in place, manipulated by, or used within a designed thing or object. This process can be particularly useful when the scholar intends to understand if the designed thing has agency or enables others to have agency.

The [[Design Research Society]] (DRS) is a learned society committed to promoting and developing design research. It is the longest established, multi-disciplinary worldwide society for the design research community. The Design Research Society was founded in the UK in 1966. The origins of the Society lie in the Conference on Design Methods, held in London in 1962, which enabled a core of people to be identified who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing. The purpose of the DRS, as embodied in its first statement of rules, was to promote ‘the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields'. The DRS Constitution states the Rules by which the society is governed. The Annual General Meeting reports detail the governance, finance, activities, and plans of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Design Research Society, Accessed November 12, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4860">'''DigitalCurriculum''' was the first educational video-on-demand system and remains the standard for interactive streaming multimedia libraries.  An early [[SaaS]] model, DigitalCurriculum was conceived and designed in 1997 and produced and released in 1999, by AIMS Multimedia's David S. Sherman, Ph. D., co-president of AIMS MULTIMEDIA, and software architect Richard Williams.  The service drew from and incorporated the AIMS Multimedia educational video library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AIMS Media History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLMxASznLzoC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=charles+cahill+aims+media+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LNVzZd9BPs&amp;sig=yru_vRq--ZcSH8cZs7zwPU_bZRk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ohUOVJKqM8bboATY4YC4DQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20cahill%20aims%20media%20history&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AIMS Multimedia - Charles Cahill and Associates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLMxASznLzoC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=aims+multimedia+charles+cahill+and+associates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LNVzZd8JIn&amp;sig=wGNxPp7w5vvu7I4ThDfMjw5BVc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jxQOVMjKL8jeoASSqoLgBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=aims%20multimedia%20charles%20cahill%20and%20associates&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; executive producer Mike Wright and associate producer Pat Davies.

The video component in DigitalCurriculum included over $300 million in educational productions — programs that received more than 1,000 awards worldwide — including the prestigious Emmy, Oscar, Peabody and Parents’ Choice awards. These premier titles came from hundreds of world-renowned producers and distributors including: [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic/Weston Woods]], [[ABC News|ABC]], [[Paramount films|Paramount]], [[TV Ontario]], TEAMS Distance Learning, Channel One and the [[National Film Board of Canada]].

DigitalCurriculum was a curriculum-on-demand teaching and learning system that fully integrated full-length educational videos, key concept video clips, still images, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIMS and Britannica Team Up|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/12497106/aims-britannica-team-up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britannica and AIMS Team Up|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2004/03/ljarchives/aims-and-britannica-team-up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; teacher guides, lesson plans, and interactive online assessments and assignments into a comprehensive learning tool for teachers, students, and administrators with complete record-keeping and an internal messaging service. At the time of its acquisition in 2004 by [[Discovery Communications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Acquires DigitalCurriculum|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/14540528/discovery-education-acquires-aims-multimedia-consolidating-video-market-k-12-schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; DigitalCurriculum had over 100,000 educational multimedia components for every K-12 subject, state and national framework correlations, multiple bit-rate encoding for school and home use, simple incorporation of local content, and a paid subscriber base of more than 20 million teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DigitalCurriculum Sales Jump|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DigitalCurriculum(TM)+Sales+Jump+169%25+in+Second+Quarter+2003%3B+-...-a0105489349}}&lt;/ref&gt; librarians, administrators, and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIMS Multimedia|url=http://glickconsulting.com/pre-k/aims-multimedia-division-discovery-education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DigitalCurriculum is of particular historical interest as it was a SaaS pioneer and one of the first video on demand services.  It used a revolutionary multiple bitrate encoding that allowed video and audio streaming by users with shared DSL fractional T-1 internet connectivity; it even allowed streaming at 56kbit/s dial up modems.

DigitalCurriculum was described as innovative and visionary; its design, features and functionality having been copied and incorporated by virtually all educational media companies since its initial release back in 1998-1999 and it's various iterations, culminating in v.5.0 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DigitalCurriculum version 5|url=http://parallaxviews.com/dc_fact_sheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an integrated system used in modern aircraft to provide aircraft crew with aircraft engines and other systems instrumentation and crew annunciations. On EICAS equipped aircraft the "recommended remedial action" is called a checklist.

==Components==

EICAS typically includes instrumentation of various engine parameters, including for example [[revolutions per minute]], temperature values, fuel flow and quantity, oil pressure etc. Typical other aircraft systems monitored by EICAS are for example hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, deicing, environmental and control surface systems. EICAS has high connectivity &amp; provides data acquisition and routing.

EICAS is a key function of a [[glass cockpit]] system, which replaces all analog gauges with software-driven electronic displays.  Most of the display area is used for navigation and orientation displays, but one display or a section of a display is set aside specifically for EICAS.

The crew-alerting system (CAS) is used in place of the [[annunciator panel]] on older systems.  Rather than signaling a system failure by turning on a light behind a translucent button, failures are shown as a list of messages in a small window near the other EICAS indications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46317">{{Translation sidebar}}A '''fansub''' (short for '''fan-subtitled''') is a version of a [[foreign film]] or foreign [[television program]] which has been [[fan translation|translated by fans]] (as opposed to an officially licensed translation done by [[professionals]]) and [[subtitled]] into a [[language]] usually other than that of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=63|title=Fansub|publisher=''Anime News Network''|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The practice of making fansubs is called fansubbing and is done by a fansubber. Fansubbers typically form groups and divide the work up. The first distribution media of fansubbed material was [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] tapes.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

Early fansubs were produced using analog video editing equipment. First, a copy of the original source material or raw was obtained, most commonly from a commercial [[laserdisc]]. VHS tapes or even a homemade recording could be used as well, though this would produce a lower quality finished product. The dialogue was then translated into a script, that was then timed to match the dialogue, and [[typeset]] for appearance. The two most popular programs used in this process were JACOsub for the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Substation Alpha]] for [[MS Windows]]. The next step was to produce one or more masters, a high quality copy of the finished fansub from which many distribution copies could be made. The fansubber would play back the raw video through a computer equipped with a [[genlock]] in order to generate the subtitles and then overlay them on the raw signal. The hardware most often used was an [[Amiga]] PC, as most professional genlocks were prohibitively expensive. The final output of this arrangement was then recorded. The master was most often recorded onto [[S-VHS]] tape in an attempt to maximize quality, though some fansubbers used the less expensive VHS or Beta. Once completed, the master copy was then sent to a distributor. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Digisubs===
The internet allows for highly collaborative fansubbing, and each member of a fansub team may only complete one task.&lt;ref name="Citas Sanchez"/&gt; Online fansubbing communities are able to release a fully subtitled episode (including elaborate [[karaoke]]&lt;ref name="Citas Sanchez"/&gt; with translation, [[kana]], and [[kanji]] for songs, as well as additional remarks and translations of signs)&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol2-4/otaku_appendix.pdf |author=Hatcher, Jordan S. |title=Of Otaku and Fansubs. Appendix&amp;nbsp;– Fansub Samples |publisher=Script-ed. Vol. 2, No. 4, 2005. |format=PDF |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; within 24 hours of an episode's debut in Japan.&lt;ref name="ANN Interview Fansubber" /&gt;

The production of a fansub typically begins with obtaining the unsubtitled source video called a "raw" that typically comes from DVDs, VHS tapes, television broadcasts, [[peer-to-peer]] networks, and directly from Japanese-based contacts. Then a translator watches the video and produces a time-stamped text file of the screenplay with any relevant notes.&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt; The same series or episode may be subtitled by multiple groups with independent translations of varying quality. Fansub groups sometimes translate other already translated fansubs that are more susceptible to more errors.&lt;ref name="Citas Sanchez"&gt;{{cite web |author=Cintas, Jorge Díaz |author2=Pablo Muñoz Sánchez |url=http://www.jostrans.org/issue06/art_diaz_munoz.pdf |title=Fansubs: Audiovisual Translation in an Amateur Environment |format=PDF |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated text is assigned with start and end times in a process known as timing to ensure subtitles appear when dialogue is spoken and disappear with the silence.&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt;  An editor and a translation checker reads over the script to ensure that English is natural and coherent while still retaining the original meaning. A [[typeset]]ter then appearance for the dialogue, signs, translator notes, etc.&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt; Then groups perform quality control to catch any final errors.&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt;

Encoders then take the script file and create a single subtitled video file, often aiming for a target file size or video quality.  "Hard" subtitles, or ''hard subs'', are encoded into the footage, and thus become hard to remove from the video without losing video quality. "Soft" subtitles, or ''soft subs'', are subtitles applied at playback time from a subtitle datafile, either mixed directly into the video file (.mkv, .ogm, etc.), or in a separate file (.ssa, .srt, etc.). Soft subs can also be rendered at higher resolutions, which can make for easier reading if the viewer is [[Video scaler|upscaling]] the file, but also are more difficult to blend into the video (for instance rotated text/moving text). Hard subs have traditionally been more popular than softsubs, due to a lack of player support and worries over plagiarism, but most fansub groups now release a softsub version of their releases.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The resulting fansub is a computer video file and can be distributed via CD, DVD, [[Direct download link|DDL]], [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] software, and by file-sharing bots on [[IRC]].&lt;ref name="Citas Sanchez"/&gt; This distribution is usually handled by a distribution team, or "distro" team, composed of one or more individuals with a server or very high upload speed.

== History ==

===Pre-fansubs (pre–1970s)===
The first documented Japanese animation to be distributed in the United States was ''[[Panda and the Magic Serpent|The Tale of the White Serpent]]'' airing on March 15, 1961. Until the late 1970s, Japanese community TV stations' broadcasts were aimed exclusive at very young children. Soon after the release video cassette recorders in November 1975, post-''[[Astro Boy]]'' anime began to spread throughout the United States. By March 1976, TV stations in the United States began broadcasting [[super robot]] shows such as ''[[Getter Robo]]'', and due to the availability of VCRs, fans could record these shows to show to their friends. [[Fred Patten]] describes his first exposure to anime at the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society (LASFS) in 1976 when he met up with another fan who was an early adopter of Sony's [[betamax]] technology. By May 1977 he and a group of fans founded the first anime club in the United States, the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization (C/FO).&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;Leonard, Sean. [http://ics.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/281 Progress against the law: Anime and fandom, with the key to the globalization of culture] International Journal of Cultural Studies, 9 2005; vol. 8: pp. 281–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1977, the C/FO began corresponding with other Japanese animation fans across the country and because distribution of shows across the United States was different based on location, fans began trading tapes of shows they were missing between each other. At the time many LASFS members maintained contact with members around the world, and thus C/FO members began exchanging videos with fans located in Japan, typically US military personnel, who wanted ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. Fortunately, shows from either the United States or Japan could be played in either region as both used the [[NTSC]] format for broadcast. These shows were not translated, however Japanese animations remained simple enough that the average viewer could discern the plot exclusively from the visuals. By 1979, fans and clubs of Japanese animation had begun to separate from the science fiction movement and began to refer to the media they watched as anime.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

Throughout this period it was considered socially acceptable to screen anime for an audience without consent as few companies had American offices, and of the few that did, the answer was invariably "no". Japanese companies made it apparent that they knew fans in the United States engaged in unauthorized distribution and screening, however knew that fans were not profiting. Japanese companies asked fans to help them publicize, for instance, [[Toei Animation]] asked the C/FO to aid it with some marketing research at San Diego [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]. Starting in 1978, Japanese companies tried to set up their own American divisions; however, with the exception of the film ''[[The Sea Prince and the Fire Child]]'' which was licensed to RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, they realized they were not going to succeed in the American market and the last American anime company branch closed in 1982.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

===Growth of anime fanclubs (1980s)===
After anime companies pulled out of the United States in 1982, there were no longer any legal or moral forces to discourage fans from copying and distributing tapes among themselves. From the late 1970s until the late 1980s, clubs began expanding to have chapters in other cities and grew to become of national and international scales. As the fandom grew, fans begun to experience ideological conflicts such as whether to keep the fandom niche or not. The visual quality of tapes began to degrade as fans made copies of copies; by the early 1980s some C/FO members reported tapes in their 15th to 20th generation that were extremely poor quality. In the mid to late 1980s, fans began to make booklets containing the translated dialogue for entire films (typically $2–3 to cover costs) and anime-focused magazines.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

Despite numerous attempts, any efforts to convince US companies to license Japanese animation fail with the exception of a handful of companies that were intent on "carving up" any series rewriting them into kiddy cartoons. Sean Leonard states that entertainment executives at the time mistakenly assumed that since anime are cartoons, they must be marketed at young children; furthermore Japanese cartoons were much too violent and complex in plot for children. Leonard states that the most notorious example was the translation of [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]] airing in the US in April 1986 that left its creators [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Isao Takahata]] appalled; Takahata exclaimed licensing Nausicaä was a huge error and no further [[Studio Ghibli]] produced films would be licensed internationally. These edits however were no worse than most other non-Disney animation films that were available in the US. Fans who obtained the Japanese originals of ''Nausicaä'' were inspired so as to organize an anime tour to Tokyo in 1986 to see Miyazaki's ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]'' and landmarks in anime.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

Carl Macek played a key role in creating a pivotal wave of anime fans. Macek ran a comic book and movie memorabilia speciality shop. After assisting in marketing and promotion of ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' and the recent establishment of a nearby C/FO chapter, he began researching Japanese animation and imported Japanese cels becoming known as a Japanese animation specialist. [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] then contacted him as they had acquired international licenses for several series, were planning on distributing in Latin America, Europe, and the US, and enlisted his help for the US market. After Macek noticed their selection of ''[[Macross]]'' and similar science fiction series, Macek obtained Harmony Gold's approval to release an anime if he could edit three series together into what they named, ''[[Robotech]]''. Macek went to science fiction conventions to promote the series and discovered the growing cult interest among adolescent and young adults, in contrast to the assumption of an exclusively viable child-targeted market. Macek edits ''[[Macross]]'', ''[[Southern Cross]]'', and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]'' together into ''[[Robotech]]'' and lands a resounding commercial success earning him a lot of notoriety in fan community. Leonard describes as it being more faithful to the original series than any other commercial success at the time as it included key elements such as the first love triangle on both Japanese and American animated television.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

The C/FO was at its height between 1985 and 1989 with over three dozen chapters throughout the US. [[John Renault]] helped lead the C/FO chapter in Japan and played a key role throughout fansub history due to his ability with Japanese, anime industry contacts, and military background. Renault helped exchange raws from Japan, wrote informative articles about production, translated booklets, introduced military techniques to anime distribution, provided plot synopses that proved invaluable for watching Japanese only anime. Fan distribution through C/FO’s efforts, particularly C/FO Rising Sun, sought to keep anime free but keep anime controlled within the C/FO organization in order to promote Japanese animation. Bootlegging at the time was economically infeasible. However a growing divide in fandom between the "haves" and "have-nots" limited access to anime as a function of who you knew. In 1989 members began to accuse Patten of disloyalty for writing articles for general magazines rather than the perpetually behind schedule C/FO fanzine. However Patten felt that in writing for popular magazines he was furthering their cause to proselytize and promote anime. With no clear succession route left behind after Patten stepped down, the C/FO began to break apart, and eventually ceased to exist as a conglomerate in July 1989.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

===Early fansubs (1980s)===
The first known fansub documented at the Rising Sun chapter of the C/FO was in 1986 of a ''[[Lupin III]]'' episode produced on the [[Commodore Amiga]], marking the introduction of the formula for the process of fansubbing. However fansubbing was extremely expensive at this time (on the order of $4000 in 1986 and over one hundred hours). There were a few ventures into subtitling in the late 1980s; Leonard labels the fansub of the first two episodes of [[Ranma 1/2]] in May 1989 as the earliest, widely distributed fansub.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

===Distribution and playback (1990s, early 2000s)===
[[File:Fansubvhs.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A [[VHS]] tape from an internet fansub distributor]]
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, fansubs in electronic form were primarily distributed like VHS and Beta tapes: via mailed CD-Rs. Many fans did not have high speed Internet and were unable to download large files. Many of the early digital fansubs were made from regular tape subs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In the mid-2000s, most fansubs were distributed through IRC channels, [[file hosting service]]s and BitTorrent. In recent years most groups have shifted from using IRC to being primarily BitTorrent. BitTorrent trackers dedicated to anime fansub releases allow fans to easily find the latest releases, and individual fansub groups often use their own websites to inform fans of new releases. Because of an almost complete de-emphasis on CD-R and DVD-R distribution, file size standards are less frequently followed.

==Legal and ethical issues==
Hye-Kyung Lee, a lecturer at [[King's College London]], states that anime fansubber embody the general characteristics of fans described by John Fiske; fansubbers are motivated by strong affection for anime, devotion to sharing it with other fans, the sense of community interaction with their viewers, working together as a member of a group, and a strong desire to support the local animation industry by promoting anime culture and widening anime's accessibility. Lee describes fansubbers as involved in productive activities that enhance their knowledge of anime and improve their skills culminating in a final product.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/participatory-media-fandom-a-case-study-of-anime-fansubbing%28cbe6bb0d-e49b-4457-ba3f-68e701547f41%29.html |last=Lee |first=Hye-Kyung |title=Participatory media fandom: a case study of anime fansubbing |journal=Media Culture &amp; Society |date=November 2011 |volume=8 |pages=1131–1147 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the first anime club, Cartoon Fantasy Organization, and its subsequent chapters was to proselytize and promote anime. Sean Leonard and Lee agree that without fan distribution that began in 1976 till fansubbing 1993, the anime industry would not take off as it did in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; Some companies such as [[Protoculture Addicts]] with its titular magazine and [[Viz Media]] with ''[[Animerica]]'' drew their origins from anime club fanzines in the early history of fansubs.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;

Intellectual property lawyer Jordan Hatcher situates fansubs on the boundary between the desirable [[dojinshi]] fan culture and the "massive online file trading so vilified by the recording and motion picture industries". Legal scholar [[Lawrence Lessig]] states that the re-working of culture—remix—is necessary to cultural growth and points to doujinshi in Japan as an example of how permitting more remix can contribute to a vibrant cultural industry. However Hatcher states that fansubs do not match this type of remix because their aim is to remain faithful to the original. Furthermore, Hatcher states that fansubs compete with the original cultural product since they have the potential to replace the market need for official translations and thus resemble the debate over [[peer-to-peer]] file trading.&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt;

Hatcher states that copyright law does not condone fansubs. The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], international copyright treaty, states that its signatories—including Japan—grant authors exclusive right to translation. Hatcher states that fansubs could "potentially" be legal within Japan given the nature of Japan's domestic copyright laws, although the target audience of fansubs is the non-Japanese market. However Hatcher states that copyright law in the United States—the frame of reference for most online discussions of fansub legality—construes translations as derivative,&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt; and fansubs infringe on the author's right to prepare derivative works{{citation needed |date=August 2014}} and to reproduction by copying original source material.&lt;ref name="Hatcher appendix" /&gt;

Lee describes an unspoken rule in the fan community: "once the anime was licensed the fansubbed version should no longer be circulated".&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; As a result, many fansubbers do not view themselves as pirates.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Charles | title=File Share and Share Alike | work=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/arts/21solo.html?ex=1282276800&amp;en=91a6bf6f3813c78f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss |date=August 21, 2005 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the late 1980s, fans were for the most part unable to obtain anime through official means, and the few anime that were licensed were rewritten to a much lower quality that even outraged the Japanese creators. Fans such as [[Fred Patten]] attempted to obtain official consent; however, no series really proved commercially successful. Until sometime after 1989 when subtitling became affordable signalling the rise of both fansubbing and the domestic industry, bootlegging was not financially feasible. Sean Leonard distinguishes fansubs from bootlegs as fansubs following the unspoken rule in the fan community with the intent to promote anime whereas bootlegs aim to make a profit. Many fansubs began to include a "This is a free fansub: not for sale, rent, or auction" notice as a response to bootleggers, and would encourage viewers to buy official copies. [[Anime Expo]] in 1993 was the first time the US industry representatives began talking more publicly about pre-existing copies eating into profits.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt; For early fansubs due to the deteriorating nature of copying VHS tapes, official releases would be far superior in terms of visual quality, and thus there would be no competition between fansubs and official releases.&lt;ref name=Leonard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;

However, with the digital age at the start of 2000, each step of the fansubbing process was made easier and cheaper with a dramatic improvement to the visual standards of fansubs. Lee described English fansubbing as having been rapidly globalized over the years in terms of viewership. Lee states that it was the rise of peer-to-peer file sharing software ''[[BitTorrent]]'' that "put fansubbing on the map internationally". Lee states that while other language communities exist, the English language fansubbing community has the greatest pull. US publishers traditionally found fansubbing useful for testing demand and broadening their fanbase, whereas Japanese publishers treat fansubbing as something remote and insignificant.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; Lee states that some Japanese producers even praise fansubber's efforts at promoting their work overseas. However at the turn of the new millennium in the face of fans' demands for greater immediacy, temporal and spatial disparity in overseas licensing, English as the internationally preferred medium for fansubs, and the increasingly globalized membership of the English fansubbing community, fansubbing groups are becoming less and less willing to follow the unspoken rule. Some fansubbers state that they don't want to abandon the rest of the world because someone bought the [[DVD region code|region 1]] license.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;

Fans' attitudes also seem to have changed. With a lower barrier to entry, even the least dedicated can view anime with a few clicks. Newer fans also seem less willing to purchase or collect DVDs. Consequently, the anime industry's view of fansubbing has changed. US companies have begun blaming fansubbers for the decline in DVD sales.&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;

Henry Jenkins states that fansubbing has a positive impact on the anime industry through its function as publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jenkins, Henry | title=When Piracy becomes Promotion | work=Reason Magazine | url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/116788.html |date = December 2006|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the internet grew in availability and speed, fansub groups were able to host and distribute fansubs online easily. The advent of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] as opposed to [[IRC]] has been pointed to as a key ingredient in the current fansubbing scene.&lt;ref name="ANN Interview Fansubber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2008-03-11 |title=Interview With The Fansubber |publisher=Anime News Network |date=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that this prompted fans to ignore official releases altogether, and some websites started charging for easier downloading rates. Many anime shows make their debut outside of Japan's shores in electronic format, and it is rare that a popular anime will go without fansubs.&lt;ref name="ANN Interview Fansubber"/&gt;

Due to 4Kids' heavy editing of their properties and refusal to release untouched versions on DVD, some fansubbing groups continue to subtitle and release popular shows owned by the company such as ''[[Tokyo Mew Mew]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''. 4Kids attempted an uncut bilingual release of ''Shaman King'' and ''Yu-Gi-Oh'' in the mid-2000s, releasing a handful of volumes of each title in the format, but in an interview with ANN Alfred Kahn stated that "The market for them just isn't as large as the one for the cut version," pointing out that their sales might not have met 4Kids' needs or expectations to continue them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2005-04-24/alfred-r-kahn |title=Alfred R. Kahn |publisher=Anime News Network |date=April 24, 2005 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past market reactions have shown that time might be better spent petitioning 4Kids for a bilingual release, and supporting the uncut release of former 4Kids licenses like ''One Piece'', to show them there is a market for such titles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} An older example is ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', which was initially licensed by [[DiC]]. After fan demand showed there was a market for the title,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} uncut, unedited versions of the show, and Pioneer successfully release the ''Sailor Moon'' Movies in a subtitled VHS format in 1999, followed by dubbed versions and bilingual DVDs. This was quickly followed by the release of ''[[Sailor Moon S]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon Supers]]'', which both received complete unedited releases on VHS and DVD from [[Geneon]]. In 2003, the commercial subtitles of the first two seasons appeared, released by [[ADV Films]] under license by DIC, nearly completing the uncut release that many fans never believed would be possible (Prior to [[Viz Media]] obtaining the license, the final season of the original Sailor Moon Series "Sailor Stars" was not commercially released in the United States.).

There is a belief among some fans that an "unspoken agreement" exists between the fansubbers and Japanese copyright holders that fansubs help promote a product. Steve Kleckner of [[Tokyopop]] noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Frankly, I find it kind of flattering, not threatening[...] To be honest, I believe that if the music industry had used downloading and file sharing properly, it would have increased their business, not eaten into it. And, hey, if you get 2,000 fans saying they want a book you've never heard of, well, you gotta go out and get it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol2-4/hatcher.asp#sdendnote175anc|title=Of Otakus and Fansubs|author=Hatcher, Jordan|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This belief was challenged when in December 2004 [[Media Factory]], itself  a Japanese copyright holder, directly requested that its works be removed from download sites and since then numerous other companies such as [[Nippon TV]] have followed suit in the wake of the appearance of fansubs on [[YouTube]].

Recently, a few titles such as ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: Generations]]'' were prelicensed, meaning that they were released simultaneously in Japan and North America, in an effort to negate the need for fansubs. However, some fansubbing of such titles still occurs, as some people prefer fansubs over commercial releases.

Fansub opposers claim{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} that Japanese licensors have reportedly grown discontent with fansubbers because the ease of access with which their works are obtained has begun to affect foreign licensees' willingness to license a series, as evidenced by the Western market's sharp drop in new acquisitions in 2005. They also suggest{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} that anime fans in Japan have reportedly begun to turn to English fansubs which often appear days after a show's release, affecting sales in their home market. Indeed, Japanese companies have banded together to form JASRAC, a copyright holders' rights company, which has frequently taken YouTube to task for providing content which domestic Japanese viewers often use, which includes fansubs, as seen on their official site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasrac.or.jp/release/06/12_2.html|title=Press release|publisher=Jasrac.or.jp|accessdate=July 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing anti-fansub stance has been taken by US distributors, as seen in Geneon and ADV's comments at the State of the Industry Panel at Anime Boston,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animeondvd.com/forum/showtopic.php?tid/19708/tp/12/|title=Why do R1 companies suddenly hate us?|publisher=AnimeonDVD.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200506/http://animeondvd.com/forum/showtopic.php?tid%2F19708%2Ftp%2F12%2F|archivedate=2007-09-27|deadurl=yes|accessdate=July 19, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as recent comments by Matt Greenfield of ADV Films at Anime Central:

==Legal action==
In 1999, Ryuta Shiiki, a former representative of [[SPE Visual Works Inc.]] sent a letter to a fansub distribution group to take down the illegal copies of the anime [[Rurouni Kenshin]], because a company that was interested in the rights of said series notified the Japanese company about the illegal distribution of it. The group complied and the series was pulled from distribution. This is the first legal action via a [[cease-and-desist letter]] against a fansub in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/1999-01-20/digital-anime-distribution-threatened-by-letter-from-sony|title=Digital Anime Distribution threatened by letter from Sony|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Hideaki Hatta, president of [[Kyoto Animation]], sent a letter to a fansub group requesting the stop of illegal distribution of the anime OAV [[Munto]]. The fansub group complied and the distribution stopped. This is the first legal action via a cease-and-desist letter against the fansubbing of an anime title not available outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-11-28/japanese-request-fansub-removal|title=Japanese request Fansub Removal|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, time later, it was confirmed that [[Central Park Media]] licensed the title in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-11-30/munto-licensed|title=Munto Licensed?|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a fansubbing group known as Anime Junkies was involved in a conflict with the licensor and co-producer of  the [[Ninja Scroll: The Series|Ninja Scroll TV]], [[Urban Vision]]'s even provided the pitch to [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] to create the series. Urban Vision sent a letter asking for Anime Junkies to stop hosting the licensed material, but Anime Junkies did not comply with the request and responded negatively to Urban Vision. Christopher Macdonald, an editor at [[Anime News Network]], highlighted the ethics code of the fansubbing community and asked that fans not support Anime Junkies as a result of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2003-06-08/2 | title=Unethical Fansubbers | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=9 August 2013 | author=Macdonald, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2004, a [[Tokyo]] law firm representing Media Factory sent letters and e-mails to the anime [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] directory [[AnimeSuki]] and fansub groups Lunar Anime and Wannabe Fansubs requesting that they halt the fansubbing and hosting of all current and future fansubbing productions.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt; AnimeSuki and Lunar Anime complied, and shortly after, other fansub groups such as Solar and Shining Fansubs followed suit. Despite the request, Wannabe Fansubs and a handful of other fansubbing groups continued to produce fansubs of MFI anime series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Removal of Media Factory Inc.

On July 27th, 2006, the legal department representing the Spanish anime company [[SelectaVision|Selecta Visión]] sent a cease-and-desist letter to the anime BitTorrent and fansubbing site Frozen-Layer requesting the halt of the fansubbing and publishing all of current and prior anime licensed by the company. The owner complied and, until 2013, established that all licensed anime in Spain was banned from the site, regardless of the status of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.frozen-layer.com/foro/topic/87810-cambios-nuevos-en-el-tracker/|title=Cambios Nuevos En El Tracker - Frozen-Layer Web/Foro|work=Foro - Frozen-Layer|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, anime distributor [[Odex]] has been actively [[Odex's actions against file sharing|tracking down and sending legal threats]] against internet users in Singapore since 2007. These users have allegedly downloaded fansubbed anime via the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol. Court orders on [[ISP]]s to reveal subscribers' personal information have been ruled in Odex's favour, leading to several downloaders receiving letters of legal threat from Odex and subsequently pursuing out-of-court settlements for at least [[Singapore dollar|S$]]3,000 (US$2,000) per person, the youngest person being only 9 years old.&lt;ref name="aug2np"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,137645,00.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224936/http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,137645,00.html| archivedate=2007-09-30 |title=Parents get shock letter |first=Liew |last=Hanqing |publisher=[[The New Paper]] |date=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/rehashplus/post.htm?id=63000177 |title=Kicking kids for profit? |first=Michael |last=Tan |publisher=[[CNet]] Asia |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205113447/http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/rehashplus/post.htm?id=63000177 |archivedate=December 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions were considered controversial by the local anime community and have attracted criticisms towards the company, as they are seen by fans as heavy-handed.&lt;ref name="aug16sta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southeastasia.asp?parentid=76054 |title=Anime firm boss gets online death threats |first=Chua Hian |last=Hou |publisher=[[The Straits Times]] |date=August 16, 2007 |page=4 |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223020817/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southeastasia.asp?parentid=76054 |archivedate=December 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18th, 2007, [[Anime News Network]] reported that the police in [[Poland]] and [[Germany]] seized the fansubbing site Napisy.org arrested at least 9 people related to it. These raids were orchestrated by the [[Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry]] (ZPAV), a collective rights organisation, and German authorities shut the site which was hosted on servers in that jurisdiction. In May of 2013, that case was closed, as prosecutors decided to drop the charges due to the charged individuals' ignorance of the unlawfulness of their actions.

On May 19th, 2007, the Spanish organization Federación Anti Piratería (FAP) sent a cease-and-desist against the website Wikisubtitles.net and their website provider [[Bluehost]], requesting the closure of the site since the owners were profiting with the content of others, violating copyright laws. The webmaster complied and the site was closed..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.genbeta.com/web/imagen-de-la-semana-wikisubtitles-cerrado-por-la-fap|title=Imagen de la semana: Wikisubtitles cerrado por la FAP|last=Pimentel|first=Víctor|date=2008-05-19|access-date=2018-02-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705022554/http://smalleye.net/2008/05/19/wikisubtitles-cerrada-por-la-fap/|title=Cosas que nunca te dije - » Wikisubtitles cerrada por la FAP|date=2008-07-05|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bloguitar.net/noticias/otros-noticias/la-fap-cierra-wikisubtitles/|title=La F.A.P. cierra Wikisubtitles|date=2008-05-19|work=Bloguitar|access-date=2018-02-13|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the webmaster published the source-code of the website.

On September 21, 2016, the [[Kyoto Prefectural Police SC|Kyoto Prefectural Police]] in Japan arrested two Chinese company workers, Liang Wang and Wangyi Yang, on Wednesday on suspicion of violating the Japanese Copyright Act by uploading the anime series [[The Heroic Legend of Arslan|The Heroic Legend of Arslan: Dust Storm Dance]] and [[Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya|Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya Drei!!]] with Chinese subtitles. Both suspects admitted to the charge, and Yang claimed to be a member of a Chinese fansubbing group. This became the first known legal action against fansubbing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-09-28/kyoto-police-arrest-2-chinese-suspects-for-uploading-anime/.107007|title=Kyoto Police Arrest 2 Chinese Suspects for Uploading Anime|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 27th, 2016, the Kyoto Prefectural Police arrested two Chinese individuals on charges of violating the Japanese Copyright Act. The two suspects were both located in Tokyo. The first suspect is a 29-year-old male living in Edogawa ward. The second suspect is a 23-year-old male college student. According to police, the first suspect is accused of fansubbing episodes of the anime [[Saki (manga)|Saki: The Nationals]] in Chinese and uploading the subtitled episodes on a file sharing service. The second suspect allegedly subtitled a different anime in Chinese, and similarly used a file sharing service, but the report didn't mention the anime. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-10-28/2-chinese-men-arrested-in-japan-for-illegally-subtitling-uploading-anime/.108205|title=2 Chinese Men Arrested in Japan for Illegally Subtitling, Uploading Anime|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16th, 2017, the Kyoto Prefectural Police arrested a 26-year-old Chinese man on the charge of illegally subtitle the anime [[Ange Vierge]] in Chinese and distribute it through a file sharing software. Police allege that the man is a member of the group ''Jimaku Gumi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-17/man-arrested-in-japan-for-releasing-ange-vierge-anime-with-chinese-subtitles/.112367|title=Man Arrested in Japan for Releasing Ange Vierge Anime With Chinese Subtitles|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2017 a judge in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], declared fansubtitling illegal. The Dutch court declared that these translations correspond to the producers and no one else. In case they do not exist, they can not be created by fans. After this ruling, the creation of subtitles without the consent of the author of an audiovisual production is now considered a crime in the Netherlands. This is the first ruling in the world that values subtitles as intellectual property and that punishes with fines and imprisonment those who violate copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnnchile.com/noticia/2017/04/22/juez-declara-ilegales-los-subtitulos-de-peliculas-en-internet|title=Juez declara ilegales los subtítulos de películas en Internet|date=2017-04-22|work=CNN Chile|access-date=2018-02-06|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alfabetajuega.com/noticia/holanda-declara-ilegales-los-subtitulos-creados-por-fans-y-los-castigara-con-multas-y-carcel-n-83001|title=Holanda declara ilegales los subtítulos creados por fans y los castigará con multas y cárcel|work=Alfa Beta Juega|access-date=2018-02-06|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/unauthorized-subtitles-for-movies-tv-shows-are-illegal-court-rules-170421/|title=Unauthorized Subtitles For Movies &amp; TV Shows Are Illegal, Court Rules - TorrentFreak|date=2017-04-21|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31th, 2018, [[Sankei West]] and [[Asahi Shimbun]] reported that police departments from Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Shizuoka, Mie, and Shimane Prefectures in Japan, along with the [[Association of Copyright for Computer Software]] arrested four Chinese nationals for illegal fansubbing anime, manga and videogames. The suspects, who range in age from 23 to 28, are allegedly part of a translating group that distributed Chinese-translated manga, anime, and other materials online. The titles includes [[Yuki Ochimura ni Ojō-sama!]], [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]] and [[Kimi ni Todoke]]. The Association of Copyright for Computer Software reported that one of the suspects, a 23-year-old female company worker from Niiza City in Saitama Prefecture, translated the 123rd and final chapter of the manga Kimi ni Todoke. Police from Kanagawa, Ishikawa, Gifu, and Shiga Prefectures also worked on the case. This is the first known arrest regarding illegal manga translation in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASL105RDJL10PLZB011.html|title=日本の漫画など違法に翻訳　中国人の容疑者５人逮捕：朝日新聞デジタル|work=朝日新聞デジタル|access-date=2018-02-12|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sankei.com/west/news/180131/wst1801310098-n1.html|title=日本の漫画やゲーム、無断で翻訳…中国人の女２人逮捕　不正ネット公開組織「漢化組」メンバー|last=INC.|first=SANKEI DIGITAL|date=2018-01-31|work=産経WEST|access-date=2018-02-12|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.rocketnews24.com/2018/02/03/five-chinese-nationals-arrested-in-japan-for-translating-manga-games-for-distribution/|title=Five Chinese nationals arrested in Japan for translating manga, games for distribution|date=2018-02-03|work=SoraNews24|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slator.com/industry-news/arrested-for-translation-japan-detains-five-chinese-nationals-for-pirate-translation/|title=Arrested for Translation: Japan Detains Five Chinese Nationals for Pirate Translation {{!}} Slator|date=2018-02-06|work=Slator|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flow diverter''' is an endovascular [[prosthesis]] used to treat intracranial [[aneurysm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alderazi Yazan J. |author2=Shastri Darshan |author3=Kass-Hout Tareq |author4=Prestigiacomo Charles J. |author5=Gandhi Chirag D. | year = | title = Review Article: Flow Diverters for Intracranial Aneurysms | url = http://www.hindawi.com/journals/srt/2014/415653/ | journal = Stroke Research and Treatment | volume = 2014 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is placed in the aneurysm's parent artery, covering the neck, in order to divert blood flow and determine a progressive thrombosis of the sac.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pierot [http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/283978 "Flow diverter stents in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms: Where are we?"]. ''Journal of Neuroradiology'', Volume 38, n° 1, pages 40-46 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Flow diverting stents consist of structural [[Cobalt-chrome]] or [[Nitinol]] alloy wires and often a set of [[radiopaque]] wires woven together in a flexible braid. {{medical citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Medical usage==
Flow diverters are treatment for intracranial aneurysms alternative to endosaccular coil embolization (although the techniques can be combined, especially in large/giant aneurysms). It is mainly effective in wide neck unrupted [[saccular aneurysm]]s, that are difficult to coil because of the tendency of the coils to fill the parent artery (referred to as prolapse).  Another situation is [[:wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] shape or circumferential aneurysms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Guo S. |author2=Jiang P. |author3=Liu J. |author4=Yang X, |author5=Li Y. |author6=Wu Z. | year = 2017| title = A comparative study of CFD of canine model of common carotid fusiform aneurysm and vertebrobasilar fusiform aneurysm in human patients. | journal = International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology | volume = 37| issue = | pages = 32–40| pmid=28945061 | doi=10.23736/S0392-9590.17.03869-X}} &lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to flow diverters many intracranial aneurysms went untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alderazi|first1=Yazan J.|last2=Shastri|first2=Darshan|last3=Kass-Hout|first3=Tareq|last4=Prestigiacomo|first4=Charles J.|last5=Gandhi|first5=Chirag D.|date=2014|title=Flow Diverters for Intracranial Aneurysms|journal=Stroke Research and Treatment|volume=2014|pages=1–12|doi=10.1155/2014/415653}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 September 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks and complications==
The efficacy of flow diverters can be evaluated using a grading system developed by researchers at Oxford Neurovascular and Neuroradiology Research Unit (Kamran et al. 2011), commonly referred to as ''flow diverter grading system'' or ''Kamran grading system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kamran M. |author2=Yarnold J. |author3=Grunwald I.Q. |author4=Byrne J.V. | year = 2011 | title = Assessment of angiographic outcomes after flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms: a new grading schema | url = | journal = Neuroradiology | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 501–508 | doi = 10.1007/s00234-010-0767-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a cerebral flow diverter, patients are placed on dual antiplatelet therapy for an extended period of time to reduce the likelihood of peri-procedural and post-procedural thromboembolic complications. {{medical citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The degree of aneurysm occlusion is graded on a five-point scale from 0 (no change in the endoaneurysmal flow) to 4 (complete obliteration of the aneurysm). The patency status of the parent artery is evaluated on a three-point scale, from no change in the parent [[artery]] diameter  to parent artery occlusion. This grading system is used in clinical practice. It has also been used and adapted by researchers to evaluate and report the effectiveness of flow diverters in general.&lt;ref&gt;Darsaut, T.E., Bing, F., Makoyeva, A., Gevry, G., Salazkin, I., Raymond, J., 2013.

A '''glass electrode''' is a type of [[ion selective electrode|ion-selective electrode]] made of a doped glass membrane that is sensitive to a specific ion. The most common application of ion-selective glass electrodes is for the measurement of [[pH]].  The pH electrode is an example of a glass electrode that is sensitive to hydrogen ions.   Glass electrodes play an important part in the instrumentation for chemical analysis and physico-chemical studies.  The voltage of the glass electrode, relative to some reference value, is sensitive to changes in the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of certain type of ions.

== History ==

The first studies of glass electrodes (GE) found different sensitivities of different glasses to change of the medium's acidity (pH), due to effects of the alkali metal ions.

In 1906,  M. Cremer, the father of [[Erika Cremer]], determined that the electric potential that arises between parts of the fluid, located on opposite sides of the glass membrane is proportional to the concentration of acid (hydrogen ion concentration).&lt;ref&gt;Cremer, M. Über die Ursache der elektromotorischen Eigenschaften der Gewebe, zugleich ein Beitrag zur Lehre von Polyphasischen Elektrolytketten. — Z. Biol. 47: 56 (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909,  [[S. P. L. Sørensen]] introduced the concept of [[pH]], and in the same year [[Fritz Haber|F. Haber]] and [[Zygmunt Klemensiewicz|Z. Klemensiewicz]] reported results of their research on the glass electrode in The Society of Chemistry in [[Karlsruhe]]. &lt;ref&gt;First publication — The Journal of Physical Chemistry by [[Wolfgang Ostwald|W.

In 1922, W. S. Hughes showed that the alkali-silicate GE are similar to hydrogen electrode, reversible with respect to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hughes, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 44, 2860. 1922; J. Chem. Soc. Lond., 491, 2860. 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925,  [[Phyllis Margaret Tookey Kerridge|P.M. Tookey Kerridge]] developed the first glass electrode for analysis of blood samples and highlighted some of the practical problems with the equipment such as the high resistance of glass (50–150 megohms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derangedphysiology.com/main/core-topics-intensive-care/arterial-blood-gas-interpretation/Chapter%201.1.2/history-glass-electrode |title=History of the Glass Electrode |last1=Yartsev |first1=Alex |date= |website=Deranged Physiology |publisher= |access-date=26 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her PhD, Kerridge developed the miniature glass electrode, maximizing the surface area of the tool by heat treating the platinum with platinum chloride at red heat, thus enabling a much larger signal; her design was the predecessor of many of the glass electrodes used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inventricity.com/#!phyllis-kerridge/c5ic |title=Phyllis Kerridge And The Miniature Ph Electrode  |last1=Blake-Coleman |first1=Barrie |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Inventricity |publisher= |access-date=26 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kerridge |first=Phyllis Margaret Tookey |date=1925 |title=The Use of the Glass Electrode in Biochemistry |url=http://www.biochemj.org/content/ppbiochemj/19/4/611.full.pdf |journal=Biochemical Journal |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=611–617 |doi=10.1042/bj0190611  |access-date=23 June 2016 |pmid=16743549 |pmc=1259230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Glass electrodes are commonly used for [[pH-meter|pH measurements]]. There are also specialized ion sensitive glass electrodes used for determination of the concentration of lithium, sodium, ammonium, and other ions. Glass electrodes have been utilized in a wide range of applications including pure research, control of industrial processes, analysis of foods and cosmetics, measurement of environmental indicators, and microelectrode measurements such as cell membrane electrical potential and soil acidity.

== Types ==

Almost all commercial electrodes respond to single charged [[ion]]s, like H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The most common glass electrode is the [[pH]]-electrode. Only a few [[chalcogenide glass]] electrodes are sensitive to double-charged ions, like Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and some others.

There are two main glass-forming systems: [[silicate]] matrix based on molecular network of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with additions of other metal oxides, such as Na, K, Li, Al, B, Ca, etc. and [[chalcogenide]] matrix based on molecular network of AsS, AsSe, AsTe.

== Interfering ions ==
[[Image:Zilverchloridereferentie- en PH-glaselektrode.jpg|right|thumb|100px|A [[silver chloride]] reference electrode (left) and glass pH electrode (right)]]
Because of the [[ion-exchange]] nature of the glass membrane, it is possible for some other ions to concurrently interact with ion-exchange centers of the glass and to distort the linear dependence of the measured electrode potential on pH or other electrode function. In some cases it is possible to change the electrode function from one ion to another. For example, some silicate pNa electrodes can be changed to pAg function by soaking in a silver salt solution.

Interference effects are commonly described by the semiempirical [[Boris Nikolsky|Nicolsky]]-Eisenman equation (also known as [[Boris Nikolsky|Nikolsky]]-Eisenman equation),&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Hall, ''Ion-Selective Membrane Electrodes: A General Limiting Treatment of Interference Effects'', J. Phys. Chem '''100''', 7230 - 7236 (1996) [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jpchax/1996/100/i17/abs/jp9603039.html article]&lt;/ref&gt; an extension to the [[Nernst equation]]. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E=E^0 + \frac{RT}{z_iF} \ln \left [ a_i + \sum_{j} \left ( k_{ij}a_j^{z_i/z_j} \right ) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the emf, ''E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;'' the [[standard electrode potential]], ''z'' the ionic valency including the sign, ''a'' the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]], ''i'' the ion of interest, ''j'' the interfering ions and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the selectivity coefficient. The smaller the selectivity coefficient, the less is the interference by ''j''.

To see the interfering effect of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to a pH-electrode:
:&lt;math&gt;E=E^0 + \frac{RT}{F} \ln \left ( a_{\text{H}^+} + k_{\text{H}^+,\text{Na}^+}a_{\text{Na}^+} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

== Range of a pH glass electrode ==
{{norefs|section|date=July 2018}}
The pH range at constant [[concentration]] can be divided into 3 parts:
[[Image:PH graph.jpg|thumb|300 px|Scheme of the typical dependence E (Volt)&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;pH for [[ion-selective electrode]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}]]
* Complete realization of general electrode function, where potential depends linearly on pH, realizing an [[ion-selective electrode]] for [[hydronium]].
:&lt;math&gt;E=E^0 + \frac{2.303RT}{F} \text{pH}&lt;/math&gt;
where F is Faraday's constant (see [[Nernst equation]]).
* Alkali error range - at low concentration of [[hydrogen ion]]s (high values of pH) contributions of interfering [[alkali metal]]s (like Li, Na, K) are comparable with the one of hydrogen ions. In this situation dependence of the potential on pH become non-linear.
The effect is usually noticeable at pH&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;12, and concentrations of lithium or sodium ions of 0.1&amp;nbsp;moles per litre or more. Potassium ions usually cause less error than sodium ions.
* [[Acid]]ic error range – at very high concentration of hydrogen ions (low values of pH) the dependence of the electrode on pH becomes non-linear and the influence of the [[anion]]s in the solution also becomes noticeable. These effects usually become noticeable at pH&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;-1.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- possible vandalism by an anonymous user adding a negative sign to this pH value: pH measurements below pH = 1 are very rare and certainly below pH = 0. Please, help checking this controversial assertion. However, it is what is indicated in the figure illustrating this section! So, the previous change should be assumed as being made in good faith. Question: is this figure correct? --&gt;

Specialized electrodes exist for working in extreme pH ranges.

==Construction==
{{norefs|section|date=July 2018}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[PH meter]] --&gt;
[[Image:Glass electrode scheme 2.svg|thumb|Scheme of typical pH glass electrode.]]
A typical modern pH probe is a combination electrode, which combines both the glass and reference electrodes into one body. The combination electrode consists of the following parts (see the drawing):

# a sensing part of electrode, a bulb made from a specific glass
# internal electrode, usually [[silver chloride electrode]] or [[Saturated calomel electrode|calomel electrode]]
# internal solution, usually a pH=7 [[Buffer solution|buffered]] solution of 0.1 [[molar solution|mol/L]] KCl for pH electrodes or 0.1&amp;nbsp;mol/L MCl for pM electrodes
# when using the [[silver chloride electrode]], a small amount of AgCl can precipitate inside the glass electrode
# reference electrode, usually the same type as 2
# reference internal solution, usually 0.1&amp;nbsp;mol/L KCl
# junction with studied solution, usually made from [[ceramic]]s or capillary with [[asbestos]] or quartz fiber.
# body of electrode, made from non-conductive glass or plastics.

The bottom of a pH electrode balloons out into a round thin glass bulb.  The pH electrode is best thought of as a tube within a tube.  The inner tube contains an unchanging 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; mol/L [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] solution.  Also inside the inner tube is the cathode terminus of the reference probe.  The anodic terminus wraps itself around the outside of the inner tube and ends with the same sort of reference probe as was on the inside of the inner tube.  It is filled with a reference solution of [[potassium chloride|KCl]] and has contact with the solution on the outside of the pH probe by way of a porous plug that serves as a [[salt bridge]].

==Galvanic cell schematic representation==
This section describes the functioning of two distinct types of electrodes as one unit which combines both the glass electrode and the reference electrode into one body. It deserves some explanation.

This device is essentially a [[galvanic cell]] that can be schematically represented as:

&lt;br /&gt;
:Glass electrode || Reference Solution || ''Test Solution'' || Glass electrode
:Ag(''s'') | AgCl(''s'') | KCl(''aq'') || 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;M H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solution || glass membrane || ''Test Solution'' ||  junction || KCl(''aq'') | AgCl(''s'') | Ag(''s'')

In this schematic representation of the galvanic cell, one will note the  symmetry between the left and the right members as seen from the center of the row occupied by the "Test Solution" (the solution whose pH must be measured). In other words, the glass membrane and the ceramic junction occupies both the same relative place in each respective electrode (indicative (sensing) electrode or reference electrode). The double "pipe symbol" (||) indicates a diffusive barrier that prevents (glass membrane), or slowing down (ceramic junction), the mixing of the different solutions. By using the same electrodes on the left and right, any potentials generated at the interfaces cancel each other (in principle), resulting in the system voltage being dependent only on the interaction of the glass membrane and the test solution.

The measuring part of the electrode, the glass bulb on the bottom, is coated both inside and out with a ~10&amp;nbsp;nm layer of a hydrated [[gel]].  These two layers are separated by a layer of dry glass.  The silica glass structure (that is, the conformation of its atomic structure) is shaped in such a way that it allows [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions some mobility.  The metal cations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the hydrated gel diffuse out of the glass and into solution while H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from solution can diffuse into the hydrated gel.  It is the hydrated gel, which makes the pH electrode an ion-selective electrode.

H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; does not cross through the glass membrane of the pH electrode, it is the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which crosses and allows for a change in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  When an ion diffuses from a region of activity to another region of activity, there is a free energy change and this is what the pH meter actually measures.  The hydrated gel membrane is connected by Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and thus the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on the outside of the membrane is 'relayed' to the inside of the membrane by Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

All glass pH electrodes have extremely high [[electric resistance]] from 50 to 500 MΩ. Therefore, the glass electrode can be used only with a high input-impedance measuring device like a [[pH meter]], or, more generically, a high input-impedance voltmeter which is called an [[electrometer]].

==Storage==
Between measurements any glass and membrane electrodes should be kept in a solution of its own ion.  It is necessary to prevent the glass membrane from drying out because the performance is dependent on the existence of a hydrated layer, which forms slowly.

A '''handheld television''' is a [[portable device]] for watching [[television]] that usually uses a [[thin-film transistor|TFT]] [[LCD]] or [[OLED]] [[color graphics|color]] display.  Many of these devices resemble [[handheld]] [[transistor radio]]s.

==History==
[[File:Sony watchman fd210.jpg|thumb|Sony Watchman]]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, [[Panasonic]] and [[Sinclair Research]] released the first TVs which were small enough to fit in a large pocket; called the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001 and [[MTV-1]].  Since [[LCD]] technology was not yet mature at the time, the TV used a minuscule [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] which set the record for being the smallest CRT on a commercially marketed product.

Later in 1982, [[Sony]] released the first model of the [[Sony Watchman|Watchman]], a [[pun]] on [[Walkman]].  It had grayscale video at first.  Several years later, a color model with an [[Active-matrix liquid crystal display|active-matrix]] LCD was released.  Some [[smartphone]]s integrate a television receiver, although Internet broadband video is far more common.

Since the switch-over to digital broadcasting, handheld TVs have reduced in size and improved in quality.{{dubious|reason=See talk page|date=August 2018}}{{cn|date=August 2018}} The major current manufacturers of [[DVB-T]] standard (common throughout Europe) handheld TVs are August International, ODYS and Xoro.

==Hardware==
[[File:Pocket Television CRT.svg|thumb|Elements of a pocket television CRT: (1) Recessed Screen, (2) Electron Beam, (3) Electron Gun]]
These devices often have stereo 1⁄8 inch (3.5 mm) [[phono plug]]s for [[composite video]]-analog mono audio relay to serve them as [[composite monitor]]s; also, some models have mono 3.5 mm jacks for the broadcast signal that is usually relayed via [[F connector]] or [[Belling-Lee connector]] on standard television models. 

Some include [[HDMI]], [[USB]] and [[Secure Digital|SD]] ports.

Screen sizes vary from {{convert|1.3|to|5|in}}.  Some handheld televisions also double as portable [[DVD player]]s and [[digital video recorder|USB personal video recorders]].

==Size==
'''Portable televisions''' cannot fit in a pocket, but often run on batteries and include a [[cigarette lighter receptacle]] plug.

'''Pocket televisions''' fit in a pocket.

'''Wearable televisions''' sometimes are made in the form of a [[wristwatch]].

==Notable brands and models==
* [[August International]] - DA100C
* [[ODYS]] - LIVE
* [[Xoro]] - HSD7790
* [[RCA]] - DPTM70R

[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb| ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60, by [[William Bell Scott]] illustrates the rise of coal and iron working in the Industrial Revolution and the heavy engineering projects they made possible.]]
The '''Industrial Age''' is a period of history that encompasses the changes in economic and social organization that began around 1760 in Great Britain and later in other countries, characterized chiefly by the replacement of hand tools with power-driven machines such as the power loom and the steam engine, and by the concentration of industry in large establishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/210a/readings/temin1.pdf Two Views Of The British Industrial Revolution], Peter Temin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/industrial+revolution|title=Industrial-revolution - Define Industrial-revolution at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is commonly believed that the Industrial Age was supplanted by the [[Information Age]] in the late 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/5-Myths-About-the-Information/127105/|title=5 Myths About the 'Information Age'|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view that has become common since the [[Revolutions of 1989]], as of 2013 electric power generation is still based mostly on [[fossil fuels]] and much of the [[Third World]] economy is still based on [[manufacturing]]. Thus it is debatable whether we have left the Industrial Age already or are still in it and in the process of reaching the Information Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senscot.net/view_prof.php?viewid=4353|title=Human beings have never before lived in a condition where our actions today literally affect people|work=senscot.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Huge changes in agricultural methods made the Industrial Revolution possible. This agricultural revolution started with changes in farming in the Netherlands, later developed by the British.

The Industrial [[mining]] from places such as [[Wales]] and [[County Durham]].

The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain because it had the factors of production, land (all natural resources), capital, and labor. Britain had plenty of harbors that enabled trade, Britain had access to capital, such as goods and money, for example, tools, machinery, equipment, and inventory. Britain, lastly, had an abundance of labor, or industrial workers in this case. There are many other conditions that help show why the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. The British Isles and colonies overseas represented huge markets that created a large demand for British goods. Britain also had one of the largest [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] due to its massive [[Royal Navy|navy]] and [[Merchant navy|merchant marine]]. The British government's concern for commercial interests was also important. 
The [[steam engine]] allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the [[Industrial Revolution]] had spread to [[Continental Europe]] and [[North America]], and since then it has spread to most of the world.

==The Textile Industry==

The cotton industry was the first industry to go through [[mechanization]], the use of automatic machinery to increase production. The [[Putting-out system|domestic system]] sprouted as a result of when businesses began importing raw cotton, employing spinners and weavers to make it into cloth from their home. Jarry Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which could produce eight times as much thread as a single spinning wheel, and [[Richard Arkwright]] made it driven by water. Later Arkwright opened a spinning mill which marked the beginning of the [[factory system]]. In 1785 [[Edmund Cartwright]] invented a loom which was powered by water.

==Steam Engines==

In 1712 [[Thomas Newcomen]] produced the first successful [[steam engine]], and in 1769 [[James Watt]] patented the modern steam engine. As a result, steam replaced water as industry's major power source.

The [[steam engine]] allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the [[Industrial Revolution]] had spread to [[Continental Europe]] and [[North America]], and since then it has spread to most of the world.

The Industrial Age is defined by [[mass production]], [[broadcasting]], the rise of the [[nation state]], [[Energy industry|power]], [[modern medicine]] and [[running water]]. The quality of human life has increased dramatically during the Industrial Age. Life expectancy today worldwide is more than twice as high as it was when the Industrial Revolution began.

'''Keneth Alden Simons''' (March 10, 1913 – June 11, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;''Marquis Who's Who on the Web,'' accessed 1/10/2011; ''Marquis Who's Who on Demand,'' accessed 4/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[electrical engineer]] best known for his pioneering contributions to the technical development of [[cable television]] in the United States, for the most part as chief engineer for the [[Jerrold Electronics|Jerrold Electronics Corporation]]. Jerrold was one of the first manufacturers of [[cable television]] equipment and also constructed entire cable systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick Parsons, ''Blue Skies: A History of Cable Television'', Temple University Press, 2008, p. 68-69, 113-115, and Brian Lockman and Don Sarvey, ''Pioneers of Cable Television: The Pennsylvania Founders of an Industry'', McFarland, 2005, p. 62-84, for Jerrold's importance to the early history of the cable television industry. Lockman and Sarvey quote Simons' oral history in telling the [[Milton Shapp]]/Jerrold story.&lt;/ref&gt; Simons designed one of the first converters and the two most important pieces of the early test equipment, the Model 704 Field Strength Meter and Model 900 Sweep Frequency Generator.  He also authored a seminal technical handbook on cable television systems, and served on national and international engineering standards committees. Fellow cable engineer Archer Taylor stated that Simons was seen as the leading technical expert at Jerrold for over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Archer S. Taylor, ''History Between Their Ears: Recollections of Pioneer CATV Engineers'', The Cable Center, 2000, p. 44. Taylor was the interviewer for Simons' oral history, and his section on Simons, p. 40-46, is largely based on that oral history.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Simons' interest in radio began at an early age, and he obtained his amateur radio license (callsign W3UB) in 1930. Simons started his career as a radio troubleshooter for RCA in 1932 in Camden, and worked for RCA while he attended college. In 1938 he graduated from the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]],with distinction&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania. One Hundred and Eighty-Second Commencent for the Conferring of Degrees, Municipal Auditorium, Wednesday, June the Fifteenth, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; and recipient of the A. Atwater Kent Prize in Electrical Engineering] (see [[Atwater Kent Museum of Philadelphia]])&lt;ref&gt;Student awards from the Moore School.&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a [[television]] field engineer for [[RCA]]. On one occasion in 1939 he and another field engineer installed a television set in the honeymoon cottage of movie stars [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]], and Simons showed her how to operate it.&lt;ref&gt;Barco Library, The Hauser Oral and Video History Collection, The Cable Center.  Interview with Keneth Simons, Feb. 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Simons helped run the {{YouTube|UmCl9e84UJg|RCA television exhibit}} at the [[1939 World’s Fair]]. In the summer of 1940 he was sent by RCA to run the [[public address]] system and make recordings of speeches on the campaign train of [[Wendell Willkie]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for president that year.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.S. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 he was a radio engineer for WCAU in Philadelphia, broadcasting live concerts over the radio. From 1942 until 1946 he was the chief instructor for the RCA Signal Corps School. Along with teaching operation and repair of various devices, he wrote  instruction manuals on oscilloscope use &lt;ref&gt;Simons, K. ''Understanding Oscilloscope Patterns.'' RCA Signal Corps School. Philadelphia, PA 1943&lt;/ref&gt; and synchronous motors.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Ordnance and Bureau of Ships (U.S. Navy) publication (Ordnance Pamphlet No. 1303) dated December 15, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1946 and was the chief television instructor at Central Radio School until 1948. Simons then worked for Sylvania for about a year developing television tuners and an indoor antenna. In 1952 he formed a partnership to design and manufacture direct-coupled oscilloscopes. Due to lack of funding, they ultimately were not produced.&lt;ref&gt;Chronology and job titles from Marquis Who's Who and "Resume of Keneth A. Simons," in Simons biographical file, Barco Library, The Cable Center&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jerrold years ==

[[File:KenethASimonsWorkbench1968.jpg|thumb|alt=Keneth Alden Simons at his Jerrold Electronics workbench in the 1960s|Keneth Alden Simons At His Jerrold Electronics Workbench in the 1960s (Click to enlarge)]]Simons began at Jerrold Electronics Corporation as a part-time consulting engineer in 1951. His first project was to design a high-to-low [[frequency converter]]. He and other Jerrold engineers worked out of Simons' personal laboratory located on the second floor of a stained glass factory in Bryn Athyn, Pa., until a new Jerrold lab was built in Hatboro, Pa., in 1955. Simons characterized his role at Jerrold in his resume: "Three of us were primarily responsible for equipment design in the early years. Donald Kirk was talented in coming up with new ideas, my contribution was often in getting a system to work, and Henry Arbeiter took all the bright ideas and made them producible."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Simons resume&lt;/ref&gt;  Other engineering colleagues included Eric Winston, Mike Jeffers, Frank Ragone, Caywood Cooley, Vic Nicholson, Len Ecker, and Bill Felsher.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simons successively became chief engineer, chief test equipment engineer, vice president and director of advanced development.  Some of his noteworthy designs include the Model 704B Field Strength Meter. In a technology area based on rapid and  constant change, the 704B  was of note in being in production and use for more than 20 years &lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, G. From workhorse to icon. The 704 Jerrold Field Strength Meter, ''CED Magazine,'' November/December 2004, p. 42,.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 704 name is honored even today in a fraternal organization of its users [https://web.archive.org/web/20080310144919/http://lo704.com/ ''The Loyal Order of the 704''], commemorating the meter’s defining role in cable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedmagazine.com/articles/2012/11/memory-lane-a-signal-of-what-would-come Schley, S.The 704 remains locked in the cable industry’s memory ''CED Magazine'', 11/19/2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Simons also designed its successor, the Model 727 Field Strength Meter; the Model 900 and Model 1015 Sweep Frequency Generators, and the Model SCA 213 Distributed [[Amplifier]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Operation Moonwatch==

As part of the [[International Geophysical Year]], the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] set up a national network of amateur-run observation stations to track the early Russian artificial satellites, [[Sputnik|Sputniks I and II]], [[Operation Moonwatch]]. As a member of his local Moonwatch group [http://siarchives.si.edu/findingaids/FA10-004.htm Moonwatch group], he made use of a unique radio-based [[Doppler effect|Doppler tracking system]] he designed to enhance the accuracy of his team’s sightings.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, K. Tracking Sputniks I and II with Operation Moonwatch. ''IRE Almanack,'' Philadelphia, Feb. 1958, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last years ==

Simons retired from Jerrold in 1976. He then served as a consultant for a number of cable industry manufacturers until 1989, and then for the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1990.

In February 1992, Simons was interviewed by [[Archer Taylor]] covering a broad range of topics from his life in cable television. The [http://cablecenter.org/s-listings/keneth-simons.html Audio and Transcript] of the interview are now archived in the oral histories maintained by [http://cablecenter.org/ The Cable Center].

Simons had originally patented a [[directional coupler]], U.S. Patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=hXFZAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 3,048,798], filed December 24, 1959, that had defined this key component for cable-based distribution of television. Now, 35 years later, he designed another coupler unit, U.S  Patent  [http://www.google.com/patents?id=tqMkAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5,461,349], filed Oct. 17, 1994, a wide-band bidirectional coupler.  He expanded on its concept with a proposal for a contemporary bidirectional hybrid copper and optical [[cable television headend]], with a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and privacy capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Simons K. Supercharging the traditional cable plant. ''CED Communication Engineering &amp; Design.’’ August 1994, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The  final innovation he worked on involved getting back together with a friend he had first worked with when both were in college, the distinguished biophysicist [[Britton Chance]].&lt;ref&gt;Benaron et al. Celebrating Britton Chance ‘’J Biomedical Optics’’ 2000 5:115.&lt;/ref&gt; “In BC’s group meeting on every Saturday, he invited his friend Ken Simons (retired from RCA lab) to teach us circuits and electronics.”&lt;ref&gt;Chen,Y. [http://www.med.upenn.edu/biocbiop/chance/reflections/chen.html  ''A Personal Reflection on my Ph.D. Advisor Dr. Britton Chance'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Chance’s group wanted to construct an [[optical tomography]]-based replacement for the standard [[MRI]].  Simons collaborated in this effort, attempting to use [[phase modulation]] of the illuminating [[laser]] to more efficiently measure [[hemoglobin]] [[deoxygenation]] in body tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Weng, K, Zhang, MZ, Simons K, Chance, B. Measurement of biological tissue metabolism using phase modulation spectroscopic technology. ''Proceedings of the SPIE, Section on Time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging of tissues'', Vol. 1431, 1991, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Chance later wrote:

''A Boon to Medicine''

I appreciated the June 15 obituary of Keneth Simons. However, not only was he a contributor to cable television but he volunteered his unique knowledge to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in developing optical imaging systems for the detection of breast cancer and brain function. This deep knowledge and facile handiwork made possible the perfection of devices that are now the focus of new types of medical devices that make possible non-invasive and highly sensitive detection of brain function, muscle function and cancer detection.
Simons will be long remembered for his generous and far-reaching knowledge of electronic circuits.

==Honors==

In addition to the list of memberships and committee assignments
Simons was an invited participant at a variety of standards-setting meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, K. ‘’Relating transfer impedance to [[coaxial cable]] radiation, ’’Proceedings of the 23rd International Wire and Cable Symposium, Sponsored by U.S. Army Electronics Command, Atlantic City, New Jersey, December 3,4 and 5, 1974, pp. 152-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simons, K. ‘’The evolution of CATV equipment in the USA.’’  Estratto Dagli Atti Ufficiali Del XXI Congresso Scientifico Internationale Per L’electronica, Marzo 1974, Roma.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Cable Television Association (NCTA) named Simons "CATV Engineer of the Year" in 1965, and he served on NCTA's Ad Hoc Committee on Technical Standards and their Engineering Subcommittee.&lt;ref&gt;"Profile of a Leader: Keneth Alden Simons," ''CATV'' [weekly trade magazine], November 25, 1968, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 NCTA presented Simons with the "Technical Achievement Award" (now the "Vanguard Award for Science &amp; Technology").&lt;ref&gt;The NCTA website lists all of the past award winners http://2011.thecableshow.com/Attending/VanguardAwards/Categories#Science&lt;/ref&gt;

Simons was awarded the first [[IEEE]] Delmer Ports Award, in 1978 at IEEE’s annual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;''C-ED Communications-Engineering Digest'' June 1978, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was characterized in the award as a legend in the [[CATV]] industry and credited for his role in developing [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association|NCTA]] technology.  He was credited as responsible for NCTA noise interference standards and for the measurement of distortion components.  His ''Technical Handbook for CATV Systems'' was characterized as an indispensable sourcebook on the technical aspects of CATV and for many years the best tutorial available on performance and measurement in CATV.

A '''library card''' can refer to several cards traditionally used for the management of books and patrons in a [[library]]. In its most common use, a library card serves similar functions as a [[membership card]]. A person who holds a library card has borrowing or other privileges associated with the issuing library. The library card also serves as a method of identification. When a person chooses an item to borrow and presents their library card to the library, they take responsibility for the borrowed item and promise to abide by certain rules, usually including a promise to return the item by the due date or face a [[library fine]]. If the cardholder violates these responsibilities, their borrowing privileges may be suspended. As of 2011, 62% of all Americans are library cardholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of 1 January 2011 Harris Poll Quorum|url=http://www.ala.org/research/sites/ala.org.research/files/content/librarystats/2011harrispoll.pdf|publisher=Harris Interactive|accessdate=27 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215143501/http://www.ala.org/research/sites/ala.org.research/files/content/librarystats/2011harrispoll.pdf|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Library card" may also refer to the ''borrowing cards'' used to record book borrowing before the advent of computer systems. When a library book was prepared for lending, a borrowing card would be inserted into a small pocket in the front or back cover of the book. When a patron borrowed a book, their name and the book's due date would be recorded on the borrowing card, which would be filed under the patron's name or card number. The borrowing card would be replaced with a stamped due date card to inform the patron of the item's due date. The book was then released to the patron. When the book was returned, the patron's name would be crossed off the borrowing card. The borrowing card would be placed back in the book and the book would be shelved. In some libraries, this system of borrowing may still be in use.

{{eastern name order|Kozma László}}
'''László Kozma''' ([[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], 28 November 1902 − [[Budapest]], Hungary, 9 November 1983) was a Hungarian electrical engineer, designer of the first Hungarian [[digital computer]] (1957), a full member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Due to the regulations of [[numerus clausus]] his application to the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technology]] was rejected in 1921, and he started to work as an electrician. Between 1925 and 1930 he studied at the [[Brno University of Technology]], where he graduated as an electrical engineer in 1930, then was hired by the [[Antwerpen]] office of the  [[ITT_Inc.|International Telephone &amp; Telegraph company]] to design automated [[telephone switchboard]]s and [[analog computer|electromechanical computer]]s. He moved back to Hungary in 1942, but in 1944 he was deported to the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]]. He returned in August 1945 in a very poor physical state, then worked for a Hungarian electrical company, Standard Electrical Co. as designing engineer. He was arrested by the communist government in 1949, and sentenced to 15 years in the show trial called Standard Gate. He was rehabilitated and released from prison in 1954 and taught as a professor at the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] between 1955 and 1972.

His main researches were in the field of automatization of [[telephone]] technology, but he is more notable for the first Hungarian [[digital computer]] (called MESZ–1) what he designed and created between 1955 and 1957. He was a corresponding (1961), then a full member (1976) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1110">The '''Mark 26 nuclear bomb''' was related to the [[Mark 21 nuclear bomb|Mark 21]]. Development of the Mk-26 started on 1 September 1954. At the end of July 1955 the design of the Mk-21 was released for production, while the design for the Mk-26 was not. The "Clean" Mk-21C which was tested in the [[Operation Redwing|Redwing Navajo]] shot did not interest the [[US Air Force]], or [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]]. As the decision not to pursue the "clean" Mk-21 closely coincided with the decision to terminate development of the Mk-26 in April 1957, it is possible that Mk-26 was the designation for the clean version of the Mk-21.

A '''mop''' (such as a '''floor mop''') is a mass or bundle of coarse strings or yarn, etc., or a piece of cloth, sponge, or other absorbent material, attached to a pole or stick. It is used to soak up liquid, for [[Floor cleaning|cleaning floors]] and other surfaces, to mop up dust, or for other cleaning purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mop|title=Mop - Definition of mop by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word (then spelled ''mappe'') is attested in English as early as 1496, but new refinements and variations of mop designs have been introduced, from time to time.

A '''dry mop''' or '''dust mop''' is designed to pick up dry, loose contamination such as dust, earth, and sand from the surface of the floor. It consists of yarn and/or [[microfiber]] and is used as a first step in cleaning a floor.
[[File:Mop.png|thumbnail|A mop]]
Professional dry mops consist of a flat sheet of [[microfiber]] textile or sheets with a surface of looped yarn, usually about {{Convert|15|cm|0|abbr = on}} wide, and comes in variable lengths (usually {{Convert|30|-|100|cm|0|abbr = on}}).

The dry mop can in many instances replace a broom and has the ability to hold a limited amount of dust or sand within itself. The heads of dry mops are often removable and can be washed and replaced when saturated with dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choosing the right mop for the job|url=http://www.clean4less.co.uk/choosing-the-right-mop|website=Clean4less Janitorial Supplies|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is using a vacuum cleaner to suck surface dust away from the mop; however, this is much more limited in its effectiveness.

Single-use dry mops are also available and widely sold.

===Wet-mop, moist-mop===
A '''wet mop''' or '''moist mop''' is, in professional cleaning, used as in the second step in the cleaning of a surface. The wet mop is swept over the surface to dissolve and absorb fat, mud and dried-in liquid contaminations. Professional wet mops consist of a flat sheet of microfiber textile or a sheet with a surface of looped yarn (which might contain microfiber as well), usually about {{Convert|15|cm|0|abbr = on}} wide, and come in various lengths (usually {{Convert|30|-|100|cm|0|abbr = on}}).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mops for pre-moisting===
[[Image:Mop, manual pre-wetting of mops in bucket.jpg|thumb|Manual pre-moisting of wet-mops in bucket]]
Professional flat mops are made for pre-moisting. Mops are pre-impregnated with an ideal amount of water mixed with an appropriate amount of detergent. This means that the cleaner does not need to bring any additional water on the cleaning trolley. This ideal amount is often recommended by the manufacturer in terms of weight percent of water per weight of the dry mop, for example "175% water per weight of the dry mop".

Mops for pre-moisting are flat sheets of (often [[microfiber]]) textile, usually about {{Convert|15|cm|0|abbr = on}} wide, and comes in variable lengths (usually {{Convert|30|-|100|cm|0|abbr = on}}). Mops for pre-moisting are fastened on a handle with a flat pad mount with the aid of velcro or a pouch on the mop, in which the pad on the handle fits.

Pre-moisting can be done with a special washing machine or by hand by simply folding and packing the mops tight in a container and pouring the measured amount of water over them. The mops will then need about 5–10 minutes for the liquid to distribute evenly in their tissue before use. This offers some advantages:
* The cleaner does not have to have a bucket of water with him/her when sweeping the floor, but simply carries an appropriate number of mops. This means the weight of the equipment can often be kept lower.
* The risk of over-wetting the floor and leave puddles is eliminated if the wetness is ideal.

===Hot mop===
The ''hot mop'' (or steam mop) follows a similar concept to a [[Iron (appliance)|steam iron]]. After adding water, the water is heated to make it exude on top of a floor, which can then be cleaned without using a cleaning solvent. These can work best on surfaces where a regular mop would also be used, such as bare floors, hearths, and laminate.

===Syntho-mop===
A ''syntho-mop'' such as the [[Scooba (brand)|Scooba]] is not considered a mop, because even though it performs the same function as a traditional mop, the lack of hand operation makes it ineligible for status as a mop.

===Microfiber mop===
Microfiber mops are constructed of a blend of polyester and polyamide fibers which are “split” and formed into a single fiber. This blend consists of 70-90% polyester that serves as the scrubbing and cleaning fiber and 10–30% polyamide which performs as the holding and quick drying fiber. This blend is usually expressed as a ratio on the label of the mop, e.g. an 80% polyester and 20% polyamide blend would be labeled as "80/20".

==Handles and mounting==
A mop handle consists of a long piece of wood or aluminium tubing fitted with a specific mount for the mop. The handle can be attached for mounting a mop on it by means of:

* clamp
* hanger (with strands doubled over the hanger)
* plastic claws (attached to the strands)
* pouch (as with many professional flat mops)
* screwing (as with the classic yarn mop)
* velcro (as with many professional flat mops)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Traditional construction==
In her book ''Maggie's Memories'' Margaret Wadkin (late of [[Hickling, Nottinghamshire|Hickling]], near [[Melton Mowbray]] in England) describes the use of a mop nail for constructing homemade mops from old pieces of cloth during her village childhood in the early 20th century. "The mop nail was made by the blacksmith (if there are any still around, they will be antiques). This nail was several inches long with a point at the end and a flat head a couple or so inches wide. We would stand the nail on its flat head, cut pieces of old material into squares and push over the sharp end of the nail and when enough fix a piece of leather, then push the sharp point into the mop stale or handle. There was a knack of twisting these mops over the wrist to swish away surplus water, every woman could use one of these useful mops."&lt;ref&gt;''Maggie's Memories: Childhood Memories of Hickling''. Privately published memoirs.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mr. Steven''''' is the ship intended as a landing platform for the [[SpaceX]] reusable rocket [[Payload fairing|payload fairings]]. The ship is fitted with four large arms which support an elevated horizontal net, similar to a giant trampoline or trapeze net. It is named after Steven Miguez, the father of SeaTran CEO Blake J. Miguez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wattles |first1=Jackie |title=SpaceX's latest launch and recovery attempt: We explain it all |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/31/technology/spacex-fairing-recovery-explained/index.html |website=CNNMoney |accessdate=3 October 2018 |date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fairing reuse ==
{{main|SpaceX reusable launch system development program#Fairing reuse}}
[[File:Cofia Falcon 9 TESS 03.jpg|Two SpaceX payload fairings before launch|thumb]]
As a part of the [[SES-10]] mission in March 2017, SpaceX successfully performed a controlled landing of the [[payload fairing]] for the first time. SpaceX was able to recover a fairing half after it landed, aided by [[Attitude control thruster|attitude-control thrusters]] and a [[steerable parachute]], gently on water.{{r|sn20170330|verge20170330}} The company announced its intent to land the fairings on a dry flexible structure, jokingly described by [[Elon Musk]] as a "floating [[bouncy castle]]", with the goal of reusing the fairings.{{r|floridatoday_26216836069515264}}

The bouncy castle idea led to a fast [[platform supply vessel]] named ''Mr. Steven'' which has a net strung between large arms. ''Mr. Steven'' is equipped with a [[dynamic positioning]] system and was first tested after the launch of the [[Paz (satellite)|Paz]] satellite from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in February 2017.&lt;ref name=techcrunch20180220&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=SpaceX to use a net boat called ‘Mr. Steven’ to recover next rocket&amp;nbsp;fairing|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/20/spacex-to-use-a-net-boat-called-mr-steven-to-recover-next-rocket-fairing/|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=TechCrunch|date=February 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf-20180225"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baylor|first1=Michael|title=SpaceX’s Mr. Steven, the FSV fairing catcher – NASASpaceFlight.com|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/spacexs-mr-steven-fsv-fairing-catcher/|accessdate=February 26, 2018|work=NASASpaceFlight.com|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was not fully successful because the fairing missed the boat by a few hundred meters but landed safely in the water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=966692641533390848 |date=22 Feb 2018 |title=Missed by a few hundred meters, but fairing landed intact in water. Should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down descent. }}&lt;/ref&gt; before being recovered and taken back to port.{{r|nsf-20180225}} {{asof|2018|08}}, all four attempts by SpaceX to land a fairing on the recovery ship have failed, despite fitting ''Mr. Steven'' with larger nets before the July 2018 attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bartels |first1=Meghan |title=SpaceX Lands Rocket in Harshest Conditions to Date and Attempts to Catch Fairing |url=https://www.space.com/41273-spacex-launch-iridium-satellites-harsh-weather.html |website=Space.com |publisher=Purch |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wall |first1=Mike |title=SpaceX Gives Nose-Cone-Catching Boat 'Mr. Steven' a Bigger Net |url=https://www.space.com/41168-spacex-boat-mr-steven-bigger-net.html |website=Space.com |publisher=Purch |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, to practice recovery outside mission situations, SpaceX started to perform drop tests of a fairing half from a helicopter into ''Mr. Steven's'' net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-mr-steven-helicopter-drop-test-practice/|title=SpaceX's Mr. Steven returns with Falcon fairing half in net after drop test practice|website=www.teslarati.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a fairing is about $6 million which accounts for 10 percent of overall launch costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Stephen |title=New photos illustrate progress in SpaceX’s fairing recovery attempts – Spaceflight Now |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/06/01/new-photos-illustrate-progress-in-spacexs-fairing-recovery-attempts/ |website=spaceflightnow.com |publisher=Pole Star Publications Ltd |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modifications==
In July 2018, ''Mr. Steven'' was upgraded to fit a broader net with an area of {{cvt|3700|m2|acres}}, four times the original net size.{{r|netSize}} The upgrade included fitting four new arms, which are each supported and positioned by two extendable shock-absorbing booms.{{r|teslaRati2}} Each arm can be removed and disassembled into six subsections.{{r|TeslaRati}} These four shock-absorbing arms replaced the previous rigid arms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6561">'''Multiplex polymerase chain reaction''' (Multiplex PCR) refers to the use of [[polymerase chain reaction]] to amplify  several different DNA sequences simultaneously (as if performing many separate PCR reactions all together in one reaction).  This process [[DNA replication|amplifies]] [[DNA]] in samples using multiple [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] and a temperature-mediated [[DNA polymerase]] in a [[thermal cycler]]. The primer design for all primers pairs has to be optimized so that  all primer pairs can work at the same annealing temperature  during PCR.

Multiplex-PCR was first described in 1988 as a method to detect deletions in the [[dystrophin]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Nucleic Acids Research |title=Deletion screening of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus via multiplex DNA amplification |vauthors=Chamberlain JS, Gibbs RA, Ranier JE, Nguyen PN, Caskey CT |year=1988 |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=11141–11156 |pmc=339001 |pmid=3205741 |doi=10.1093/nar/16.23.11141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used with the [[steroid sulfatase]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Screening for steroid sulfatase (STS) gene deletions by multiplex DNA amplification |journal=Human Genetics |vauthors=Ballabio A, Ranier JE, Chamberlain JS, Zollo M, Caskey CT |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=571–573 |year=1990 |pmid=2338343 |doi=10.1007/BF00210812|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/47626/1/439_2004_Article_BF00210812.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, multiplex-PCR was used for analysis of [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s and [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hayden MJ, Nguyen TM, Waterman A, Chalmers KJ |title=Multiplex-ready PCR: a new method for multiplexed SSR and SNP genotyping |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=9 |pages=80 |year=2008 |pmid=18282271 |pmc=2275739 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplex-PCR consists of multiple primer sets within a single PCR mixture to produce [[amplicon]]s of varying sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. By targeting multiple sequences at once, additional information may be gained from a single test run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes, i.e., their base pair length, should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by [[gel electrophoresis]].  Alternatively, if amplicon sizes overlap, the different amplicons may be differentiated and visualised using primers that have been dyed with different colour fluorescent dyes. Commercial multiplexing kits for PCR are available and used by many forensic laboratories to amplify degraded DNA samples.

'''Neil Gallagher''' (born 1982/1983) is a [[Gaelic football]] player. He plies his trade with [[Glenswilly GAA|Glenswilly]] and played inter-county for [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]], usually at midfield from 2004 until his retirement in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/gallagher-retirement-a-sad-day-for-donegal-35467398.html |title=Gallagher retirement a 'sad day' for Donegal|date=20 January 2017|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other accolades, he has two [[List of All Stars Awards winners (football)|All Star]]s to his name (2012 and 2014), one [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] ([[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|2012]]), three [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]]s ([[2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2011]], [[2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2012]] and [[2014 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2014]]) and one [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] ([[2007 National Football League (Ireland)|2007]]). He captained Donegal to the National Football League title in 2007.

==Playing career==
===Youth===
Educated at [[Saint Eunan's College]] in [[Letterkenny]], he warmed the bench during the College's 2000 McLarnon Cup victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sainteunans.com/|title=Twitter feed|work=Saint Eunan's College|quote=EunansFootball Best of luck 2our past pupils who r in Donegal panel v Cork in All Ire Semi-Final on Sun @neilgerardgalla [[Michael Murphy (Gaelic footballer)|@murphm95]] @AntoinMcFadden @Tommyk_91 @BrickMolloy [[Rory Kavanagh|@123kav]] [[Kevin Rafferty (Gaelic footballer)|@kevin_raff]] [[Gary McFadden|@gmacfadden14]] [[Michael Boyle (Gaelic footballer)|@mdboyler24]] +[[Colm McFadden|Mr McFadden]] #TheCollege}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Foley|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/local-sport/forward-thinking-mcfadden-1-4247035|title=Forward thinking McFadden|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|publisher=Johnston Press|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012|quote=When McFadden was a Leaving Cert student in 2000, no St Eunan's team had won the competition, which is considered the undercard to the MacRory Cup in Ulster, since 1979.  “It was always a massive thing in the school and they hadn't won it for years,” he recalls. “Rory Kavanagh was on that team and Neil Gallagher was a sub. Looking back, it was strange that it was even B football as the standard was very good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club===
Gallagher was part of the Glenswilly team that won the [[2011 Donegal Senior Football Championship]] (his team's first County Championship at senior level). Glenswilly defeated [[C.L.G. Naomh Mícheál|Naomh Mícheál]] by 1-8 to 0-9 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/murphy-magic-proves-key-as-glenswilly-secure-first-donegal-crown-2893919.html|title=Murphy magic proves key as Glenswilly secure first Donegal crown|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his second Donegal Senior Football Championship with Glenswilly in [[2013 Donegal Senior Football Championship|2013]], scoring a goal in the final against [[C.L.G. Na Cealla Beaga|Killybegs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/donegal-sfc-final-murphy-follows-up-ireland-heroics-by-firing-glenswilly-to-county-glory-29676305.html|title= Murphy follows up Ireland heroics by firing Glenswilly to county glory|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=21 October 2013|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team had a successful Ulster campaign, advancing to the final of the 2013 [[Ulster Senior Club Football Championship]], where they lost to [[Ballinderry Shamrocks GAC|Ballinderry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2013/1201/490279-glenswilly-v-ballinderry/|title=Ballinderry 1-13 Glenswilly 2-06|work=RTÉ Sport|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=1 December 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://donegalnow.com/sp/article_manager/detail/live_glenswilly_v_ballinderry_shamrocks_ulster_senior_club_final|title=Live: Glenswilly v Ballinderry Shamrocks Ulster senior club final|work=Donegal Now|date=1 December 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-county===
Gallagher was first called up to the senior team by [[Brian McEniff]] for winter training in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keys|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/royals-seal-of-approval-puts-pressure-on-boylan-194946.html|title=Royals' seal of approval puts pressure on Boylan|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=5 November 2003|accessdate=5 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut for Donegal in 2004. That year his team made it to the Ulster final but were defeated by [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]]. 2005 was unsuccessful. Donegal reached the 2006 Ulster Senior Football Championship Final and he played in that match at [[Croke Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/5153174.stm|title=Donegal 0-09 1-09 Armagh|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=9 July 2006|accessdate=9 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he was part of the Donegal team that won the county's first National Football League title. They defeated [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/6581961.stm|title=Donegal win National League title|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=22 April 2007|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the caption that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaltimes.com/2007/04_2/sport.html|title=Donegal achieve historic win - First national league title comes to county after victory over Mayo|work=Donegal Times|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=25 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412230842/http://www.donegaltimes.com/2007/04_2/sport.html|archivedate=12 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Glenswilly teammate [[Ciaran Bonner]], he was dropped by manager [[John Joe Doherty]] over a breach of discipline ahead of the [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] qualifier game against [[Carlow GAA|Carlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2009/0702/251391-donegal/|title=Donegal duo dropped for discipline breach|work=RTÉ Sport|publisher=RTÉ|date=2 July 2009|accessdate=2 July 2009|quote=Ciaran Bonner and Neil Gallagher have been dropped from the Donegal football panel for a breach of discipline ahead of Saturday’s All-Ireland qualifier against Carlow in Ballybofey.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a linchpin of the Donegal midfield during the [[Jim McGuinness]] managerial era, winning his first Ulster title in 2011. He won his second in 2012. He was then part of the Donegal team that reached the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]]. He scored a point against [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] at [[Croke Park]] as Donegal claimed the [[Sam Maguire Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2012/0923/338702-live-all-ireland-football-finals/|title=Live updates from the All-Ireland finals at Croke Park|work=RTÉ Sport|publisher=RTÉ|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also started for Donegal in the [[2014 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]].

Injuries prompted him to announce his retirement from inter-county football at the age of 33 on 20 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highlandradio.com/2017/02/20/donegal-midfielder-neil-gallagher-to-retire-from-inter-county-football/|title=Donegal Midfielder Neil Gallagher to retire from inter-county football|date=20 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220222249/http://www.highlandradio.com/2017/02/20/donegal-midfielder-neil-gallagher-to-retire-from-inter-county-football/|archivedate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business venture==
In conjunction with teammate [[Michael Murphy (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Murphy]], Gallagher opened the sports store "Michael Murphy Sports and Leisure" in Letterkenny in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Foley|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/gaelic-games/michael-murphy-sports-and-leisure-opens-its-doors-in-letterkenny-1-6243064|title=Michael Murphy Sports and Leisure opens its doors in Letterkenny|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|publisher=Johnston Press|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Less than a week after the [[2014 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]], Gallagher attended the [[2014 Ryder Cup]] in [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldaily.com/2014/09/26/jimmys-still-swinging-matches-at-the-ryder-cup/|title=Jimmy's still swinging matches at the Ryder Cup!|work=Donegal Daily|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of heat-to-electricity schemes have been proposed: [[Rankine cycle]], [[Brayton cycle]], [[Stirling cycle]], [[thermoelectrics|thermoelectric]] (including [[graphene]]-based thermal power conversion&lt;ref&gt;Technology Review, March 5, 2012: ''[http://www.technologyreview.com/view/427140/graphene-battery-turns-ambient-heat-into-electric-current/ Graphene Battery Turns Ambient Heat Into Electric Current]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Reports, Aug. 22, 2012: ''[http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130311/srep01383/full/srep01383.html Graphene-based photovoltaic cells for near-field thermal energy conversion]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MIT News, Oct. 7, 2011: ''[http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2011/graphene-thermoelectric-1007 Graphene shows unusual thermoelectric response to light]''&lt;/ref&gt;), [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]], [[thermophotovoltaic]], [[thermionic converter|thermionic]] and [[magnetohydrodynamic]] type [[thermoelectric materials]].

==Possible uses==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
One of the more practical schemes is a variant of a [[pebble bed reactor]].  It would use a high mass-flow [[nitrogen]] coolant near normal atmospheric pressures.  This would take advantage of highly developed conventional [[gas turbine]] technologies.  The fuel for this reactor would be highly enriched, and encapsulated in low-[[boron]] [[graphite]] balls probably 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  The graphite serves to slow, or moderate, the [[neutron]]s.

This style of reactor can be designed to be inherently safe.  As it heats, the graphite expands, separating the fuel and reducing the reactor's criticality.  This property can simplify the operating controls to a single valve throttling the turbine.  When closed, the reactor heats, but produces less power.  When open, the reactor cools, but becomes more critical and produces more power.

The graphite encapsulation simplifies refueling and waste handling. Graphite is mechanically strong, and resists high temperatures.  This reduces the risk of an unplanned release of radioactives.

Since this style of reactor produces high power without heavy castings to contain high pressures, it is well suited to power spacecraft.

==Research==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Research in nuclear propulsion began with studies for nuclear thermal propulsion, where the reactor heated a propellant (usually hydrogen) that was allowed to expand through a nozzle. This was essentially an ordinary chemical rocket with the nuclear reaction replacing chemical combustion as the rocket's heat source. Because the reactor could supply more heat to the propellant than chemical combustion, higher exhaust velocities, i.e., higher [[specific impulse]]s, were possible. See KIWI, [[NERVA]]. The reports at the time{{When|date=July 2015}} (and since) indicated that keeping the system light would require high-temperature, densely packed designs, such as fast metal-cooled reactors or hexagonal pin fueled, high temperature gas-cooled reactors. In the past several decades the attention has turned to using the nuclear reactor to drive a turbine to produce electricity, which is used to create a plasma which is accelerated. See [[Project Prometheus]]. The present best of tech is the [[SAFE-400]], which uses a 400&amp;nbsp;kW thermal reactor and a gas turbine (called a closed [[Brayton cycle]]) to produce electric power. Heat rejection is kept low-mass using advanced heat pipe systems (such as are now used in some laptop computers for cooling as well).  Safety comes from ruggedness{{Vague|date=March 2014}}, proper shielding, control pins and spoiler pins&lt;!-- What the heck are control pins and spoiler pins? --&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2014}} inside the reactor which arrest the reaction.

The key elements to NEP, as they are being pursued today are:
# A compact reactor core
# A gas turbine or [[Stirling engine]] used as an electric generator
# A compact heat rejection system such as heat pipes
# An electric power conditioning and distribution system
# A high [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric power propulsion system]] based on [[Ion thruster|plasma propellants]]

The SAFE-400 is the current best of tech for items 1–3. Item 4 is common to all spacecraft. Some examples of thrusters that might be suitable for this are [[VASIMR]], [[DS4G]] and [[pulsed inductive thruster]] (PIT). PIT and VASIMR are unique in their ability to trade between power usage, specific impulse (a measure of efficiency, see [[specific impulse]]) and thrust in-flight. PIT has the additional advantage of not needing the power conditioning system between itself and the electric generators.

==Other types of nuclear power in space==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
{{main|Nuclear power in space|Nuclear propulsion|Nuclear pulse propulsion}}
Nuclear electric propulsion is a field that is distinct from other space nuclear power areas, such as radioisotope systems (including [[radioisotope thermoelectric generators]], [[radioisotope heater unit]]s, [[radioisotope piezoelectric generator]]s &amp; the [[radioisotope rocket]] - all of which use the heat from a static radioactive source (usually [[Plutonium-238]]) for a low level of electric or direct propulsion power), a [[nuclear thermal rocket]] (energy is used to heat the liquid hydrogen propellant), direct nuclear (fission products from a nuclear reaction directly propel the rocket), [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] (nuclear explosions propel the rocket), or space based [[nuclear fusion]] systems, either a [[fusion rocket]], or some as-yet theoretical or unproven experimental fusion technology.

'''Overengineering''' (or '''over-engineering''') is the act of designing a product to be more robust or have more features than necessary for its intended use, or for a process to be unnecessarily complex or inefficient.

Overengineering is often done to increase a [[factor of safety]], add function, or overcome perceived design flaws that most users would accept. Overengineering can be desirable when safety or performance is critical (e.g. in aerospace vehicles), or when extremely broad functionality is required (e.g. diagnostic tools), but it is generally criticized in terms of [[value engineering]] as wasteful of resources such as materials, time and money. As a [[design philosophy]], it is the opposite of the [[minimalist]] ethos of "less is more" and a violation of the [[KISS principle]].

Overengineering generally occurs in high-end products or specialized markets. In one form, products are ''overbuilt'' and have performance far in excess of expected normal operation (a city car that can travel at 300&amp;nbsp;km/h, or a home video recorder with a projected lifespan of 100 years), and hence are more expensive, bulkier, and heavier than necessary. Alternatively, they may become ''overcomplicated'' &amp;ndash; the extra functions may be unnecessary, and potentially reduce the [[usability]] of the product by overwhelming [[end user]]s.

Overengineering can decrease the [[productivity]] of the design team because of the need to build and maintain unwanted features.

A related issue is [[market segmentation]] &amp;ndash; making different products for different market segments. In this context, a particular product may be more or less suited (and thus considered over- or under-engineered) for a particular market segment.

== Cultural references ==
A story about very precise engineering is given in the 1858 story ''[[s:The Deacon's Masterpiece|The Deacon's Masterpiece or, the Wonderful "One-hoss Shay": A Logical Story]]'' by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], which tells of a carriage ([[one-horse shay]])
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;That was built in such a logical way
It ran a hundred years to a day,
And then,
...
went to pieces all at once, --
All at once, and nothing first, --
Just as bubbles do when they burst.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because it had been engineered so that no single piece failed first – no piece was over-engineered relative to the others, and they thus all collapsed at the same time.

A similar quote by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] claimed "the perfect [[Auto racing|race car]] crosses the finish line in first place and immediately falls into pieces."{{Citation needed|reason=Need reliable source to confirm Porsche said this.|date=March 2018}}

A modern example is [[Juicero]], a wi-fi "smart" juicing press. But after its release, [[Bloomberg News]] published a story that showed that the juice packs could be squeezed by hand faster than the press, and that hand-squeezing produced juice that was indistinguishable in quantity and quality from the output of the machine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/silicon-valley-s-400-juicer-may-be-feeling-the-squeeze|title=Silicon Valley’s $400 Juicer May Be Feeling the Squeeze|date=2017-04-19|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''paper shredder''' is a mechanical device used to cut [[paper]] into either strips or fine particles. Government organizations, businesses, and private individuals use shredders to destroy private, [[confidentiality|confidential]], or otherwise sensitive documents. 

==Invention==
The first paper shredder is credited to prolific inventor [[Abbot Augustus Low]], whose patent was filed on February 2, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Abbot Augustus Low [http://www.google.com/patents?id=BLZCAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Waste-paper receptacle] February 2, 1909 Patent filing&lt;/ref&gt; His invention was however never manufactured.

Adolf Ehinger's paper shredder, based on a hand-crank pasta maker, was manufactured in 1935 in Germany. Supposedly he needed to shred his anti-Nazi propaganda to avoid the inquiries of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woestendiek|first1=John|title=The Compleat History of SHREDDING|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-10/entertainment/0202110302_1_paper-shredders-papyrus-thereof|accessdate=22 February 2017|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=February 10, 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822084311/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-10/entertainment/0202110302_1_paper-shredders-papyrus-thereof|archivedate=22 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehinger later marketed his shredders to government agencies and financial institutions converting from hand-crank to electric motor.  Ehinger's company, EBA Maschinenfabrik, manufactured the first cross-cut paper shredders in 1959 and continues to do so to this day as EBA Krug &amp; Priester GmbH &amp; Co. in [[Balingen]].

==History of use==
Until the mid-1980s, it was rare for paper shredders to be used by non-government entities. 

A high-profile example of their use was when the U.S. embassy in Iran used shredders to reduce paper pages to strips before [[Iran hostage crisis|the embassy was taken over in 1979]], but some documents were reconstructed from the strips, as detailed below.

After Colonel [[Oliver North]] told Congress that he used a Schleicher cross-cut model to shred [[Iran-Contra]] documents, sales for that company increased nearly 20 percent in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966794,00.html?promoid=googlep |title=Business notes office equipment |publisher=Time |date=1988-02-29 |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930115604/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966794,00.html?promoid=googlep |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paper shredders became more popular among U.S. citizens with [[privacy]] concerns after the 1988 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[California v. Greenwood]]''; in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside of a home. Anti-burning laws also resulted in increased demand for paper shredding.

More recently, concerns about [[identity theft]] have driven increased personal use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Identity Theft|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/about-identity-theft.html|work=US FTC website|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520060906/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/about-identity-theft.html|archivedate=2009-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the US Federal Trade Commission recommending that individuals shred financial documents before disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting Back Against Identity Theft|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/idtheft/idt01.shtm|work=US FTC website|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528001302/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/idtheft/idt01.shtm|archivedate=2009-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information privacy laws like [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act|FACTA]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] are driving shredder usage, as businesses and individuals take steps to securely dispose of confidential information.

== Types ==
[[File:ShredderScissors.jpg|thumb|Multi-cut [[scissors]] used to shred paper]]
Shredders range in size and price from small and inexpensive units designed for a certain amount of pages, to large units used by commercial shredding services that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and can shred millions of documents per hour. While the very smallest shredders may be hand-cranked, most shredders are  electrically powered.

Shredders over time have added features to improve the shredder user's experience. Many now reject paper that is fed over capacity to avoid jams; others have safety features to reduce risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Paper Shredder Safety Alert | publisher = U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission | date = 11 June 2007 | url = http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/5127.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081122052637/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/5127.pdf | archivedate = 22 November 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/shredder.asp |title=Paper Shredder Danger |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shredders designed for use in shared workspaces or department copy rooms have noise reduction.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

=== Mobile shredding truck ===
Larger organisation or shredding services sometimes use "mobile shredding trucks", typically constructed as a [[box truck]] with an industrial-size paper shredder mounted inside and space for storage of the shredded materials. Such a unit may also offer the shredding of  [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[hard drive]]s, [[credit card]]s, and uniforms, among other things.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

=== Kiosks ===
A ''shredding kiosk'' is an [[automated retail]] machine (or [[kiosk]]) that allows public access to a commercial or industrial-capacity paper shredder. This is an alternative solution to the use of a personal or business paper shredder, where the public can use a faster and more powerful shredder, paying for each shredding event rather than purchasing shredding equipment.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

=== Services ===
Some companies [[outsource]] their shredding to ''shredding services''. These companies either shred on-site, with mobile shredder trucks or have off-site shredding facilities. Documents that need to be destroyed are often placed in locked bins that are emptied periodically.
[[File:Shredding Console.jpg|thumbnail|Shredding console]]

==Shredding method, and output==
As well as size and capacity, shredders are classified according to the method they use; and the size and shape of the shreds they produce. 

*'''''Strip-cut''''' shredders use rotating knives to cut narrow strips as long as the original sheet of paper. 
*'''''Cross-cut''''' or '''''[[confetti]]-cut''''' shredders use two contra-rotating drums to cut rectangular, parallelogram, or [[lozenge]] (diamond-shaped) shreds.
*'''''Particle-cut''''' shredders create tiny square or circular pieces.
*'''''Cardboard''''' shredders are designed specifically to shred corrugated material into either strips or a mesh pallet.
*'''''Disintegrators''''' and ''granulators'' repeatedly cut the paper at random until the particles are small enough to pass through a mesh.
*'''''Hammermills''''' pound the paper through a screen.
*'''''Pierce-and-tear''''' shredders have rotating blades that pierce the paper and then tear it apart.
*'''''Grinders''''' have a rotating shaft with cutting blades that grind the paper until it is small enough to fall through a screen.

[[File:Shreddedlottoticket.jpg|thumb|The shredded remains of a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] play slip.]]

===Security levels===
There are a number of standards covering the security levels of paper shredders, including:

====[[DIN]] - Deutsches Institut für Normung====

The previous DIN 32757 standard has now been replaced with DIN 66399. This is complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New times, new storage media, new standards|url=http://www.hsm.eu/en/products/shredding/document-shredder/new-din-66399/|publisher=http://www.hsm.eu/|accessdate=22 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125956/http://www.hsm.eu/en/products/shredding/document-shredder/new-din-66399/|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be summarized as below:
*Level P-1 = ≤ 2000&amp;nbsp;mm² particles or ≤ 12&amp;nbsp;mm wide strips of any length (For shredding general internal documents)
*Level P-2 = ≤ 800&amp;nbsp;mm² particles or ≤ 6&amp;nbsp;mm wide strips  of any length
*Level P-3 = ≤ 320&amp;nbsp;mm² particles or ≤ 2&amp;nbsp;mm wide strips of any length (For highly sensitive documents and personal data subject to high protection requirements)
*Level P-4 = ≤ 160&amp;nbsp;mm² particles with width ≤ 6&amp;nbsp;mm
*Level P-5 = ≤ 30&amp;nbsp;mm² particles with width ≤ 2&amp;nbsp;mm
*Level P-6 = ≤ 10&amp;nbsp;mm² particles with width ≤ 1&amp;nbsp;mm (Espionage-safe, for extremely high demands of security such as military or government departments)
*Level P-7 = ≤ 5&amp;nbsp;mm² particles with width ≤ 1&amp;nbsp;mm

====[[NSA]]/[[Central Security Service|CSS]]====
* The United States [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service|CSS]] produces the "NSA/CSS Specification 02-01 for High Security Crosscut Paper Shredders". 
* They provide a list of evaluated shredders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA/CSS EVALUATED PRODUCTS LIST for HIGH SECURITY CROSSCUT PAPER SHREDDERS|url=https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/media-destruction/assets/files/epl-18-may-2015.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223041648/https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/media-destruction/assets/files/epl-18-may-2015.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction of evidence==
There have been many instances where it is alleged that documents have been improperly or illegally destroyed by shredding, including:

* [[Oliver North]] shredded documents relating to the [[Iran–Contra affair]] between November 21 and November 25, 1986.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Lawrence|title=Vol. I: Investigations and prosecutions|work=Final report of the independent counsel for Iran/Contra matters|publisher=Independent Council for Iran/Contra Matters|date=August 4, 1993|url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/|accessdate=15 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417230304/http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/|archivedate=17 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, North testified that on November 21, 22, or 24, he witnessed [[John Poindexter]] destroy what may have been the only signed copy of a presidential covert action finding that sought to authorize CIA participation in the November 1985 [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk missile]] shipment to Iran.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;
 
* According to the report of the [[Paul Volcker Committee]], between April and December 2004, [[Kofi Annan]]'s ''Chef de Cabinet'', Iqbal Riza, authorized thousands of United Nations documents shredded, including the entire chronological files of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] during the years 1997 through 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportMar2005.pdf |title=Interim Report March 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805032019/http://www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportMar2005.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] used paper shredders to destroy evidence that their company owned property stolen from [[Jews]] during the [[Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]] government. The shredding was disclosed to the public through the work of [[Christoph Meili]], a security guard working at the bank who happened to wander by a room where the shredding was taking place. Also in the shredding room were books from the German [[Reichsbank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Eizenstat, Stuart | year = 2003 | title = Imperfect Justice | ISBN=1-58648-110-X | publisher = PublicAffairs | place = New York}} Page 94&lt;/ref&gt; They listed stock accounts for companies involved in the holocaust, including [[BASF]], [[Evonik Industries|Degussa]], and [[Degesch]].&lt;ref&gt;Eizenstat p 94, 95&lt;/ref&gt; They also listed real-estate records for Berlin properties that had been forcibly taken by the Nazis, placed in Swiss accounts, and then claimed to be owned by UBS.&lt;ref&gt;Eizenstat p 95&lt;/ref&gt; Destruction of such documents was a violation of Swiss laws.&lt;ref name="ch96-434"&gt;Swiss parliament: ''[http://search.parlament.ch/cv-geschaefte?gesch_id=19960434 Parliamentary Initiative 96.434: Bundesbeschluss betreffend die historische und rechtliche Untersuchung des Schicksals der infolge der nationalsozialistischen Herrschaft in die Schweiz gelangten Vermögenswerte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226144023/http://search.parlament.ch/cv-geschaefte?gesch_id=19960434 |date=2008-02-26 }}''; in German.

== Unshredding and forensics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stasi]] --&gt;
[[File:Shredded 1979-09-01 1305Z CIA cable from American Embassy Tehran.jpg|thumb|An example of a shredded and reassembled document during [[Iran hostage crisis]]]]

In theory shredded documents should not be able to be reassembled and read. In practice the feasibility of this depends on, (a) how well the shredding has been done, and (b) the resources put into reconstruction. The [[cost benefit analysis]] will depend on whether it is a simple personal matter, [[corporate espionage]], a criminal matter - or if [[national security]] is at stake.

Factors making reconstruction more likely include not only the cutting method, but also the orientation of the material when fed, and whether the shredded material is further randomized afterwards. Even without a full reconstruction, in some cases useful information can be obtained by forensic analysis of the paper, ink, and cutting method.

===Reconstruction examples===
{{wikisource|Documents Seized from the US Embassy in Tehran}}
* After the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the takeover of the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] in 1979, Iranians enlisted local carpet weavers who reconstructed the pieces by hand. The recovered documents would be later released by the Iranian government in a series of books called "Documents from the US espionage Den".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dānishjūyān-i Musalmān-i Payraw-i Khaṭṭ-i Imām, Dānishjūyan-i Musalmān-i Payraw-i Khaṭṭ-i Imām | title = Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den | publisher = Published by Muslim Students Following the Line of the Iman | year = 1980 | url = https://archive.org/details/DocumentsFromTheU.s.EspionageDen | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131018143837/http://archive.org/details/DocumentsFromTheU.s.EspionageDen | archivedate = 2013-10-18 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The US government subsequently improved its shredding techniques by adding pulverizing, pulping, and chemical decomposition protocols.

* Modern computer technology considerably speeds up the process of reassembling shredded documents. The strips are scanned on both sides, and then a computer determines how the strips should be put together. Robert Johnson of the [[National Association for Information Destruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naidonline.org|title=National Association for Information Destruction|work=naidonline.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805065828/http://www.naidonline.org/|archivedate=2009-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that there is a huge demand for document reconstruction. Several companies offer commercial document reconstruction services. For maximum security, documents should be shredded so that the words of the document go through the shredder horizontally (i.e. perpendicular to the blades).  Many of the documents in the [[Enron scandal|Enron Accounting scandals]] were fed through the shredder the wrong way, making them easier to reassemble.

* In 2003, there was an effort underway to recover the shredded archives of the [[Stasi]], the East German secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Heingartner | first = Douglas | title = Back Together Again | publisher = New York Times | date = 2003-07-17 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E3D7123CF934A25754C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | accessdate = 2007-01-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305141421/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E3D7123CF934A25754C0A9659C8B63 | archivedate = 2008-03-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are "millions of shreds of paper that panicked Stasi officials threw into garbage bags during the regime's final days in the fall of 1989". As it took three dozen people six years to reconstruct 300 of the 16,000 bags, the Fraunhofer-IPK institute has developed the "Stasi-Schnipselmaschine" (''Stasi snippet machine'') for computerized reconstruction and is testing it in a pilot project.

* The [[DARPA Shredder Challenge 2011]] called upon computer scientists, puzzle enthusiasts, and anyone else with an interest in solving complex problems, to compete for up to $50,000 by piecing together a series of shredded documents. The Shredder Challenge consisted of five separate puzzles in which the number of documents, the document subject matter and the method of shredding were varied to present challenges of increasing difficulty. To complete each problem, participants were required to provide the answer to a puzzle embedded in the content of the reconstructed document. The overall prizewinner and prize awarded was dependent on the number and difficulty of the problems solved. [[DARPA]] declared a winner on December 2, 2011 (the winning entry was submitted 33 days after the challenge began) - the winner was "[[All your base are belong to us|All Your Shreds Are Belong To U.S.]]" using a combination system that used automated sorting to pick the best fragment combinations to be reviewed by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darpa Shredder Challenge|url=http://archive.darpa.mil/shredderchallenge/|website=Darpa.mil|publisher=U S.

=== Forensic identification ===
The individual shredder that was used to destroy a given document may be sometimes be of [[forensic]] interest. Shredders display certain device-specific characteristics, "[[fingerprint]]s", like the exact spacing of the blades, the degree and pattern of their wear. By closely examining the shredded material, the minute variations of size of the paper strips and the microscopic marks on their edges may be able to be linked to a specific machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author = Jack Brassil | title = Tracing the Source of a Shredded Document | publisher = [[Hewlett-Packard]] | date = 2002-08-02 | url = http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-215.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029090544/http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-215.pdf | archivedate = 2006-10-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (c.f. the [[Typewriter#Forensic identification|forensic identification of typewriters]].)

[[File:German parachute mine.jpg|thumb|right|A defused, German 1,000 kg 'Luftmine'. Glasgow, 18 March 1941]]
A '''parachute mine''' is a [[naval mine]] dropped from an aircraft by [[parachute]]. They were mostly used in the [[Second World War]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] and initially by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].
Frequently, they were dropped on land targets.

==Blast effects==
These mines were attached to parachutes to act as blast bombs; when detonated at roof level rather than on impact the aerodynamic effects of their blast were maximised. Instead of the shock waves from the explosion being cushioned by surrounding buildings, they could reach a wider area, with the potential to destroy a whole street of houses in a {{convert|110|yd|abbr=on}} radius and windows being blown in up to a mile away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ww2today.com/21st-september-1940-the-menace-of-the-parachute-mine|title = The menace of the parachute mine|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = World War 2 Today|publisher = |last = Cherrett|first = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}}

==History==

===Luftwaffe===
During the Second World War, the Luftwaffe used a number of different kinds of parachute mine. The '''Luftmine A''' (LMA) and '''Luftmine B''' (LMB) weighed {{convert|500|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on}} respectively. The LMA was {{convert|5|ft|8|in|abbr=on}} in length and the LMB {{convert|8|ft|8|in|abbr=on}}.

After the parachute opened, the mine would descend at around {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}. If it came down on land, a clockwork mechanism would detonate the mine 25 seconds after impact. If the mine landed in water it would sink to the bottom. If the depth was greater than {{convert|8|ft|m}}, water pressure and the dissolving of a water–soluble plug would deactivate the clockwork time-detonator, and activate an anti-shipping detonator. These were initially [[Magnetic pistol|magnetic detonators]] but later, acoustic or magnetic/acoustic detonators could be fitted.&lt;ref name="IWM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30020471 | title=Non-Contact, Parachute Ground (Land) Mine Type GC | publisher=Imperial War Museum | accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luftwaffe began dropping mines in British waters in November 1939, using [[Heinkel He 115]] seaplanes and [[Heinkel He 111]] land–based bombers. They were first used against land targets on 16 September 1940 in the early stages of [[the Blitz]].&lt;ref name="IWM" /&gt; Clearance of these was carried out by the [[Royal Navy]], which quickly despatched a team to London from [[HMS Vernon (shore establishment)|HMS Vernon]], while Army Bomb disposal staff were warned that it was extremely inadvisable to attempt to render them safe without Naval guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Major Arthur Hogben |title= Designed to Kill: Bomb disposal from World War 1 to the Falklands |isbn=0850598656 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luftwaffe also used the {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on}} '''Bombenmine''' (BM 1000, Monika, or G Mine). This was fitted with a tail made from [[Bakelite]] which broke up on impact. It had a [[photoelectric cell]] beneath a cover which detonated the bomb if exposed to light to counteract the work of bomb disposal units.

===RAF===
The RAF initially used naval mines, but replaced them with purpose-made [[blockbuster bomb]]s, which were produced in various sizes up to {{convert|12000|lb|kg}}.

==Notable people killed by parachute mines==

{{see also|GPS navigation device|Automotive navigation system|Satellite navigation}}
A '''Personal Navigation Assistant''' ('''PNA''') also known as '''Personal Navigation Device''' or '''Portable Navigation Device''' ('''PND''') is a portable [[electronics|electronic]] product which combines a positioning capability (such as [[GPS]]) and [[navigation]] functions.

Some PNA devices are [[Personal_digital_assistant|PDA]]s with limited features and can be unlocked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mio.digiwalker.googlepages.com/unlockmio See here how to "unlocks" Mio made PNAs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest PNAs were hand-held GPS units (circa mid-1980s) which were capable of displaying the user's location on an electronic [[map]]. These units included simple navigation functions such as course-to-steer and course-made-good. This first generation of PNAs were used by the US military.

==Market developments==
[[File:Gosmore in berlin with winCE on transonic 6000.jpg|thumb|Bicycle navigation on a personal navigation assistant.]]
According to the analyst firm [[Berg Insight]], there were more than 150 million [[turn-by-turn navigation]] systems worldwide in mid-2009, including about 35 million factory installed and aftermarket in-dash navigation systems, over 90 million Personal Navigation Devices (PNDs) and an estimated 28 million navigation-enabled mobile handsets with GPS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berginsight.com/ReportPDF/Summary/bi-pnd3-sum.pdf Berg Insight's PND report 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term PNA has come into widespread use with the growing popularity of [[automobile navigation system]]s. Original PNAs provided users with a map layer, real-time-traffic, and a routing engine with audio/visual cues for turn-by-turn guidance. The latest generation of PNA have sophisticated navigation functions such as parking assistance and [[personalization engines]] that enhance the user experience.  To reduce total cost of ownership and time to market, most modern PNA devices such as those made by [[Garmin|Garmin Ltd.]], [[Mio Technology|Mio Technology Ltd.]] or [[TomTom|TomTom International BV.]] are running an off-the-shelf [[embedded operating system]] such as [[Windows CE]] or [[Embedded Linux]] on [[commodity hardware]] with OEM versions of popular PDA Navigation software packages such as TomTom Navigator, I-GO 2006, Netropa IntelliNav iGuidance, or Destinator. 

Other manufacturers such as [[Garmin]] and [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]] prefer to bundle their own software developed in-house.  Because many of these devices use an embedded OS, many technically inclined users find it easy to modify PNAs to run third party software and use them for things other than navigation, such as a low-cost audio-video player or [[PDA]] replacement.

GPS equipped mobile phones have now eclipsed the sale of dedicated GPS units. [[Nokia]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Motorola]] and other handset makers were predicted to sell 162 million GPS equipped phones in 2007, dwarfing the 20 million units Garmin and TomTom have forecast they will sell combined, according to iSuppli, a leading market researcher in California. The inclusion of [[Google Maps Navigation]] in [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices such as [[Motorola Droid]] and [[Nokia]]'s announcement of free [[Ovi Maps]] has led to many people using their smartphones instead of having a separate PNA for trip navigation.

'''Purfleet''' is a town in the [[Thurrock]] unitary authority in [[Essex]], England. It is contained between the [[A13 road (Great Britain)|A13 road]] to the north and the [[River Thames]] to the south and is within the easterly bounds of the [[M25 motorway]] but just outside the [[Greater London]] boundary. It was within the traditional [[Church of England]] parish of [[West Thurrock]]. There is some industry to the south and the area forms part of the [[Thames Gateway]] redevelopment area. Purfleet is one of seven [[Conservation area#United Kingdom|conservation areas]] in Thurrock.&lt;ref name="Thurrock conservation areas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Areas in Thurrock|url=https://www.thurrock.gov.uk/conservation-areas/conservation-areas-in-thurrock|website=thurrock.gov.uk|publisher=Thurrock Council|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 18th century, Purfleet [[Gunpowder magazine#Purfleet.2C Essex|Royal Gunpowder Magazine]] was established as a location for the storage of [[gunpowder]] together with a garrison to protect it. There was a constant danger of explosion as a result of lightning strikes. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was asked for advice on the design of a lightning conductor and a committee of the [[Royal Society]] supported his design for pointed conductors. After the [[American Revolution]]  the powder store was protected from lightning which hit the building, though metal drainpipes actually did the work. When [[King George III]] heard of this, he insisted they be replaced with blunt conductors and the [[president of the Royal Society]] was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Doren|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Van Doren|title=Benjamin Franklin|year=1939|publisher=Putnam|location=London|pages=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Harrold (editor) ''Exploring Thurrock'' (Thurrock Local History Society, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Magazine number 5, the only one remaining of the original five, is now the Purfleet Garrison Heritage and Military Centre and a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].  It is run by volunteers and contains a wide range of local and military memorabilia (including from [[RAF Hornchurch]]) and is open to the public on Thursdays, Sundays and bank holidays.

[[J.M.W. Turner]] (1775-1851) made sketches of Purfleet in 1805-08 mainly featuring the Powder Magazines. The sketches are collected in the River and Margate Sketchbook which are part of the [[Tate Britain]] collection and accepted as part of the Turner Bequest in 1856. &lt;ref&gt; Tate website [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-purfleet-d06474]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other surviving 18th century buildings include the proofing house (now used for community activities) and the gatehouse clock tower (described by [[English Heritage]] as forming "an integral part of the finest ensemble in any of the Ordnance Yards, consistent with the high standards practised by the Ordnance Board in its designs for fortifications and barracks from the C17").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-119623-clock-tower-and-attached-walls- listed building description]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his history of Essex (1848)  &lt;ref&gt; History, gazetteer and directory of Essex, 1848&lt;/ref&gt; W. White describes Purfleet as having 704 inhabitants including 199 from the barracks. "Purfleet is a village and military station....at the mouth of a rivulet, and at the west end of West Thurrock ...sometimes called a township...and has a pleasure fair on the 13th of June. Near it are the extensive limeade chalk pits of W.H.Whitbread, the lord of the manor. The harbour is often full of shipping business and animation: and joining it is a large government powder magazine, consisting of five detached bomb-proof and well-protected store-houses, barracks for a company of artillery, a store keeper's mansion, and a good quay. The magazine was built in 1781,and has room for the safe keeping of 60,000 barrels of gunpowder." &lt;ref&gt; Quoted in Brian Evans (2004), Grays Thurrock, A History, Phillimore &lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 1916, [[anti-aircraft]] gunners based at Purfleet shot down the German [[Zeppelin]] LZ15 – a first. As a result, the gunners received a prize from the [[Lord Mayor of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=parish_facts_details&amp;id=2 Thurrock Council | Thurrock Heritage | Parish Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608220003/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=parish_facts_details&amp;id=2 |date=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1921 to 1936, Purfleet formed an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Essex]] including the parishes of [[Aveley]], [[West Thurrock]] and [[South Ockendon]]. It covered an area of {{convert|8900|acre|km2}} and in 1931 had a population of 8,511. The parishes and urban district were abolished in 1936 and their former area was used to form part of [[Thurrock Urban District]].

Reflecting a strong port and storage history, Purfleet was listed by the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] as one of 14 sensitive [[Nuclear weapon#Fission bomb or atomic/atom bomb (A-bomb)|A-bomb]] targets in 1955, including for the supply of tea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7382750.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Nuclear threat sparked tea worry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel, [[Count Dracula]] had an estate here.&lt;ref&gt;Bram: Dracula, Chapter 2, 1897 {{ISBN|978-0141439846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Scratch Drive Actuator.gif|right|Scratch Drive Actuator]]
A '''scratch drive actuator (SDA)''' is a [[microelectromechanical system]] device that converts [[electrical energy]] into one-dimensional motion.&lt;ref name="LiBrown2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Lijie|last2=Brown|first2=J. Gordon|last3=Uttamchandani|first3=Deepak|date=|year=2002|title=Study of scratch drive actuator force characteristics|url=|journal=[[Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering]]|volume=12|issue=6|pages=736–741|bibcode=2002JMiMi..12..736L|doi=10.1088/0960-1317/12/6/303|issn=0960-1317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FujitaToshiyoshi1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujita|first1=Hiroyuki|last2=Toshiyoshi|first2=Hiroshi|date=|title=Micro actuators and their applications|url=|journal=Microelectronics Journal|publication-date=September 1998|volume=29|issue=9|pages=637–640|doi=10.1016/S0026-2692(98)00027-5|issn=0026-2692|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The [[actuator]] component can come in many shapes and sizes, depending on the fabrication method used. It can be visualised as an 'L'. The smaller end is called the 'bushing'.

The actuator sits on top of a substrate that has a thin insulating [[dielectric]] layer on top. A voltage is applied between the actuator and the substrate, and the resulting potential pulls the body of the actuator downwards. When this occurs, the brush is pushed forwards by a small amount, and energy is stored in the strained actuator. When the voltage is removed, the actuator springs back into shape while the bushing remains in its new position. By applying a pulsed voltage, the SDA can be made to move forward.

The voltage is usually applied to the actuator by means of a 'tether'. This can consist of a rigid connector or a rail which the SDA follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2344498/dancing-microrobots-waltz-on-a-pin-s-head.html|title=Dancing microrobots waltz on a pin's head|last=Cooney|first=Michael|date=June 2, 2008|work=[[Network World]]|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of an SDA is typically measured on the [[Micrometre|μm]] scale.

The '''Spårvägsmuseet''', or '''Tramway Museum''', was located at Tegelviksgatan 22 in [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]]. In the museum there was also a café, a library, an archive and another museum called ''[[Leksaksmuseet]]'' ("Toy Museum"). It was owned by [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]]. It showed vehicles and the development of the public transport at Stockholm from the 19th century until present.

The museum closed to the public in September 2017 and will open again in early 2020 in a new premises (Norra Djurgårdsstaden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sparvagsmuseet.sl.se/in-english|title=Spårvägsmuseet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Sveriges Television AB|language=Swedish|trans-title=The tram museum will receive new premises in Hjorthagen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==
The tramway chief {{ill|Ernst Hjortzberg|sv}} started collecting things in about 1900, when there were horse trams. There was an internal museum at the headquarters of the company at Tegnérgatan. (You can read about this in a newspaper article from 1922.)

In 1944 the museum was publicly opened on [[Tulegatan]] close to the old tram depot. In 1964 the museum was moved to [[Odenplan]], but the museum was small and it was impossible to show many vehicles. In 1990 it moved to its location Tegelviksgatan 22.

The company was founded in 1981 under the brand name '''TTK''' as a cassette manufacturer, making [[knock-off]] [[TDK]] cassettes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1985, after being sued by [[TDK]] for intellectual property violation, the company changed its brand name to '''TCL''' by taking the initials from ''T''elephone ''C''ommunication ''L''imited. It began manufacturing consumer electronics for the Chinese market during the 1980s,&lt;ref name="TCL Hist"&gt;[http://www.tclcom.com/?page=board_of_directors History] TCL Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; and began to sell overseas in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="TCL About1"&gt;[http://www.alcatel-mobilephones.com/www/content/view/full/181 About TCL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327192302/http://www.alcatel-mobilephones.com/www/content/view/full/181 |date=27 March 2010 }} TCL Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; Though a [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprise]], TCL was established as a joint venture with several Hong Kong-based investors.&lt;ref name="TCL Hist"/&gt;

In May 2005, TCL announced that its Hong Kong-listed unit would acquire Alcatel's 45 per cent stake in their mobile-phone joint venture for consideration of HK$63.34 million ($8.1 million) worth of TCL Communication shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aRUa6H1Z_x98&amp;refer=europe|title=TCL Unit to Buy 45% Stake of Mobile-Phone Venture From Alcatel|accessdate=25 April 2011|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=16 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, TCL announced that its mobile phone division planned to cease using the Alcatel brand and switch entirely to the TCL brand within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2007-06/20/content_5419829.htm|title=TCL to switch to own brand|accessdate=25 April 2011|work=China Daily|date=20 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, [[Samsung Electronics]] announced that it would be outsourcing the production of some LCD TV modules to TCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2008/04/29/samsung-tcl-idINSEO25310120080429|title=Samsung to outsource some work to China's TCL|accessdate=17 April 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14946">'''Team OS/2''' was an [[operating system advocacy|advocacy group]] formed to promote [[IBM]]'s [[OS/2]] operating system. Originally internal to IBM with no formal IBM support, Team OS/2 successfully converted to a grassroots movement formally supported (but not directed) by IBM - consisting of well over ten thousand OS/2 enthusiasts both within and without IBM. It is one of the earliest examples of both an online [[viral phenomenon]] and a cause attracting supporters primarily through online communications.

The decline of Team OS/2 largely coincided with IBM's abandonment of OS/2 and the coinciding attacks orchestrated by Microsoft on OS/2, Team OS/2, and IBM's early attempts at online evangelism.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Team OS/2 was a significant factor in the spread and acceptance of [[OS/2]]. Formed in February 1992, Team OS/2 began when [[IBM]] employee Dave Whittle, recently appointed by IBM to evangelize OS/2 online,&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Beth. "IBM Creates Post To Push OS/2 2.0 Into Mass Market," PC Week, Feb. 17, 1992, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; formed an internal IBM discussion group titled TEAMOS2 FORUM on IBM's worldwide network, which at the time, served more individuals than did the more academic Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Waldrep | first=Mark |title= Team OS/2 | publisher=Datatrend Technologies | year=2007 | url=http://www.datatrend.com/trendsetter/Issue_18_Articles/index.html | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The forum header stated that its purpose was 
{{Quote box
|quote = "for the discussion of those things that empowered IBMers, working as a team, can do to promote the success of OS/2, focused on synergy and combining talents to achieve results greater than the sum of individual efforts through teamwork."
|source = - David B. Whittle, "Cyberspace: The Human Dimension," W.H. Freeman, New York, NY, 1997, p. 225 
}}

The forum went viral as increasing numbers of IBMers worldwide began to contribute a wide variety of ideas as to how IBM could effectively compete with [[Microsoft]] to establish OS/2 as the industry standard desktop operating system.  Within a short time, thousands of IBM employees had added the words TEAMOS2 to their internet phone directory listing, which enabled anyone within IBM to find like-minded OS/2 enthusiasts within the company and work together to overcome the challenges posed by IBM's size, insularity, and top-down marketing style.  TEAMOS2 FORUM quickly caught the attention of some IBM executives, including Lee Reiswig and Lucy Baney, who after initial scepticism, offered moral and financial support for Whittle's [[grass roots]] and online marketing efforts.  IBM's official program for generating word-of-mouth enthusiasm was called the "OS/2 Ambassador Program", where OS/2 enthusiasts company-wide could win Gold, Silver, and Bronze Ambassador pins and corporate recognition with various levels of structured achievement. Both the OS/2 Ambassador Program and Team OS/2 were effective in evangelizing OS/2 within IBM, but only Team OS/2 was effective in generating support for the promotion of OS/2 outside of IBM.&lt;ref name="True Believers"&gt;Scheier, Robert L. "True Believers" PCWeek, February 7, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Externalization===
Whittle began to extend the Team OS/2 effort outside of IBM with various posts on [[CompuServe]], [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], bulletin boards, newsgroups, and other venues.  He also made a proposal to IBM executives, which they eventually implemented when IBM Personal Software Products moved to Austin, Texas, that they form a "Grass Roots Marketing Department".&lt;ref name="Cyberspace: The Human Dimension"&gt;{{cite book | last=Whittle | first=David B. |title=Cyberspace: The Human Dimension | publisher=W.H. Freeman | location=New York | date=1997 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34767380 | oclc=34767380 | isbn= 9780716783145 | accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228}}

Team OS/2 went external that spring, when the first Team OS/2 Party was held in Chicago.  The IBM Marketing Office in Chicago created a huge banner visible from the streets.  Microsoft reacted when [[Steve Ballmer]] roamed the floor with an application on diskette that had been specially programmed to crash OS/2;&lt;ref&gt;Dvorak, John C. "Microsoft Should Apologize" PC Magazine, October 20, 1998, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; and OS/2 enthusiasts gathered for an evening of excitement at the first Team OS/2 party.  Tickets were limited to those who had requested them on one of the online discussion groups.  Attendees were asked to nominate their favorite "Teamer" for the "Team OS/2 Hall of Fame", and those whose names were drawn came forward to tell the story of their nominee - what sacrifice they had made to promote OS/2 and why they were deserving of recognition.   Prizes included limousine rides that evening. At the end, all attendees received the first TEAM OS/2 T-shirt, which includes the first Team OS/2 logo on the front and the distinctive IBM blue-stripe logo on the back - except with lower-case letters: "ibm/2" to represent the new IBM.  Even the lead singer in the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] that had provided music for the event asked if they could have a T-shirt for each member of the band. One IBM executive in attendance said it was the first IBM event that had given him goosebumps.&lt;ref name="Cyberspace: The Human Dimension"/&gt;{{rp|227}}

After that, word about the Team OS/2 phenomenon spread even more quickly, both within IBM and without. OS/2 enthusiasts spread the word to computer user groups across the United States, then eventually worldwide, independently of IBM marketing efforts.  Whittle established multiple localized forums within IBM, such as TEAMNY, TEAMDC, TEAMFL, TEAMTX, and TEAMCA, which attracted new supporters and enabled enthusiastic followers to share ideas and success stories, plan events, and creatively apply what they were learning from one another.&lt;ref name="Cyberspace: The Human Dimension"/&gt;{{rp|228}}

The "Teamer Invasion" of [[COMDEX]] in the Fall of 1993 was perhaps the high water mark for Team OS/2. COMDEX was, at that time, the most important computer and electronics trade show, held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  Wearing the salmon-colored shirts which were to become associated with Team OS/2, the group's members, led by Doug Azzarito, Keith Wood, Mike Kogan, IBM User Group Manager Gene Barlow, and others wandered the convention floors, promoting OS/2 and providing demo discs to vendors and offering to install the distributed version of OS/2 on display computers.  Many Team OS/2 volunteers had traveled to the convention on their own, including some from overseas; so their independence and grass-roots enthusiasm attracted significant attention in the media and amongst exhibitors.&lt;ref name="True Believers"/&gt;

What little funding IBM provided went to provide the shirts, "trinkets and trash", and an onsite headquarters for Teamers to coordinate their efforts and collect items to give to vendors.&lt;ref name="True Believers"/&gt; IBM had established the Grass Roots Marketing department proposed earlier, and had even tapped Vicci Conway and Janet Gobeille to provide support and guidance for Team OS/2 with Whittle voluntarily stepping aside from his previous day-to-day focus on supporting and monitoring Team OS/2 activities. Janet was nicknamed "Team Godmother", but everyone in IBM, especially Whittle, was wary of trying to direct volunteers or make Team OS/2 too structured or formal, in order to avoid "breaking something that works".&lt;ref name="Cyberspace: The Human Dimension"/&gt;{{rp|229}}

According to the Team OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions document, Team OS/2 at one point had a presence (sponsoring members willing to publish their e-mail addresses as points of contact) in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; as well as online on America Online, CompuServe, Delphi, FidoNet, Genie, the Internet/Usenet/mail servers, Prodigy, and WWIVNet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/Team-OS2-FAQ/ |title=Team OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions |last=Scarborough |first=Christian  |date=February 13, 1997 |website=faqs.org |access-date=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
In an article analyzing Team OS/2 and its meaning and context, Robert L. Scheier listed several of the factors the led to the success of the group. These included the creation of a strong group identity with a powerful name, corporate support without corporate direction, the ability of volunteer members to do things that companies couldn't do, keeping it "loose" and relatively unstructured, providing lots of smaller material rewards without compensation, and listening to team members as if they were the "eyes and ears of the public."&lt;ref name="True Believers"/&gt;

However, Team OS/2's very lack of structure left it vulnerable.  Various journalists have documented a "dirty tricks" campaign by Microsoft.&lt;ref name="Stevens, Elizabeth Lesly 1998, p. 109"&gt;Stevens, Elizabeth Lesly. "Making Bill" Brill's Content, September 1998, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Online, numerous individuals (nicknamed "Microsoft Munchkins" by [[John C. Dvorak]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; used pseudonyms to attack OS/2 and manipulate online discussions. Whittle was the target of a widespread online character assassination campaign.&lt;ref name="Stevens, Elizabeth Lesly 1998, p. 109"/&gt;

Some journalists who were less than enthusiastic about OS/2 received death threats and other nasty emails from numerous sources, identified in taglines as "Team OS/2" without a name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this attack pattern was part of Microsoft's efforts or from Team OS/2, the identity was never proven. Ultimately, at least some of Microsoft's efforts were exposed on Will Zachmann's [[Canopus]] forum on CompuServe, where the owner of one particular account, ostensibly belonging to "Steve Barkto", (who had been attacking OS/2, David Barnes, Whittle, and other OS/2 fans) was discovered to be funded by the credit card of Rick Segal, a high-level Microsoft employee and evangelist, who had also been active in the forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Will Zachmann sent an open letter to [[Steve Ballmer]], futilely demanding a public investigation into the business practices of the publicly traded Microsoft.&lt;ref name="Cyberspace: The Human Dimension"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

===Decline===
At the height of the marketing effort, Team OS/2 consisted of more than ten thousand known members, and countless undocumented members.&lt;ref name="Cyberspace: The Human Dimension"/&gt;{{rp|228}} IBM acknowledged publicly that without Team OS/2, there might not have been a fourth generation ("Warp 4") of the operating system.  However, the IBM Marketing Director over the Grass Roots Marketing Department made the decision to meet his headcount cut targets by eliminating the entire department - one week before the 1995 Fall Comdex.  Microsoft executives were said to be positively gleeful and Team OS/2 members worldwide were said to be incredulous.&lt;ref&gt;Petreley, Nicholas.  "Down to the Wire," InfoWorld, November 27, 1995, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within months, Whittle and Barlow had left IBM, Conway and Gobeille were reassigned within IBM, and Teamers were crushed by IBM's announcement that the marketing of individual desktop versions would come to a close.  Most Team members eventually migrated away from OS/2 to Linux, which offered the power and stability which they had come to expect from OS/2, and where much of what was learned with Team OS/2 inspired at least some in the Linux and Open Source movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Legacy==
Microsoft attempted to fabricate "Team NT" for COMDEX Fall 1995, but this was widely ridiculed as a blatant attempt at impersonation.  "Team NT" members were Microsoft employees, and called "Team Nice Try" by industry pundits such as ''Spencer F. Katt'' (a [[pen name]] with various contributors, such as Paul Connolly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[EWeek|PCWeek Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

When Microsoft was readying the first version of Windows NT (designated "Version 3.1") in 1993, a Texas computer user group (HAL-PC) invited IBM and Microsoft to a public "shootout" between the two operating systems.  Videotape of the two demonstrations was later distributed by IBM and Team OS/2 members.  Compared to the dynamic presentation given by David Barnes as he put OS/2 through its paces, the Microsoft presenter and NT showed so poorly that Microsoft demanded that all portions of the NT presentation be cut out of the videotapes which IBM was distributing of the event.  This resulted in issuance of an edited version of the tape, but hundreds of original (complete) copies had already been released.  The uncut version of the "OS/2 - NT Shootout" tape have been dubbed the "OS/2 - NT Shootdown" or "The Shootdown of Flight 31".  The tape has been used to train professional software and hardware presenters who might face user groups.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''Total system power''' is a term often used in [[Audio engineering|audio electronics]] to rate the power of an audio system. Total system power refers to the total [[Energy consumption|power consumption]] of the unit, rather than the [[power handling]] of the [[Loudspeaker|speakers]] or the power output of the [[amplifier]]. This can be viewed as a somewhat deceptive [[marketing]] ploy, as the total power consumption of the unit will of course be greater than any of its other power ratings, except for, perhaps, the [[power handling|peak power]] of the amplifier, which is essentially an exaggerated value anyway. [[Shelf stereo]]s and [[surround sound]] receivers are often rated using total system power.

One way to use total system power to get a more accurate estimate of power is to consider the [[amplifier class]] which would give an educated guess of the power output by considering the efficiency of the class. For example, [[class AB amplifier]]s are around 25 or 50% efficiency while Class D amps are much higher; around 80% or more efficiency. A very exceptional efficiency for a specific Class D amp, the [[ROHM]] BD5421efs, operates at 90% efficiency. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800464222_499501_NP_c0bbb082.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, an audio device may be measured by the ''total system power'' of all its loudspeakers by adding all their peak power ratings. Many [[home theater in a box]] systems are rated this way. Often low-end home theater systems' power ratings are taken at a high level of [[harmonic distortion]] as well; as high as 10%, which would be painfully noticeable. &lt;ref&gt;http://hometheater.about.com/cs/audiocomponents/a/aapowermada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victoria Alexandrina Drummond''' [[Order of the British Empire#Current awards|MBE]] (1894–1978), was the first woman marine engineer in Britain and first woman member of [[Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology|Institute of Marine Engineers]]. In World War II she served at sea as an engineering officer in the British [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] and received awards for bravery under enemy fire.

==Childhood==
Victoria Drummond was born on 14 October 1894 at [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]], [[Perthshire]], Scotland. Her father was Captain Malcolm Drummond of [[Megginch Castle|Megginch]], [[Groom in Waiting]] to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26448 |page=5961 |date=10 October 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Perthshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26466 |page=5961 |date=12 December 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Geraldine Margaret Tyssen-Amherst was the daughter of [[William Tyssen-Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney]].&lt;ref name="ClanMcFarlan"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I61157&amp;tree=CC |title=Victoria Alexandrina Drummond, M.B.E. |publisher=Clan McFarlane and Associated Clans Genealogy |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had two sisters, Jean and Frances, and a younger brother, [[John Drummond, 15th Baron Strange]]. She was [[Baptism|baptised]] Victoria after [[Queen Victoria]], who was one of her [[Godparent|godmothers]].&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB |title=Drummond, Victoria Alexandrina |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66436 |last=Drummond |first=Cherry |authorlink=Cherry Drummond, 16th Baroness Strange |volume= |pages= |quote= |accessdate= |vb= |supplement= |no-icon=}} September 2004. {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/66436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Pine |editor-first=L.G. |year=1952 |title=Burke's Landed Gentry |edition=17th |location=London |publisher=Burke's Peerage Ltd in conjunction with City Ltd |page=694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond and her siblings were brought up in both the [[Church of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=2}} All four worked as children: growing vegetables and flowers to sell and keeping poultry. Drummond's speciality was hand-churning butter.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=35–36}} Their privileged upbringing was straitened after one pair of grandparents [[Panic of 1907#Economic conditions|lost a fortune in investments in 1906]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=39}}

One of Drummond's grandmothers [[Woodturning|turned]] wood and ivory and belonged to the [[Worshipful Company of Turners]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=25}} Drummond herself became a prizewinning model maker, making her own toys that were shown in exhibitions and won prizes in competitions.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=42–43}}

Drummond used to visit the engineering works of Robert Morton and Sons in Errol,{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=36}} which built steam-powered and petrol-engined lorries and buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Robert_Morton_and_Sons |title=Robert Morton and Sons |work=Grace's Guide |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young girl she asked Mr Morton how she could learn to be a marine engineer and go to sea. Morton may or may not have taken the young girl seriously, but he told her to serve an apprenticeship, find a shop with a vacancy and start at the beginning, serve her time and then find a ship that would give her a berth as an engineer.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=36}}

In February 1913 Drummond's parents took her to London where she was presented at court to King [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] as a [[Debutante#United Kingdom|Debutante]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=44–47}}

==Apprenticeship==
In 1915 Drummond turned 21 and her father encouraged her to choose her own career. She repeated her ambition to be a marine engineer. From 18 October 1916 she was apprenticed at the Northern Garage, South Street, Perth.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=54}} Her wage as a first year apprentice was three [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s a week, from which [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] was deducted for [[National Insurance]] so her net wage was [[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]]. In her second year her wage before National Insurance was six shillings. Her foreman, a Mr Malcolm, who had worked in Clyde shipyards, gone to sea and risen to be a [[Chief Engineer]] at sea, supported her training.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=55}} On three evenings a week a teacher from Dundee Technical College (now [[Abertay University]]) taught her maths and engineering.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=56}}

Mr Malcolm supported Drummond's training but in 1918 the garage dismissed him for drunkenness. Drummond took this as the right time to move on and resigned from the garage. Her father got her an introduction to the [[Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company]] in [[Dundee]], which took her on in its engine and boiler works at Lilybank in Dundee.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=59–60}} She started as a [[Pattern (casting)|pattern maker]] for metal [[casting]],{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=62–63}} and in 1919 was promoted to the finishing shop.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=69}} She completed her apprenticeship in 1920 and stayed on at Caledon as a [[journeyman]], later transferring to the [[Technical drawing|drawing]] office.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=71}} In 1922 Caledon suffered a decline in orders and laid off many workers, including Drummond who left on 7 July.&lt;ref name=Drummond72&gt;{{harvnb|Drummond|1994|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years at sea==

===''Anchises''===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 133201 Anchises (ship).jpg|thumb|Blue Funnel's {{SS|Anchises|1911|2}}, on which Drummond was 10th Engineer 1922–24]]
Early in Drummond's time at Caledon, the founder W.B. Thompson introduced her and her parents to Henry Wortley, a director of [[Blue Funnel Line]]. Wortley offered Drummond the promise of a position as an engineer at sea when she completed her apprenticeship.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=66}} When Caledon gave her notice in 1922, Drummond wrote to Wortley to take up his offer.&lt;ref name=Drummond72/&gt; Unknown to Drummond, Wortley had died in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Henry_Bell_Wortley |title=Henry Bell Wortley |work=Grace's Guide |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Lawrence Durning Holt|Lawrence Holt]] honoured Wortley's promise and invited her to Liverpool for an interview.&lt;ref name=Drummond72/&gt;

Blue Funnel employed Drummond initially in its engineering record office in Liverpool&lt;ref name=Drummond72/&gt; on a salary of £12 a month.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=73}} About a month later, on 25 August, she was instructed to sign on the {{GRT|10000}} [[Ocean liner|passenger liner]] {{SS|Anchises|1911|2}} for a trial trip from [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] to Glasgow as an Assistant Engineer.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=75}} On 2 September she signed on ''Anchises'' again as Tenth Engineer. The salary of £10 a month was £2 less than the company had paid her ashore!{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=77}} She served on the ship until 1924, making four voyages to Australia and one to [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=i}}

On ''Anchises'' all the crew, all but one of the officers and most of the passengers accepted having a woman engineer. A few of the women passengers passed demeaning remarks at her.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=82}} When ''Anchises''{{'}} usual [[First assistant engineer|Second Engineer]] was taken ill his position was covered by an extra Second, Mr Howard, who Drummond says "persecuted" her. Drummond was friends with the usual Second Engineer, Malcolm Quayle, who supported her career, was her escort for social events ashore and whom she called her "protector".{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=102}} The pair had prickly tempers, for which Drummond nicknamed Quayle "hedgehog" and he nicknamed her "Kate", after Katherina in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=93}} Quayle was married and had two children, and Drummond was emphatic that there was never any impropriety between them. However, when in 1924 she wanted to take her exams to become a Second Engineer, she unwisely wrote to her manager at Blue Funnel, Mr Freeman, suggesting that Quayle be promoted to Chief Engineer and she could be his Second. This gave Freeman the damaging impression that Quayle and Drummond were having an affair.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=110}} Drummond left ''Anchises'' and Blue Funnel in April 1924.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=i}}

===''Mulbera''===
Drummond began study for her [[First assistant engineer|Second Engineer]]'s qualification. However, after qualifying, she was able to find work only as a Fifth Engineer, signing on the [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] {{GRT|9100}} [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|steam turbine]] liner {{ship|TSS|Mulbera|1922|2}} on 14 April 1927. She served on the ship until 4 December 1928, completing one voyage to [[East Africa]] and four to [[British Raj|India]] and [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=i}}

Aboard ''Mulbera'' Drummond was again accepted by nearly all the [[ship's company]]. The exception was the Second Engineer, Mr Lamb, who on Drummond's first day aboard told her that he didn't want her there. Drummond said Lamb often shouted at her, occasionally swore at her and thus wore her down.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=121}} Drummond privately nicknamed Lamb the Tiger Cat or just "The Tiger".{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=123}} On occasion she also encountered passengers who initially did not believe a woman could be a marine engineer. Drummond won them round by competently doing her job.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=135}}

In port in [[Colony of Aden|Aden]] on 11 May 1928 Drummond received an air mail letter telling her that aboard her former ship ''Anchises'' on 13 April her friend Malcolm Quayle had died. The letter gave no details of what had happened{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=139}} and she found out none until some time thereafter.

==12 years ashore==
From about 1919 Drummond's sister Jean ran the Queen Victoria Girl's Club at 122 [[Kennington Road]], [[Lambeth]], south London: a job that included a flat at the top of the building.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=68}} From 1929 Victoria and Frances leased a house almost opposite at 143 Kennington Road, which they named The Studio. Frances worked as a commercial artist and she and Victoria also developed a business, the Golden Fisheries, trading [[goldfish]] that they kept in their garden pond and in tanks in the house.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=154–155}}

From October 1929 Drummond repeatedly sat the Board of Trade examination for Chief Engineer, but every time the examiners failed her.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=152}} Mr Martin at Dundee continued to support her and eventually in 1936 tackled the examiners, who privately admitted to him that they always failed her because she was a woman.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=167}} Indeed, to prevent any accusations of unfairness, the [[Board of Trade]] Examiners habitually failed all candidates who sat the examinations with her.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

From 1935 Frances and Victoria's business took them abroad to trade fairs in [[Leipzig]], [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=158–170}} In March 1938 when [[Anschluss#German troops march into Austria|German forces occupied Austria]] in the [[Anschluss]], the two sisters were at a trade fair in Vienna. Drummond photographed Hitler in his motorcade and later described that time in Vienna as very tense, chaotic and dangerous.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=162–170}}

==World War II service==
In 1939 war seemed to grow inevitable so Drummond applied to return to sea as a Second Engineer. Despite her good service on liners of two of the most prestigious companies in the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]], and glowing references from numerous superior officers, all her many applications were declined. Therefore, on the eve of [[World War II]] she joined Jean and Frances enlisting as [[Air raid warden]]s in [[Lambeth]], London.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=177}}

===''Har Zion''===
[[File:NMMI IMG 8951.JPG|thumb|Model of {{SS|Har Zion||2}} in the [[Israeli National Maritime Museum]]]]
Drummond then tried visiting the [[Royal Docks]] in the hope of finding a ship that would take her on. Eventually on such a visit a donkeyman,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A donkeyman was a crewman who operated and maintained machinery other than the ship's main engines. His exact responsibilities varied widely between different ships.&lt;/ref&gt; who had served with her on ''Mulbera'' 12 years earlier, recognised Drummond in a café. He and his shipmates advised her that if no British company would take her she should try for a berth on a foreign ship. They introduced her to a representative of Palestine Maritime Lloyd, owned by a group of Jewish businessmen based in [[Haifa]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. He was sceptical of signing a woman engineer until he saw her papers. Palestine Maritime Lloyd operated mostly [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]] of {{GRT|200}} to {{GRT|300}}, but had also one small deep-sea cargo and passenger ship, the {{GRT|2508}} {{SS|Har Zion||2}} ([[Mount Zion]]), that which could carry both cargo and 110 passengers. ''Har Zion'' needed a new Second Engineer so he immediately offered Drummond a berth{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=178}} at a salary of £41 10s.&lt;ref name=Drummond184&gt;{{harvnb|Drummond|1994|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Har Zion'' was registered at [[Famagusta]] in the British [[Modern history of Cyprus#Cyprus as a Protectorate|Protectorate of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hma.org.il/Museum/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=84&amp;FID=1753&amp;PID=5095 |title=Har Zion |publisher=Haifa Museums: National Maritime Museum |work=Hebrew Shipping Database |accessdate=21 January 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218064246/http://www.hma.org.il/Museum/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=84&amp;FID=1753&amp;PID=5095 |archive-date=18 February 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her officers and crew were a mixture of Arab, Czech, Egyptian, German, Hungarian, Russian, Spanish, and the ship's dog was Polish.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=179}} She was built in 1907 and by 1940 was in poor condition. Drummond mastered disciplinary problems among the engine room crew{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=180}} and then in [[drydock]] in [[Port of Antwerp|Antwerp]] completed enough furnace and boiler repairs for ''Har Zion'' to pass its Lloyd's Certificate inspection.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=180–181}}

In Antwerp ''Har Zion'' took on a Greek Third Engineer who clashed with Drummond. The ship worked to Beirut, Haifa and back, and on its return trip evacuated the British Consul and part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] from [[Marseille]]&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; to [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=183–184}} When the ship returned to London in July 1940 Drummond left to get away from the Third Engineer.&lt;ref name=Drummond184/&gt; About a month later, in August 1940, ''Har Zion'' was sunk in the [[Western Approaches]] by the {{GS|U-38|1938|6}}, with the loss of 36 of the 37 people aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/503.html |last=Helgason |first=Guðmundur |title=Har Zion |work=Ships hit by U-boats |publisher=uboat.net |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bonita''===
In August 1940 a [[Panama]]nian company, ''Compañía Arena Limitada'', gave Drummond a berth on its {{GRT|4929}} cargo ship {{SS|Bonita||2}} at a salary of £46 10s — £5 a month more than on ''Har Zion''.&lt;ref name=Drummond184/&gt; Drummond joined her at [[Fowey]] in [[Cornwall]] where the ship loaded [[Kaolinite|china clay]]&lt;ref name=Drummond184/&gt; for the USA. Being a neutral ship she was not offered the protection of a place in a [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=186}}

On the morning of Sunday 25 August 1940 ''Bonita'' was in the North Atlantic about {{convert|400|mi}} from land when ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]] aircraft attacked.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Drummond was on watch and immediately ordered the fireman and greaser to join her on the starting platform ready in case they needed to escape. Near misses from {{convert|250|kg|abbr=on|sing=on}} bombs blew all the lagging off the pipes in the engine room and split the main water service pipe feeding the boilers. Fuel oil started leaking from somewhere, hitting Drummond in the face and closing one of her eyes. She ordered her fireman and greaser to open the fuel injectors and main steam throttle to increase speed and then get out of the engine room in case they needed to abandon ship.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=187}}

Drummond remained alone at her post. ''Bonita'' had never before exceeded {{convert|9|kn|km/h}} but in 10 minutes Drummond somehow increased speed to {{convert|12.5|kn|km/h|0}}.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=189}} The Master, a Captain Herz from Hungary, used the extra speed to change course sharply and avoid being hit whenever a Condor bombed the ship. The bombs were heavy enough to lift ''Bonita'' in the water and cause damage even by near misses. The ship was hit by both {{convert|13|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} machine-gun fire. Drummond says 25 bombs were dropped;{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=188}} this suggests that six or seven aircraft took part in the attack, which continued for 30–35 minutes.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=186}}{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=189}} ''Bonita'' continued her crossing without further incident and reached [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 8 September.&lt;ref name=Drummond191&gt;{{harvnb|Drummond|1994|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; There Drummond received news that The Studio at 143 Kennington Road had been bombed but Frances and Jean were safe.&lt;ref name=Drummond192&gt;{{harvnb|Drummond|1994|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rquote|right|She is about the most courageous woman I ever saw. She seems to be without fear or nerves, is very good at her job and has an uncanny power over engines, for which I once thanked God.''{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=189}}}}
Aboard ''Bonita'' Drummond formed a close friendship with another married man, the [[Chief mate|First Mate]] Mr Warner. In a published account of her conduct in the air raid, Warner described Drummond as ''"about the most courageous woman I ever saw"''.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=189}} Newspapers in Norfolk, VA quoted Captain Herz commending Drummond as ''"one of the most competent engineers ever employed on this vessel".&lt;ref name=Drummond191/&gt;

In Norfolk, Drummond made friends with a Virginian woman, Mrs Julia Davies, who was engaged in charitable work collecting goods to send to Britain that were in short supply because of the War.&lt;ref name=Drummond191/&gt; Davies engaged Drummond as a speaker at charitable events, and in return directed to Lambeth much of the goods that her charitable network was collecting.
&lt;ref name=Drummond192/&gt;

At Norfolk ''Bonita'' discharged her china clay and loaded scrap iron. The ship made her return crossing ''via'' [[Halifax Port Authority|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], where she joined an eastbound convoy.&lt;ref name=Drummond191/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drummond192/&gt; The oil-burning ship was unable to stop making black smoke, which made her dangerously conspicuous.&lt;ref name=Drummond192/&gt; When the third or fourth engineer were on watch the ship lost speed and fell behind the convoy. Whenever Drummond was on watch the ship managed to increase speed and regain her station.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=192–194}}

===Developments ashore===
By Christmas 1941 Drummond's sisters Jean and Frances were preparing to move into a flat in Restormel House, Chester Way, Kennington.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=196}}

By 1941 Drummond had qualified as a [[Panama]]nian chief engineer. These examinations were a purely written paper, with the gender or status of the candidate not being known to the examiners.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} By then the Board of Trade had failed her for Chief Engineer 31 times. Due to the needs of war the Board of Trade was now granting Chief Engineer certificates to experienced Second Engineers on the sole basis of an oral examination. However, when Drummond requested this dispensation the Board refused. Because of the dangers of war, the Board patronisingly suggested that Drummond take a shore job as an instructor. Drummond replied firmly that numerous Chief and other engineers with whom she had served had lacked the nerve to cope while under enemy attack, and therefore the best service she could give was as a Chief Engineer at sea.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=197–198}}

In about April 1941, Drummond learnt that Mrs Davies in Virginia had raised £400 toward the provision of a "Victoria A. Drummond Ambulance" for the people of Lambeth. In raising funds Davies and a Mrs Leitch had even enlisted the poet [[Robert Frost]] to give a public reading of his works. However, what Lambeth needed more was a [[British Restaurant]] for people who had been bombed out of their homes. Accordingly, the "Victoria A. Drummond Canteen" was opened in [[Westminster Bridge Road]] near [[Lambeth North tube station]]. The canteen served hot meals for sixpence a head{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=201}} and remained open for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref name="ClanMcFarlan"/&gt;

For her courage aboard ''Bonita'' Drummond was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35214 |page=3964 |date=9 July 1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea]]&lt;ref name=Plimsoll/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C10818957 |title=Merchant Navy Awards |work=[[The London Gazette]] |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=9 July 1941 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/55/a8649255.shtml |last=de Neumann |first=Bernard |title=Lloyd’s War Medal for Bravery at Sea (Part One) |work=WW2 People's War |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=19 January 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 1941. Her MBE was presented by [[George VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=News in Brief: The King's Investiture |work=The Times |date=30 July 1941 |location=London |pages=7 |issue=48991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Czikos''===
In February 1941 Warner and Drummond signed on as Captain and Second Engineer of an old Panamanian steamship, {{SS|Czikos||2}}.{{sfn|Drummond|196}} The ship was in [[Lisbon]] so a skeleton crew including Warner and Drummond sailed out to join her on [[Yeoward Brothers]]' passenger liner {{SS|Avoceta||2}}.{{sfn|Drummond|198}} They sailed ''Czikos'' to Gibraltar, where they joined a convoy bound for the [[Firth of Clyde]]. About {{convert|300|mi}} northwest of Ireland a ''Luftwaffe'' Fw 200 Condor attacked ''Czikos''.{{sfn|Drummond|199}} As with ''Bonita'', none of the bombs hit but the near misses damaged the ship. The Condor also machine-gunned the ship, killing a quartermaster at the helm and wounding two other crewmen.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;{{sfn|Drummond|200}}

===''Manchester Port''===
[[File:ManchesterPort.jpg|thumb|Manchester Liners' {{SS|Manchester Port||2}}, on which Drummond was Fifth Engineer in 1942]]
In April 1942 Drummond joined [[Manchester Liners]]' {{GRT|7071}} {{SS|Manchester Port||2}} in Liverpool as Fifth Engineer. The ship was unkempt and filthy, including the galley, the food was ill-served and the Master, Captain Davis, seemed permanently drunk. Nevertheless, ''Manchester Port'' was made Commodore Ship for [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]] [[ON convoys|ON]] 89 to North America.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=203}} The ship survived the crossing and on 17 May loaded [[dynamite]] at [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]]. On 20 May the ship reached Halifax to join an eastbound convoy. Drummond reported Davis for drunkenness and on 21 May he was removed under police escort, replaced by a Captain Middleton. ''Manchester Port'' joined convoy [[HX convoys|HX]] 191, which left Halifax on 24 May and reached Liverpool on 6 June. The ship discharged her explosive cargo in Manchester and Drummond returned to her sisters in Lambeth.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=205}}

===''Danae II''===
At the end of August 1942 Drummond and Warner joined the {{GRT|2660}} cargo steamer {{SS|Danae II||2}} at [[Boston, Lincolnshire]] as First Mate and Second Engineer. The ship was owned by the [[Ministry of War Transport]] and managed by Ambrose, Davies and Matthews, who had chosen someone else for Second Engineer.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=206}} The [[Second assistant engineer|Third]] and [[Third assistant engineer|Fourth Engineer]]s were unqualified. The Master, Captain Cheek, the Chief Engineer and either the third or fourth engineer were all heavy drinkers.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=206–207}} Drummond called ''Danae II'' "The worst ship I ever sailed in".{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=205}}

The ship steamed north ''via'' [[North Shields]] in [[Northumberland]] to [[Methil Docks]] in [[Fife]]. There Cheek tried to give Drummond her notice on medical grounds, but doctor ashore stopped him.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=206}} When the ship reached [[Aultbea]] in [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]] Cheek sacked Drummond with 24 hours' notice, although she had signed on for two years. The firemen, greasers and donkeyman all refused to sail without Drummond, and so did the deck crew. Her friend Warner, however, refused to leave the ship, leaving Drummond feeling betrayed.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=207}}

Drummond reported the mismanagement of ''Danae II'' to the MoWT and Ambrose, Davies and Matthews. Cheek's solicitors threatened to sue Drummond for defamation, but no action followed.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=207}}

===''Perseus''===
At the end of January 1943 Drummond returned to Blue Funnel, signing on as refrigeration engineer on the {{GRT|10286}} [[Reefer ship|refrigerated cargo ship]] {{ship|TSS|Perseus||2}}. Again Drummond was beset by a hostile Second Engineer always being rude to her, giving her extra work and trying to prevent her from getting shore leave.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=210}}{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=214}}

''Perseus'' circumnavigated the World westbound from Liverpool ''via'' [[Port of New York and New Jersey|New York]], [[Cuba]], the [[Panama Canal]], [[Australia]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Gibraltar]], returning to Liverpool in September 1943.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=208–220}} In July 1943 the ship visited [[Port of Cape Town|Cape Town]], where Drummond was able to go ashore and visit her friend Malcolm Quayle's grave outside the city.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=216}}

After an eight-month voyage Drummond did not want to return to sea immediately. After leaving ''Perseus'' in September 1943 she returned to her sisters in Lambeth, where Restormel House had been damaged by a bomb but their flat remained intact. Drummond did not seek another position at sea until January 1944.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=220}}

===''Karabagh''===
In April 1944 Drummond signed on as Assistant Engineer of a diesel ship, the Baltic Trading Company's {{GRT|6427}} [[oil tanker]] {{ship|MT|Karabagh||2}}, with which she sailed on an [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]] to [[Onega, Russia|Onega]] in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. On return to England in May 1944 Drummond signed onto ''Karabagh'' again as Fourth Engineer.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=221}} After [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] on 6 June 1944 the tanker spent three months shuttling supplies such as [[aviation spirit]] across the [[English Channel]] for the [[Invasion of Normandy]], initially from the [[Solent]] and later from [[Newport, Wales]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=222–223}}

Drummond formed a friendship with ''Karabagh''{{'}}s Master, a man from [[Northern Ireland]] called Captain Charlton. In Newport the two took occasional trips ashore, and once on a visit to [[Tintern Abbey]] he proposed to her. She did not accept, and later explained that this was because both he and she had short tempers.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=222}}

==Post-war years==
After the War the bomb-damaged Restormel House was demolished. In December 1945 and January 1946 Drummond's sisters Jean and Frances moved into 160 Kennington Road, which they named [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=226}}

[[File:StateLibQld 1 169059 Rhexenor (ship).jpg|thumb|{{MV|Rhexenor|1945|2}}, one of two Blue Funnel ships whose completion Drummond supervised at Caledon's yard in Dundee]]
In April 1946 Blue Funnel appointed Drummond to return to Caledon in Dundee to supervise the completion of the {{GRT|10200}} [[sister ship]]s {{MV|Rhexenor|1945|2}} and {{MV|Stentor|1946|2}}, which she did until July.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=227}}

''Karabagh'' had given Drummond enough experience to take her Second Engineer's motor examination. She passed in May 1946 on her second attempt. In September Drummond returned to sea as Second Engineer, now with [[Cunard-White Star Line]]. She worked as a relief Second Engineer, serving for short periods on Cunard cargo ships until January 1947.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=229}} After leaving Cunard she served on the MoWT's {{GRT|5028}} [[Type C1 ship]] {{MV|Hickory Mount||2}} for five months, signing on in May 1947 at [[Fowey]] in [[Cornwall]], leaving in September in [[Port of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and returning to Britain as a passenger on Cunard's {{RMS|Aquitania}}.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=230}}

For the next four years Drummond worked as Chief or Second Engineer for short periods for various shipping companies. They included ''[[SS Wilhelm Russ|Elsie Beth]]'', which she joined at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], South Wales in August 1949 and left in [[Dublin]] in December. The voyage took Drummond back to Onega in the USSR,{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=235–237}} where she had previously been in 1944 on ''Karabagh''.

In February 1952 Drummond returned to supervising shilbuilding in Scotland. The Phocian Ship Agency sent her to the [[Burntisland Shipbuilding Company]] in Fife to oversee building of the {{GRT|8453}} {{MV|Master Nicos||2}} until the ship was launched in September.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=240–241}} Drummond would have liked further jobs supervising shipbuilding, but instead Phocian offered her a berth on the {{GRT|10000}} {{SS|Markab||2}}. She spent a month on ''Markab'' as Second Engineer in October and November 1952, then returned to the ship as Chief Engineer in January 1953.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=242}} This turned out to be a year-long voyage that included the Suez Canal, Japan, [[Port of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Port of Singapore|Singapore]], the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the USA, the Caribbean, Argentina, Brazil, [[Cape Verde]] and ended in Antwerp in January 1954.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=242–265}}

Drummond next spent another three years serving for short periods for various shipping companies. Then in April 1957 in [[Port of London|London]] she signed on Monarch Steamship Company's {{GRT|5806}} {{MV|British Monarch|1954|2}}.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=280}} This turned out to be a six-month voyage: across the Atlantic to the USA, through the Panama Canal, across the Pacific to Japan, south to [[Fiji]], north to [[British Columbia]] and back through the Panama Canal, back across the Atlantic and ending in Liverpool in November 1957.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=280–283}}

Drummond returned home to Kennington Road until May 1958, when she began a two-month voyage as the engineer of an old motor yacht, ''My Adventuress'', from Southampton to Istanbul. The engine was unreliable and Drummond's relationship with the owner and his family was strained.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=283–286}} Thereafter she stayed ashore in Kennington for another year.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=287}}

==Jebshun Shipping Company==

===''Grelrosa / Shantae''===
Drummond spent her final three years at sea as a Chief Engineer with the [[Jebshun Shipping Company]] of Hong Kong. Her first Jebshun ship was the {{GRT|7085}} former [[Empire ship]] ''[[SS Empire Guinevere|Grelrosa]]'', which Drummond joined in [[Garston, Merseyside]], Liverpool in July 1959. The ship had been laid up for 18 months and needed extensive work to pass its [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] inspection.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=287}} ''Grelrosa'' steamed ''via'' the Suez Canal and Singapore to Japan, China and Hong Kong, where Jebshun renamed her ''Shantae''.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=288–301}}

As ''Shantae'' in 1960 the ship sailed to Malaysia and Thailand. In February 1960 in [[Bangkok Port]] the ship loaded a flammable mixed cargo of rice, firewood, paper, cotton, palm husks, charcoal, flour and palm oil, all carelessly and chaotically packed into the holds. On top of this, 580 head of live [[Bubalus|buffalo]] were crammed on as deck cargo.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=308–309}} ''En route'' to Hong Kong on 1 March the cargo in number 2 hold caught fire. Drummond provided steam to smother and contain the fire, but this depleted the ship's water supply which was needed to make steam to power the main engine.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=310}} ''Shantae'' reached Hong Kong on 3 March, where the port's fire service used [[carbon dioxide]] gas to extinguish the fire.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=311}} The ship returned to sea 11 days later, trading to Chinese ports including [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]]. Drummond signed off at Hong Kong in mid-April.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=313–315}}

===''Shun Fung''===
Drummond's next Jebshun vessel was the {{GRT|7148}} [[Park ship]] ''[[SS Simcoe Park|Shun Fung]]'', which she joined in [[Kristiansand]], Norway in September 1960.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=316}} This was another steamship that had been laid up and needed work to make her reliable.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=317}} Drummond served on her for 14 months, sailing ''via'' the Suez Canal to Japan and China, then ''via'' Durban to West Africa, back to Hong Kong, then to India, and back ''via'' Singapore and Chinese ports to Hong Kong, where she signed off in November 1961.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=318–334}}

===''Santa Granda''===
Drummond's final Jebshun ship, and the final vessel of her career, was the {{GRT|7284}} [[Liberty ship]] ''[[SS Samfleet|Santa Granda]]''. Only 10 days after signing off ''Shun Fung'' in Hong Kong she signed on ''Santa Granda'' for six months.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=335}} She found ''Santa Granda'' to be in very poor condition: rusty, dirty{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=336}} and in poor repair. The [[Governor (device)|governor]], a vital piece of safety equipment, was missing from the engine.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=341}}{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=343}}

''Santa Granda'' worked to [[Port of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and then [[Basuo]] on [[Hainan]] Island, where it loaded iron ore in December 1961. The ship left port on 8 December, and by midnight was struggling against a strong headwind. The next day water was found in the Number one hold [[bilge]], which took an hour and a half to pump out. On 11 December the Number one hold bilge again needed pumping out, which took an hour and three quarters. From 12 December the Number one hold bilge needed pumping continuously.

Finally on 13 December the Master and Drummond inspected the Number One hold. They found about 10 frames adrift, a plate near the bulkhead split either side of the frame, and frames corroded through at the bottom and broken across. With the motion of the ship, plates and frames were moving past each other and friction was heating the metal. If a plate failed and flooded Number One hold, the Number One bulkhead would be likely to fail. In that case, and laden with dense iron ore, ''Santa Granda'' would be likely to sink within a very few minutes.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|pp=339–340}}

''Santa Granda'' initially made for Shanghai, until the Number One Hold's bulkhead began to buckle. Then the Master put the ship about for [[Huangpu, Zhongshan|Whampoa]] on the [[Pearl River Delta]], arriving on 17 December.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=341}} After the iron ore was unloaded, ship surveyors allowed the damaged ''Santa Granda'' to leave to make for Hong Kong for repairs. Christmas was spent in Hong Kong, with Drummond arguing against Jebshun representatives who wanted to postpone many of the repairs essential to make the ship safe.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=342}} Drummond began engine and boiler repairs, and on 29 December the ship moved to drydock in [[Kowloon]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=343}}

A fortgnight later ''Santa Granda'' returned to sea,{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=344}} continuing to take cargoes of iron ore from Basuo to other Chinese ports. On 25 March 1962 Drummond advised that the ship was still in too poor a condition to pass its forthcoming Lloyd's inspection.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=349}} Two days later ''Santa Granda'' reached Hong Kong, where Jebshun told the Master they would transfer the insurance from Lloyd's to a French company. Drummond believed this was to avoid inspection, and on 30 March she gave the Master her notice that she would quit the ship the next day.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=350}} Then Drummond spent 10 days in Hong Kong and visited friends in Japan before returning to London and retirement.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=351}}

==Retirement==
Drummond and her two sisters spent the next 12 years living at 160 Kennington Road. She attended annual meetings of the [[Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology|Institute of Marine Engineers]] (now IMarEST) and wrote her life story. In the early 1970s Drummond grew less mobile and more dependent on Jean and Frances. In 1974 she fell out of bed, broke her leg and was admitted to [[St Thomas' Hospital]].{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=353}} Soon Jean and Frances were admitted to the same hospital, where they died within two days of each other.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=354}} Drummond recovered physically but her state of mind deteriorated and she was discharged to St George's Retreat, a church-run nursing home at [[Ditchling Common]] in East Sussex. She died there on Christmas Day 1978, and is buried at [[Megginch Castle]] beside her parents and sisters.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In a career spanning 40 years Drummond made 49 ocean-going voyages. She persevered with her career through hardship and some discrimination, doing the hard physical work of the engine room, managing the engine room crew&lt;ref name=Plimsoll&gt;{{cite web |title=Victoria Drummond (1894–1978) |work=Port Cities Southampton |publisher=[[University of Southampton]] |url= http://www.plimsoll.org/Galleries/Biographies/victoriadrummond/default.asp |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at times enduring prejudice and discrimination from some of her immediate superiors. However, she won acceptance and support from most of her fellow-officers and near-universal support and loyalty from crewmen.

She is commemorated by a Victoria Drummond Room at the IMarEST headquarters in London.{{sfn|Drummond|1994|p=353}} Her biography, ''The Remarkable Life of Victoria Drummond – Marine Engineer'', was written by her niece, [[Cherry Drummond, 16th Baroness Strange]].

The '''Wall of Discovery''' is an environmental artwork that includes a 253-foot-long printed "blackboard" located in the center of the [http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/discovery/index.html Scholars Walk] on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus. This installation was designed to celebrate the discoveries, inventions and creations of alumni and faculty of the University that have brought significant changes to the world in which we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/discovery/index.html|title=University of Minnesota: Scholars Walk|website=www.scholarswalk.umn.edu|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method used to capture the work was first to create an extensive list of notable U of M graduates in as many fields as possible. Extensive research was done by [[Minneapolis]] design firm [[LA ink]] that led to the finding of many original hand written notes and diagrams chronicling the discoveries by these scholars. The documents were then [[Image scanning|scanned]] and [[Image editing|retouched]], pixel by pixel, until they looked as if they were rendered in chalk on a chalkboard. 20 Glass edge lit panels were also designed to both illuminate the walkway and possibly inspire current students toward future discoveries.

An installation of this nature has never before been attempted by a major institution like the University of Minnesota.

The Artwork was submitted to the SEGD design competition in 2007 and won their "Honor Award" the highest achievement category. That same year it also received the AIA Minnesota Honor Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://segd.org/content/wall-discovery|title=Wall of Discovery|last=Makowski|first=Ann|date=2013-10-28|website=segd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
