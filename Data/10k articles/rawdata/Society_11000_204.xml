On 24 January 2008 [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Romano Prodi]] lost a [[Motion of Confidence|vote of confidence]] in the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] by a vote of 161 to 156 votes, causing the downfall of his [[Prodi II Cabinet|government]].&lt;ref name="BBC loses"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208000.stm | title = Prodi loses crucial Senate vote  | publisher = [[BBC]] | author =   | date = 2008-01-24 | accessdate = 2008-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080127160315/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208000.stm| archivedate= 27 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prodi's resignation led President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] to request the president of the Senate, [[Franco Marini]], to assess the possibility to form a [[caretaker government]]. The other possibility would have been to call for early elections immediately. Marini acknowledged impossibility to form an interim government due to the unavailability of the centre-right parties, and [[Italian general election, 2008|early elections]] were scheduled for 13 April and 14 April 2008.

==Background==
Prodi had at the time been in office for 20 months, after winning the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 general election]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/world/europe/24italy.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title = Italy Backs Its Coalition but Only Just for Now | work = [[The New York Times]] | author = Ian Fisher | date = 2008-01-24 | accessdate = 2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, the Prime Minister handed in his resignation, only to be asked to remain by the President, and winning a vote of confidence in the Parliament.&lt;ref name="BBC struggles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6406487.stm | title = Prodi's fragile bloc struggles on | publisher = [[BBC]] | author =  | date = 2007-02-28 | accessdate = 2008-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080129132600/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6406487.stm| archivedate= 29 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prodi had built his government around a [[Coalition government|coalition]] called [[The Union (Italy)|The Union]], which consisted of a large number of smaller parties. This situation was in turn the result of an electoral system of proportional representation, due to legislation passed by Berlusconi three months before he lost power.&lt;ref name="BBC glee"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7208705.stm | title = Will Italian opposition's glee last? | publisher = [[BBC]] | author = Christian Fraser | date = 2008-01-25 | accessdate = 2008-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080129130708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7208705.stm| archivedate= 29 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was when the leader of one of these lesser parties, [[Italian Minister of Justice|Justice Minister]] [[Clemente Mastella]] of the [[Union of Democrats for Europe]] (UDEUR), came under investigation for corruption that the coalition started to break up. When the media reported an extensive corruption investigation involving Mastella and his wife – an UDEUR politician in [[Campania]] – Mastella resigned.&lt;ref name="BBC resigns"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7191413.stm | title = Italian justice minister resigns | publisher = [[BBC]] | author =  | date = 2008-01-16 | accessdate = 2008-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119174714/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7191413.stm| archivedate= 19 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After first promising to support the government, he later retracted this support, and his party followed, in part also due to pressure from the [[Holy See|Vatican]], for which the government's proposed laws in regards to [[registered partnership]]s of same-sex couples, and other liberal reforms were objectionable.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1706790,00.html?xid=rss-world |title=How An Italian Government Falls |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |author=[[Jeff Israely]] |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2008-01-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129005649/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1706790%2C00.html?xid=rss-world |archivedate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clemente Mastella.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Clemente Mastella]]
The decision of former Minister of Justice Mastella arrived a few days after the confirmation of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] which confirmed the [[Referendum in Italy|referendum]] to modify the electoral system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1685828620080116 "Italian court okays referendum on election law"] Reuters, January 16th 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As stated many times by Minister Mastella, if the referendum would have been confirmed this would lead directly to the fall of the government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2007/04_Aprile/10/legge_elettorale_mastella_referendum.shtml "Legge elettorale, Mastella minaccia la crisi"] ''Corriere della Sera'', April 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200704articoli/20302girata.asp "Mastella: Se c'è referendum si rischia la crisi di governo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828192601/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200704articoli/20302girata.asp |date=2007-08-28 }} ''La Stampa'', April 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
and it happened.&lt;br/&gt; The fall of the government would disrupt a pending election-law referendum that if passed would make it harder for small parties like Mastella's to gain seats in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aEv_XkZP2lg0&amp;refer=home "Prodi Likely to Quit, Prompt Vote or Election Reform"] Bloomberg.com
&lt;/ref&gt;

UDEUR's defection forced the question of whether Prodi still had the parliamentarian support to govern. Presenting a [[motion of confidence]] to parliament, he won relatively easily in the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]], the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], where the coalition's majority was substantial.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Yet a win in the [[upper house]] – or Senate – seemed unlikely, and [[President of Italy|President]] [[Giorgio Napolitano]] was said to have warned against going through with the vote.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The vote, held between 3pm and 9pm ([[Central European Time|CET]]), was heated and dramatic.&lt;ref name="Corriere cade"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_24/mussi_elezioni_anticipate_0aa4638e-ca5c-11dc-bbdc-0003ba99c667.shtml | title = Prodi sconfitto in Senato: cade il governo, Il premier al Quirinale per le dimissioni | publisher = [[Corriere della Sera]] | author =  | date = 2008-01-24 | accessdate = 2008-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125083737/http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_24/mussi_elezioni_anticipate_0aa4638e-ca5c-11dc-bbdc-0003ba99c667.shtml| archivedate= 25 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its course the UDEUR party Senator [[Stefano Cusumano]] decided to confirm the confidence and to support the prime minister, even against the orders of his party's leader. Cusumano was subsequently subjected to the abuse of his colleagues, being called an "hysterical faggot", "traitor", and reportedly spat on by a member of the conservative UDEUR party. At this point Cusumano apparently fainted, and was carried out on a stretcher.&lt;ref name="Corriere Cusumano"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_24/cusumano_nuccio_udeur_02cef526-ca8d-11dc-bbdc-0003ba99c667.shtml | title = Cusumano si dissocia: voto sì.

==Attempts at a resolution==
[[Image:Franco Marini 4.jpg|right|thumb|Franco Marini]]
On 30 January 2008, Napolitano appointed [[Franco Marini]] to try to form a caretaker government with the goal of changing the current electoral system, rather than call a quick election.&lt;ref name="Corriere Marini"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_30/casini_no_marini_6ef4ecdc-cf16-11dc-8e3f-0003ba99c667.shtml | title = Crisi, Napolitano incarica Marini | publisher = [[Corriere della Sera]] | author =  | date = 2008-01-30 | accessdate = 2008-01-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131081433/http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_30/casini_no_marini_6ef4ecdc-cf16-11dc-8e3f-0003ba99c667.shtml| archivedate= 31 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of the [[Voting system|electoral system]] had been under criticism not only within the outgoing government, but also among the opposition and in the general population, because of the impossibility to choose candidates directly and of the risks that a close-call election would not lead to a stable majority in the Senate.

After Marini was given the mandate, two politicians ([[Bruno Tabacci]] and [[Mario Baccini]]) splintered from the [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC) to form the [[The Rose for Italy|White Rose]], while two leading members of the [[Forza Italia]] faction [[Liberal-Popular Union|Liberal Popular Union]] ([[Ferdinando Adornato]] and [[Angelo Sanza]]) switched allegiance to the UDC. On 4 February, the [[Liberal Populars]] (an UDC faction which favours merging with Forza Italia) seceded from UDC to join Berlusconi's [[The People of Freedom|People of Freedom]] later this year.

On 4 February 2008 Marini acknowledged that he had failed to find the necessary majority for an interim government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20080204-1053-italy-government-.html SignOnSanDiego.com &gt; News &gt; World - Italy Senate speaker fails to form govt, vote looms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212162718/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20080204-1053-italy-government-.html |date=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and resigned his mandate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hemscott.com/news/latest-news/item.do?newsId=58999966030362 Italy's Marini says no majority for electoral reform govt, resigns mandate | Latest News | News | Hemscott&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; after having met with all major political forces and having found opposition to forming an interim government mainly from center-right parties [[Forza Italia]] and [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], favoured in a possible next election and strongly in favour of an early vote.,&lt;ref name="Corriere No"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_30/berlusconi_subito_voto_legge_elettorale_non_va_cambiata_f651eab4-cf5b-11dc-8e3f-0003ba99c667.shtml | title = "A Marini diremo: "subito al voto"" | publisher = [[Corriere della Sera]] | author =  | date = 2008-01-30 | accessdate = 2008-01-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080203113620/http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_30/berlusconi_subito_voto_legge_elettorale_non_va_cambiata_f651eab4-cf5b-11dc-8e3f-0003ba99c667.shtml| archivedate= 3 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Napolitano summoned Bertinotti and Marini, the two speakers of the houses of the Italian parliament, acknowledging the end of the legislature, on 5 February 2008.&lt;ref name="Ansa scioglimento"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_12342748.html |title=DOMANI LO SCIOGLIMENTO DELLE CAMERE |publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] |author= |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204214404/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_12342748.html |archivedate=2008-02-04 |language=it |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He dissolved parliament on 6 February 2008.

'''Acoli''' are a Nilo-Shemetic Luo [[ethnic group]] from the eastern part of [[South Sudan]] [[Magwi County]] and [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Uganda]] (an area commonly referred to as '''Acoliland'''), including the districts of [[Agago District|Agago]], [[Amuru District|Amuru]], [[Gulu District|Gulu]], [[Kitgum District|Kitgum]], [[Nwoya District|Nwoya]], Lamwo, and [[Pader District|Pader]]. Approximately 1.17 million Acoli were counted in the Uganda census of 2002, and 45,000 more were living in South Sudan in 2000.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;Lewis, M. Paul (ed.). [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ach "Acholi."] [[Ethnologue|''Ethnologue: Languages of the World.'']] SIL International, September, 2010. Accessed 10 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{main article|Acoli language}}

The Acoli dialect is a [[Western Nilotic languages|Western Nilotic]] language, classified as [[Luo languages|Luo]] (or Lwo). It is [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Lango language (Uganda)|Lango]], [[Alur dialect|Alur]] and other Luo languages. The Luo language and dialect is spoken by the Luo groups who are currently settled in various locations including western [[Kenya]], Eastern [[Uganda]], Acoliland, [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile]] in Uganda, and [[South Sudan]].

The ''[[Song of Lawino]]'', one of the most successful African literary works, was written by [[Okot p'Bitek]] in Acholi, and later translated to [[English language|English]].

==Location==
[[File:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|Acholiland, Uganda]]

Acholiland or "Acoli-land" (also known as the Acoli sub-region) is a necessarily inexact ethnolinguistic taxonomy that refers to the region traditionally inhabited by the Acoli.  In the administrative structure of Uganda, Acoli is composed of the [[Districts of Uganda|districts]] of:

# [[Agago District|Agago]]
# [[Amuru District|Amuru]]
# [[Gulu District|Gulu]]
# [[Kitgum District|Kitgum]]
# [[Lamwo District|Lamwo]]
# [[Nwoya District|Nwoya]]
# [[Pader District|Pader]]
Under the decentralisation policy of the government, creation of another district, Omoro, is in the offing. It encompasses about 28,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11,000 square miles) near the Uganda-Sudan border.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Ronald R. "The Evolution of Ethnicity among the Acholi of Uganda: The Precolonial Phase." ''Ethnohistory'' 1989: 36(1), p.20).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its current population is estimated to be around 600,000 individuals, or four per cent of the total national population.&lt;ref&gt;Doom, Ruddy and Koen Vlassenroot. "Kony's Message: A New Koine?". ''Africa Affairs'' 1999: 98(390), p.7).&lt;/ref&gt; While Acoli also live north of the [[South Sudan]]ese border, the Sudanese Acoli are often excluded from the political meaning of the term "Acoliland".

The word 'Acoli' is a misnomer that became adopted for convenience over the years. It refers to people known locally as ''Luo Gang''. That is why the Lango neighbours refer to the Acoli as ''Ugangi,'' meaning people of the home.

==History==
{{see also|Luo peoples}}

The Acoli migrated south to Northern Uganda from the area now known as [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] in [[South Sudan]] by about 1,000 AD. Starting in the late seventeenth century, a new sociopolitical order developed among the Luo of Northern Uganda, mainly characterized by the formation of [[chiefdom]]s headed by ''Rwodi'' (sg. Rwot, 'ruler'). The chiefs traditionally came from one [[clan]], and each chiefdom had several villages made up of different [[patrilineal]] clans. By the mid-nineteenth century, about 60 small chiefdoms existed in eastern Acoliland.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; During the second half of the nineteenth century, [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking traders from the north started to call them ''Shooli'', a term which was transformed into 'Acholi'.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Their traditional communities were organised hamlets of circular huts with high peaked rooves, furnished with a mud sleeping-platform, jars of grain and a sunken fireplace. Women daubed the walls with mud, decorating them with geometrical or conventional designs in red, white or grey. The men were skilled hunters, using nets and spears. They also kept [[goat]]s, [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. The women were accomplished agriculturists, growing and processing a variety of food crops, including [[millet]], [[sesame|simsim]], groundnuts, peas, [[sorghum]] and vegetables. In war, the men used spears and long, narrow shields of giraffe or ox hide.

During Uganda's [[History of Uganda|colonial period]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] encouraged political and economic development in the south of the country, in particular among the [[Baganda]]. In contrast, the Acoli and other northern ethnic groups supplied much of the national manual labour and came to comprise a majority of the military, creating what some have called a "military [[ethnocracy]]".

Many of the Acoli soldiers who joined the [[Kings African Rifles]] (KAR), the British colonial army, were deployed to the frontlines in central Asia especially in Singapore and Burma  during the World War II where  they held British positions against an intense Japanese offensive. Notable among the Acoli soldiers who made the ranks were Gen. [[Tito Okello]]-Lutwa, Brig. Pyerino Okoya and Lt. Gen [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]].

Due to a changing economy, after the 1950s, fewer Acoli were recruited to the armed forces, but continued to be associated with them in popular mythology and stereotypes.&lt;ref name="conflict" /&gt;

In the 2000s, James Ojent Latigo  described some of Uganda's social problems as based on the way the political elites have used ethnicities to divide the country. He has noted that the emphasis on distinction among ethnic groups has even been part of the internal government dialogue." He wrote, "Part of the structural causes of the conflict in Uganda has been explained as rooted in the ‘diversity of ethnic groups which were at different levels of socio-economic development and political organisation.’ (Ugandan Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs 1997.)&lt;ref name="conflict"/&gt;

He has written further, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Since independence in 1962, Uganda has been plagued by ethnically driven, politically manipulated violence referred to by some as a history of ‘cycles of revenge and mistrust’. Deep-rooted divisions and polarization remain between different ethnic groups, and these have been greatly exacerbated by the way in which the country’s leadership has developed since independence."&lt;ref name="conflict"&gt;[http://www.idea.int/publications/traditional_justice/upload/Chapter_4_Northern_Uganda_tradition-based_practices_in_the_Acholi_region.pdf James Ojent Latigo, Chapter 4: "Northern Uganda tradition-based practices in the Acholi region, 1. The conflict"], pp. 85-89, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[Milton Obote]], the first leader after independence, relied on Acoli and [[Langi people|Langi]] [[Luo people]] in government. [[Idi Amin]] was also from north Uganda, but was of the [[Kakwa people]]. He overthrew Obote's government and established a dictatorship, ultimately suppressing and killing 300,000 persons, including many Acoli.&lt;ref name="minority"/&gt; General [[Tito Okello]] was an Acoli, and came to power in a military coup.  He was defeated in January 1986. Despite the years of leadership by men from the North, that region continued to be marginalized economically after independence, and has suffered higher rates of poverty than other areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Latigo (2006), "Northern Uganda", p. 90-92&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating Okello and his Acoli-dominated [[Uganda National Liberation Army]], now-President [[Yoweri Museveni]] and his [[National Resistance Army]] conducted revenge killings in the north. Museveni has held absolute power since, surviving unrest, civil war, and numerous attempts at coups.&lt;ref name="minority"/&gt;

The Acoli are known to the outside world mainly because of the long insurgency of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) led by [[Joseph Kony]], an Acoli from [[Gulu]]. The activities of the LRA have been devastating within [[Acholiland]] (though they spread also to neighbouring districts and countries). In September 1996, the Ugandan government moved hundreds of thousands of Acoli from the [[Gulu]] district into camps, ostensibly for their protection. Since 1996 this policy has expanded to encompass the entire rural Acoli population of four districts, one million people.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, A. 2008. "Against Humanitarian Impunity: Rethinking Responsibility for Displacement and Disaster in Northern Uganda," ''Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding'' 2(2): 151-173&lt;/ref&gt; These camps had some of the highest mortality rates in the world, with an estimated 1,000 people dying per week at one point. [[Malaria]] and [[AIDS]] have been the primary disease causes of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report/56063/UGANDA-1-000-displaced-die-every-week-in-war-torn-north-report UGANDA: 1,000 displaced die every week in war-torn north - report | Uganda | Refugees/IDPs], IRIN Africa&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees in the camps have also been subject to raids by both LRA and government forces.&lt;ref name="minority"/&gt;

At the height of the insurgency, 1.8 million people in the north were living in [[Refugee camp|camps]].&lt;ref name="minority"&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=5033 "Uganda: Minorities: Acoli"], World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples, accessed 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Peace talks beginning in 2005 promised some relief to these people, and some camps were closed in 2007 as security in the north improved. As of September 2009, large numbers of Acoli people remain in camps as [[internally displaced person]]s. The long civil war in the North has destroyed much of their society.

The majority of elected members of parliament in the Acoli sub-region are members of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikileaks]]: [[United States diplomatic cables leak|cablegate]], cable "09KAMPALA679", [http://213.251.145.96/cable/2009/06/09KAMPALA679.html UGANDA/DRC: OPERATION RUDIA II UPDATE  2009-06-29] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222182616/http://213.251.145.96/cable/2009/06/09KAMPALA679.html |date=22 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
According to Latigo, prior to colonialism, "the Acoli people maintained a traditional government that was rooted firmly in their religious beliefs, norms and customs, which demanded peace and stability in Acoliland at all times, based on their philosophy of life. This structure was maintained by the real anointed chiefs of the Acoli, the ''rwodi moo.''"&lt;ref name="Latigo"&gt;Latigo (2006), "Northern Uganda", pp. 102-104&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were believed to have supernatural powers, the chiefs ruled through a Council of Clan Elders, so they never ruled singlehandedly. The Council's representatives could mediate issues between clans, and essentially covered both civil and criminal functions, like a Supreme Court. It was a system of governance fully integrated with their religion and cosmology.

It was not until 1995 that a constitutional reform recognized such cultural leaders, but they have not been fully restored to previous powers, as so much of society has changed. In the pre-colonial era, all the Acoli believed in the same superior being, YA Latwer.  Killing of a person was prohibited but if it took place, negotiations for blood money were led by the victim's family, with agreement followed by rituals of a reconciliation ceremony to restore the killer to the community, and to bring peace between clans.&lt;ref&gt;Latigo (2006), "Northern Uganda", p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the people have important rituals for cleansing homes and sites, to welcome back people who have been away a long time, to clear spirits from places where killings have occurred, and to welcome people who have been captive.

The system values peace over justice, and has retributive and restorative aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Latigo (2006), "Northern Uganda", p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the LRA returnees, numbering 12,000, underwent ''nyono tong gweno'' (‘stepping on the egg’) after returning to their home villages, to help restore them to home.&lt;ref&gt;Latigo (2006), "Northern Uganda", p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; It is important because it is intended to restore communities to balance, and to bring people back into relation in their home communities, where ideally they would return at the end of the war. Purifications or [[wikt:atonement|atonement]] practices are still performed by Acoli elders in some communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twesigye, K.|first=Emmanuel|year=2010|title=Religion, Politics and Cults in East Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious leaders have tried to help end the conflict in the country of the last two decades and to reconcile the parties. "In 1997, the Catholic, Anglican, Muslim, and later the Orthodox religious leaders of Acoli formalized their increasing cooperation on peace issues by setting up the Acoli Religious Leaders’ Peace Initiative (ARLPI)."&lt;ref&gt;Latigo, "Northern Uganda", p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; They have continued to work to end the war through negotiation. Kitgum, Pader and Gulu, the three districts of the Acoli sub-region, each established peace forums for continuing discussions. In addition, the peace forums have worked to help establish the Amnesty Commission. They have also "played a vital role in Acoli traditional reconciliation processes and in preparing the community to receive former combatants."&lt;ref&gt;Latigo, "Northern Uganda", p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the peace talks of 2005-2007, Latigo noted leaders who called for a revival of the traditional processes of the indigenous people by which they worked for accountability and justice, namely, ''mato oput.'' [[Ruhakana Rugunda]], the Ugandan minister of internal affairs and leader of the government negotiating team, noted the effectiveness of the traditional system. He and others have suggested it could help the nation more than adopting the Western system of the International Criminal Court at [[The Hague]] (although some charges had already been filed against LRA leaders in 2005 there.&lt;ref&gt;''New Vision,'' 1 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;'''Lamogi Rebellion'''

'''Acoli Civil war (1986-1989)'''

In January 1986, the junta government of Gen. Tito Okello-Lutwa in Uganda was overthrown by Museveni and his NRA rebels. Tito and Bazilio, who were Acoli by tribe, fled the country into exile. Soon after, the NRM started pacifying the northern region, which is home to several ethnics, including the Acoli and Lango.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The attempt to pacify the Northern Uganda was carried out recklessly with much brutality and unprofessionalism from the NRA soldiers and government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} This resulted in resistance building up in the region and soon a host of rebel groups sprang up in the north. Most prominent  among them was the [[Uganda People's Army|Uganda People's Army (UPA)]] in Teso and Lango sub region, the [[West nile bank front|West Nile Bank Frontiers (WNBF]]) in the West Nile region, the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]], the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]  and the LRA in the Acoli region. These rebellions sprung up in defiance and from disapproval of the conduct and legitimacy of the new NRA government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Some of the groups in Acoli, like the UPDA, detested the Museveni regime because it had overthrown the government in which they served. They were also against the power consolidation approach of the NRA, which included mass arrest, toturing, killing, cattle raiding, food crop destruction, and looting and burning of villages. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The NRA managed to defeat all the rebel groups except  the LRA  which culminated in a 20-year conflict. At the peak of the conflict, 90% of the Acoli population moved into IDP camps designed as protected villages. The camps caused misery and suffering--with a conservative death toll of 1,000 people a week.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Conservative approaches estimates that at least  300,000 people died in the conflict that extended into the Sudan, Congo and Central African Republic.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== In popular culture ==
In 2012 the American charity [[Invisible Children, Inc.|Invisible Children]] produced a [[Kony 2012|documentary]] about the LRA. The documentary was met with mixed reactions, with many people familiar with the situation dubbing it a shallow and money-grabbing scheme.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, it successfully popularised the LRA in the West.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In 2016, the multi award-winning film, [[A Brilliant Genocide]] was produced. It was filmed by Australian director Ebony Butler, Simon Hardwidge and Ugandan author Frey Onen. The documentary focused on the unofficial discourse of the LRA war and it was largely critical of the Ugandan government role in the LRA war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10259">The '''Agua Prieta pipeline''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''gasoducto Agua Prieta'') is a [[natural gas pipeline]] project by [[Sempra Energy]] that aims to move [[natural gas]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]] to the [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Sonora]] and [[Sinaloa]]. The pipeline will cross the [[Yaqui River]] (''Rio Yaqui''), the main water source for the [[Yaqui]], an [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous tribe]]. The pipeline has an approximate length of 833&amp;nbsp;km upon completion, approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km of which will go through Yaqui territory.

== History ==
On December 12, 2013, the Mexican lower house voted by a two-thirds majority to end government control of Mexico's oil, historically opening up the nation to private companies and foreign investments after decades of nationalized oil. While project managers hail this pipeline as the bringer of clean and low-cost energy, Loma de Bácum (the Yaqui holdout community) remain skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/democraciaabierta/andrea-arzaba/another-pipeline-through-indian-land-this-time-in-mexico|title=Another pipeline through Indian land – this time in Mexico|date=2016-12-16|website=openDemocracy|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaqui territory is protected by the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican constitution]] and law which guarantees indigenous community land rights. Mexico, along with other Latin American countries, are signatories to the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization (ILO)]] Convention, which guards their rights and makes an informed consultation obligatory in the case of projects that affect their territories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''An Act of Conscience''''' is a 1997 documentary film by Robbie Leppzer about the war [[tax resistance]] of [[Randy Kehler]] and [[Betsy Corner]] and years-long struggle that ensued after the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] seized their home in [[Colrain, Massachusetts]] in 1989, to recover $27,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"&gt;{{cite video | people = Robbie Leppzer (director) |date = 1997 | title = An Act of Conscience | url = | medium = DVD | publisher = Turning Tide Productions | location = Wendell, MA | time = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was shown on [[Cinemax]] and the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]].&lt;ref name="aocsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turningtide.com/aoc.htm |title=An Act of Conscience |accessdate=2007-06-16 |work=Turning Tide Productions| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070704224331/http://www.turningtide.com/aoc.htm| archivedate= 4 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is narrated by [[Martin Sheen]] and features cameo appearances by activist-priest [[Daniel Berrigan]] and political folksinger [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt;

==Plot==
After the house was seized, the couple and their daughter refuse to move out and Kehler is arrested on December 3, 1991, by US Marshals and IRS agents.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; Community supporters move in, helping them to occupy the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 1992, the still-occupied house—but not the land, which belongs to the Valley Community Land Trust—is sold at auction to Danny Franklin and Terry Charnesky for $5400; the IRS had failed to receive any monetary bids at an earlier auction.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; The sale results in suits and countersuits between the Franklin-Charnesky family and the Land Trust.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; Despite the sale of the house, the Kehler-Corner occupiers refuse to leave.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt;

However, on April 15, 1992, while Kehler, Corner, and their supporters are away, Franklin, Charnesky, and their supporters move-in and occupy the house.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; Kehler, Corner, and their supporters begin a lively protest and round-the-clock vigil just outside the house, eventually even building a small wooden structure to shelter the protesters.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; On May 28, 1993, the Franklin County Superior court issues an injunction against the Kehler-Corner protests and, subsequently, several protesters are arrested and jailed after violating the injunction.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; Still, the protest continues until September, when they are finally discontinued.&lt;ref name="aocvideo"/&gt; The battle over the house is ended on December 31, 1993, when an out-of-court settlement is reached between the Land Trust and the Franklin-Charnesky family, who agree to leave the house and deed it and the land-lease to the land trust in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref name="kehlerart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&amp;issue=soj9404&amp;article=940441d |title=Conscience, Community, and Compromise

'''Betawi Malay''', also known as '''Jakartan Malay''' or '''Batavian Malay''', is the spoken [[language]] of the [[Betawi people]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. It is the native language of perhaps 5 million people; a precise number is difficult to determine due to the vague use of the name.

Betawi is a [[Malay-based creole languages|Malay-based creole]], and closely related to the [[Malay language]]. The Betawi language has large amounts of [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]] Chinese, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanwords.  It replaced the earlier Portuguese-based creole of Batavia, [[Mardijker language|Mardijker]].  The first-person pronoun ''gue'' (I or me) and second-person pronoun ''lu'' (you) and numerals such as ''cepek'' (a hundred), ''gopek'' (five hundred), and ''seceng'' (a thousand) are from Hokkien, whereas the words ''ente'' (you) and ''ane'' (me) are derived from Arabic. [[Cocos Malay]], a Malay creole spoken in [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], [[Australia]] and [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] is derived from an earlier form of Betawi Malay.

Today Betawi Malay is a popular informal language in Indonesia and used as the base of [[Indonesian slang]] and commonly spoken in Jakarta TV soap operas. The name ''Betawi'' stems from [[Jakarta|Batavia]], the official name of Jakarta during the era of the [[Dutch East Indies]].

==Origins==
Betawi developed as a Malay-based creole whose speakers were descendants of [[Peranakan|Chinese]] men and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] women in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. These descendants converted to Islam and spoke a pidgin that was later creolized, and then decreolized incorporating many elements from [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] (Uri Tadmor 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/17/abstracts/Tadmor.pdf Tadmor, Uri (2013). "On the Origin of the Betawi and their Language". ISMIL 17 conference talk.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Betawian Malay is divided into two main dialects 
* '''Betawi Kota''' dialect:  Originally spoken within Jakarta with the typical strong ''e'' like (''ada'' becomes ''ade'').
* '''Betawi Udik''' dialect:  Originally spoken in suburban Jakarta, Tangerang, [[Banten]], Depok, Bogor and Bekasi in [[West Java]]. It has a strong ''a'' like (''ada'', pronounced ''adah'').

Another Betawi Udik variant is called ''Betawi Ora'', which was highly influenced by Javanese.

Betawi is still spoken by the older generation in some locations on the outskirts of Jakarta, such as Kampung Melayu, Pasar Rebo, Pondok Gede, Ulujami, and Jagakarsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/research/jakarta-field-station/documentation-of-betawi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005456/http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/research/jakarta-field-station/documentation-of-betawi.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant Chinese community which lives around [[Tangerang]], called ''[[Benteng Chinese|Cina Benteng]]'', who have stopped speaking Chinese and now speak Betawian Malay.

Examples :
* ''aye (kota), sayah (udik), gue (informal)'' : I
* ''lu'' (informal or intimate) : you
* '' iye'' (strong e, not schwa like Malaysian), ''iyah'' : yes
* ''kagak, ora'' (''udik'' variant and it is Javanese influence) : no
* ''Encing mo pegi ke mane?'' : Where will you go, uncle?
* ''Dagangan aye udeh bures, dah'' : My stuff has been sold out.

The ending of every word that ends with an "a" is pronounced "e" such as in "net" in Betawinese language. The "e" is pronounced different than the "e" spoken by Malaysian Malays. 

==Sample==
===English===
&lt;blockquote&gt;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bahasa Indonesia===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Semua orang dilahirkan merdeka dan mempunyai martabat dan hak-hak yang sama. Mereka dikaruniai akal dan hati nurani dan hendaknya bergaul sesama lain dalam semangat persaudaraan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bahasa Betawi===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Semue orang ntu dilahirin bebas ame punye martabat dan hak-hak yang same. Mereka ntu dikasih akal ame ati nurani dan kudu bergaul satu ame lainnye dalem semangat persaudaraan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Boris Morros''' (January 1, 1891 - January 8, 1963) was an American [[Communist Party]] member, Soviet agent, and [[FBI]] [[double agent]]. He also worked at [[Paramount Pictures]], where he produced films as well as supervising their music department.

Morros was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. He emigrated with his family to America in 1922. In 1934, he was enlisted as a [[Soviet]] spy, following which time [[Vasily Zarubin]] became his first contact in 1936.

The mysterious "Mr Guver" letter, sent to [[FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] in 1943 from an anonymous source, who is now widely believed to be KGB Officer Vasily Zarubin, named Morros as an agent working with [[NKVD|Soviet intelligence]] and identified [[Elizabeth Zarubina]] as Morros' contact.

In December 1943, Zarubin drove with Morros to [[Connecticut]], where they met with [[Alfred Stern]] and his wife [[Martha Dodd Stern]]. Soviet intelligence wanted to use an investment from the Sterns in Morros' sheet music company to serve as cover for [[espionage]]. The Sterns invested $130,000 in the Boris Morros Music Company.

In 1947, Morros became a counterspy for the FBI. He reported on [[Jack Soble]] and members of the Soble spy ring, while also passing low-level secrets and misinformation back to [[Moscow]]. Morros' codename in Soviet intelligence and the [[Venona]] files was "FROST."

In 1960, ''[[Man on a String]]'', a feature film loosely based on Morros' adventures as a counterspy, was released. [[Ernest Borgnine]] played Morros, who co-wrote the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054058/ Man on a String (1960)], accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Morros, who was employed by [[Paramount Pictures]], worked there in several capacities. His movie production credits include ''[[The Flying Deuces]]'' (1939) with [[Laurel and Hardy]] and ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940) with [[Paulette Goddard]] and [[Fred Astaire]]. Morros also worked with [[Bing Crosby]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Martha Raye]], and [[Rudy Vallee]]. Morros was also the music director at Paramount, where he conducted the music of such composers as [[George Antheil]], among others.

He died in [[New York City]] on January 8, 1963.

'''Computer ethics''' is a part of [[practical philosophy]] concerned with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/resources/research/introduction/bynum_shrt_hist.html#maner|title=A Very Short History of Computer Ethics |last= Bynum |first=Terrell Ward |publisher=Southern Connecticut Wein University|accessdate=2011-01-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418122849/http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/resources/research/introduction/bynum_shrt_hist.html|archivedate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Margaret Anne Pierce, a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computers at Georgia Southern University has categorized the ethical decisions related to computer technology and usage into three primary influences:
# The individual's own personal code.
# Any informal code of ethical conduct that exists in the work place.
# Exposure to formal codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Margaret Anne |last2=Henry |first2=John W. |title=Computer ethics: The role of personal, informal, and formal codes |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=April 1996 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=425–437 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m3201253822641r0/ |doi=10.1007/BF00380363 }} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The term computer ethics was first coined by Walter Maner,&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; a professor at [[Bowling Green State University]]. The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by [[information ethics]], a branch of philosophical [[ethics]] promoted, among others, by [[Luciano Floridi]].&lt;ref name=InformationEthics&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of computer ethics originated in the 1940s with MIT professor [[Norbert Wiener]], the American mathematician and philosopher. While working on anti-aircraft artillery during [[World War II]], Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems "[[cybernetics]]," and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, ''Cybernetics''.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;&lt;ref name=BynumSEP&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bynum |first1=Terrell |title=Computer Ethics: Basic Concepts and Historical Overview |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/ethics-computer/ |date=21 December 2014 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Wiener's second book, ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]'', delved deeper into the ethical issues surrounding information technology and laid out the basic foundations of computer ethics.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

A bit later during the same year the world's first [[computer crime]] was committed. A programmer was able to use a bit of computer code to stop his banking account from being flagged as overdrawn. However, there were no laws in place at that time to stop him, and as a result he was not charged.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Computer Ethics |url=http://www.comphist.org/computing_history/new_page_5.htm |website=Learning Computing History |date=5 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}} To make sure another person did not follow suit, an ethics code for computers was needed.

In 1973, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) adopted its first code of ethics.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; [[SRI International]]'s [[Donn B. Parker|Donn Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2002#Parker|title=Alumni Hall of Fame: Donn Parker|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; an author on computer crimes, led the committee that developed the code.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

In 1976, medical teacher and researcher Walter Maner noticed that ethical decisions are much harder to make when computers are added. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The term "computer ethics" was thus invented.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1976 [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] made his second significant addition to the field of computer ethics. He published a book titled ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason]]'',&lt;ref name=ObituaryWeizenbaum&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Joseph Weizenbaum |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N12/weizenbaum.html |newspaper=The Tech |edition=Online |volume=128 |issue=12 |date=14 March 2008 |publisher=MIT News office |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which talked about how [[artificial intelligence]] is good for the world; however it should never be allowed to make the most important decisions as it does not have human qualities such as wisdom. By far the most important point he makes in the book is the distinction between choosing and deciding. He argued that deciding is a computational activity while making choices is not and thus the ability to make choices is what makes us humans.

At a later time during the same year [[Abbe Mowshowitz]], a professor of Computer Science at the City College of New York, published an article titled "On approaches to the study of social issues in computing." This article identified and analyzed technical and non-technical biases in research on social issues present in computing.

During 1978, the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] was adopted by the United States Congress, drastically limiting the government's ability to search bank records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Right to Financial Privacy Act |website=Electronic Privacy Information Center |url=https://epic.org/privacy/rfpa/ |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year [[Terrell Ward Bynum]], the professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University as well as Director of the Research Center on Computing and Society there, developed the first ever curriculum for a university course on computer ethics.{{Citation needed |date=April 2015}} Bynum was also editor of the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]].''&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; In 1983 the journal held an essay contest on the topic of computer ethics and published the winning essays in its best-selling 1985 special issue, “Computers and Ethics.”&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

In 1984, the United States Congress passed the Small Business Computer Security and Education Act, which created a [[Small Business Administration]] advisory council to focus on computer security related to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|98|HR|3075|pipe=Small Business Computer Security and Education Act of 1984|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1985, [[James Moor]], Professor of Philosophy at DartMouth College in New Hampshire, published an essay called "What is Computer Ethics?"&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt; In this essay Moor states the computer ethics includes the following: "(1) identification of computer-generated policy vacuums, (2) clarification of conceptual muddles, (3) formulation of policies for the use of computer technology, and (4) ethical justification of such policies."&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

During the same year, Deborah Johnson, Professor of Applied Ethics and Chair of the Department of Science, Technology, and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of the University of Virginia, got the first major computer ethics textbook published.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt; Johnson's textbook identified major issues for research in computer ethics for more than 10 years after publication of the first edition.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1988, Robert Hauptman, a librarian at St. Cloud University, came up with "[[information ethics]]", a term that was used to describe the storage, production, access and dissemination of information.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}} Near the same time, the [[Privacy Act of 1974#Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act|Computer Matching and Privacy Act]] was adopted and this act restricted United States government programs identifying debtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|100|S|496|pipe=Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1992, ACM adopted a new set of ethical rules called "ACM code of Ethics and Professional Conduct"&lt;ref name=ACMethics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics|title=ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |date=16 October 1992 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of 24 statements of personal responsibility.

Three years later, in 1995, Krystyna Górniak-Kocikowska, a Professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University, Coordinator of the Religious Studies Program, as well as a Senior Research Associate in the Research Center on Computing and Society, came up with the idea that computer ethics will eventually become a global ethical system and soon after, computer ethics would replace ethics altogether as it would become the standard ethics of the information age.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1999, Deborah Johnson revealed her view, which was quite contrary to Górniak-Kocikowska's belief, and stated that computer ethics will not evolve but rather be our old ethics with a slight twist.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}}

Post 20th century, as a result to much debate of ethical guidelines, many organizations such as ABET&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abet.org/about-abet/|title=About ABET {{!}} ABET|website=www.abet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer ethical accreditation to University or College applications such as "Applied and Natural Science, Computing, Engineering and Engineering Technology at the associate, bachelor, and master levels" to try and promote quality works that follow sound ethical and moral guidelines.

==Internet privacy==
{{main|internet privacy}}
[[Privacy]] is one of the major issues that has emerged since the internet has become part of many aspects of daily life. Internet users hand over [[personal information]] in order to sign up or register for services without realizing that they are potentially setting themselves up for invasions of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;CSC300 Lecture Notes @ University of Toronto, 2011. For more information on this topic, please visit the [http://epic.org Electronic Privacy Information Center] website.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=April 2015}}

Another example of [[privacy issues]], with concern to [[Google]], is [[Website visitor tracking|tracking]] [[web search|searches]]. There is a feature within searching that allows Google to keep track of searches so that advertisements will match your search criteria, which in turn means using people as products.

There is an ongoing discussion about what privacy and privacy enforcement measures imply. With the increase in [[social networking]] sites, more and more people are allowing their private information to be shared publicly. On the surface, this may be seen as someone listing private information about them on a social networking site, but below the surface, it is the site that could be sharing the information (not the individual). This is the idea of an [[opt-in]] versus [[opt-out]] situation. There are many privacy statements that state whether there is an opt-in or an opt-out policy. Typically an opt-in [[privacy policy]] means that the individual has to tell the company issuing the privacy policy if they want their information shared or not. Opt-out means that their information will be shared unless the individual tells the company not to share it.

==Identifying issues==
Identifying ''ethical'' issues as they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem.  The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Ethical standards==
Various national and international professional societies and organizations have produced code of ethics documents to give basic behavioral guidelines to computing professionals and users.  They include:

([[:Image:Conways game of life breeder animation.gif|animation]])]]

The '''''Game of Life''''', also known simply as '''''Life''''', is a [[cellular automaton]] devised by the British [[mathematician]] [[John Horton Conway]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Martin | authorlink1 = Martin Gardner | title = Mathematical Games – The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game "life" | volume = 223 | journal = Scientific American | date = October 1970  | pages = 120–123 | url = http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/HyFISCH/Produzieren/lis_projekt/proj_gamelife/ConwayScientificAmerican.htm | accessdate = 2011-06-26 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090603015231/http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/HyFISCH/Produzieren/lis_projekt/proj_gamelife/ConwayScientificAmerican.htm | archivedate= 2009-06-03 | isbn = 0-89454-001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is a [[zero-player game]], meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

==Rules==
The universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

==Origins==
In late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1179|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. Thus, ingeniously, [[Stanisław Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Motivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=877|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.

Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:
# There should be no explosive growth.
# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.
# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s "[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt; It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcg"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

Since its publication, ''Conway's Game of Life'' has attracted much interest, because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. ''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative sciences]] have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of "diverse academic use of this game" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' "universe" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first= D. C. |date=1991|title= Consciousness Explained |location=Boston |publisher=Back Bay Books |ISBN=0-316-18066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first= D.

C. |date=2003 |title=Freedom Evolves |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |ISBN =0-14-200384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of ''Conway's Game of Life'' was helped by its coming into being just in time for a new generation of inexpensive computer access which was being released into the market. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractals]]. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P. Goucher|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of patterns==
Many different types of patterns occur in the ''Game of Life'', which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include: ''[[still life (CA)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[oscillator (CA)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.

The earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; these were the first spaceships ever discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common period 3 oscillator. The great majority of naturally occurring oscillators are period 2, like the blinker and the toad, but oscillators of many periods are known to exist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://entropymine.com/jason/life/status.html#oscper Game of Life Status page], Jason Summers, retrieved 2012-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and oscillators of periods 4, 8, 14, 15, 30 and a few others have been seen to arise from random initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/freq_top_life.html |title=Most seen natural occurring ash objects in Game of Life |author=Achim Flammenkamp |date=2004-09-07 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns which evolve for long periods before stabilizing are called ''[[Methuselah (cellular automata)|Methuselahs]]'', the first-discovered of which was the R-pentomino. ''Diehard'' is a pattern that eventually disappears, rather than stabilizing, after 130 generations, which is conjectured to be maximal for patterns with seven or fewer cells.&lt;ref&gt;

Conway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow indefinitely—i.e., that for any initial configuration with a finite number of living cells, the population cannot grow beyond some finite upper limit. In the game's original appearance in "Mathematical Games", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the Gosper ''glider gun'' produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years this glider gun was the smallest one known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A. Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=July 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418232240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|archivedate=April 18, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a period-120 gun called the Simkin glider gun was discovered that has fewer live cells but which is spread out across a larger bounding box at its extremities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1599&amp;start=200#p19125 The Hunting of the New Herschel Conduits], ConwayLife forums, April 28th, 2015, posts by Michael Simkin ("simsim314") and Dongook Lee ("Scorbie").&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller patterns were later found that also exhibit infinite growth. All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Block-laying_switch_engine|title=Block-laying switch engine|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third configuration creates two such patterns. The first has only ten live cells, which has been proven to be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/InfiniteGrowth.html |title=Infinite Growth |publisher=Eric Weisstein's Treasure Trove of Life |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second fits in a five-by-five square, and the third is only one cell high.

Later discoveries included other ''[[gun (CA)|guns]]'', which are stationary, and which produce gliders or other spaceships; ''[[puffer train (CA)|puffer trains]]'', which move along leaving behind a trail of debris; and ''[[rake (cellular automaton)|rakes]]'', which move and emit spaceships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#rake|title=Rake|author=Stephen A. Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=July 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221152607/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#rake|archivedate=December 21, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[breeder (CA)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.

It is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].&lt;ref name="chapman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcg"/&gt; In fact, several different programmable computer architectures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.&lt;ref name="bcg"/&gt;

On March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down, as opposed to normal spaceships which move side to side, or a glider which moves exactly diagonally. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. "Elementary" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary "Elementary"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undecidability==

Many patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.

''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no such algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.&lt;ref&gt;Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[Universal Turing Machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.

==Self-replication==
On May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern dubbed Gemini that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=399&amp;p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini – LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman-Greene construction arms. These, in turn, create new copies of the pattern, and destroy the previous copy. Gemini is also a spaceship, and is the first spaceship constructed in the Game of Life that is an oblique spaceship, which is a spaceship that is neither orthogonal nor purely diagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=New Scientist|date=16 June 2010|first=Jacob|last=Aron|title=First replicating creature spawned in life simulator|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627653.800-first-replicating-creature-spawned-in-life-simulator.html|accessdate=12 October 2013|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Types_of_spaceships#Knightship |title=Gemini – LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2013, Dave Greene built the first [[replicator (cellular automaton)|replicator]] in ''Conway's Game of Life'' that creates a complete copy of itself, including the instruction tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1006&amp;p=9917#p9901|title=Geminoid Challenge|publisher=Conwaylife.com|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, diagonal versions of the Gemini were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Demonoid|title=Demonoid|publisher=LifeWiki|access-date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iteration==
From most random initial patterns of living cells on the grid, observers will find the population constantly changing as the generations tick by. The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.

==Algorithms==
Early patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.

A variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of life on surface of Trefoil Knot|thumb|Game of life on surface of [[Trefoil knot|Trefoil Knot]].]]
To avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighborhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.

If it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.

[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]
[[File:Игра "Жизнь".gif|thumb|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions.]]

In principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.  ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a Möbius strip.

Alternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.

For exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1029886 |title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15–18 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403013723/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1029886 |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201–209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 |access-date=17 March 2015 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}
Since ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is '''''B'''orn'' if it has exactly three neighbours, '''''S'''urvives'' if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means "a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife – An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver|accessdate=July 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221152607/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#replicator|archivedate=December 21, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata exist, although the vast majority of them produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest.

[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]

Some variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. 1-D square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|publisher=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.

Patterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpiński triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpiński triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[Spaceship (CA)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/Immigration.html |title=Immigration |publisher=Eric Weisstein's Treasure Trove of Life |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar variation, called ''QuadLife'', involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/QuadLife.html |title=QuadLife |publisher=Eric Weisstein's Treasure Trove of Life |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the variation among on cells, both of these variations act identically to Life.

==Notable programs==
[[File:Turing Machine in Golly.png|thumb|right|The 6,366,548,773,467,669,985,195,496,000th (6 [[octillion]]th) generation of a [[Turing machine]], made in the game of Life, computed in less than 30 seconds on an [[Intel]] Core Duo 2 GHz CPU using Golly in [[Hashlife]] mode]]

Computers have been used to follow ''Life'' configurations since it was first publicized. When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a [[Go (game)|Go]] board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors.

The first interactive ''Life'' program was written in [[ALGOL 68]] for the [[PDP-7]] by [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|M. J. T. Guy]] and [[Stephen R. Bourne|S. R. Bourne]]. The results were published in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', along with the statement: "Without its help, some discoveries about the game would have been difficult to make."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game "Life"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|journal=Scientific American|volume=223|date=October 1970|pages=120–123|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now thousands of ''Life'' programs online, so a full list will not be provided here. The following is a small selection of programs with some special claim to notability, such as popularity or unusual features. Most of these programs incorporate a graphical user interface for pattern editing and simulation, the capability for simulating multiple rules including Life, and a large library of interesting patterns in Life and other CA rules.
* [[Golly (program)|Golly]] is a cross-platform (Windows, Macintosh, Linux and also iOS and Android) open-source simulation system for ''Life'' and other cellular automata (including all ''Life''-like cellular automata, the ''Generations'' family of cellular automata from ''Mirek's Cellebration'', John von Neumann's 29-state cellular automaton, and others), by Andrew Trevorrow and Tomas Rokicki. It includes the ''Hashlife'' algorithm for extremely fast generation, and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scriptability for both editing and simulation.
* ''Mirek's Cellebration'' is a freeware 1-D and 2-D cellular automata viewer, explorer and editor for Windows. It includes powerful facilities for simulating and viewing a wide variety of CA rules including ''Life'', and a scriptable editor.
* ''Xlife'' is a cellular-automaton laboratory by Jon Bennett. The standard UNIX X11 Life simulation application for a long time, it has also been ported to Windows. It can handle cellular automaton rules with the same neighbourhood as ''Life'', and up to eight possible states per cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Xlife |title=Xlife}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google implemented an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] of ''Conway's Game of Life'' in 2012. Users who search for the term are shown an implementation of the game in the search results page.

[[Pearl millet]] and [[sorghum]]  especially in the [[Sahel]] and other cereals can be cooked in a similar way and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.&lt;ref name="milletCC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=J.R.N.|last2=Barrion|first2=S.C.|last3=Rooney|first3=L.W.|title=Pearl Millet--New Developments in Ancient Food Grain|journal=Cereal Foods World|date=2010|volume=55|issue=1|pages=16-19|doi=10.1094/CFW-55-1-0016|url=https://www.aaccnet.org/publications/plexus/cfw/pastissues/2010/Documents/CFW-55-1-0016.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="codex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Codex Standards for Couscous: 202-1995|url=http://www.fao.org/input/download/standards|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Couscous is a [[staple food]] throughout the [[North African cuisine|North African cuisines]] of [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]],and [[Libya]].&lt;ref name="Naylor2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Phillip C. |title=Historical Dictionary of Algeria |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftFbCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195 |year=2015 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8108-7919-5 |page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soletti"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Soletti|first1=Francesco |last2=Selmi|first2=Luca |title=Turismo gastronomico in Italia, Volume 1 |publisher=Touring Club Italiano |date=2006 |isbn=978-8836535002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}} In Western supermarkets, it is typically sold in instant form with a flavor packet, and may be served as a side or on its own as a main dish.

==Etymology==
The original name may be derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''Kaskasa'', meaning "to pound small" or the [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''Seksu'', meaning "well rolled", "well formed", or "rounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/806981280|title=Scheherazade's feasts : foods of the medieval Arab world|last=Habeeb.|first=Salloum,|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|others=Salloum, Muna., Elias, Leila Salloum.|year=|isbn=081224477X|edition=1st|location=Philadelphia|pages=93|oclc=806981280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|s|k|ʊ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|s|k|uː|s}} in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is sometimes pronounced ''kuskusi'' ({{lang|ar|كسكسي}}) in Arabic, while it is known in [[Morocco]] as ''seksu'' ; ''kesksu'' or ({{lang|ar|كسكسي}} ; in [[Algeria]] as ''kosksi''  ' ({{lang|ar|طعام}}, literally meaning "food") ; in [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]] ''kosksi'' or ''kuseksi'' , in [[Egypt]] ''kuskusi'' ({{lang|ar|كسكسي}}), [[Sicilian language|Sicily]] ''cuscusu'' and ''keskes'' in [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].&lt;ref name="foucauld"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucauld|first1=Charles de|title=Dictionnaire touareg-français : dialecte de l'Ahaggar|date=1950–1952|publisher=Impr. nationale de France|location=Paris|url=https://archive.org/details/DictionnaireTouareg-francaisDialecteDeLAhaggar|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|919}}

==Origin and history==
The origin of couscous appears to be in the region from eastern to northern Africa where [[Berbers]] used it as early as the [[7th century]].&lt;ref name="mwn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/06/46130/moroccan-couscous-and-tagine/|title=Moroccan Couscous and Tagine|author=Mustafa Ettoualy|publisher=Moroccan World News|date=29 June 2012|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="efc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Couscous|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/food-and-drink/food-and-cooking/couscous|publisher=Encyclopedia of Food and Culture, The Gale Group Inc.|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized as a traditional North African delicacy, it is a common [[cuisine]] component among [[Maghreb]] countries.&lt;ref name=mwn/&gt;&lt;ref name=efc/&gt;

[[Ibn Battuta]] (b. Morocco, 1304-1368? AD) stated in his ''Rihlah'' (Travels), indicating what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in West Africa from the early 1350s:
{{Quote|text=When the traveler arrives in a village the women of the blacks come with ''anlî'' and milk and chickens and flour of ''nabaq'' [lotus], rice, and ''fûnî'' [[fonio]] [a type of [[millet]]], this is like the grain of mustard and from it ''kuskusu'' and porridge are made, and bean flour. He buys from them what he likes, but not rice, as eating the rice is harmful to white men and the fûnî is better than it.&lt;ref name="hamdun"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamdun|first1=Said|editor1-last=King|editor1-first=Noel Quinton|title=Ibn Battuta in Black Africa|date=1975|publisher=Collings|location=London|isbn=9780901720573}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}}}

==Preparation==
[[File:Tunisian brown couscous with vegetables.JPG|thumb|Brown couscous with vegetables in Tunisia]]
Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women came together to make large batches over several days, which were then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency. &lt;ref name=asbell&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Chronicle Books| isbn = 978-1-4521-0042-5| last = Asbell| first = Robin| title = The New Whole Grain Cookbook: Terrific Recipes Using Farro, Quinoa, Brown Rice, Barley, and Many Other Delicious and Nutritious Grains| date = 2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some regions couscous is made from [[Farina (food)|Farina]] or coarsely ground [[barley]] or [[pearl millet]]. In [[Brazil]], the traditional couscous is made from [[cornmeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Receitas|url=http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0,6993,EEC533123-1488-4,00.html|website=revistagloborural.globo.com|accessdate=9 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129120634/http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0%2C6993%2CEEC533123-1488-4%2C00.html|archivedate=January 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Couscoussier.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A ''[[couscoussier]]'', a traditional steamer for couscous.]]
In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold in markets around the world. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid.&lt;ref name=asbell /&gt; Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a [[food steamer]] (called a''Taseksut'' in [[Berber language|Berber]], a {{lang|ar|كِسْكَاس}} ''kiskas'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or a ''[[couscoussier]]'' in [[French language|French]]). The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp [[cheesecloth]]. There is little [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original ''couscoussier'' was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.

===Instant couscous===
The couscous that is sold in most [[Western culture|Western]] supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous then leaving covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried [[pasta]], or dried grains (such as [[rice]]).

===Local serving variations===
[[Image:MoroccanCouscous.jpg|thumb|Couscous with various toppings]]
In Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Libya, couscous is generally served with vegetables ([[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[turnip]]s, ''etc.'') cooked in a spicy or mild [[broth]] or stew, and some meat (generally, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[lamb and mutton|mutton]]). In the [[Sahel]]ian countries of West Africa, such as [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]], [[pearl millet]] is pounded or milled to the size and consistency necessary for the couscous.&lt;ref&gt;Sivak MN. ''Starch: Basic Science to Biotechnology''. Academic Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-12-016441-8}}, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milletCC"/&gt;

In Algeria and Morocco it is also served, sometimes at the end of a meal or just by itself, as a delicacy called ''"sfouff"''. The couscous is usually steamed several times until it is very fluffy and pale in color. It is then sprinkled with [[almond]]s, [[cinnamon]] and [[sugar]]. Traditionally, this dessert is served with milk perfumed with [[orange flower water]], or it can be served plain with [[buttermilk]] in a bowl as a cold light soup for supper.

In Tunisia, it is made mostly spicy with [[harissa]] sauce and served with almost everything, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef and sometimes in southern regions, camel. [[Fish]] couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with [[octopus as food|octopus]], [[squid as food|squid]] or other [[seafood]] in hot, red, spicy sauce. Couscous in Tunisia is served on every occasion; it is also served in some regions (mostly during [[Ramadan]]), sweetened as a dessert called masfouf.

In Libya, it is mostly served with meat, specifically mostly lamb, but also [[Camel#Food uses|camel]], and very rarely beef, in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey, and locally referred to as "maghrood".

Couscous is also very popular in France, where it is now considered a traditional dish, and has also become common in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Indeed, many polls have indicated that it is often a favorite dish.&lt;ref&gt; Study conducted on January 11 and 12, 2006, for the magazine ''Notre Temps'' based on face-to-face interviews with a sample of {{formatnum:1000}} people representative of the adult French population, stratified by age, sex, profession of the head of household, region and type of municipality.&lt;/ref&gt; Couscous is served in many Maghrebi restaurants all over the world. In France, Spain and Italy, the word "couscous" (''cuscús'' in Spanish and Italian; ''cuscuz'' in Portuguese) usually refers to couscous together with the stew. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French, Spanish and Italian [[grocery store]]s and [[supermarket]]s. In France, it is generally served with [[harissa]] sauce, a style inherited from the [[Tunisian cuisine]]. Indeed, couscous was voted as the third-favourite dish of [[France|French]] people in 2011 in a study by TNS Sofres for magazine ''Vie Pratique Gourmand'', and the first in the east of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx Les plats préférés des Français] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408173836/http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx |date=April 8, 2012 }}, enquête réalisée en août 2011 pour le magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand auprès d'un échantillon national de {{formatnum:999}} personnes représentatif de l'ensemble de la population âgée de 18 ans et plus, interrogées en face à face.

[[File:Fish couscous from Kerkenah, Tunisia, August 16th, 2007.jpg|thumb|Fish couscous in [[Trapani]]]]
Couscous with fish soup is a traditional dish in [[Trapani]], [[Sicily]].

In Egypt, couscous is eaten more as a dessert. It is prepared with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and topped with cream. In Palestine, maftoul is considered as a special type of couscous but made from different ingredients and a different shape. It is larger than North African couscous, but is similarly steamed and often served on special occasions in a chicken broth with garbanzo beans and tender pieces of chicken taken off the bone. Maftoul is an Arabic word derived from the root "fa-ta-la", which means to roll or to twist, which is exactly describing the method used to make maftoul by hand rolling [[bulgur]] with wheat flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitchen of Palestine Palestinian Couscous (Maftoul) -|url=http://www.kitchenofpalestine.com/palestinian-couscous-maftoul|website=www.kitchenofpalestine.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maftoul is a special dish in Palestinian cuisine and not every cook knows how to prepare it. In fact, there is an annual Maftoul Festival which involves a competition held in Bir Zeit every year.

Couscous may be used to make a breakfast [[tabbouleh]] salad. Though usually cooked it water, it can also be cooking in another liquid, like [[apple juice]], and served with [[dried fruit]] and [[honey]].&lt;ref name=asbell /&gt;

==Similar foods==

Couscous is distinct from pasta, even pasta such as [[orzo]] and [[risoni]] of similar size, in that it is made from crushed durum wheat semolina, while pasta is made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined. Pasta is cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed.&lt;ref name=notpasta/&gt; [[Burghul]] or bulgur is a kind of parboiled dried cracked wheat of similar size to couscous, cooked by adding boiling water and leaving for a few minutes to soften.

=== Illegal drug trade ===
{{See|Illegal drug trade in Paraguay}}

The illegal drug trade in Paraguay is significant in both production of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and trans-shipment of [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; In 2011 the [[United Nations]] reported that it was the largest cannabis producer in South America, accounting for 15 per cent of world cannabis production.&lt;ref name=UNODC2&gt;[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 9 November 2011, [http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2011/November/unodc-and-paraguay-launch-usdollar-10-million-programme-to-counter-drugs-and-crime.html UNODC and Paraguay launch $10 million programme to combat drugs and crime]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also responsible for 30-40 tons of cocaine trans-shipment annually.&lt;ref name=UNODC2/&gt;

===Cigarette smuggling===
Due to discrepancies in the [[Tobacco_smoking#Taxation|cigarette tax rate]] between [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]] (16% in Paraguay vs. 80% in Brazil), large quantities of cigarettes are smuggled into Brazil via [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]].&lt;ref name="InsightBrazil"&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Breaks Down Paraguay to Brazil Cigarette Smuggling Trail |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/report-breaks-down-paraguay-brazil-cigarette-smuggling-trail |publisher=[[InSight Crime]] |first=James |last=Bargent |date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have alleged that the Tabacalera Del Este factory owned by relatives of Paraguayan President [[Horacio Cartes]], in responsible for producing cigarettes for the purpose of being smuggled into Brazil via [[Ciudad del Este]].&lt;ref name="InsightBrazil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/sites/swf/dc_nos_95_fumaca_do_crime/phone/index.html |title=Munição do crime |language=Spanish |first=Pedro |last=Rockenbach |publisher=Nós}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationality/Ethnicity==
===Ethnic population 1948–2011&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;===
{{POV|date=February 2012}}
The vast majority (over 90%) of the population of Montenegro is of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origin. [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] make up 5 percent of the population (4.9% at the 2011 census), while there is also a small [[Romani people|Romani]] minority (0.8% at the 2011 census). The Slavic population of Montenegro uses a large diversity in ethnic identities to describe their ethnicity. During the first decades after WW II most Slavic people identified themselves as [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], with less than 2% [[Serbs]] and less than 2% [[Croats of Montenegro|Croats]] in 1948. During the last decades of the existence of [[Yugoslavia]] up to 5% of the population declared themselves [[Yugoslavs]] (South-Slavs). During and after the [[Yugoslav Wars]] the ethnic identity of the [[Serbs]] (and in general the political influence of [[Serbia]]) became increasingly important in Montenegro and at the 2003 census almost one third of the population identified themselves as [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]]. The [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] live mostly along the borders with [[Bosnia]] and [[Serbia]], while the [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] live in the center of the country. The Slavic population are in majority [[Orthodox Christians]], but there is also a large [[Muslim]] minority, like in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Although most of the Slavic Muslims initially also identified themselves as [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], gradually over time more and more Slavic Muslims started to use [[Muslims by nationality|Muslim]] as an ethnic identity instead of only a religious identity. After the [[Yugoslav Wars]] this changed again and at the 2003 and 2011 census most Slavic Muslims declared themselves [[Bosniaks of Montenegro|Bosniaks]], because they have relations with Bosniaks in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and mostly live in the northeast of [[Montenegro]].

This census witnessed the forming of the [[Bosniak]]s nation; although there are still people who declare themselves as [[Muslims by nationality]]. Also, there are very few people left who consider themselves Yugoslavs. Also a noticeable difference compared to 1991 census is the reemerging in the number of Serbs, from nearly 60,000 to 200,000 in a decade (compared to 1931s 90% strong Serb community).

Others include small ethnic groups of perceived non-European/Slavic origins: [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Balkan Egyptians]] and [[Black Montenegrins]] who are thought to be local Turks.

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Republic of the Congo]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The Republic of the Congo's sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country, leaving the vast areas of tropical [[jungle]] in the north virtually uninhabited. Thus, Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa, with 85% of its total population living in a few urban areas, namely in [[Brazzaville]], [[Pointe-Noire]], or one of the small cities or villages lining the {{convert|332|mi|km|order=flip|adj=on}} [[Congo-Ocean Railway|railway which connects the two cities]]. In rural areas, industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years, leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence. Before the 1997 war, about 15,000 Europeans and other non-Africans lived in Congo, most of whom were French. Presently, only about 9,500 remain. [[Pygmies]] make up 2% of Congo's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2011/08/05/les-pygmees-du-congo-en-danger-d-extinction_1556735_3212.html|title=Les pygmées du Congo en "danger d'extinction"|date=5 August 2011|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the census from October 2010, [[Japan]]'s [[population]] was at its peak at 128,057,352.

Japan's population density was 340.8 people per square kilometer as of 2014(874 people per square mile) according to World Development Indicators. It ranks 35th in a [[list of countries by population density]], ranking directly above [[Philippines]] (347 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and directly below [[Curaçao|Curacao]] (359 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Between 1955 and 1989, land prices in the six largest cities increased 15,000% (+12% a year). Urban land prices generally increased 40% from 1980 to 1987; in the six largest cities, the price of land doubled over that period.  For many families, this trend put housing in central cities out of reach.

The result was lengthy [[commuting|commute]]s for many workers in the big cities, especially in [[Tokyo]] area where daily commutes of two hours each way are common. In 1991, as the bubble economy started to collapse, land prices began a steep decline, and within a few years fell 60% below their peak.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book| last = Krugman| first = Paul| year = 2009| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 | publisher = W.W.

National and regional governments devote resources to making regional cities and rural areas more attractive by developing transportation networks, social services, industry, and educational institutions in attempts to decentralize settlement and improve the quality of life. Nevertheless, major cities, especially Tokyo, [[Yokohama]], and [[Fukuoka]], and to a lesser extent [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]] and [[Nagoya]], remain attractive to young people seeking education and jobs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Japan has a high population concentration in urban areas on the plains since 75% of Japan’s land area is made up of mountains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=地形分類 |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/archive/j-atlas-d_j_02.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |accessdate = 2015-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also Japan has a forest cover rate of 68.5% (the only other developed countries with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden).&lt;ref name="Forest area % of land area"/&gt;
The 2010 census shows 90.7% of the total Japanese population live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=平成22年国勢調査最終報告書 人口の地域分布 |url=http://www.stat.go.jp/data/kokusei/2010/final/pdf/01-02.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Statistics Bureau |accessdate = 2015-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan is an urban society with about only 5% of the [[labor force]] working in [[agriculture]]. Many farmers supplement their income with [[Part time|part-time jobs]] in nearby towns and cities. About 80&amp;nbsp;million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific shore of [[Honshu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/placesinthenews/archive/2011arch/20110921_japan.html|title=Japan - Places in the News {{!}} Library of Congress|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metropolitan [[Tokyo]]-[[Yokohama]], with its population of 35 million residents, is the world's most populous city. Japan faces the same problems that confront urban industrialized societies throughout the world: overcrowded cities and congested [[highway]]s.

===Population===
Population in 5 households,{{huh?|date=July 2017}} 78.7% in urban areas (July 2000). High population density; 329.5 people per square kilometer for total area; 1,523 persons per square kilometer for habitable land. More than 50% of the population lives on 2% of the land. (July 1993). According to research in 2018, the population to land density ratio has gradually increased, now at 127 Million per 337 km2. Compared to the findings of July 1993 as well as in July 2000, the Population density has greatly increased, from 50% of the population living on 2% of the land to 77%. However, as the years have progressed since the last recordings of the population, Japan’s population has decreased immensely, raising concern about the future of Japan. There are many causes, such as the declining birthrates, as well as the ratio of men to women since the last measurements from the years of 2006 and 2010. According to researchers, the birth rate is said to decrease immensely as the year's progress, with an estimation of the population dropping from its current state of [https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/07/health/japan-child-population-record-low-intl/index.html 126.26 million to 86.74 million by the year of 2060.]

===Total fertility rate===
{{See|Family policy in Japan}}

Japan's [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) in 2012 was estimated at 1.41 children per woman, increasing slightly from 1.32 in the 2001–05 period. In 2012, the highest TFR was 1.90, in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], and the lowest was 1.09, in [[Tokyo]]. TFR by [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] for 2000–05, as well as future estimates, have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/webj-ad/webjournal.files/population/2011_Vol.9/Web%20Journal_Vol.9_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420060214/http://www.ipss.go.jp/webj-ad/WebJournal.files/population/2011_Vol.9/Web%20Journal_Vol.9_01.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page 30}}

==Migration==

===Internal migration===
Between 6 million and 7 million people moved their residences each year during the 1980s. About 50% of these moves were within the same prefecture; the others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by [[urbanization]] as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades.

In the 1980s, government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities, particularly Tokyo, and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed lifestyle than could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities, however, to attend universities and find work, but some returned to regional cities (a pattern known as U-turn) or to their prefecture of origin (a pattern referred to as "J-turn").

Government statistics show that in the 1980s significant numbers of people left the largest central cities (Tokyo and Osaka) to move to suburbs within their metropolitan areas. In 1988 more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year.

Due to decreasing total population of the country, only 8 prefectures show increase in population. These are [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]](2.9%), [[Tokyo]](2.7%), [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]](1.0%), [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]](1.0%), [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]](0.9%), [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]](0.6%), [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]](0.2%), and [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]](0.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/data/nihon/02.html|title=統計局ホームページ/日本の統計 2018－第2章　人口・世帯|last=総務省統計局|website=www.stat.go.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}
{{Main article|Japanese diaspora}}
About 663,300 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historical insularity. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.

===Immigration===
{{Main article|Immigration to Japan}}
According to the Japanese immigration centre,&lt;ref name="xvq"/&gt;  the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents (excluding a small number of [[illegal immigrant]]s and [[Tourism in Japan|short-term visitors]], such as foreign nationals staying less than 90&amp;nbsp;days in Japan),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarkaroffice.com/alien_registration.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317141857/http://www.sarkaroffice.com/alien_registration.html |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; exceeded 2.2&amp;nbsp;million people in 2008.&lt;ref name="xvq" /&gt;

In 2010, the number of foreigners in Japan was 2,134,151. This includes 209,373 Filipinos, many of whom are married to Japanese nationals,&lt;ref name="ministry"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ministry of Justice|title=平成２３年末現在における外国人登録者統計について 法務省|language=ja|trans-title=Statistics of Registered Foreigners in 2011|location=Japan |date=February 22, 2012 |url=http://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/nyuukokukanri04_00015.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 210,032 Brazilians, the majority possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry,&lt;ref name="ministry"/&gt; 687,156 Chinese and 565,989 Koreans. Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, and Brazilians account for about 69.5% of foreign residents in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/no-of-foreign-residents-in-japan-falls-for-2nd-straight-year-in-2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605164706/http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/no-of-foreign-residents-in-japan-falls-for-2nd-straight-year-in-2010 |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current issue of the shrinking workforce in Japan alongside its aging population has resulted in a recent need to attract foreign labour to the country. Reforms which took effect in 2015 relax visa requirements for "Highly Skilled Foreign Professionals" and create a new type of residence status with an unlimited period of stay.

The number of naturalizations peaked in 2008 at 16,000, declining to over 9,000 in the most recent year for which data are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/TOUKEI/t_minj03.html |title=法務省 |website=Moj.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the decline is accounted for by a steep reduction in the number of Japan-born Koreans taking Japanese citizenship. Historically the bulk of those taking Japanese citizenship have not been foreign-born immigrants but rather Japanese-born descendants of Koreans and Taiwanese who lost their citizenship in the [[Japanese Empire]] in 1947 as part of the American Occupation policy for Japan.

Japanese statistical authorities do not collect information on ethnicity, only nationality. As a result, both native and naturalized Japanese citizens are counted in a single group.&lt;ref name="xvq" /&gt; Although official statistics show near homogeneity, one analysis describe the population as “multi-ethnic”, although unofficial statistics still show that ethnic minorities are small compared with many other countries.&lt;ref name="lie"/&gt;{{Quote request|date=February 2012}}

In 2015 the Japanese government under prime minister [[Shinzō Abe]] announced that its policy of restricting immigration would not change despite the current declining population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/japan-says-it-must-look-after-its-own-before-allowing-syrian-refugees-in|title=Japan says it must look after its own before allowing in Syrian refugees|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=2015-12-26|date=2015-09-30|first1=Justin|last1=McCurry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercatornet.com/demography/view/germany-and-japan-on-different-immigration-paths/17081|title=Germany and Japan: on different immigration paths|date=2015-10-28|access-date=2015-12-26|first1=Marcus|last1=Roberts|publisher=MercatorNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, its plan is to improve technology to address the labour shortage, while increasing Japanese fertility rates from the current level of 1.4 to 1.8, eventually stabilizing the population at approximately 100 million.

The Japanese society of [[Yamato people]] is [[linguistics|linguistically]] [[Multiculturalism#Japan|homogeneous]] with small populations of [[Koreans]] (0.9&amp;nbsp;million), [[Chinese people|Chinese]]/[[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] (0.65&amp;nbsp;million), [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipino]] (306,000 some being Japanese Filipino; children of Japanese and Filipino parentage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Embassy taps help of Pinoy groups in Japan|location=Japan|date=March 12, 2011|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/03/12/11/embassy-taps-help-pinoy-groups-japan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]]ians (300,000, many of whom are ethnically Japanese) as well as [[Peru]]vians and [[Argentina|Argentineans]] of both Latin American and Japanese descent. Japan has indigenous [[minority group]]s such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuans]], who generally speak Japanese.

Japanese [[citizenship]] is conferred ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and monolingual Japanese-speaking minorities often reside in Japan for generations under permanent residency status without acquiring citizenship in their country of birth, although legally they are allowed to do so. This is because Japanese law does not recognise dual citizenship after the age of adulthood, and so people becoming naturalised Japanese citizens must relinquish citizenship of other countries when they reach the age of 20. Some ethnic Koreans and Chinese and their descendants (who may speak only Japanese and may never have even visited the country whose nationality they hold) do not wish to abandon this other citizenship.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In addition, people taking Japanese citizenship must take a name using the Japanese character sets hiragana, katakana, and/or kanji.  Names using Western alphabet, Korean alphabet, Arabic characters, etc. are not acceptable as legal names.  Chinese characters are usually legally acceptable as nearly all Chinese characters are recognized as valid by the Japanese government.  Transliterations of non-Japanese names using katakana (e.g. {{lang|ja|スミス}}　"{{transl|ja|Sumisu}}" for "Smith") are also legally acceptable.

However, some naturalizing foreigners feel that becoming a Japanese citizen should mean that they have a Japanese name and that they should abandon their foreign name, and some foreign residents do not wish to do this—although most [[Special Permanent Resident (Japan)|Special Permanent Resident]] Koreans and Chinese already use Japanese names.  Nonetheless, some 10,000 [[Zainichi Koreans]] naturalize every year.  Approximately 98.6% of the population are Japanese citizens, and 99% of the population speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as their first language. Non-ethnic Japanese in the past, and to an extent in the present, also live in small numbers in the Japanese archipelago.&lt;ref name="lie"&gt;[[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]], ''Multiethnic Japan'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-674-01358-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
===Lifestyle===
{{See also|Suicide in Japan}}
Japanese people enjoy a high standard of living, and nearly 90% of the population consider themselves part of the [[middle class]]. However, many studies on happiness and satisfaction with life tend to find that Japanese people average relatively low levels of [[life satisfaction]] and happiness when compared with most of the highly developed world; the levels have remained consistent if not declining slightly over the last half century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/hap_nat/findingreports/RankReport2006-1d.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104014832/http://worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/hap_nat/findingreports/RankReport2006-1d.htm |archivedate=2008-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/hap_nat/findingreports/TrendReport2007-1.pdf |title=nation |website=Worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/lif_lif_sat-lifestyle-life-satisfaction |title=Countries Compared by Lifestyle &gt; Life satisfaction.

===Discrimination against ethnic minorities===

{{Main article|Burakumin}}
Three native Japanese minority groups can be identified. The largest are the ''hisabetsu buraku'' or "discriminated communities", also known as the ''burakumin''. These descendants of premodern outcast hereditary occupational groups, such as [[butcher]]s, [[leather]]workers, [[funeral director]]s, and certain entertainers, may be considered a Japanese analog of [[India]]'s [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalits]]. Discrimination against these occupational groups arose historically because of [[Buddhist]] prohibitions against killing and [[Shinto]] notions of pollution, as well as governmental attempts at social control.

During the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period, such people were required to live in special ''buraku'' and, like the rest of the population, were bound by [[sumptuary law]]s based on the inheritance of social class. The [[Meiji period|Meiji]] government abolished most derogatory names applied to these discriminated communities in 1871, but the new laws had little effect on the social discrimination faced by the former outcasts and their descendants. The laws, however, did eliminate the economic monopoly they had over certain occupations. The ''buraku'' continued to be treated as social outcasts and some casual interactions with the majority caste were perceived [[taboo]] until the era after World War II.

Estimates of their number range from 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;million (about 2% to 3% of the national population). Although members of these discriminated communities are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, they often live in urban [[ghetto]]es or in the traditional special hamlets in rural areas, and membership can be surmised from the location of the family home, occupation, dialect, or mannerisms.  Checks on family background designed to ferret out ''buraku'' were commonly performed as part of marriage arrangements and employment applications, but have been illegal since 1985 in Osaka.

Past and current discrimination has resulted in lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status among ''hisabetsu buraku'' than among the majority of Japanese. Movements with objectives ranging from "liberation" to encouraging integration have tried to change this situation, with some success.  Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that as of 1998, between 60 and 80% of burakumin marry a non-burakumin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nancho.net/kyoto/nadamoto.html |title=Kyoto Ijin: Nadamoto Masahisa |website=Nancho.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ryukyuans===
One of the largest minority groups among Japanese citizens is the [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910845577|title=The international handbook of the demography of race and ethnicity|others=Saenz, Rogelio,, Embrick, David G.,, Rodriguez, Néstor,|isbn=9789048188918|location=Dordrecht|oclc=910845577}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  They are primarily distinguished from their use of several distinct [[Ryukyuan languages]] though use of Ryukyuan is dying out. The Ryukyuan people and language originated in the [[Ryukyu Islands]], which are in Okinawa prefecture.

===Ainu===
[[File:"Ainus in national Gala-Costume, married women with tattooed mustache." Department of Anthropology, Japanese exhibit, 1904 World's Fair.jpg|thumb|Japanese Ainu group in 1904]]
The third largest minority group among Japanese citizens is the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], whose language is an [[language isolate|isolate]]. Historically, the Ainu were an indigenous [[hunting]] and gathering population who occupied most of northern Honshū as late as the Nara period (A.D.&amp;nbsp;710–94). As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward, by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the Ainu were pushed into the island of [[Hokkaido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shinichiro|first=Takakura|title=The Ainu of Northern Japan: A Study in Conquest and Acculturation|year=1960|publisher=The American Philosophical Society|location=Independence Square|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterized as remnants of a primitive circumpolar culture, the fewer than 20,000&amp;nbsp;Ainu in 1990 were considered racially distinct and thus not fully Japanese. Disease and a low birth rate had severely diminished their numbers over the past two centuries, and intermarriage had brought about an almost completely mixed population.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Although no longer in daily use, the [[Ainu language]] is preserved in epics, songs, and stories transmitted orally over succeeding generations. Distinctive rhythmic music and dances and some Ainu festivals and crafts are preserved, but mainly in order to take advantage of tourism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Hāfu===

[[Hāfu]] is a term used for people who are [[biracial]] and ethnically half [[Japanese_people|Japanese]]. Of the 1 million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or more non-Japanese parent.&lt;sup&gt;[[Marriage in Japan#cite note-70|[70]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, one in forty-nine babies born in Japan today are born into families with one non-Japanese parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hafufilm.com/en/about/|title=About the film {{!}} Hafu|website=hafufilm.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most intermarriages in Japan are between Japanese men and women from other Asian countries, including China, the Philippines and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/9/hafu-in-japan-mixed-race.html|title=Being ‘hafu’ in Japan: Mixed-race people face ridicule, rejection|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast Asia too, also has significant populations of people with half-Japanese ancestry, particularly in [[Japanese settlement in the Philippines|the Philippines]], [[Japanese migration to Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Japanese migration to Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Japanese expatriates in Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Japanese migration to Thailand|Thailand]].
 
In the 1940s, biracial Japanese children (Ainoko), specifically [[Amerasian]] children, encountered social problems such as poverty, perception of impurity and discrimination due to negative treatment in Japan.&lt;ref name="japantimes1"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kosaka | first = Kristy |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090127zg.html |title=Half, bi or double? One family's trouble |publisher=[[Japan Times]] |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, discrimination against [[hāfu]] occurs based on how different their identity, behavior and appearance is from a typical Japanese person.

==Foreign residents==

In 2005, there were 1,555,505 foreign residents in Japan, representing 1.22% of the Japanese population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.stat.go.jp/Pubstat/topCntryStatE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107111225/http://portal.stat.go.jp/Pubstat/topCntryStatE.html |archivedate=2008-01-07 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Army personnel, of which there were up to 430,000 from the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] ([[Post-occupation Japan|post-occupation]], [[United States Forces Japan]]) and 40,000 [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force|BCOF]] in the immediate post-war years, have not been at any time included in Japanese foreign resident statistics.&lt;ref name="TESSA1"&gt;Morris-Suzuki, Tessa; ''Borderline Japan: foreigners and frontier controls in the post-war era;'' Cambridge 2010; {{ISBN|978-0-521-86460-2}}, Ch. 1: "Border Politics," Ch. 8: "A point of no return"&lt;/ref&gt; Most foreign residents in Japan come from Brazil or from other Asian countries, particularly from China, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/11/national/japan-sees-record-high-number-foreign-residents-justice-ministry/#.W0loCdIzbD4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00137/&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of long-term resident Koreans in Japan today retain familial links with the descendants of Koreans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/syugiin/023/0488/02312080488003a.html |title=衆議院会議録情報 第０２３回国会 法務委員会 第３号 |website=Kokkai.ndl.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that either immigrated voluntarily or were forcibly relocated during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese Occupation of the Korea]]. Within this group, a number hold [[Special Permanent Resident (Japan)|Special Permanent Resident]] status, granted under the terms of the Normalisation Treaty (22. June 1965) between South Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Morris-Suzuki (2010), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases special residents, despite being born in Japan and speaking Japanese, have chosen not to take advantage of the mostly automatic granting of citizenship to special resident applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.han.org/a/fukuoka96a.html |title="Koreans in Japan: Past and Present" |publisher=HAN |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1947 the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] started to repatriate Korean nationals, who had nominally been granted [[Japanese nationality law|Japanese citizenship]] during the years of [[Occupation of Japan|military occupation]]. When the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] came into force many ethnic Koreans lost their Japanese citizenship from April 28, 1952 and with it the right to welfare grants, to hold a government job of any kind or to attend Japanese schools.&lt;ref name="TESSA1" /&gt; In the following year the government contrived, with the help of the Red Cross, a scheme to "repatriate" Korean residents, who mainly were from the Southern Provinces, to their "home" of [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Agreement signed in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], brokered by the [[ICRC]]. Morris-Suzuki (2010), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1959 and 1984 93,430 people used this route. 6,737 were Japanese or Chinese dependents. Most of these departures &amp;ndash; 78,276 &amp;ndash; occurred before 1962.&lt;ref&gt;detailed in: Morris-Suzuki, Tessa; ''Exodus to North Korea: shadows from Japan's cold war; Lanham, Md. 2006; {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5441-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All non-Japanese without special residential status (people whose residential roots go back to before WWII) are required by law to register with the government and carry alien registration cards. From the early 1980s, a civil disobedience movement encouraged refusal of the [[fingerprint]]ing that accompanied registration every five years.

Opponents of fingerprinting argued that it was discriminatory because the only Japanese who were fingerprinted were criminals. The courts upheld fingerprinting, but the law was changed so that fingerprinting was done once rather than with each renewal of the registration, which until a law reform in 1989 was usually required every six months for anybody from the age of 16. Those refusing fingerprinting were denied re-entry permits, thus depriving them of freedom of movement.

Of these foreign residents below, the new wave started 2014 comes to Japan as students or trainees. These foreigners are registered under student visa or trainee visa which gives them the student residency status, Most of these new foreigners are under this visa. Almost all of these foreign students and trainees will return to their home country after 3–4 years (one valid period), few students extend their visa. [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] makes the largest increase, however [[Demographics of Burma|Burmese]], [[Cambodians]], [[Filipinos]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] are also increasing.

[[Asian migrant brides in Japan|Asian migrant wives of Japanese men]] have also contributed to the foreign-born population in the country. Many young single Japanese male farmers choose foreign wives, mainly from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and South Korea, due to a lack of interest from Japanese women living a farming life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=JyaeipnFbvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Japanese Society|first=Yoshio|last=Sugimoto|date=22 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant wives often travel as [[mail-order bride]]s as a result of [[arranged marriage]]s with Japanese men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gK2TJ8mKs-MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Local Dynamics in an Era of Globalization: 21st Century Catalysts for Development|first1=Shahid|last1=Yusuf|first2=Weiping|last2=Wu|first3=Simon J.|last3=Evenett|date=16 September 2017|publisher=World Bank Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Japanese men in urban parts of the country have also begun marrying foreign Asian women.

===Foreign residents as of 2015===
There was an increase of 110,358 foreign residents from 2014 to 2015. [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] made the largest proportion of these new foreign residents, whilst [[Nepali people|Nepalese]], [[Filipino people|Filipino]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] are also significant in numbers. Together these countries makes up 91,126 or 82.6% of all new residents from 2014 to 2015. However, the majority of these immigrants will only remain in Japan for a maximum of five years, as many of them have entered the country in order to complete trainee programmes. Once they complete their programmes, they will be required to return to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/Xlsdl.do?sinfid=000031399575 |title=第１表　国籍・地域別　在留資格（在留目的）別　在留外国人 |website=E-stat.go.jp |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2014 there were 2,121,831 foreigners residing in Japan, 677,019 of whom were long-term residents in Japan, according to national demographics figures. The majority of long-term residents were from Asia, totalling 478,953. Chinese made up the largest portion of them with 215,155, followed by Filipinos with 115,857, and Koreans with 65,711. Thai, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese long-term residents totaled 47,956, and those from other Asian countries totaled 34,274.  The Korean figures do not include [[zainichi]] Koreans with ''tokubetsu eijusha'' ("special permanent resident") visas, of whom there were 354,503 (of a total of 358,409 of all nationalities with such visas).  The total number of permanent residents had declined over the previous 5 years due to high cost of living.&lt;ref name="stat.go"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/List.do?lid=000001133760|trans-title=General counter of statistical tables list government statistics|title=統計表一覧　政府統計の総合窓口|access-date=2015-12-26|date=2015-04-24|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign residents on short term employment contracts===
A significant number of foreign residents of Japan are employed on a short term contractual basis under programs administered by the Japanese government. Well known programs include:

* The [[JET Programme]] employing up to 5,000 foreign university graduates as native language teachers in Japanese schools and as international support staff in local government offices.
* The [[Technical Intern Training Program]] employing in excess of 200,000 mainly manual laborers in variety of industries including construction, ship building, manufacturing, agriculture, retail and food processing.

In the light of current demographic trends Japan is likely to experience a decrease in tax revenue without a corresponding decrease in welfare expenses for an increasingly elderly population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Implications of Japan’s Changing Demographics|url = http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=304|website = nbr.org|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given growing manpower shortages, immigrant workers continue to play an important role taking low skilled and manual labour jobs. A recent growth in blue collar employment using documented short term contractual labour from developing countries has also contributed to the rise in the resident foreign population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Japan's Resilient Demand for Foreign Workers|url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/japans-resilient-demand-foreign-workers|website = migrationpolicy.org|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government administered [[Technical Intern Training Program]], first established in 1993, provided over 190,000 short term contracted workers in 2015. However, it has been claimed that many of these workers often work at reduced pay and are required to undertake significant amounts of overtime in order to make up for labor shortages. As trainees, labor standards law and minimum wage legislation has on occasion been ignored by unscrupulous employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Japanese Immigration Policy: Responding to Conflicting Pressures|url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/japanese-immigration-policy-responding-conflicting-pressures|website = migrationpolicy.org|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Japanese government has begun to examine this problem and has sought to both strengthen the vocational training aspect of the work program oversight.

===Koseki===
Foreign residents were recorded only in an alien registration system separate from the ''[[koseki]]'' (family registry) and ''[[jūminhyō]]'' (resident registry) systems in which Japanese citizens were registered until a new registration system was enacted in July 2012.  Since then, all residents are recorded by municipal offices in the ''jūminhyō'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/en/index.html|title=Start of new residency management system |date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''koseki'' system continues for Japanese citizens, while foreigners are recorded in a separate residency management system administered by immigration offices which combines the previous immigration status and local alien registration systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To all foreign nationals residing in Japan　Beginning on Monday, July 9, 2012,　Start of a new residency management system!|url=http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/en/q-and-a_page2.html|website=www.immi-moj.go.jp|accessdate=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001080415/http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/en/q-and-a_page2.html|archivedate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreigner-reporting website and hotline===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice maintains a website and hotline for "receiving report on {{sic}} illegal stay foreigner." The criteria for reporting include "feeling anxious about a foreigner", and anonymous submissions are permitted. Japanese immigration authorities work in unison with police to investigate those reported, and human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]] have argued that those reported do not receive proper legal protection.

The [[Daiyo kangoku|Daiyo Kangoku]] system allows police to detain suspects without charges, access to legal counsel or telephone calls for up to 23&amp;nbsp;days. In October 2006, the foreigner reporting hotline's operating hours were extended to include Saturday, Sunday and national holidays.

===Fingerprinting foreigners when entering Japan===
As of November 20, 2007, all foreigners entering Japan must be biometrically registered (photograph and fingerprints) on arrival; this includes people living in Japan on visas as well as permanent residents, but excludes people with special permanent resident permission, diplomats, and those under 16.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hogg ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7102962.stm Japan ups checks for foreigners]'', [[BBC News]], 20 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/IB/ip.html The Immigration Bureau introduced new immigration procedures on November 20th, 2007.], Immigration Bureau, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]] are Japan's two major religions. They have co-existed for more than a thousand years. However, most Japanese identify as either atheists, irreligious, or do not identify themselves as adherents of one religion, but rather incorporate various elements in a [[syncretism|syncretic]] fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin O. Reischauer]]  The Japanese Today: Change and Continuity; Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]] (1988), pg. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; There are small [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]] and other minorities as well, with the Christian population dating to as early as the 1500s, as a result of European missionary work before [[sakoku]] was implemented from 1635–1853.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5969">A '''designated place''' (DPL) is a type of [[community]] or populated area identified by [[Statistics Canada]] for statistical purposes. DPLs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of [[incorporated place]]s such as [[city|cities]], [[town]]s and [[village]]s.

DPLs are communities that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] places. DPLs are delineated at the request of a federal or provincial government to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are [[unincorporated area|not legally incorporated]] under the laws of the province in which they are located. The boundaries of a DPL have no legal status, and not all unincorporated communities are necessarily granted DPL status.

Some designated places may have a quasi-governmental status, such as a [[local services board (Ontario)|local services board]] in [[Ontario]] or an [[Hamlets of Saskatchewan|organized hamlet]] in [[Saskatchewan]]. Others may be formerly unincorporated settlements or formerly independent municipalities which have been merged into larger governments, and have retained DPL status in order to ensure statistical continuity with past censuses.

DPLs are similar to the function of [[census-designated place]]s in the [[United States]], but are defined differently. One significant difference is that Statistics Canada applies the designation to much smaller communities than does the United States Census Bureau.

== Creation ==
To be defined as a DPL under current Statistics Canada rules, a community must have:&lt;ref name=statscan&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/reference/dictionary/geo018a.cfm "More information on Designated place (DPL)"], [[Statistics Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* a minimum population of 100 and a maximum population of 1,000. The maximum population limit may be exceeded provided that the population density is less than 400 persons per square kilometre, which is the population density that defines a [[population centre]]
* a population density of 150 persons or more per square kilometre
* an area less than or equal to 10 square kilometres
* a boundary that respects the block structure from the previous census, where possible
* a boundary that respects census subdivision (CSD) limits. If a named area with DPL status crosses the boundary of two or more census subdivisions, then it is enumerated as multiple DPLs, each designated "Part A", "Part B", etc., rather than as a single DPL.

The status of designated place was created for the first time in the [[Canada 1996 Census]].&lt;ref name=statscan /&gt; Prior to 1996, such areas were only counted as regular enumeration areas within the applicable [[census divisions of Canada|census divisions]], and no special aggregation of figures was published.&lt;ref name=statscan /&gt;

== By province ==
In the [[Canada 2011 Census]], there were 1,507 designated places in Canada, of which 1,506 of them were in nine provinces.&lt;ref name=DPLtypes&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/92-151-g/2011001/tbl/tbl4.7-eng.htm | title=Table 4.7: Designated place types by province and territory, 2011 Census | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=2012-02-08 | accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Shakespeare Theatre and River Avon2.jpg|thumb|Royal Shakespeare Theatre, seen from across the river Avon in September 2006]]

'''Elisabeth Whitworth Scott''' (20 September 1898 – 19 June 1972) was a British architect who designed the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]] at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], England. This was the first important public building in Britain to be designed by a female architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Richardson|date=22 April 1932; quoted in Walker (1999: 257)|title=Shakespeare Memorial Theatre|journal=[[Building (magazine)|The Builder]]|volume=142|page=718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Scott was born in [[Bournemouth]], England, one of ten children of Bernard Scott, a surgeon. She was a great-niece of the architects [[George Gilbert Scott]] (Founder of [[Watts &amp; Co.]] ) and [[George Frederick Bodley]] and second cousin of [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], architect of Liverpool Cathedral.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite book |last=Stamp |first=Gavin |authorlink=Gavin Stamp|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=|chapter=Scott, Elisabeth Whitworth (1898–1972), architect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timesa/&gt; She was educated at home until the age of fourteen, when she enrolled at the Redmoor School, Bournemouth. In 1919 she became one of the early students at the [[Architectural Association]]'s new school in Bedford Square, London, graduating in 1924.&lt;ref name=timesa&gt;{{cite journal

  | title = The Shakespeare Memorial
  | journal = [[The Times]]
  | issue = 44783
  | page = 12
  | location = London
  | date = 6 January 1928
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Scott's first position was with the architects David Niven and Herbert Wigglesworth, a practice specialising in the Scandinavian style. In turn she became an assistant to [[Louis de Soissons]], a progressive architect producing work in the contemporary style for the new [[Garden city movement|garden city]] of [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]], Hertfordshire, and the [[Modernism#Second generation, 1930–1945|modernist]] [[Oliver Hill (architect)|Oliver Hill]].&lt;ref name=timesa/&gt;

===Shakespeare Memorial Theatre===
In 1927 a competition for a replacement to the burnt-out Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was announced and Scott entered, with a confidence in her own abilities taken from the sound theoretical grounding at the Architectural Association's school.&lt;ref name=timesc&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Staff writer

  | date = 6 January 1928
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she was working for Maurice Chesterton's practice at [[Hampstead]], London, and Chesterton agreed to oversee her proposals for feasibility. (Maurice Chesterton was a cousin of the theatre's publicist [[A. K. Chesterton|A.K. Chesterton]], who became director of propaganda for the [[British Union of Fascists]] and went on to co-found the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].) Maurice Chesterton's daughter [[Elizabeth Chesterton]] confided in a late interview the "fond belief" that the competition entry had been falsely "submitted under Scott's name", although Chesterton himself had "disclaimed any personal share whatever in the successful design".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n09/richard-wilson/bonfire-in-merrie-england|title=Bonfire in Merrie England|last=Wilson|first=Richard|date=4 May 2017|work=London Review of Books|access-date=14 May 2017|dead-url=|pages=15–17|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LW2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Lynne|editor1-last=Borden|editor1-first=Iain|editor2-last=Penner|editor2-first=Barbara|editor3-last=Rendell|editor3-first=Jane|title=Gender space architecture : an interdisciplinary introduction|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn= 9780415172523|page=254|edition=2000|chapter=Women and Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was assisted by two fellow AA students: Alison Sleigh and John Chiene Shepherd.  On winning the competition  (against seventy-one other entries) the four formed a partnership to prepare the detailed plans and supervise the construction.&lt;ref name=timesb&gt;{{cite journal

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; 

The reaction to Scott's design was mixed. The ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' suggested that, although the design reflected the building's purpose, its bulk in the small town was "startling...monstrous [and] brutal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Trial flight for the Swan of Avon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1740490,00.html |work= [[The Guardian]]|date=27 March 1932 |accessdate=28 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' did not agree, noting how well the building "adapt[ed] itself to the lines of the river and landscape".&lt;ref name=timesb/&gt; Sir Edward Elgar, then 75, was to be the theatre's new musical director but, after visiting the building, he so was furiously angry with that "awful female" and her "unspeakably ugly and wrong" design that he would have nothing further to do with it, refusing even to go inside.&lt;ref&gt;Beauman (1982: 100), quoted in Stamp (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]], a member the SMT committee notwithstanding his earlier telegram of congratulations to its chairman on having the unsuitable old building burnt down,&lt;ref name=IM/&gt; was a firm supporter of Scott's design as the only one to show any theatrical sense.&lt;ref name=timesb/&gt; Scott herself acknowledged that in her design she had not intended to conceal the functionality of the building.&lt;ref name=timesc/&gt;

Although most criticism was directed at the building's external form, in the auditorium the performers—although acknowledging that Scott had been at the mercy of her theatrical advisors: [[William Bridges-Adams]], [[Barry Vincent Jackson|Barry Jackson]] and stage designer Norman Wilkinson (1882–1934, since 1920 a governor of the SMT&lt;ref name=MAMP/&gt;)—found that it was curiously difficult to connect with their audience: evidently the large, plain expanse of the cream-painted side walls had the effect of diffusing attention from the stage. Only in 1951, when the [[Auditorium#Modern auditorium structure|gallery]] seating was extended along the sides, was this overcome.&lt;ref name=IM&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackintosh|first=Iain |title=Architecture, actor, and Audience|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1993|pages=102–105|isbn=978-0-415-03183-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAMP&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armfield|first1=Maxwell|authorlink1=Maxwell Armfield|last2=Pottle|first2=Mark|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=Wilkinson, Norman (1882–1934), stage designer |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/36906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the building's lack of "meaningless decoration" was one of the features enthusiastically praised in the special June 1932 edition of the modernist ''[[Architectural Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Mackintosh (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DCMS" /&gt;

From today's viewpoint the theatre, now called the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, is regarded as a "nationally significant building" representing the "best modern municipal style of architecture".&lt;ref name="DCMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmcumeds/489/489ap72.htm|title=Memorandum submitted by English Heritage to the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport|date=February 2002|publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made a [[listed building]] on 14 October 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=366450|title=Details for IoE Number: 366450|last=Staff writers|year=2007|work=National Monuments Record|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later practice===
Scott was joined in the partnership by John Breakwell and—as John Shepherd and Alison Sleigh had married—the practice became "Scott, Shepherd and Breakwell". None of their subsequent commissions had the prominence of the SMT, although their 1938 work on the Fawcett Building at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], is of note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely|editor=Roach, J. P. C.|publisher=[[Victoria County History]]|year=1959|volume=3|pages=493–495|chapter=The colleges and halls: Newnham|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66661|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Post-war]] period Scott returned to [[Bournemouth]], working with the practice of Ronald Phillips &amp; Partners.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In the 1960s she joined the [[public sector]], working for Bournemouth Borough Architect's Department on such projects as the new pavilion and theatre on [[History of Bournemouth#History of Bournemouth Pier|Bournemouth Pier]].&lt;ref name=LW2000/&gt; These relatively mundane schemes were no reflection of Scott's early talent; largely forgotten, she was "unable to live up to her perceived early promise".&lt;ref name="Darley2011" /&gt; She retired in 1968.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Feminism==
In 1924, when Scott entered practice, there were no prominent women architects and her selection for the project to rebuild the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre after it was destroyed by fire was only through her success in an international competition. Her achievement, and her decision to employ where possible women architects to assist her on the Stratford design, was instrumental in opening up the profession to women.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Scott was not an outspoken feminist&lt;ref name=bmouthhated&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/13933939.The_extraordinary_Elisabeth_Scott__why_pioneering_Bournemouth_architect_would_have_hated_starring_in_new_passport/ |title=The extraordinary Elisabeth Scott: why pioneering Bournemouth architect would have hated starring in new passport |date=4 November 2015|work=Bournemouth Echo |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was identified with the progressive movement to overturn traditional assumptions about women and the professions.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1999: 244)&lt;/ref&gt; She was by nature more of a quiet and practical feminist, ensuring that women were represented on her design projects and working through the [[Fawcett Society]] to promote wider acceptance.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; Above anything else, she disliked being labelled as a 'female architect' rather than simply an 'architect'.&lt;ref name=bmouthhated /&gt;

==Family==
In 1936 she married George Richards.&lt;ref name="Darley2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/29/elisabeth-scott-royal-shakespeare-theatre|title=A stage of her own: Elisabeth Scott and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre |last=Darley|first=Gillian|date=29 January 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Bournemouth on 19 June 1972.

==UK passport==
In November 2015 it was announced Elisabeth Scott would be one of only two prominent British women (the other being [[Ada Lovelace]]) to be featured in the design of the new UK passport, to be used for the next 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/03/new-uk-passport-design-features-just-two-women|title=New UK passport design features just two women |last=Davies|first=Caroline|date=3 November 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/british-passport-design-women.html|title=New Passport in Britain Puts Women in 2nd Class |last=De Freytas-Tamura|first=Kimiko|date=4 November 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-uk-passport-changes-shakespeare-anish-kapoor-and-ada-lovelace-part-of-most-secure-design-ever-a6719271.html|title=New UK passport changes: Shakespeare, Anish Kapoor and Ada Lovelace part of ‘most secure design ever issued’ |last=Eleftheriou-Smith|first=Loulla-Mae|date=3 November 2015|work=Independent|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="introducing2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing the new UK passport design|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/473495/HMPO_magazine.pdf|publisher=HM Passport Office|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galileo Circle''' was an atheist-materialist student organization that functioned in [[Budapest]] between 1910 and 1919. It was based in [[Anker_Palace#Anker_Köz|Anker Köz]].&lt;ref name="Csunderlik"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Csunderlik |first1=Péter Tibor |title=The history and reception history of the Galilei Circle (1908-1919) |url=http://doktori.btk.elte.hu/hist/csunderlikpeter/thesis.pdf |website=elte.hu |publisher=ELTE Faculty of Humanities |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle was founded on November 22, 1908.&lt;ref name="Titkos"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Csunderlik |first1=Péter |title="Titkos társulat zsoldján kitartott bárgyú eszmezavarosok"? - 105 éve alakult a Galilei Kör |url=https://mult-kor.hu/20131121_titkos_tarsulat_zsoldjan_kitartott_bargyu_eszmezavarosok__105_eve_alakult_a_galilei_kor |website=Múlt-kor történelmi magazin |publisher=Múlt-ko |accessdate=28 November 2018 |language=hu |date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to the attacks on [[Gyula Pikler]], a social scientist who had suggested that the nation was a social phenomenon was arose through a social and historical process, rather than an eternal entity. This led to him being attacked by Hungarian christian nationalists.&lt;ref name="Titkos"/&gt; It claimed to be specifically apolitical and declared itself in favour of self-education and science. [[Endre Ady]] described the galilesists as the ‘young army of Fever’, dedicating various poems to the Circle. [[Oszkár Jászi]] thought the galileists would help lead Hungary from ‘the Balkans into Western Europe’.&lt;ref name="Csunderlik"/&gt;

The organisation was banned in January, 1918, a period of labour unrest in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. However following the [[Aster Revolution]] in October 1918 it was relaunched. It was finally dissolved on 21 March, shortly following the establishment of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].&lt;ref name="Csunderlik"/&gt;

The circle published ''Szabadgondolat''.&lt;ref name="Death instead of life"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Péter |first1=Csunderlik |title=Death instead of life – Activities of the Galilei Circle in the first two years of the world war {{!}} Frontlines and Hinterland |url=http://elsovh.hu/english/death-instead-of-life-activities-of-the-galilei-circle-in-the-first-two-years-of-the-world-war/ |website=elsovh.hu |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Day of Action''' is a [[direct action]] protest format. [[Environmentalism]] initiatives begun to use it in 2005 in connection with [[individual and political action on climate change|Global Climate Campaign]]. They aimed to focus world attention on the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] effect that [[human]]s are having on [[global warming]]. Its main objective is to spearhead demands that elected representatives of their respective governments honor commitments set forth by the [[Kyoto Protocol]], by conducting in unison peaceful [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] around the world. The demonstration, or [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]], are intended to coincide with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)]], a meeting of world leaders from 189 nations, that meet annually to discuss [[climate change]].

== History ==

===2005===
In response to entering into force of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], following [[ratification]] by Russia, on February 16, 2005, Global Day of Action rallies were [[Wikinews:Thousands demand climate change action#Global Action|first conducted]] on December 3, 2005 to coincide with the UNFCCC's ''First Meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol'', or MOP 1, in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]]. The following year on November 3 and 11, 2006, rallies were conducted again  when the UNFCCC convened for the ''Second Meeting of Parties'', or MOP 2, in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].

The most recent Global Day of Action event, entitled ''Kyoto Now!'', occurred on December 8, 2007 to coincide with the UNFCCC's conference, otherwise known as COP 13/MOP 3, convening Dec 3-14, 2007 in  [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. Numerous groups and [[coalitions]], as well as independent [[grassroots]] efforts, were organized in over eighty countries worldwide to march in open rallies in support of this initiative. Chief among them was [[Campaign against Climate Change]], [[Stop Climate Chaos]] and [[Greenpeace]].

'''Henry (Lorenz) Loftus''' (born 1915) and '''Harry (Dwyer) Donaldson''' (born 1910) were two young men who made national headlines for their unsuccessful attempt to rob the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s ''Apache Limited'' in 1937. The last major train robbery in the United States, the two have been referred to as "the last of America's classic train robbers". Though they were not professional criminals, their unhealthy fixation with the [[American Wild West]] prompted them to rob the train which resulted in the intentional wounding of one passenger and the accidental death of another.

==History==
Henry Loftus (or Lorenz) was born and raised in [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] to German immigrant Conrad Lorenz. As a bored teenager living in a small town, Loftus developed an interest in [[dime novels]] and the [[American Old West]]. This interest eventually evolved into what his family later called a "Wild West complex" though they humored him hoping he would outgrow it. Loftus was still living at home when he committed his first arrest for [[burglary]]. The local town judge sympathized with the young man, [[suspended sentence|suspended his sentence]] and released him on [[probation]].&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton, Michael. ''The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers''. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 179-180) {{ISBN|0-8160-4488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, Loftus' father moved the family to [[Chicago]] where he opened a shoe store in 1936. Loftus stayed for only a few months and, after living in [[Brooklyn, New York]] for a time, announced that he was going west "to seek fame and fortune in the wide open spaces". His companion on this journey was Harry Donaldson (or Dwyer), a young Canadian he had recently befriended, who had a similar interest in the Wild West and its outlaws in particular. A year later, they booked a train on the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] to [[El Paso, Texas]]. Upon their arrival, they were disappointed to see that El Paso had long since left behind its frontier past and [[History of El Paso, Texas#The roaring 20s to World War II|had become a modern city]] with paved streets and automobiles much like they left behind in Chicago. While in El Paso, they purchased [[Cowboy#Attire|cowboy outfits]], including [[chaps]] and [[Ten-gallon hats]], and soon found themselves a source of amusement to the local residents. Loftus and Donaldson eventually decided to leave the city by purchasing two horses and heading westward hoping to find something left of the American frontier.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Article1"&gt;"Youth's, Held In Slaying, Find Story Books Were Wrong". ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]''. 13 December 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

After two days on the trail, they arrived at [[Deming, New Mexico]]. Confronted with the fact that [[American Old West#Closing out the century|the frontier no longer existed in the American Southwest]], the two formed a plan to rob a train. Selling their horses, they used the money to buy old fashioned six-shooters with hand-tooled holsters and the rest for train tickets back to El Paso.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

On November 24, 1937, Loftus and Donaldson were travelling as passengers on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s westbound ''Apache Limited'' out of El Paso. About an hour into the trip, Loftus sat up from their seat and drew his pistol on [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] W.M. Holloway. Holloway later recalled that he "thought [Loftus] was drunk. I didn't think it was a holdup. I was afraid that gun was going off when the amateur's hands started shaking". Regardless, Loftus covered the conductor while Donaldson moved through the passengers collecting several men's watches but no cash. Growing frustrated and nervous, a male passenger made a sudden move causing Donaldson to panic and shot the man in the hip. When Loftus went back to help his partner, he was tackled by an off-duty [[brakeman]], W.L. Smith, who was travelling as a passenger.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Loftus and Smith began wrestling on the floor when the gun suddenly went off killing Smith. At this point, the 20 passengers attacked both men "punching and kicking them in a frenzy". One witness said "If it hadn't been that we had women passengers on the coach, these robbers would have been beaten to death". Lashing the would-be robbers to the seats, they turned them over to the sheriff in Deming, then transferred to [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] for trial.&lt;ref name="Article1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Train 'Bandits' Held For Trial; Bail Denied". ''[[Sarasota Herald]]''. 21 Dec 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns arose that the two were [[mental disorder defence|unfit for trial]] as then District Attorney Martin Threet had to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf. His father and sister travelled from Chicago to see Loftus, who read passages from the Bible given to him by his father, and his sister Margaret told the press that Loftus "does not seem to grasp the meaning of the charges against him". Neither had funds to help Loftus but said they would return for the trial if they were able. Donaldson's mother, a Mrs. Joseph Thibault, traveled all the way from [[Concession, Nova Scotia]] after using his last 95 cents to telegraph her.&lt;ref name="Article1"/&gt; Facing the death penalty, they pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to serve 50–75 years imprisonment in February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;"Train Robbers Sentenced; Two Youths Get 50 to 75 Years for Death in Hold-Up". ''[[New York Times]]''. 21 Feb 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men were charged and swiftly convicted of robbery and murder, however the circumstances of the crime received national attention. It was the last major train robbery in the United States, the two being referred to as "the last of America's classic train robbers", and officially ended the Old West-style [[train robbery]] started by the [[Reno Brothers]] 70 years before.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

[[File:Recherches sur l’isolement du fluor, Fig. 5.PNG|300px|thumb|Moissan's fluorine cell, from his 1887 publication]]

Fluorine is a relatively new [[chemical element|element]] in human applications. In ancient times, only minor uses of fluorine-containing minerals existed. The industrial use of [[fluorite]], fluorine's source mineral, was first described by early scientist [[Georgius Agricola]] in the 16th century, in the context of [[smelting]]. The name "fluorite" (and later "fluorine") derives from Agricola's [[New Latin|invented Latin terminology]]. In the late 18th century, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was discovered. By the early 19th century, it was recognized that fluorine was a bound element within compounds, similar to [[chlorine]]. Fluorite was determined to be [[calcium fluoride]].

Because of fluorine's tight bonding as well as the toxicity of [[hydrogen fluoride]], the element resisted many attempts to isolate it. In 1886, French chemist [[Henri Moissan]], later a Nobel Prize winner, succeeded in making elemental fluorine by [[electrolysis|electrolyzing]] a mixture of [[potassium fluoride]] and hydrogen fluoride. Large-scale production and use of fluorine began during World War 2 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. Earlier in the century, the main fluorochemicals were commercialized by the [[DuPont]] company:  refrigerant gases ([[Freon]]) and polytetrafluoroethylene plastic ([[Teflon]]).

==Ancient use==

[[File:Barber Cup High ISO Deep Field.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[The Barber Cup and Crawford Cup|The Barber Cup]], a Roman fluorite carving (on display at the British Museum)]]

Some instances of ancient use of fluorite, main source mineral of fluorine, for ornamental use carvings exist. However, archeological finds are rare, perhaps in part because of the stone's softness. Two Roman cups made of Persian fluorite have been discovered and are currently exhibited at the British museum. [[Pliny the Elder]] described a soft stone from Persia used in cups that may have been fluorite.

Fluorite carvings from about 1000 AD have been discovered in the Americas in Indian burial grounds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The word "fluorine" derives from the Latin stem of the main source mineral, fluorite, which was first mentioned in 1529 by [[Georgius Agricola]], the "father of mineralogy". He described fluorite as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]]—an additive that helps melt ores and [[slag]]s during smelting.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=790}}&lt;ref name="assassinated"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&amp;pg=PT149|isbn = 978-0-444-52239-9|page = 149|first = Alexander|last = Senning|year = 2007|publisher = Elsevier|title = Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology: The whies and whences of chemical nomenclature and terminology|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorite stones were called ''schone flusse'' in the German of the time. Agricola, writing in Latin but describing 16th century industry, invented several hundred new Latin terms. For the ''schone flusse'' stones, he used the Latin noun ''fluores'', "fluxes", because they made metal ores flow when in a fire. After Agricola, the name for the mineral evolved to [[spar (mineralogy)|fluorspar]] (still commonly used) and then to fluorite.&lt;ref name="KGS fluorite terminology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norwood|first=Charles J.|title=Kentucky geological survey Bulletin 9: Fluorspar deposits of Kentucky|year=1907|publisher=Globe Printing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGRMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA34|author2=Fohs, Julius F.|page=52|chapter=Fluorspar and its Occurrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/agricola-metallica/page_003 |pages = preface, 380–381 (3, 416–417 in linked viewer)|first = Georgius |last=Agricola |title=De Re Metallica|others =trans.

Fluorite mineral was also described in the writings of alchemist [[Basilius Valentinus]], supposedly in the late 15th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  However, it is alleged that "Valentinus" was a hoax as his writings were not known until about 1600.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Hydrofluoric acid==

[[File:Andreas Sigismund Marggaf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marggraf, inventor of hydrofluoric acid]]

Some sources claim that the first production of hydrofluoric acid was by Heinrich Schwanhard, a German glass cutter, in 1670.&lt;ref name=Asimov&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|year=1966|title=The noble gases|isbn=978-0-465-05129-8|publisher=Basic Books|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peer-reviewed study of Schwanhard's writings, though, showed no specific mention of fluorite and only discussion of an extremely strong acid. It was hypothesized that this was probably [[nitric acid]] or [[aqua regia]], both capable of etching soft glass.&lt;ref name=Partington&gt;{{cite journal|last=Partington|first=J. R.|title=The early history of hydrofluoric acid|journal=Memoirs and Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society|year=1923|volume=67|issue=6|pages=73–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] made the first definite preparation of hydrofluoric acid in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid in glass, which was greatly corroded by the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marggraf, Andreas Sigismun|year=1770|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f28pAXS5SGIC&amp;pg=PA3|title=Observation concernant une volatilisation remarquable d'une partie de l'espece de pierre, à laquelle on donne les noms de flosse, flüsse, flus-spaht, et aussi celui d'hesperos; laquelle volatilisation a été effectuée au moyen des acides|trans-title=Observation of a remarkable volatilization of part of a type of stone to which one gives the name flosse, flüsse, flus-spaht, as well as that of hesperos; which volatilization was effected by means of acids|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres|pages=3–11|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Fluorine|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ycSf3EK9i2gC&amp;pg=PA5|pages = 3–10|title = Modern fluoroorganic chemistry: Synthesis, reactivity, applications|isbn = 978-3-527-30691-6|author1 = Kirsch, Peer|year = 2004|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1771, Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] repeated this reaction.&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scheele, Carl Wilhelm|year=1771|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d984AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA120|title=Undersŏkning om fluss-spat och dess syra|trans-title=Investigation of fluorite and its acid|journal=Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapsademiens Handlingar (Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science)|volume=32|pages=129–138|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheele recognized the product of the reaction as an acid, which he called "fluss-spats-syran" (fluor-spar-acid); in English, it was known as "fluoric acid".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1810, French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]] suggested that hydrofluoric acid was a compound of hydrogen with an unknown element, analogous to chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ampere|first = André-Marie|title = Suite d'une classification naturelle pour les corps simples|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4jEFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA5|journal= Annales de chimie et de physique|year = 1816|volume = 2|pages = 1–5|accessdate=7 May 2011|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorite was then shown to be mostly composed of calcium fluoride.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Weeks|first1 = Mary Elvira|authorlink1=Mary Elvira Weeks|title = The discovery of the elements. XVII. The halogen family|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume = 9|pages = 1915–1939|year = 1932|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|issue = 11|bibcode = 1932JChEd...9.1915W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] originally suggested the name ''fluorine'', taking the root from the name of "fluoric acid" and the -ine suffix, similarly to other halogens. This name, with modifications, came to most European languages. (Greek, Russian, and several other languages use the name ''ftor'' or derivatives, which was suggested by Ampère and comes from the Greek φθόριος (''phthorios''), meaning "destructive".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=F |title=09 Fluorine |publisher=elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Latin name (''fluorum'') gave the element its current symbol, F, although the symbol Fl has been used in early papers.&lt;ref name="dissolve"&gt;{{cite book|pages=278–280|title=First outlines of a dictionary of solubilities of chemical substances| author= Storer, Frank Humphreys| publisher= Cambridge University Press| year=1864| isbn=978-1-176-62256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbol Fl is now used for the [[super-heavy element]] [[flerovium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/element-114-is-named-flerovium-and-element-116-is-named-livermorium.html |title=Element 114 is named flerovium and element 116 is named livermorium |date=2012-05-30 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early isolation attempts==

[[File:Edmond Frémy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Edmond Fremy, early fluorine researcher]]

Progress in isolating the element was slowed by the exceptional dangers of generating fluorine:  several 19th century experimenters, the "fluorine martyrs", were killed or blinded. Davy, as well as the notable French chemists [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], experienced severe pains from inhaling hydrogen fluoride gas; Davy's eyes were damaged. Irish chemists [[Thomas and George Knox]] developed fluorite apparatus for working with hydrogen fluoride, but nonetheless were severely poisoned. Thomas nearly died and George was an invalid for three years. Belgian chemist [[Paulin Louyet]] and French chemist [[Jerome Nickles]] tried to follow the Knox work, but they died from HF poisoning even though they were aware of the dangers.&lt;ref name="Weeks"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Toon"/&gt;

Humphry Davy of England: poisoned, recovered.
George and Thomas Knox of Ireland: both poisoned, one bedridden 3 years, recovered.
P. Louyet of Belgium: poisoned, died.
Jerome Nickels of Nancy, France: poisoned, died.
George Gore of England: fluorine / hydrogen explosion, narrowly escaped injury.
Henri Moissan of France: poisoned several times, success, but shortened life.

Initial attempts to isolate the element were also hindered by material difficulties:  the extreme corrosiveness and reactivity of hydrogen fluoride (and of fluorine gas) as well as problems getting a suitable conducting liquid for [[electrolysis]]. Davy tried to electrolyze HF but had to stop because the electrodes were damaged. He then shifted to (unsuccessful) chemical reactions.

[[Edmond Frémy]] thought that passing electric current through pure hydrofluoric acid (dry HF) might work. Previously, hydrogen fluoride was only available in a water solution. Frémy therefore devised a method for producing dry hydrogen fluoride by acidifying [[potassium bifluoride]] (KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Unfortunately, pure hydrogen fluoride did not pass an electric current. Frémy also tried electrolyzing molten calcium fluoride and probably produced some fluorine (since he made calcium metal at the other electrode), but he was unable to collect the gas.

English chemist [[George Gore (electrochemist)|George Gore]] also tried electrolyzing dry HF and may have made small quantities of fluorine gas in 1860. He reported an explosion after running his cell (hydrogen and fluorine recombine dramatically), but he recognized that an oxygen leak could have also caused the reaction.&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Toon"/&gt;

==Moissan==

[[File:Henri Moissan HiRes.jpg|alt=painting of bearded man facing left|thumb|upright|Henri Moissan, fluorine discover (Nobel Prize photo)]]

French chemist [[Henri Moissan]], formerly one of Frémy's students, continued the search. After trying many different approaches, he built on Frémy and Gore's earlier attempts by combining potassium bifluoride and hydrogen fluoride. The resultant solution conducted electricity. Moissan also constructed especially corrosion-resistant equipment: containers crafted from a mixture of [[platinum]] and [[iridium]] (more chemically resistant than pure platinum) with fluorite stoppers.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=789–791}}&lt;ref name = "Toon"/&gt;

After 74 years of effort by many chemists, on 26 June 1886, Moissan isolated elemental fluorine.&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt;&lt;ref name='qwen'&gt;{{cite journal|title = Action d'un courant électrique sur l'acide fluorhydrique anhydre| last1 = Moissan| first1 = Henry| journal= Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences| year = 1886| volume = 102| pages = 1543–1544| url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3058f/f1541.chemindefer|accessdate=7 May 2011|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moissan's report to the French Academy of making fluorine showed appreciation for the feat:  "One can indeed make various hypotheses on the nature of the liberated gas; the simplest would be that ''we are in the presence of fluorine''."{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=789–791}}

Moissan's 1887 publication documents reaction attempts of fluorine gas with several substances: sulfur (flames), hydrogen (explosion), carbon (no reaction), etc. Later, Moissan devised a less expensive apparatus for making fluorine: copper equipment coated with [[copper(II) fluoride|copper fluoride]].

Moissan also constructed special apparatus—5m long platinum tubes with fluorite windows—to determine the slight yellow color of fluorine gas. (The gas appears transparent in small tubes or when allowed to escape. The color observation was not repeated until the 1980s, when his result was confirmed.)

[[File:Moissan color images.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Moissan's 1892 observation of the color of fluorine gas (2), compared to air (1) and chlorine (3)]]

In 1906, two months before his death, Moissan received the Nobel Prize in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1906/ |publisher=nobelprize.org|title=The Nobel Prize in chemistry 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=791}}&lt;ref name="Chem Nobel laureates"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Laylin K.|title=Nobel laureates in chemistry, 1901–1992|year=1993|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|isbn=978-0-8412-2690-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEy67gEvIuMC&amp;pg=PA35|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The citation:&lt;ref name = "Toon"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Toon |first=Richard |title=The discovery of fluorine |date=1 September 2011 |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=148–151 |url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-discovery-of-fluorine/2020249.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Moissan's Nobel also honored his invention of the [[electric arc furnace]]||group="note"}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;...in recognition of the great services rendered by him in his investigation and isolation of the element fluorine...The whole world has admired the great experimental skill with which you have studied that savage beast among the elements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development==

During the 1930s and 1940s, the [[DuPont]] company commercialized organofluorine compounds at large scales. Following trials of chlorofluorcarbons as refrigerants by researchers at [[General Motors]], DuPont developed large-scale production of [[Freon-12]]. DuPont and GM formed a joint venture in 1930 to market the new product; in 1949 DuPont took over the business. Freon proved to be a marketplace hit, rapidly replacing earlier, more toxic, refrigerants and growing the overall market for kitchen refrigerators.&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt;{{sfn|Hounshell|Smith|1988|p=156}}&lt;ref name="Jstg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD Freon history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freon|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Phoenix_Heritage/en_US/1930_d_detail.html|publisher=dupont.com|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) was discovered by accident by a recently hired DuPont PhD, [[Roy J. Plunkett]]. While working with a cylinder of [[tetrafluoroethylene]], he was unable to release the gas, although the weight had not changed. Scraping down the container, he found white flakes of a [[polymer]] new to the world. Tests showed the substance was resistant to corrosion from most substances and had better high temperature stability than any other plastic. By early 1941, a crash program was making commercial quantities.&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jstg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Okazoe|first1 = Takashi|title = Overview on the history of organofluorine chemistry from the viewpoint of material industry|journal= Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B|volume = 85|pages = 276–289|year = 2009|doi = 10.2183/pjab.85.276|issue = 8|bibcode = 2009PJAB...85..276O|format=PDF|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pjab/85/8/85_8_276/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hounshell|Smith|1988|p=157}}

[[File:K25 Aerial.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=top level view of large industrial buildings|The Manhattan Project's [[K-25]] gaseous diffusion plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]

Large-scale productions of elemental fluorine began during World War II. Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to produce tons of [[chlorine trifluoride]], a compound planned to be used as an incendiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Meyer|first1 = Eugene|title = Chemistry of hazardous materials|journal= Prentice Hall|edition = 1st|page = 111|year = 1977|isbn=9780131292390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Manhattan project]] in the United States produced even more fluorine for use in [[Enriched uranium|uranium separation]]. Gaseous [[uranium hexafluoride]] was used to separate [[uranium-235]], an important nuclear explosive, from the heavier [[uranium-238]] in [[Gaseous diffusion|diffusion plants]]. Because uranium hexafluoride releases small quantities of corrosive fluorine, the separation plants were built with special materials. All pipes were coated with nickel; joints and flexible parts were fabricated from Teflon.&lt;ref name="Jstg"/&gt;

In 1958, a DuPont research manager in the Teflon business, [[Bill Gore]], left the company because of its unwillingness to develop Teflon as wire-coating insulation. Gore's son [[Robert W. Gore|Robert]] found a method for solving the wire-coating problem and the company [[W. L. Gore and Associates]] was born.{{sfn|Hounshell|Smith|1988|p=489}} In 1969, Robert Gore developed an expanded [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (ePTFE) membrane which led to the large [[Gore-Tex]] business in breathable rainwear. The company developed many other uses of PTFE.&lt;ref name="Gore innovation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrington|first=Ann|title=Who's afraid of a new product? Not W.L. Gore.

In the 1970s and 1980s, concerns developed over the role chlorofluorocarbons play in damaging the [[ozone layer]]. By 1996, almost all nations had banned chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants and commercial production ceased. Fluorine continued to play a role in refrigeration though: [[hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] (HCFCs) and [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs) were developed as replacement refrigerants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/defns.html#hcfc|title=Ozone depletion glossary|accessdate=3 September 2008|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/q_a.html |title=Brief questions and answers on ozone depletion &amp;#124; Ozone layer protection |author= U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |year=2006 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

During the 18th century, the Marquess of San Clemente commanded the construction of the mansion, for his daughter. In the 19th century the house was a post office until 1890 when Tadeo Fulgencío Mejía, a mines of De Cata y de Mellano mining engineer, bought the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=2011-12-16 |title=Cumple su primer año la Casa de los Lamentos |url=http://www.periodicocorreo.com.mx/ocio/12514-cumple-su-primer-ano-la-casa-de-los-lamentos.html |location=Guanajuato, Mexico |publisher=Periódico Correo |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001044/http://www.periodicocorreo.com.mx/ocio/12514-cumple-su-primer-ano-la-casa-de-los-lamentos.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tadeo Mejía crimes===
Tadeo Mejía's wife, Constanza de la Rivera, died in 1890 during an assault. According with some versions, the murder of Constanza occurred during a domestic invasion orchested for employees of the mine where Mejía worked, they accused him of malversation but really the mine suffered a economic crisis and for this reason the salaries had been late. Costanza was stabbed in the neck. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://puntozer0.com/leyenda-de-la-casa-de-los-lamentos/ |title=Leyenda de la Casa de los Lamentos |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1 October 2017 |website=puntozer0.com |language= Spanish  |trans-title= Legend of the House of Laments |publisher=Zona Cer0 |access-date=17 February 2018 |quote=Se cuenta que la mina en la que trabajaba Don Tadeo sufrió una mala racha, las vetas escaseaban y los trabajadores se irritaban pues no recibían su pagos como era debido.

Un día mientras paseaban como acostumbraban Don Tadeo y la joven Constanza, como era hábito, al final de su paseo se quedaron a ver la futura casa que acogería su cariño. De pronto un trabajador tocó la puerta diciéndole a Don Tadeo que lo necesitaban urgentemente en la mina, y sin pensar Fulgencio se fue inmediatamente, dejando sola a la bella Constanza...

Al tiempo, regresó Don Tadeo, en el suelo un charco de sangre que brotaba del cuerpo de Constanza. Ella fue asesinada a sangre fría, Don Tadeo sólo la contemplaba y sollozaba, se negaba lo que sus ojos presenciaban, el encuentro de emociones hizo que golpeara su cabeza contra los muros.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According with other versions, Costanza died in a street near to hose.

Supposedly, her death caused the [[psychosis]] of Tadeo Mejía. He consulted with a "witch", who showed him strange rituals that included human sacrifices of young men and women. Tadeo Mejía committed an unknown number of murders, but several human bones were located in the mansion's basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people =Alejandra Enciso (reporter)| year =2011| title =Extranormal: Historias a fondo, Casa de los Lamentos|trans-title=Extranormal: Histories to depth, The House of laments| medium =TV| language =Spanish| url =http://www.metatube.com/es/videos/63284/Extranormal-Historias-a-fondo-Casa-de-los-Lamentos/| accessdate =| time =| location =Guanajuato, Mexico| publisher =TV Azteca| id =| isbn =| oclc =| quote =| ref =

[[File:Green insect on hand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The "Spanish Fly", ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'' has been considered to have medicinal, [[aphrodisiac]], and other properties&lt;!--, though it contains an irritant chemical, [[cantharidin]], which is certainly toxic--&gt;.]]
'''Human interactions with insects''' include both a wide variety of uses, whether practical such as for food, textiles, and dyestuffs, or symbolic, as in art, music, and literature, and negative interactions including serious damage to crops and extensive efforts to eliminate insect pests. 

Academically, the interaction of insects and society has been treated in part as '''cultural entomology''', dealing mostly with "advanced" societies, and in part as '''ethnoentomology''', dealing mostly with "primitive" societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of [[insects]] on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in [[anthropology]] and [[natural history]], as well as [[entomology]], the study of insects. Other [[culture|cultural]] uses of insects, such as [[biomimicry]], do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.

More generally, people make a wide range of uses of insects, both practical and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of [[insecticide]]s has failed to exterminate any [[insect pest]], but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.

Practical uses include [[entomophagy|as food]], [[Insects in medicine|in medicine]], for the valuable [[textile]] [[silk]], for [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]], in science, where the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] is an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]], and [[Entomological warfare|in warfare]], where insects were successfully used in the [[Second World War]] to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the [[honey bee]], provides [[honey]], [[pollen]], [[royal jelly]], [[propolis]] and an anti-inflammatory peptide, [[melittin]]; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include [[maggot therapy]] for wound [[debridement]]. Over a thousand protein families have been identified in the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, [[vasodilation|vasodilators]], [[antihistamine]]s and [[anaesthetic]]s.

Symbolic uses include roles [[Insects in art|in art]], [[Insects in music|in music]] (with [[List of insect-inspired songs|many songs featuring insects]]), [[Arthropods in film|in film]], [[Insects in literature|in literature]], [[Insects in religion|in religion]], and in mythology. Insect [[costume]]s are used in theatrical productions and worn for parties and carnivals.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by insects in human culture so defined.

===Cultural entomology and ethnoentomology===

[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|left|"[[The Malay Archipelago|Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo]]": [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was a pioneer of ethnoentomology.]]

Ethnoentomology developed from the 19th century with early works by authors such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1852) and [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1862). [[Hans Zinsser]]'s "classic" ''[[Rats, Lice and History]]'' (1935) showed that insects were an important force in human history. Writers like [[William Morton Wheeler]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Jean Henri Fabre]] described insect life and  communicated their meaning to people "with imagination and brilliance". Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy, and showed a positive aspect of insects. [[Food]] is the most studied topic in ethnoentomology, followed by [[medicine]] and [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posey |first1=Darrell Addison |title=Topics And Issues In Ethnoentomology With Some Suggestions For The  Development Of Hypothesis-Generation And Testing In Ethnobiology |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=99–120 |url=https://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801192909/http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crop Duster.jpg|thumb|upright|Fighting insects: an [[agricultural aircraft]] applies low-[[insecticide]] bait to kill [[western corn rootworm]]s.]]

In 1968, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Schimitschek|de}} claimed cultural entomology as a branch of insect studies, in a review of the roles insects played in [[folklore]] and culture including [[religion]], food, medicine and the arts.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schimitschek |first=E. |title=Handbuch der Zoologie |year=1968 |publisher=Berliner Akademie Verlag|editor=Helmcke J.G. |editor2=Stark D. |editor3=Wermuth H. |chapter=Insekten als Nahrung, Brauchtum, Kult und Kultur |volume= 4 | pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Charles Hogue]] covered the field in English and from 1994 to 1997, Hogue's ''The Cultural Entomology Digest'' served as a forum on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogue|first=Charles|title=Cultural Entomology|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who? What? Why?|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/who_what_why.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogue argued that "Humans spend their intellectual energies in three basic areas of activity: surviving, using practical learning (the application of technology); seeking pure knowledge through inductive mental processes (science); and pursuing enlightenment to taste a pleasure by aesthetic exercises that may be referred to as the "humanities." [[Entomology]] has long been concerned with survival ([[economic entomology]]) and scientific study (academic entomology), but the branch of investigation that addresses the influence of insects (and other terrestrial Arthropoda, including [[arachnids]] and [[myriapods]]) in literature, language, music, the arts, interpretive history, religion, and recreation has only become recognized as a distinct field through Schimitschek's work.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schimitschek | first=E. | title=Die Bedeutung der Insekten für Kultur und Wirtschaft des Menschen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart | journal=Istanbul Universitesi | date= 1961 |volume= 908: | pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogue 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1987|volume= 32 |pages=181–199 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hogue set out the boundaries of the field by saying: "The narrative history of the science of entomology is not part of cultural entomology, while the influence of insects on general [[history]] would be considered cultural entomology."&lt;ref name="Hogue"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Because the term "cultural" is narrowly defined, some aspects normally included in studies of human societies are excluded."&lt;ref name="Hogue"/&gt;

Darrell Addison Posey, noting that the boundary between cultural entomology and ethnoentomology is difficult to draw, cites Hogue as limiting cultural entomology to the influence of insects on "the essence of humanity as expressed in the arts and humanities". Posey notes further that cultural anthropology is usually restricted to the study of "advanced", industrialised, and literate societies, whereas ethnoentomology studies "the entomological concerns of 'primitive' or 'noncivilized' societies". Posey states at once that the division is artificial, complete with an unjustified us/them bias.&lt;ref name=Posey/&gt; Brian Morris similarly criticises the way that anthropologists treat non-Western attitudes to nature as monadic and spiritualist, and contrast this "in [[gnostic]] fashion" with a simplistic treatment of Western, often 17th century, mechanistic attitude. Morris considers this "quite unhelpful, if not misleading", and offers instead his own research into the multiple ways that the people of [[Malawi]] relate to insects and other animals: "pragmatic, intellectual, realist, practical, aesthetic, symbolic and sacramental."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and costs==

===Insect ecosystem services===
[[File:Honeybee (Apis mellifera) pollinating Avocado cv.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pollination]], here by a bee on an [[avocado]] crop, is an [[ecosystem service]].]]

The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) report 2005 defines [[ecosystem services]] as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet is that a few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, [[ant]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[spider]]s).  However, insects offer [[ecological goods and services]].&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and human well-being : synthesis|date=2005|publisher=Island Press|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-59726-040-1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xerces Society]] calculates the economic impact of four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. "the importance of bugs to [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and wildlife observation, including [[bird-watching]]"), dung burial, and [[biological pest control|pest control]]. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lyman Kirst |first=Marian |title=Insect – the neglected 99% |url=http://www.hcn.org/blogs/goat/insects-the-neglected-99-percent/ |accessdate=22 July 2012 |newspaper=High Country News |date=29 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ant expert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward O.

Wilson]] observed: "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.O. |title=The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth |date=2006 |publisher=Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nova (TV Series)]] segment on the American [[Public Broadcasting Service]] framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives&amp;nbsp;... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Creatures Who Run the World|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2203crea.html|work=Nova|publisher=PBS Airdate: August 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated: "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the [[Asian tiger mosquito]] or the [[fire ant]], appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Adrian |title=Saving Earth From the Ground Up |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/29/AR2007062902334.html |work=June 30, 2007 |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=22 July 2012 |date=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 can be regarded as serious [[pest insect|pest]]s, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including [[pollinator]]s such as bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller G.T. |title=Sustaining the Earth |edition=6th |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson Learning |pages=211–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries launched a widespread [[war against the potato beetle]], blaming the [[Colorado potato beetle|introduction of the species]] from America on the [[CIA]], demonising the species in [[propaganda]] posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.&lt;ref name=colUWP&gt;{{cite web |last=Sindelar |first=Daisy|title=What's Orange and Black and Bugging Ukraine? |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-colorado-beetle-separatists/25365793.html |work=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;br&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/world/europe/kievs-reins-weaken-as-chaos-spreads.html?_r=0 Ukraine’s Reins Weaken as Chaos Spreads], [[The New York Times]] (4 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{main article|Entomophagy}}
[[File:Witchetty grub.jpg|thumb|left|[[Witchetty grub]]s were prized as food by [[Australian aborigine]]s.]]

[[Entomophagy]] is the eating of insects. Many insects are considered a culinary [[delicacy]] in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy,  but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow | first=Victor Benno | title=Can insects help to ease the problem of world food shortage? | journal= ANZAAS Journal: "Search"| date= 1975|volume= 6 |issue= 7 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer [[caterpillar]]s to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) &lt;ref name="Nyishi"&gt;Chakravorty, J., Ghosh, S., and V.B. Meyer-Rochow. (2011). Practices of entomophagy and entomotherapy by members of the Nyishi and Galo tribes, two ethnic groups of the state of Arunachal Pradesh (North-East India). ''Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 7(5)''&lt;/ref&gt; point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Laos"&gt;Meyer-Rochow V.B., Nonaka K., Boulidam S (2008) More feared than revered: Insects and their impacts on human societies (with specific data on the importance of entomophagy in a Laotian setting. ''Entomologie Heute 20: 3–25''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, ant larvae and Corixid water boatman eggs are sought out as a form of [[caviar]] by gastronomes. In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]''.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2009/&gt;

===In medicine===
[[File:Eciton burchellii Illustration.png|thumb|[[Eciton burchellii]]|Army ants were used by the Mayans as living [[Surgical suture|suture]]s, their powerful jaws holding a wound closed.]]
{{main article|Insects in medicine}}

Insects have been used medicinally in cultures around the world, often according to the [[Doctrine of Signatures]]. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Ramos-Elorduy de Concini, J. and J.M. Pino Moreno. (1988). The utilization of insects in the empirical medicine of ancient Mexicans. ''Journal of Ethnobiology, 8(2), 195–202.''&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine was applied in both [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) and in [[Ayurveda]]. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, [[centipede]] is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions,&lt;ref name="centipede"&gt;http://tcm.health-info.org/Herbology.Materia.Medica/wugong-properties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, ''[[Polyrhachis]] vicina'', is used as a cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1809450.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Ayurveda uses insects such as [[Termite]] for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The [[Jatropha]] leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Nyishi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting"&gt;Srivastava, S.K., Babu, N., and H. Pandey. (2009). Traditional insect bioprospecting—As human food and medicine. ''Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge, 8(4):'' 485–494.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised.&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally.

Insects play an important role in biological research.

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''Pachycondyla commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''Pseudomyrmex'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The red harvester ant ''[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]]'' has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.

Both the symbolic form and the actual body of insects have been used to adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features.  Often referred to as the bee "goddess",  these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to the genus [[Sternocera]].  The practice comes from across Asia and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Myanmar, Japan, India and China.  In Thailand beetlewings were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewellery in former court circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Beetle-Wing Tea-Cosy |url=https://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk/content/beetle-wing-tea-cosy |publisher=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Butterflies]] have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Speak, Memory |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |location=New York |page=129 |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories&amp;nbsp;... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the artist Anna Collette created over 10,000 individual ceramic insects at [[Nottingham Castle]], "Stirring the Swarm." Reviews of the exhibit offered a compelling narrative for Cultural Entomology: "the unexpected use of materials, dark overtones, and the straightforward impact of thousands of tiny multiples within the space. The exhibition was at once both exquisitely beautiful and deeply repulsive, and this strange duality was fascinating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=French |first=Anneka |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/interface/reviews/single/1652788 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://download.cnet.com/Stirring-the-Swarm/3000-12511_4-75660244.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s essay ''Butterflies'' analyses the treatment of the butterfly in [[Japanese literature]], both prose and poetry. He notes that these often allude to Chinese tales, such as of the young woman that the butterflies took to be a flower.

The honey bee played a central role in the cosmology of the [[Mayan people]]. The stucco figure at the temples of Tulum known as "Ah Mucen Kab" – the Diving Bee God – bears resemblance to the insect in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus identified as a bee.  Such reliefs might have indicated towns and villages that produce honey. Modern Mayan authorities say the figure also have a connection to modern cosmology. Mayan mythology expert Migel Angel Vergara relates that the Mayans held a belief that bees came from Venus, the "Second Sun."

The costuming was a fusion of arthropod body types blended with superhero armour. Liz Vandal, the lead costume designer, has a special affinity for the world of the insect:&lt;ref name=Cirque/&gt;

{{quote|When I was just a kid I put rocks down around the yard near the fruit trees and I lifted them regularly to watch the insects who had taken up residence underneath them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14060">'''Informatization''' or '''informatisation''' refers to the extent by which a geographical area, an economy or a society is becoming information-based, i.e. the increase in size of its information labor force. Usage of the term was inspired by [[Marc Porat]]’s categories of ages of human civilization: the Agricultural Age, the Industrial Age and the Information Age (1978). Informatization is to the Information Age what industrialization was to the Industrial Age. It has been stated that:

:The Agricultural Age has brought about the agriculturization of the planet. The Industrial Age has caused among other things the industrialization of agriculture. The Information Age has resulted to the informatization of the agricultural industry (Flor, 1993).

The term has mostly been used within the context of national development. [[Everett Rogers]] ([[#Rogers2000|2000]]) defines informatization as the process through which new communication technologies are used as a means for furthering development as a nation becomes more and more an [[information society]]. However, some observers, such as Alexander Flor ([[#Flor1986|1986]]) have cautioned about the negative impact of informatization on traditional societies.

Recently, the [[technological determinism]] dimension has been highlighted in informatization. [[Randy Kluver]] of Texas A&amp;M University defines informatization as the process primarily by which information technologies, such as the World Wide Web and other communication technologies, have transformed economic and social relations to such an extent that cultural and economic barriers are minimized. Kluver expands the concept to encompass the civic and cultural arenas. He believes that it is a process whereby information and communication technologies shape cultural and civic discourse.

[[G. Wang]] describes the same phenomenon (1994) which she calls "informatization" as a "process" of change that features (a) the use of informatization and IT (information technologies) to such an extent that they become the dominant forces in commanding economic, political, social and cultural development; and (b) unprecedented growth in the speed, quantity, and popularity of information production and distribution."

==Origin of the term==
The term informatisation was coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in their publication ''L'Informatisation de la société: Rapport à M. le Président de la République''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=L'informatisation de la société|journal=La Documentation française|date=1978|pages=901|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/154000252/index.shtml|accessdate=23 February 2016|ref=nora-minc|isbn=2020049740}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated in English in 1980 as ''The Computerization of Society: A report to the President of France''.&lt;ref name="nora-minc-en"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=The computerization of society : a report to the President of France0-262-64020-1|date=1981|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262640201|pages=208|edition=2. pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]) However, in an article published in 1987 Minc preferred to use informatisation and not [[Digital Revolution|computerization]].

After the 1978 publication the concept was adopted in French, German and English subject literatures and was broadened to include more aspects than only computers and [[telecommunication]]s ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]).

==Social impact of informatization==
Informatization has many far-reaching consequences in society. Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) observes that these include repercussions in economics, politics and other aspects of modern living. In the economic sphere, for example, information is viewed as a focal resource for development, replacing the centrality of labor and capital during the industrial age. In the political arena, there are increased opportunities for participative democracy with the advent of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) that provide easy access to information on varied social and political issues.

==Informatization in economic systems==
[[Industrialization]] propelled transformation of the economic system from agricultural age to modernized economies, and so informatization ushered the industrial age into an information-rich economy. Unlike the agricultural and industrial ages where economics refers to optimization of scarce resources, the information age deals with maximization of abundant resources. Alexander Flor ([[#Flor2008|2008]]) wrote that informatization gives rise to information-based economies and societies wherein information naturally becomes a dominant commodity or resource. The accumulation and efficient use of knowledge has played a central role in the transformation of the economy ([[#Linden2004|Linden 2004]]).

==Globalization and informatization==
Over the years, [[globalization]] and informatization have "redefined industries, politics, cultures, and perhaps the underlying rules of social order" ([[#Friedman|Friedman 1999]]). Although they explain different phenomena, their social, political, economic, and cultural functions remarkably overlaps. "Although globalization ultimately refers to the integration of economic institutions, much of this integration occurs through the channels of technology. Although international trade is not a new phenomenon, the advent of communications technologies has accelerated the pace and scope of trade" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::a) Globalization and Informatization will have great impact on cultural and social consequences of society.

::b) "Globalization and informatization are likely to diminish the concept of the national as a political institution" ([[#Poster|Poster 1999]]). Friedman ([[#Friedman|1999]]) argues that as nation states decline in importance, [[multi-national corporation]]s, [[nongovernmental organizations]], and "superempowered individuals" such as [[George Soros]] gain influence and importance. As these non-political organizations and institutions gain importance, there are inevitable challenges to political, economic, and cultural processes.

::c) On the other hand, globalization and informatization allow for efficient flow of information.  Individuals and societies are, therefore, greatly empowered to engage in international arena for economic, political, and cultural resources.

::d) "There is proliferation of information about lifestyles, religions, and cultural issues.  The telecommunications and computer networks also allow for unprecedented global activism.  This democratization of information increases the potential for international harmony, although it by no means guarantees it" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::e) These twin forces greatly affects "centuries of tradition, local autonomy, and cultural integrity."

::f) "Finally, one of the potentially most devastating impact of the forces of globalization and informatization is that there is created an insidious conflict between the new global economic order and the local, or even tribal, interests" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

==Measurement of informatization==
Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) proposed to measure the informatization in a country using a composite measure made up of the following extraneous variables: Education, R&amp;D Expenditure, Agricultural Sector and [[Intellectual Property]]. Kim also relates increasing democracy as evidence of social informatization.  It supposedly take into consideration the three approaches to conceptualizing informatization namely the economic, technological, and stock. Each can be measured with economic data (e.g. GDP), ICT data (e.g. number of computers per population), and amount of information (e.g. number of published technological journals) respectively.

Such composite measure is similar to the [[World Bank]]'s Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM) Variables ([[#Worldbank1|2008]]) which are clustered into: overall performance of the economy, economic incentive and institutional regime, innovation system, education and human resources, and information and communication technology.

==The Problem of Measuring Informatization==
The measurement for the level of informatization is an ongoing area of development. Among the issues are the ambiguity of the definition of “information” and whether this entity can be quantifiable in contrast to the tangible products of industrialization.

Taylor and Zang ([[#TaylorAndZang2007|2007]]) explored the issues behind the limitations of current theoretical models in terms of quantifying the positive impacts of ICT projects, and provided critiques of the information indicators used to gauge and justify informatization projects.

International organizations such as the United Nations, through its World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also recognize this challenge and have initiated efforts to improve the methodologies for measuring an “information society”.

==National laws on informatization==
Informatization is recognized by states as important to national development. Some states have created laws implementing or regulating informatization.

In [[Russia]] the State [[Duma]] enacted the ''Federal Law on Information, Informatization, and the Protection of Information'' on January 25, 1995. It was signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin on February 20, 1995.

[[Azerbaijan]] had a ''Law on Information, Informatization and Protection of Information'' in 1998.

The '''Keiga people''' are a sub-ethnic group of the [[Nuba peoples]] in the [[Nuba Mountains]] of [[South Kordofan|South Kordofan state]], in southern [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Komey1/&gt;
The population of this ethnicity likely is below 10,000. They speak [[Keiga language|Keiga]], a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=12606&amp;rog3=SU
 |title=Keiga of Sudan
 |work=Joshua Project
 |accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The language belongs to the [[Kadugli–Krongo]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Linguistic Lineage for Keiga
 |work=Ethnologue
 |accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Keiga people live north and northwest of [[Kadugli]] in [[South Kurdufan State]].
Their tradition says that all Keiga communities originated from Kulu sub-hill in Keiga Tummero hill.
From there, they gradually spread over the present Keiga territory, the four hill communities of Tummero, Luban, al-Khayl, and Dameik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Keiga people practice farming in the rainy season and also raise cattle. They have been in competition for land with Arabs in the area, sometimes escalating into violence.&lt;ref name=Komey1/&gt;

Keiga people live in two major areas. These areas are Ambong and Koolo. Those who live in Ambong  named themselves as ''Kayikang ma Ambong'' i.e. the Keiga of Ambong, while those who live in Koolo named themselves as ''Kayikang n Koolo'' i.e. the Keiga of Koolo. The two groups speak Keiga language with different accents and sometimes different words and phrases. The Keiga traditional name is Kayigang as plural and Tayigang for singular but like many names in the Nuba Mountains, Kayigang was altered to be Keiga. The name Ambong in Keiga means SULTNATE. Dameek is one of the Ambong village with four hamlets, and historically its name was ROOFIK which is derived from the name of a Kamda tribe's place called ''LEINYA MA ROOFIK''. which means the hill of Roofik. The name roofik came to existence when three men and a woman came to Keiga Ambong escaping from the scourge of war as a safe hideaway. The Ambong Sultane welcomed them and put them in that place under his protection. The new comers were then called KAROOFIK i.e. the roofik people. One good thing in Keiga Sultante is that, it keeps calling those who come to Ambong for any reason with names of the places they came from, just like Jersey and New Jersey. Zealand and New Zealand. So the name Dameek came to existence very new. The Dameek Village although lies in Keiga Ambong area, but the people there commonly speak Dameek language which is far much closer to the Kamda language. It is worth mentioning that Kamda and Keiga tribes are from the very same language family tree. Keiga Ambong people did not come from Keiga Koolo. Instead some Keiga Koolo people for some reasons moved to Keiga Ambong and they were named after Koolo as Kakoolo and there are maternal families living in Ambong till now who claim to be Keiga Ambong and not Keiga Koolo.

'''Koreans in Spain''' form one of [[Spain|the country]]'s smaller Asian populations.&lt;ref name="Beltrán Antolín 2006 p=106"&gt;{{harvnb|Beltrán Antolín|2006|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography and distribution==
2006 statistics from Spain's [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]] showed 2,873 registered residents of Spain born in South Korea, of whom 514 held [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish nationality]], while 2,359 held other nationalities. Among Spanish nationals, men outnumbered women by a ratio of 1.3:1, which was almost exactly reversed among non-Spanish nationals. Between 1980 and 2004, a total of 696 people originally holding South Korean nationality became Spanish citizens.&lt;ref name="Beltrán Antolín 2006 p=106"/&gt; South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], whose statistics are based largely on registrations with consulates and count locally born persons of Korean descent as well as South Korean-born individuals, recorded a somewhat higher count of 3,769 individuals in 2005; of those, 2,538 resided in, with another 1,231 in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]]. This made Koreans in Spain the fifth-largest [[Korean diaspora]] population in [[Western Europe]], behind [[Koreans in the United Kingdom]], [[Koreans in Germany]], [[Koreans in France]], and [[Koreans in Italy]].&lt;ref name="Overseas2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Overseas Korean Foundation|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent statistics of the South Korean government, issued in July 2011, show only slight growth compared to the 2005 statistics. Of the 4,080 Koreans recorded as living in Spain, 929 had Spanish citizenship, 2,108 had permanent residence, 216 were on student visas, and the remaining 727 had other kinds of visas.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt;

==Las Palmas==
Koreans in Las Palmas form a community distinct from that on the [[Peninsular Spain|Spanish mainland]]. Theirs is the only concentration of Koreans in Spain whose presence has resulted in a recognisable [[Koreatown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beltrán Antolín|2006|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; They trace their origins to South Korean migrant workers who worked on deep-ocean fishing boats based on the island starting in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="BeltranAntolin"&gt;{{harvnb|Beltrán Antolín|Sáiz López|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing, along with construction, was one of the main sources of overseas employment for South Koreans for decades; by the 1970s, nearly 15,000 Koreans resided in Las Palmas, making them about 4% of the city's population of 350,000. Many brought their families over and became rooted in Spain, sending their children to local schools.&lt;ref name="Shim2005a"&gt;{{harvnb|Shim|2005|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the decline of South Korea's ocean fisheries industries in the 1990s, their population shrank, from 2,283 individuals in 1997 to just 1,292 by 1999, a number which decreased at a slower rate over the following decade to reach 1,197 by 2011.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shim2005a" /&gt; Most of the remaining Korean population have shifted away from the fishing industry, and their children have largely entered professional fields, achieving relative affluence.&lt;ref name="Shim2005a" /&gt;

==Mainland Spain==
The Korean community on the Spanish mainland consists mainly of two groups: primarily male small business owners and executives of South Korean companies along with their spouses and children, and primarily female [[international student]]s at Spanish universities.&lt;ref name="Beltrán Antolín 2006 p=113&amp;ndash;114"&gt;{{harvnb|Beltrán Antolín|2006|pp=113&amp;ndash;114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean martial arts|Korean martial artists]], though a smaller group, are also well represented; they either run their own ''[[dojang]]'', or work for private security companies.&lt;ref name="BeltranAntolin" /&gt; They do not trace their origins exclusively to South Korea; some members of the communities of [[Koreans in Argentina]] and other Latin American countries have also settled in Spain, and South Korean businessowners often employ [[Koreans in China|''chosunjok'' from China]] in their businesses. Their population peaked in the 1990s and then decreased due to the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], during which many South Korean companies, anxious to cut costs, shifted operations out of Western Europe into the cheaper countries of Eastern Europe, Latin America, and China.&lt;ref name="Beltrán Antolín 2006 p=113&amp;ndash;114"/&gt;

LGAT was a name coined for personal development programs in which many people at one time receive intense, emotionally focussed instruction over a period of hours or days to help them begin to discover the full potential for their lives. Described as part psychotherapy, part spirituality, and part business (Langone, 1998), notable LGAT programs, which originated from the human potential movement of the 1950s and 1960s, include the Erhard Seminars Training (est), Landmark Forum, Lifespring and Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). These simplistic, highly structured and lucrative methods have spawned hundreds of take-offs on the original seminars, each attempting to create their own unique version.}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4028">'''Louise Kerr Hines''' (born Louise Lyles Kerr) (born March 15, 1916-April 9, 2007) was an [[African Americans|African American]] [[Civil Rights]] [[Activism|activist]]. In 1945, Hines, along with her father, Dr. T. Henderson Kerr, were [[Plaintiff|plaintiffs]] in a [[lawsuit]] against the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] for their denial of her application for their [[library]] training course.

Hines was born in [[Baltimore]] and graduated [[Frederick Douglass High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Frederick Douglass High School]]. After graduating from Coppin Normal School (now [[Coppin State University]]), Hines was employed as a [[teacher]] in segregated Baltimore schools. In 1943, after working as a teacher for five years, Hines saw an advertisement in the [[Baltimore Sun]] for a position for a "colored" assistant for the library, but she was denied due to her race.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-04-14/news/0704140202_1_louise-kerr-pratt-free-library-hines|title=Louise Kerr Hines|newspaper=tribunedigital-baltimoresun|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pratt had previously hired two African-American library assistants to work at a branch located in a predominantly [[African-American neighborhood]], however they did not receive training through the library course.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-22/features/0405220026_1_kerr-hines-pratt-free-library|title=She beat segregation years before `Brown'|newspaper=tribunedigital-baltimoresun|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being persuaded by [[Carl J. Murphy]] of the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]'' newspaper and [[Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson]] of the Baltimore branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], Hines, along with her father, sued the library.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were represented by [[William A.C. Hughes]] and [[Charles Hamilton Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herzog|first=Donald J.|date=2007|title=The Kerr Principle, State Action, and Legal Rights|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=articles|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes and Houston argued that the library, as public institution which received funds from the city, were in violation of the law for barring tax-paying African-Americans from the course.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The case was initially dismissed because the judge argued that the library was a private corporation, not a governmental agency. However, after the case was appealed to the 4th U.S. District Court of Appeals, the court ruled that the library was an "instrumentality of the State of [[Maryland]]" and had violated Hines' [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] rights. The library appealed the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], but it was dismissed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The library training course as subsequently opened to all applicants, but was later disbanded.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the case, Hines worked as a secretary for the Baltimore NAACP and a reporter for the ''Afro-American''. She would ultimately work as a claims examiner for the Maryland Department of Human Resources, where she retired in 1978. Hines was later honored in 1986 at the [[centennial]] celebration of the library. She died of [[cancer]] on April 9, 2007 in Baltimore at the age of 91.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''For the district in Bali see [[Melaya, Bali]]''

The '''M'alayah''' (Arabic: معلايه or  معلاية / [[ALA-LC]]: ''ma‘alāyah'') is a kind of [[dance]] common in [[Eastern Arabia]], mostly in the countries of UAE and Oman. The dance is usually misnamed by calling it various names such as um-alaya, dagni, etc.

The term and its origin is doubtful due to the obscurity of the rather taboo nature of the dance in traditional Islamic [[Persian Gulf]] societies. The M'alayah's contemporary equivalents in Sudan include the [[Makossa]] and [[Mapouka]].

The dance is sexually suggestive in nature, with women tying up their lower torso with a piece of cloth or [[Keffiyeh]], and performing sensual fast movements. There is no set pattern and method of performing the dance although some of its movements can be likened to those in [[bellydance]], [[hip hop]] styled “booty popping”, Mapouka etc. It is known for its fast sensual movements of the [[buttocks]] and backside.

Primarily this dance is more often performed by groups that usually comprise singers, dancers and also backup musicians. These groups perform in special occasions such as weddings. The dance is accompanied by singing various songs that are unique to this type of dance. These troops or bands of musicians and dancers are usually outcasts and do not intermingle with the majority populace of the society.

The entertainers make out a living by charging an agreed upon fee in the range of $1000 USD to $3000 USD {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} depending on the function they will be in, typically a marriage, an engagement ceremony, or a tribe celebrations, but usually end up earning much more in the form of tips either being thrown on the ground or on the dancers themselves. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} They are suspected to belong to [[Bidun]] groups of people. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Madra''' ({{IAST3|Mādra}}; {{IPA-sa|mɑːd̪rə|}}) is the name of an ancient region and its inhabitants, located in the north-west division of the ancient Indian sub-continent. The Madra Kingdom's capital is believed to have been ancient [[Sialkot]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e8o5HyC0-FUC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=chandrahas+sialkot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PDYObWfXq9&amp;sig=JtqY5bk099FNjp6MMcrGdGVIyqQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwgNnM4YHZAhVP22MKHQlNDa4Q6AEIODAG#v=onepage&amp;q=chandrahas%20sialkot&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern|last=Kumar|first=Raj|date=2008|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178356648|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom's boundaries are believed to have extended from portions of the Hindu Kush (possibly as far as North Eastern Iran) to the present day [[Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] province of India. Some support for this belief lies within the ancient epic, the [[Mahabharata]] that describes the armies of the [[Madra Kingdom]] led by King [[Shalya]], marching from ancient Northwest Punjab to what would be known today as [[Haryana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menon|first1=Ramesh|title=The Mahabharata, A modern rendering|date=2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595401888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ganguly|first1=Kisari|title=The Mahabharata|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/index.htm|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Przyluski|first1=Jean|title=Ancient Peoples of the Punjab|date=1960|publisher=K.

In the context of secrecy laws, a '''public interest defence''' is a [[defense (legal)|defence]] that allows a [[defendant]] who disclosed classified or protected information to avoid criminality by establishing that the public interest in disclosure of the information outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure. It is aimed at protecting [[whistleblower]]s of government misconduct. 

The inclusion of the defence was a subject of debate in the legislative process of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. The defence was not included in the final Act. The defence was also absent in secrecy laws in other countries that were based on the Act. 

[[Canada]] has reformed its secrecy laws in 2001 by adding the defence in its [[Security of Information Act]]. However, its application is limited to situations in which the [[defendant]] has followed a series of steps set out in the legislation before making the disclosure, and the person's purpose in making the disclosure is to reveal an offence committed by another person in his official duties.

The inclusion of the defence has been a subject of debate in [[Hong Kong]] in 2003 during its legislative process to implement [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23 of the Basic Law]] in the [[media in Hong Kong]].

'''Sex technology''', also called '''sextech''', is technology and technology-driven ventures that are designed to enhance, innovate and disrupt [[human sexuality]] and/or the human [[sexual experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv | Gallop | 2015 | https://www.hottopics.ht/stories/consumer/what-is-sextech-and-why-is-everyone-ignoring-it/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally coined by [[Cindy Gallop]] from [[Make Love Not Porn|MLNP]] and is associated with an advancement of the [[Digital Revolution]] from 2010 and its impact on society and culture. 

While still nascent, Sextech has seen a recent boom in mainstream acceptance due to a big push from female-led firms in the space. Notable individuals include [[Cindy Gallop]] (Founder and CEO of [[Make Love Not Porn|MLNP]]), Polly Rodriguez (Co-founder and CEO of Unbound), Alex Fine and Janet Lieberman (Co-founders of Dame Products), Andrea Barrica (Founder and CEO of O.School), Liz Klinger from (Co-founder and CEO of Lioness), Kate Moyle (Psychosexual &amp; Relationship Therapist at Pillow Play), Stephanie Alys (Co-founder and CPO at [[MysteryVibe]]), Dr. [[Kate Devlin]] from Goldsmiths University and journalists including Alix Fox, [[Nichi Hodgson]], Rebecca Newman, Gigi Engle, Bryony Cole, Suzannah Weiss, Joseph Seon Kim and GirlOnTheNet.

{{Original research|date=November 2011}}
'''Small Charity Governance''' is concerned with the control and direction of [[charitable organization|charitable organisations]] established for the public benefit in the [[United Kingdom]]. The majority of charities in England and Wales (totaling about 190,000) have an income under £10,000, and only about 22% of charities have any staff at all.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Civil Society Almanac &lt;/ref&gt; Many community groups and small voluntary organisations are not registered charities, because either their turnover is below the threshold for registration or their purpose does not fall within the definition of charitable activity. Much literature about governance is written from the perspective of the minority of larger charities; this article attempts to address the topic by focusing on the experience and concerns of the majority. ''Governance'' is the process through which a group of people make decisions which direct their collective efforts. This typically features ''delegation'' to a smaller group, which is in turn accountable to the stakeholders or owners of the organisation.

== {{anchor|What Does the role involve?}}Role ==
In small voluntary organisations, those entrusted with the governance function (the governing body or board of trustees) are expected to carry out both governance functions and to also perform other roles within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Selznick (1992) "To govern is to accept responsibility for the whole life of the institution. This is a burden quite different from the rational coordination of specialized activities (i.e. management). Governance takes account of all the interests that affect the viability, competence and moral character of an enterprise”.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Core functions are:
*To ensure that the charity remains true to its mission and values
*To determine its strategy
*To act as the point of final accountability for its actions and those of its representatives and staff
*To safeguard its assets

When the organisation employs staff, the governing body undertakes the management role of hiring, firing and holding the head of staff accountable.&lt;ref&gt;Carver (1997: p16):  “…acting on behalf of an identifiable ownership, ensure that the organisation achieves what it should while avoiding what is unacceptable.”&lt;/ref&gt; Another role is as liaison between the organisation and the outside world: providing a conduit for information and ideas, representing it and acting as an ambassador for it.

In addition to these governance functions, trustees of small charities may also be expected to:
*Act as a pool of expertise and advice, making this available to staff and volunteers
*Manage one (or more) staff, volunteers or projects (for instance, managing the work of the coordinator or production of the newsletter)&lt;ref&gt;Adirondack (1999: p6) adds that “Governance is not necessarily about doing; it is about ensuring things are done.”&lt;/ref&gt;
*Carrying out the work of the organisation: staffing a helpline, answering correspondence and so on&lt;ref&gt;The Charity Act 1993: s.97(1): “The charity trustees are the people responsible … for controlling the management and administration of the charity.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature typically restricts its coverage to “pure” governance functions; it does not pay attention to these other functions which are carried out by the trustees of small charities, seen by staff, volunteers and committee members as the contribution made by them to the organisation.

== {{anchor|Who Governs?}}Governors ==
There is sometimes a lack of clarity concerning who the governing group is, what they are called and how many of them there are.&lt;ref&gt;Otto and Clifton (2005) Governance is the "functions and processes performed in an organisation by members by members of the management committee—that is, the governing body".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission's]] preferred term is "[[trustee]], but a more-common term is "management committee member".  Other terms include:
*Executive Committee member
*Board member
*Director
*Governor
*Council Member

The Charity Commission has details of about 890,000 charity trustees. Since community groups and small voluntary organisations do not have to register, the precise number of those involved in governing them is unknown but is estimated to be about one million. This gives a grand total of almost two million people in governance positions in community groups, voluntary organisations and charities in England and Wales.

== {{anchor|Context}}Concerns ==
At the turn of the 21st century, a number of overlapping areas of concern arose and reshaped the environment for governance. These included:
*International debate about the role of civil society
*Concern about scandals in the private, public and voluntary sectors concerning those in governing positions
*Gap in understanding between funders and regulators on the one hand and small charities and voluntary organisations on the other &lt;ref&gt; Kumar S, Nunan K, "A Lighter Touch" Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;

Competing governance requirements have arisen, and each stakeholder in small organisations has concerns about governance:
*'''Regulators''' are concerned with declining public confidence in charities.
*'''Funders''' are concerned with reputation and financial risk.
*'''Trustees/management committee members''' feel that the duties expected of them are unclear.
*'''Members''' find themselves competing with funders, as accountability to funders usurps their role in controlling the organisation.

== {{anchor|Pulled in Four Directions}}Conflicts ==
Small voluntary organisations find themselves faced with four competing governance requirements:
*Whilst countering social exclusion and strengthening civil society, they must be accountable to members and have a strong voice.
*Whilst delivering services to users, they must be accountable to funders/purchasers.
*Whilst promoting [[social entrepreneurship]], they must balance accountability to a wide group of stakeholders with individual action.
*Whilst engaging in consultation and lobbying, they must demonstrate responsiveness and accountability to the community.&lt;ref&gt; Kumar S, Nunan K, "A Lighter Touch" Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Competing Definitions}}Definitions ==
Governance is defined in a variety of ways:
*Structurally (for example, having a constitution)
*Processes (for example, having sub-committees in positions of responsibility)
*Roles and functions
*Group dynamics (teamwork)
*Individual competence (for example, chairing skills)&lt;ref&gt; Chait R, Holland T, Taylor B "Improving the Performance of Governing Boards" Oryx Press, 1996 &lt;/ref&gt;

A more comprehensive way of looking at governance is to view it as the sum of these perspectives. One way of connecting all of these aspects of governance is to visualize a governance system (see below). The individual competencies and resulting group dynamics between the individuals can be seen as the inputs into the system. Those skills and group processes are then applied through the structures and processes that are in place, resulting in governance (the outputs).&lt;ref&gt;Duca (1996: p3): “Governance is how a board goes about exercising its authority over an organisation; it is a system or process for managing a board's affairs”.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GovernanceSystemDiagram.png]]

For example, a governance "output" (or function) is to be accountable for the organisation.  This is achieved by the individual trustees using their skills in evaluation and analysis, applying them in the group setting through the committee using committee structures (such as a meeting) and processes (an agenda).

== {{anchor|Assessing Governance}}Assessment ==
Once governance has been defined, it should be possible to assess it. However, because of the complexity involved it is tempting to choose one or two aspects of governance and assess them by taking a small number of features as a proxy for [[good governance]]. For practical reasons, it is common to look at just two aspects of governance (individual skills and structures); these are tangible, visible features of an organisation’s governance. Thus, it is possible to assess whether the trustees possess a particular range of skills and certain structures (such as a constitution) are in place.

== {{anchor|Balancing Conflicting Demands}}Balance ==
Governance can be considered as keeping a balance between competing and conflicting demands:
*"Watchdog" or "cheerleader"
*More involvement or less
*Management versus planning
*Short or long term
*"Big picture" versus details

The balance depends on circumstances: the organisation's life cycle, its current health and demands on the committee. It is a judgement for the committee to make.

== {{anchor|Governance and Organisational Life Cycle}}Organizational life cycle ==
There are two views of an organisation's life cycle. The first, linear view is that (like organic life) organisations progress through stages from birth, infancy, adolescence, maturity, senescence and death. The second view is that within this continuum organisations can start at different points and skip (or repeat) stages in cycles. For instance, with appropriate support and backing an organisation can begin its life in a fully formed, "mature" state. Mature organisations may collapse and begin anew in infancy or adolescence before developing into a mature organisation, sometimes repeating this process. The governing body's role changes, according to the stage of the organisation’s life cycle. The transition from one stage to another may be particularly challenging for governance.

'''''Social and Personal''''' is one of the longest running columns in ''[[The Irish Times]]''. Previously called '''''Court and Personal''''' it originally published the [[Court Circular]]s of the [[British Royal Family]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and brief [[society reporting]] details of which members of the [[upper class]]  were available in their [[townhouse]]s in [[Dublin]] to receive callers.

=="Court and Personal"==
Following the [[Partition of Ireland]] in 1921, the column covered the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]] and [[Governor of Northern Ireland]], with entries placed, as for the Lord Lieutenant, below entries about the Royal Family.  The 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] established the office of [[President of Ireland]], whose holder should "take precedence over all other persons in the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article12_1|title=Constitution of Ireland |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|page=Article 12.1|nopp=Y|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of the 11th Dáil|Fianna Fáil government]] criticised the column for listing President [[Douglas Hyde]]'s engagements after those of the Royal Family and others, including leading members of the former [[Protestant Ascendancy]] — what [[Frank Aiken]] called "every [[Double-barrelled name#British tradition|hyphenated]] person in the country".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy 2016 pp.147–148; {{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1944042500023#N178|title=Estimates for Public Services. - Vote No. 63—Army (Resumed).|date=25 April 1944|work=Dáil Éireann Debates|pages=Vol.93 No.10 p.23 cc1536–6 |nopp=Y|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreed solution was to place items about the President elsewhere in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy 2016 pp.148–149&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 the government used its [[Emergency Powers Act 1939|wartime censorship powers]] to remove the column altogether, on the grounds that it compromised [[Irish neutrality during World War II|the state's neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy 2016 pp.149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Social and Personal"==
Following the  [[Republic of Ireland Act|declaration of the Republic]] in 1949 the column ceased to mention British royalty and gradually abandoned mentioning aristocracy. The name was changed to "Social and Personal".  Until around 1978 it published a daily list of who met the President of Ireland in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]]. The reasons why it stopped doing this remain unclear. The then President, [[Patrick Hillery]] suggested that the paper stopped publishing information being supplied to it. The paper insisted that it stopped receiving information from the Áras.  

Today the column only makes an occasional appearance, to enable a prominent (rarely titled) family to announce forthcoming [[nuptial]]s. Whereas once the column received extensive space daily, gets one or two inches of space on the "[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the Editor]]" page if space allows, and contains often only contains one entry and frequently goes for weeks without being published at all.

'''White Tai''' (in [[Thai language]] and [[Lao language]] '''Tai Khao'''; in [[Vietnamese language]] '''Tai Dón''' or '''Thái Trắng''', in [[Chinese language]] '''Dai Duan''') is an [[ethnic group]] of [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[China]]. In Vietnam they are called Tai Dón or Thái Trắng and are included in the group of the [[Thái people]], together with the [[Tai Dam|Thái Đen]] ("Black Tai"), [[Tai Daeng people|Thái Đỏ]] ("Red Tai"), [[Phu Thai]], [[Tai Thanh language|Tày Thanh]] and [[Tai Pao language|Thái Hàng Tổng]]. The group of the Thái people is the third largest of the fiftyfour ethnic groups recognized by the Vietnamese government.

==Geographic Distribution==
There are approximately 280,000 White Tai in Vietnam (2002), 200,000 in Laos (1995) and 10,000 in Yunan province, China (1995).&lt;ref name="TD2"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=twh Tai Dón.] Ethnologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Shan people}}
The White Tai migrated from China to Laos several centuries ago, settling along the Red and Black Rivers.&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"&gt;[http://www.global12project.com/2004/profiles/p_code2/1048.html The White Tai of Laos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The White Tai speak a language called ''Tai Khao'', also called [[Tai Dón language|''Tai Dón'']].  It is a [[Tai–Kadai language|Tai–Kadai]] language.&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"/&gt;

==Family==
Men are the heads of White Tai households, although division of labor is nearly equal.&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"/&gt;

==Religions==
*[[Animism]] (60%)&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"/&gt;
*[[Theravada Buddhism]] (38%)&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"/&gt;
*[[Christian]] (2%)&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"/&gt;
The White Tai believe in multiple personal souls and hold ceremonies to recall those souls to strengthen their character.&lt;ref name="The White Tai of Laos"/&gt;

The Temoq people that are officially recognized are known to settle in two [[kampung]]s; on the eastern side of [[Tasik Bera]]&lt;ref name="AGOS"/&gt; and on the southern side of [[Tasik Chini]], in between the settlements of the [[Jakun people]] and the [[Semelai people]].&lt;ref name="TTBC"/&gt;

Due to their small population, they have been declared extinct several times by the government by simply absorbing them into other neighbouring [[Orang Asli]] groups such as the [[Jakun people]] in 1974, 1980 and 1996,&lt;ref name="LOTP"/&gt; and with the [[Semelai people]] in 2010 for census and administrative purposes.&lt;ref name="MOP"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirk Endicott|title=Malaysia's Original People: Past, Present and Future of the Orang Asli|year=2015|contribution=|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=99-716-9861-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
There are two versions on the origins of the Temoq people:-&lt;ref name="TTBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0084530/srigumum/doc/tasikbera.html |title=The Tasik Bera Connection: Tales of Two Lakes |author=Peter A. van der Helm |publisher=Sri Gumum |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Jakun narrative identifies the Temoq people were once part of the [[Jakun people]].
* The Semelai narrative are slightly different from the Jakun's version, but the Semelai people (who practices circumcision) uses the [[Semaq Beri people]] and Temoq people as an alternative reference to [[Orang Asli]] unlike the [[Jakun people]] who do not. The [[Semelai people]] regard the Temoq people as the original inhabitants of [[Tasik Bera]].&lt;ref name="AGOS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicole Kruspe|title=A Grammar of Semelai|year=2004|contribution=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=05-218-1497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheLotusAndTheWind.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]])]]
'''''The Lotus and the Wind''''' is a [[Spy fiction|spy novel]] by [[John Masters]] published in 1953. It continues his saga of the Savage family, who are part of the [[British Raj]] in India, and is set against the backdrop of the [[Great Game]], the period of tension between Britain and Russia in [[Central Asia]] during the late nineteenth century.

==Plot summary==
The story is told through the viewpoints of Lieutenant Robin Savage and the innocent but determined Anne Hildreth, although Savage's viewpoint predominates later in the novel. It begins in 1879, when Britain and [[Afghanistan]] are engaged in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].

Anne Hildreth and Robin Savage have met and become attracted to each other before the narrative starts. Anne is the daughter of a [[Commissariat]] officer and is travelling with her parents to the military post at [[Peshawar]] in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] of India. En route, she witnesses the murder of an Afghan stranger. In his last moments, the murdered man writes the word "atlar" (horses) in his own blood.

Meanwhile, Robin is part of a military column in Afghanistan. He is the son of a distinguished soldier and has almost been forced to follow in his father's footsteps, but has no particular thirst for action. As the result of an accident, and a superior officer's bungling, he is accused of cowardice, and is also sent to Peshawar to await a military court of inquiry.

Life threatens to be awkward, but an acquaintance, Major Hayling, connects the murder witnessed by Anne with a souvenir collected by Robin in Afghanistan, a [[jezail]] with the words "atlar shimal" (horses, north) engraved on it. Realising that Robin's true passion is for solitude and empty spaces, Hayling recruits him into the Secret Service and sends him in disguise into Central Asia. Accompanied by a faithful [[Gurkha]] orderly, Robin sets out to discover the motive behind the murder and determine whether it is connected with the ambitions of [[Tsarist]] Russia. Before departing he marries Anne. 

Ultimately returning to British India, Robin is reunited with his wife and infant children. He is decorated with the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in recognition of his achievements, and appears to have achieved conventional success. However, he disappears across the frontier again in pursuit of his semi-mystical goals. Anne is left to accept the unbridgeable divide between herself as the Lotus and Robin as the Wind.

==Relations to other books in the series==
Robin is the son of Rodney Savage, the protagonist of ''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]''. Robin is around two years old when the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] occurs and his mother is murdered. Robin's son is Peter Savage, who features in ''Far, Far the Mountain Peak''.

'''Urban decay''' (also known as '''urban rot''' and '''urban blight''') is the sociological process by which a previously functioning [[city]], or part of a city, [[societal collapse|falls into disrepair]] and decrepitude. It may feature [[deindustrialization]], [[depopulation]] or [[Counterurbanization|deurbanization]], [[economic restructuring]], abandoned buildings and [[infrastructure]], high local [[unemployment]], fragmented families, political [[disenfranchisement]], [[crime]], and a desolate cityscape, known as [[greyfield land|greyfield]] or [[urban prairie]].
[[File:Uniroyal Chicopee.jpg|thumb|Abandoned Uniroyal factory in Chicopee, MA]]
Since the 1970s and 1980s, urban decay has been associated with Western cities, especially in [[North America]] and parts of [[Europe]] (mostly the United Kingdom and France). Since then, major structural changes in [[World economy|global economies]], [[transportation]], and [[Public policy|government policy]] created the economic and then the social conditions resulting in urban decay.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uf0vS1A-0dkC Urban Sores: On the Interaction Between Segregation, Urban Decay, and Deprived Neighbourhoods]'', by Hans Skifter Andersen. {{ISBN|0-7546-3305-5}}. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects counter the development of most of Europe and North America; on other continents, urban decay is manifested in the peripheral [[slum]]s at the outskirts of a metropolis, while the [[city center]] and the [[inner city]] retain high [[real estate]] values and sustain a steadily increasing populace.  In contrast, North American and British cities often experience population flights to the [[suburbs]] and [[exurb]] [[commuter town]]s; often in the form of [[white flight]].&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another characteristic of urban decay is blight—the visual, psychological, and physical effects of living among empty lots, buildings and condemned houses.

Urban decay has no single cause; it results from combinations of inter-related socio-economic conditions—including the city's [[urban planning]] decisions, tight rent control, the [[poverty]] of the local populace, the construction of [[freeway#Effects and controversy|freeway]] roads and rail road lines that bypass—or run through—the area,&lt;ref name="power"&gt;''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'', by [[Robert Caro]], p.522.&lt;blockquote&gt;The construction of the [[Gowanus Parkway]], laying a concrete slab on top of lively, bustling Third Avenue, buried the avenue in shadow, and when the parkway was completed, the avenue was cast forever into darkness and gloom, and its bustle and life were forever gone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; depopulation by [[suburbanization]] of peripheral lands, real estate neighborhood [[redlining]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. {{ISBN|0-8147-8267-1}}. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and immigration restrictions.&lt;ref name="comeback"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S. Grogan, Tony Proscio. {{ISBN|0-8133-3952-9}}. Published 2002. pp. 139-145.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The 1965 law brought an end to the lengthy and destructive—at least for cities—period of tightly restricted immigration a spell born of the [[nationalism]] and [[xenophobia]] of the 1920s", p. 140&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[Industrial Revolution]], from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century, rural people moved from the country to the cities for employment in manufacturing industry, thus causing the urban population boom. However, subsequent economic change left many cities economically vulnerable. Studies such as the Urban Task Force (DETR 1999), the Urban White Paper (DETR 2000), and a study of Scottish cities (2003) posit that areas suffering industrial decline—high unemployment, poverty, and a decaying physical environment (sometimes including contaminated land and obsolete infrastructure)—prove "highly resistant to improvement".&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, R. and Power, A. (2004) ''The Growth and Decline of Cities and Regions''. CASE-Brookings Census Brief No.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in means of transport, from the public to the private—specifically, the private motor car—eliminated some of the cities' public transport service advantages, e.g., fixed-route buses and trains. In particular, at the end of World War II, many political decisions favored suburban development and encouraged [[suburbanization]], by drawing city taxes from the cities to build new infrastructure for towns.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The manufacturing sector has been a base for the prosperity of major cities. When the industries have relocated outside of cities, some have experienced population loss with associated urban decay, and even [[urban riots|riots]]. Cut backs on police and fire services may result, while lobbying for government funded housing may increase. Increased city taxes encourage residents to move out.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Curley Effect: The Economics of Shaping the Electorate|journal=The Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|volume=21|number=1|pages=12–13|url=http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/shleifer/files/curley_effect.pdf |author1=Edward Glaeser |author2=Andrei Schleifer |authorlink1=Edward Glaeser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rent control==

Rent controls are often enacted due to public pressure and complaints regarding the cost of living. Proponents of rent controls argue that rent controls combat inflation, stabilize the economic characteristics of a city's population, prevent rent gouging, and improve the quality of housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton | first2=Walter |last2=Block |last3=Hayek |first3=Friedrich A. |title=Rent Control: Myths and Realities—International Evidence of the Effects of Rent Control in Six Countries |year=1981 |publisher=The Fraser Institute |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0889750333 |url=http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/RentControlMythsRealities.pdf |authorlink=The Presumed Advantages and Real Disadvantages of Rent Control |chapter=3 |pages=55–65 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalist economists have  documented that rent control affects the supply and demand relationship in housing markets which can contribute to urban blight and does not provide the  benefits its proponents advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peirce|first=Neal|title=On Rent Control|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/1978/5/v2n3-8.pdf|website=Cato Institute|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rent control contributes to urban blight by reducing new construction and investment in housing and deincentivizing maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton | first2=Walter |last2=Block |last3=Hayek |first3=Friedrich A. |title=Rent Control: Myths and Realities—International Evidence of the Effects of Rent Control in Six Countries |year=1981 |publisher=The Fraser Institute |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0889750333 |url=http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/RentControlMythsRealities.pdf |authorlink=The Presumed Advantages and Real Disadvantages of Rent Control |chapter=3 |page=68 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a landlord's costs to perform maintenance consume too large a proportion of profit, that is revenue minus costs, from rent, the landlord will feel pressure to drastically reduce or eliminate maintenance entirely.

Historically in the [[United States]], the white middle class gradually left the cities for suburban areas because of higher crime rates and perceived danger caused by [[Great Migration (African American)|African-American migration]] north toward cities after [[World War I]] ([[Great Migration (African American)|the Great Migration]])—the so-called "[[white flight]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Boustan | first1 = L.

Some historians differentiate between the first Great Migration (1910–1930), numbering about 1.6 million Black migrants who left mostly Southern rural areas to migrate to northern and midwestern industrial cities, and, after a lull during the [[Great Depression]], a [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] (1940–1970), in which 5 million or more African-Americans moved, including many to California and various western cities.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf William H. Frey, "The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965–2000", The Brookings Institution, May  2004, pp. 1–3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702085924/http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf |date=2 July 2004 }}. Retrieved 19 Mar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1910 and 1970, Blacks moved from 14 states of the South, especially [[Alabama]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Texas]] to the other three cultural (and census-designated) regions of the United States. More townspeople with urban skills moved during the second migration.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu" /&gt; By the end of the Second Great Migration, African Americans had become an urbanized population. More than 80 percent lived in cities. A majority of 53 percent remained in the South, while 40 percent lived in the North and 7 percent in the West.&lt;ref name=AAME&gt;AAME&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s until 1977, African-Americans seeking borrowed capital for housing and businesses were discriminated against via the federal-government–legislated [[Mortgage Discrimination|discriminatory lending practices]] for the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) via [[redlining]].&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html "Racial" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual, 1938] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229152840/http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |date=29 December 2008 }} &lt;blockquote&gt;Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following . . .

Later urban centers were drained further through the advent of mass car ownership, the marketing of suburbia as a location to move to, and the building of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. In North America this shift manifested itself in [[strip malls]], suburban retail and employment centers, and very low-density housing estates. Large areas of many northern cities in the United States experienced population decreases and a degradation of urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0815710534 Urban Decline and the Future of American Cities] By Katharine L.

Inner-city property values declined and economically disadvantaged populations moved in. In the U.S., the new inner-city poor were often African-Americans that migrated from the South in the 1920s and 1930s. As they moved into traditional white neighborhoods, ethnic frictions served to accelerate flight to the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8043.html White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610090055/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8043.html |date=10 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:Sandown Savoy Hotel in February 2012 2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The burnt-out shell of the former Savoy Hotel in [[Sandown]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] - Sandown is a town dominated by hotels, but the closure of many of them has driven tourists away, causing the buildings to fall into disuse and disrepair.]]
[[United Kingdom|Britain]] experienced severe urban decay in the 1970s and 1980s exemplified by [[The Specials]]' 1981 hit single "[[Ghost Town (The Specials song)|Ghost Town]]".
Major cities like [[Glasgow]], the towns of the [[South Wales valleys]], and some of the major industrial cities like  [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], and [[East London]], all experienced [[Counter urbanization|population decreases]], with large areas of 19th-century housing experiencing market price collapse. Some [[seaside resort]] towns have also experienced urban decay towards the end of the 20th century, due to the popularity of [[Package holiday]]s to the continent.

=== France ===
{{Main|Banlieue}}
{{tone|date=July 2013}}
Large [[France|French]] cities are often surrounded by areas of urban decay. While city centers tend to be occupied mainly by upper-class residents, cities are often surrounded by public housing developments, with many tenants being of [[North Africa|North African]] origin (from former French colonies [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]]), and recent immigrants.

From the 50s to the 70s, publicly funded housing projects resulted in large areas of mid to high-rise buildings. These modern "grands ensembles" were welcomed at the time, as they replaced shanty towns and raised living standards, but these areas were heavily affected by economic depression in the 80s.

The banlieues of large cities like [[Lyon]], especially the northern Parisian banlieues, are severely criticized and forgotten by the country's territorial spatial planning administration. They have been ostracised ever since the French [[Commune]] government of 1871, considered as "lawless" or "outside the law", even "outside the Republic", as opposed to "deep France" or "authentic France", which is associated with the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Thiesse (1997) Ils apprenaient la France, l'exaltation des régions dans le discours patriotique, MSH.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the French suburbs [[2005 civil unrest in France|were the scene of severe riots]] sparked by the accidental electrocution of two teenagers in the northern suburbs of Paris, and fueled in part by the substandard living conditions in these areas. Many deprived suburbs of French cities were suddenly the scenes of clashes between youngsters and the police, with violence and numerous car burnings resulting in huge media coverage.

Today the situation remains generally unchanged; however, there is a level of disparity. Some areas are experiencing increased drug trafficking, while some northern suburbs of Paris and areas like [[Vaulx-en-Velin]] are undergoing refurbishment and re-development.

Some previously [[Monotown|mono-industrial]] towns in France are experiencing increasing crime, decay, and decreasing population. The issue remains a divisive issue in French public politics.

=== Italy ===
[[File:Case Popolari a Scampia.jpg|thumb|Council houses in Scampia, Naples]]
In Italy, one of the most well known case of urban decay is represented by the ''Vele di Scampia'', a large public housing estate built between 1962 and 1975 in the [[Scampia]] neighbourhood of [[Naples]]. The idea behind the project was to provide a huge urban housing project, where hundreds of families could socialise and create a community. The design included a public transportation rail station, and a large park area between the two buildings. The planners wanted to create a small city model with large parks, playing fields, and other facilities.

However, various events led to tremendous urban decay inside this project and in the surrounding areas. It all started with the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake|1980 earthquake]] in [[Irpinia]], which led many families, left homeless, to squat the flats inside the ''Vele''.&lt;ref name=teduccio&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassolino|location=Teduccio|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused a melting of different cultures together and, as often the case, crime and abusiveness has grown rapidly. Things were made worse by the total lack of police presence, resulting in a deep bundling of the [[Camorra]] inside the area, which now controls drug trafficking, illegal [[street racing]], gangs, and [[Handling stolen goods|fencing operations]].

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, the most prominent urban decay case is the inner city neighborhood of [[Johannesburg]], [[Hillbrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crankshaw|first=Owen|last2=White|first2=Caroline|date=December 1995|title=Racial Desegregation and Inner City Decay in Johannesburg|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2427.1995.tb00531.x|journal=International Journal of Regional and Urban Research|volume=19|issue=4|pages=622-638|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formerly white  neighborhood,  at the end of [[Apartheid]] in 1994, most of its residents fled to [[Cape Town]] and suburbs leaving their properties behind.

==Policy responses to urban decay==
[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|[[Pruitt–Igoe]] [[public housing]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. In the 1950s, this [[urban renewal]] project was built; it failed and was razed in the 1970s.]]

The main responses to urban decay have been through positive public intervention and policy, through a plethora of initiatives, funding streams, and agencies, using the principles of [[New Urbanism]] (or through [[Urban Renaissance]], its UK/European equivalent). [[Gentrification]] has also had a significant effect, and remains the primary means of a natural remedy.

=== United States ===
{{Further|Community Reinvestment Act|Social programs in the United States|Law enforcement in the United States}}

In the United States, early government policies included "[[urban renewal]]" and building of large-scale [[housing projects]] for the poor. Urban renewal demolished entire neighborhoods in many inner cities; in many ways, it was a cause of urban decay rather than a remedy.&lt;ref name="comeback"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1295.html Encyclopedia of Chicago History]&lt;blockquote&gt;"(In Chicago) while whites were among those uprooted in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] and on the North and West Sides, urban renewal in this context too often meant, as contemporaries noted, "***** removal". Between 1948 and 1963 alone, some 50,000 families (averaging 3.3 members) and 18,000 individuals were displaced."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These government efforts are now thought by many to have been misguided.&lt;ref name="comeback"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0674008308 American Project: The Rise and Fall of a Modern Ghetto] By Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh. {{ISBN|0-674-00830-8}}. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

For multiple reasons, some cities have rebounded from these policy mistakes. Meanwhile, some of the inner [[suburb]]s built in the 1950s and 60s are beginning the process of decay, as those who are living in the inner city are pushed out due to [[gentrification]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00020.x The Decline of Inner Suburbs: The New Suburban Gothic in the United States]'' By Thomas J. Vicino.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

In [[Western Europe]], where undeveloped land is scarce and urban areas are generally recognised as the drivers of the new [[information economy|information]] and [[service economy|service]] economies, [[urban renewal]] has become an industry in itself, with hundreds of agencies and charities set up to tackle the issue. European cities have the benefit of historical organic development patterns already concurrent to the New Urbanist model, and although derelict, most cities have attractive historical quarters and buildings ripe for redevelopment.

In the inner-city estates and suburban cités, the solution is often more drastic, with 1960s and 70s state housing projects being totally demolished and rebuilt in a more traditional European urban style, with a mix of housing types, sizes, prices, and tenures, as well as a mix of other uses such as [[retail]] or [[Commerce|commercial]]. One of the best examples of this is in [[Hulme]], [[Manchester]], which was cleared of 19th-century housing in the 1950s to make way for a large estate of [[high-rise]] flats. During the 1990s, it was cleared again to make way for new development built along new urbanist lines.

==Career==
Chambliss' first academic position was at the [[University of Washington]], where he joined the faculty just after receiving his Ph.D. In 1967, he followed [[Donald Cressey]], one of his early mentors, to the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref name="enc" /&gt; He later taught at the [[University of Delaware]] for a decade before joining George Washington University in 1986.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

==Personal life and death==

'''Yachting Association of Sri Lanka''' (YASL) is recognised by the '''[[International Sailing Federation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailing.org/about-isaf/mna/austalia.php ISAF MNA Microsite&lt;/ref&gt; as the governing body for the sport of sailing in [[Sri Lanka]]. 

==Clubs==
* Royal Colombo Yacht Club
* Ceylon Motor Yacht Club
* Dehaweela Sailing Club (closed 1973)
* Sri Lanka Navy Sailing Club
* Bentota Windsurfing Club
* Ruhunu Sailing Association (established 2006)
* Kalpitiya Windsports Club

The Royal Colombo Yacht Club (RCYC) was formerly known as 'Colombo Sailing Club'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldinformation.com/worldroot/start.asp?content=world&amp;continent=Asia&amp;country=094&amp;bodytext=outdoor Basic information]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 the club received a [[royal charter]] and was renamed to the Royal Colombo Yacht Club. In the 1980s the club had to leave its club house at [[Colombo Harbour]] to accommodate the expansion of the port and for security reasons. The club then shared facilities with the Ceylon Motor Yacht Club at Bolgoda Lake, [[Moratuwa]].  In 2005 a new clubhouse was constructed on the beach at Mt. Lavinia, adjacent to the Lifesaving Association's building.

The Ceylon Motor Yacht Club (CMYC) was established in 1929 and has operated from its current location on the shores of Lake Bolgoda since 1936.

==Events==
* Sailing Nationals
* South Asian Yachting Regatta (formerly Tri-nation Regatta)
* Colombo to Galle Regatta
* Royal Thomian Optimist Sailing Regatta
* 2006 [[Enterprise (dinghy)|Enterprise]] World Championship 
* 2011 [[GP14 (dinghy)|GP14]] World Championship
* 2012 IODA [[Optimist dinghy|Optimist]] Asian Championship

The YASL has seen its activity much reduced during the past three decades owing to the civil war in the island. Even so, the YASL manages to organize [[regatta]]s regularly, like the '''Janashanthi Sailing Nationals'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundaytimes.lk/071007/Sports/sp213.html Janashanthi Sailing Nationals]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004 the Yachting Association of Sri Lanka revived the '''Tri-nation Regatta''', in which yachts from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] compete with local yachts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistantimes.net/2004/07/07/sports2.htm Tri-nation Regatta]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sailing Nationals are generally held in January and contested by four different dinghy classes:  [[Enterprise (dinghy)|Enterprise]]; [[GP14 (dinghy)|GP14]]; [[Optimist dinghy|Optimist]] and [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]], together with windsurfers.

The YASL has a sailing school and a small [[Optimist dinghy|Optimist]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optiworld.org/ioda-develop.html Optimist]&lt;/ref&gt;
