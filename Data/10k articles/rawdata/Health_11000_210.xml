'''ACT College,''' was a private [[career college]] in northern [[Virginia]]. specializing in [[Allied health]] career training.

On April 3, 2012, ACT College's website announced that the college was now closed.&lt;ref name=che1&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/financially-troubled-health-care-college-in-virginia-shuts-its-doors/42014?sid=at ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' April 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  The college had been on the U.S. Department of Education’s list of institutions with low   financial responsibility scores. The school was denied approval to continue to receive federal aid in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/college-that-abruptly-closed-reportedly-had-been-cut-off-from-federal-financial-aid/42127?sid=at ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' April 6, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__&lt;!--Table of Contents--&gt;

==Locations==

ACT College maintained locations in three communities in the Northern Virginia area: [[North Arlington, Virginia|North Arlington]], [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and [[Bull Run, Prince William County, Virginia|Bull Run]]. The Bull Run location is named "Manassas" after the nearby city of [[Manassas]], and the North Arlington location is named "Arlington" after [[Arlington County|its county]].

The college began in Arlington in 1983 as Computer-Ease, a technology and business training institute. In 1992, the name changed to Applied Career Training as the institution changed its focus to [[Allied Health]] education.

In 1998, ACT College opened a second campus  in Alexandria, [[Virginia]]; in  2003, it opened a third campus in Bull Run (near [[Manassas]]). 
In 2004, the institution underwent another name change to '''ACT College''' to reflect its expansion into Associates Degree programs and continuing education courses.

==Academics==

ACT College offered degree and diploma programs preparing for entry-level positions as a medical assistant, medical office administrator, healthcare business administration,  dental assistant, and  pharmacy technician.

==Accreditations and approvals==

The  allied health  programs were accredited by the [[Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools]] (ABHES).,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abhes.org/accredited_institutions.htm ABHES Directory of Accredited Institutions&lt;/ref&gt; and approved by the   [[State Council of Higher Education for Virginia]] (SCHEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schev.edu/Students/PrivateCollegeList.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929200937/http://www.schev.edu/Students/PrivateCollegeList.asp |archivedate=2011-09-29 }} SCHEV Licensed Institution Listing&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">In [[Sint Maarten]], a [[Dutch Caribbean]] [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], foreign policy is set by the Netherlands but all other laws including those related to abortion are self-determined. '''Abortion in Sint Maarten''' is illegal, although it may be permissible in circumstances where a pregnancy threatens the woman's life. Despite its illegality, abortions are routinely performed by some medical practitioners and are ignored by authorities.

==Legislation==
Sint Maarten's abortion law is modelled after Dutch common law which was adopted by the [[Netherlands]]' foreign colonies in 1918. This law, covered in Articles 308 to 311, prohibits the act of abortion with no exceptional circumstances. For a woman who procures her own abortion or a health practitioner who intentionally assists, the penalties range from three to 15 years of imprisonment, depending on whether the woman consents to the procedure, whether the woman dies as a result, and whether a qualified health professional is involved. Any woman "who intentionally causes the expulsion or the death of her fruit" can be imprisoned for up to three years, while assistants to abortion can be imprisoned for up to four years and six months if the woman consents to the procedure (increasing to six years if the woman dies) or up to 12 years if the woman does not give her permission (increasing to 15 years if the woman dies). The maximum sentences may be raised by a third if a health professional is involved—including doctors, midwives and pharmacists—and they may be banned from their profession. Although not explicitly stated in the articles relating to abortion law, the principle of [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]] may be used as a justification for breaking criminal law if an abortion is required to save a pregnant woman's life.&lt;ref name=upr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saludpromujer.md.rcm.upr.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124:safe-illegal-abortion-an-inter-island-study-in-the-northeast-caribbean&amp;catid=164:investigaciones&amp;Itemid=273 |title=Safe Illegal Abortion: An Inter-Island Study in the Northeast Caribbean |publisher=[[University of Puerto Rico]] |year=2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |first=Gail |last=Pheterson |first2=Yamila |last2=Azize |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085912/http://saludpromujer.md.rcm.upr.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124%3Asafe-illegal-abortion-an-inter-island-study-in-the-northeast-caribbean&amp;catid=164%3Ainvestigaciones&amp;Itemid=273 |archivedate=19 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Netherlands [[Abortion in the Netherlands|legalised abortion in 1981]], the reform was not adopted by any of the former colonies in the [[Dutch Caribbean]], including Sint Maarten, [[Aruba]] and [[Curaçao]], which instead retain the old Dutch common law.&lt;ref name=upr/&gt; These three territories became autonomous countries in 2010, but there remains public apprehension about whether the Netherlands will continue to attempt to "impose its liberal values and legislation" on the Dutch Caribbean, with abortion law being a chief concern.&lt;ref name=erla&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Complexity of National Identity Construction in Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean|journal=European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies|year=2010|volume=89|first=Rose Mary|last=Allen|url=http://www.cedla.uva.nl/50_publications/pdf/revista/89RevistaEuropea/89-ALLEN-ISSN-0924-0608.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to abortion services==
Although abortion is illegal in Sint Maarten, it is fairly commonplace as part of a system of "institutionalised
tolerance".&lt;ref name=rcm&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://prhsj.rcm.upr.edu/index.php/prhsj/article/download/42/34|title=Abortion within and around the law in the Caribbean|first=Gail|last=Pheterson|first2=Yamila|last2=Azize|volume=27|issue=1|journal=Puerto Rico Health Sciences Journal|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sxm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysxm.com/2014/01/28/opinion-abortion/ |title=Opinion: Abortion |date=28 January 2014 |work=Today |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084211/http://www.todaysxm.com/2014/01/28/opinion-abortion/ |archivedate=19 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1981 Dutch law allowed abortion, Sint Maarten physicians and officials have become more tolerant of abortion despite the fact that Sint Maarten's own law did not change. The Ministry of Health in the nearby island country of [[Curaçao]] has had an ongoing agreement with abortion providers in Sint Maarten, providing inspections of the facilities for quality of care.&lt;ref name=rcm/&gt;

Abortion is more accessible in the neighbouring country of the [[Collectivity of Saint Martin]]—which forms the other half of the island [[Saint Martin]]—where [[medical abortion]] using [[misoprostol]] is legal until 14 weeks' gestation and is universally available to those without health insurance. It is therefore common for women in Sint Maarten seeking abortions to travel to Saint Martin, "just a walk away across the border".&lt;ref name=rcm/&gt;

Overall, the abortion rate in the Dutch Antilles is similar to that of Dutch Antillean women living in the Netherlands; this is around eight times higher than the abortion rate amongst native Dutch women.&lt;ref name=erla/&gt;

'''Amistad Reservoir''' ({{lang-es|Presa Amistad}}) is a [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Rio Grande]] at its confluence with the [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils River]] {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=out}} northwest of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]], [[Texas]]. The lake is bounded by [[Val Verde County, Texas|Val Verde County]] on the [[United States]] side of the international border and by the state of [[Coahuila]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] side of the border; the American shoreline forms the [[Amistad National Recreation Area]]. The reservoir was formed in 1969 by the construction of [[Amistad Dam]]. The dam and lake are managed jointly by the governments of the United States and Mexico through the [[International Boundary and Water Commission]]. The name of the dam and lake is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for "friendship". The reservoir is also known as '''Lake Amistad'''.

==Hydrology==
Amistad Reservoir is part of the [[Rio Grande]], which forms its principal inflow at its northwestern end. The other major inflow is the [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils River]], which enters from the north. The reservoir occupies a series of meanders between the two rivers; its outflow passes through [[Amistad Dam]] on the lake's southern side, from which the Rio Grande continues southeastward toward the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Since it is filled by the Rio Grande (and its tributaries, the [[Rio Conchos]] and [[Pecos River]]), Amistad's drainage basin includes a vast area of [[West Texas]], central [[New Mexico]], southern [[Colorado]], southeastern [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and northern [[Coahuila]].

==Fish and plant life==
Amistad Reservoir is stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish found in Amistad Reservoir include [[largemouth bass]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[Guadalupe bass]], and [[catfish]]. Substantial aquatic vegetation grows in the lake, primarily [[hydrilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Amistad Reservoir|website=[[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]]|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/fish/recreational/lakes/amistad/|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amistad gambusia]], a fish species [[Endemism|endemic]] to the area, was eliminated in the wild when the filling of the reservoir in 1969 submerged [[Goodenough Spring]], its only known habitat, under approximately {{convert|70|ft|m}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Gambusia | species = amistadensis | month = May | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two captive populations didn't survive, and the fish was extinct by 1987.

==History==
The area now covered by the reservoir was long inhabited by [[Indigenous Americans]], who sheltered in caves along the rivers and left numerous [[cave painting]]s. After the [[Mexican–American War]], American pioneers such as [[John Coffee Hays]] travelled through the area in developing a reliable [[San Antonio-El Paso Road|road from San Antonio to El Paso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AMISTAD RESERVOIR|website=[[Handbook of Texas Online]]|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/roa10|accessdate=28 May 2015|date=9 June 2010|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1944 treaty between the United States and Mexico proposed the construction of a major dam and reservoir on the Rio Grande to provide [[flood control]], [[water conservation]], [[irrigation]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power, and recreation to the area. [[Amistad Dam]]'s construction began in December 1964 and was completed in November 1969, after which the reservoir was filled, flooding a series of valleys around the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Devils River. The dam and the reservoir are managed by the [[International Boundary and Water Commission]], which was established in 1889 by the governments of the United States and Mexico to maintain the border, allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation.

==Recreational uses==
[[File:Beach on Lake Amistad, Texas IMG 0296.JPG|thumb|Rocky [[beach]] on Lake Amistad west of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]], [[Texas]]]]
During the construction of the dam, the land around the American shore of the coming reservoir was designated as the [[Amistad National Recreation Area]]. The lake provides year-round, water-based recreation opportunities, including [[boating]], [[fishing]], [[human swimming|swimming]], [[scuba diving]] and [[water-skiing]], as well as other recreational opportunities for picnicking, [[camping]], and [[hunting]]. The area is rich in archaeology and rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. The lake is home to yearly nationally-televised fishing tournaments. It is also near the flight path of USAF trainers.

'''Beverly Crusher''' (born '''Beverly Cheryl Howard''') is a character in the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. She appears in the [[television program|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') and the feature films ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994), ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996), ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' (1998), and ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002). She was a regular character in the series for all but the second of its seven seasons. Crusher is portrayed by actor [[Gates McFadden]].

She was the [[chief medical officer]] of both the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] and [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]].

==Casting==
Gates McFadden was reluctant to accept the role of Dr. Crusher because of her commitment to appear in the play ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]].&lt;ref name="schrager"&gt;Adam Schrager, ''The Finest Crew in the Fleet: The Next Generation Cast On Screen and Off''. New York: Wolf Valley Books (1997): 126&lt;/ref&gt; During the second season, the Crusher character was written out of the series, with the explanation that her character "was off heading up Starfleet Medical for the year."&lt;ref name="schrager" /&gt; She was replaced by the louder, more outgoing Dr. [[Katherine Pulaski]] ([[Diana Muldaur]]). [[Patrick Stewart]] was upset by McFadden's departure from the series and played a large part in bringing about her return&lt;ref name="schrager" /&gt; to the series for its third season, with her character being reassigned to the ''Enterprise''. Upon her return, the character became more varied and more richly developed, and was not afraid to go head-to-head with Picard.

==Early life==
Beverly Crusher was born Beverly Howard on October 13, 2324, in Copernicus City, [[Moon|Luna]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conundrum", ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', directed Les Landau. Paramount Pictures, released 15 February 1992 (DVD Release 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Her ancestors were [[Scottish-American]]s. Following the death of her parents when she was very young, she lived with her grandmother, Felisa Howard on Arvada III, a colony planet until a moon collision caused the planet to flood, forcing its evacuation. Resourceful Felisa, with her granddaughter's aid, used herbs, grasses, tree chemicals, and roots as medicines when synthetic medicines ran out for the injured.

During her youth, Beverly was known as quiet, shy, and socially awkward. She was also very self-conscious about her bright red hair, and at the age of thirteen, attempted to dye it dark with disastrous results. She admits to Data later in the episode "Offspring", that she was often ridiculed and unpopular in school and it had been very painful for her. She also admits that it brought back painful memories of those years when she saw her son Wesley going through similar ridicule as a child.

It was her grandmother's career as a healer and Beverly's own caring, high intelligence, and sensitivity that largely sparked Beverly's lifelong interest in medicine and healing the sick and wounded. The Arvada III disaster solidified Beverly's decision to be a doctor.

After Arvada III was evacuated, Beverly and Felisa then settled on Caldos II where Beverly lived until she entered [[Starfleet Academy]].

==Starfleet Academy==
Crusher attended [[Starfleet Academy]] from 2342 to 2350 during which she attended medical school. While attending the academy, she became romantically involved with fellow cadet Jack Crusher. They were introduced by their friend, Walker Keel. She graduated top of her class and married Jack in 2348. She had also been called "the Dancing Doctor" when she was at the academy and had won multiple awards at a dance competition in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. In 2350, she started an internship with Dr. Dalen Quaice.

==Family==
After marrying Jack, she returned to the academy while he left for the [[USS Stargazer|USS ''Stargazer'']]. A year later, she gave birth to a son named [[Wesley Crusher]]. Jack died on an [[away team (Star Trek term)|away mission]] when Wesley was 5 years old. Captain Picard, who was commanding the ''Stargazer'' at the time, brought home the body of Jack. She never fully recovered from his death. Dr. Crusher and [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] were also acquaintances while the character's husband was alive, as Picard and Jack Crusher were friends. At the beginning of the series, Picard and Dr. Crusher have not seen or heard from each other since Jack's death. "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]" is the first time Picard and Dr. Crusher's son Wesley truly meet face to face. Later in her life she realizes Picard has fallen in love with her.

During the progression of the series, the attraction or affection between the two is made more apparent, though both Crusher and Picard try to conceal their feelings; neither wants to admit to the other how they feel, though they have both been seen on separate occasions talking with other crew members about it, most notably, [[William Riker]] and [[Deanna Troi]]. The two appear to become closer and closer throughout the series, starting with the first-season episode "[[The Naked Now]]". Their relationship ultimately takes its biggest leap forward in "[[Attached]]", when the two are linked telepathically, leading to the revelation of deep romantic feelings they share for each other. At the end of this episode, a budding hint of a romantic relationship is slowed down when a blushing Beverly tells Jean-Luc, "Perhaps we should be afraid", implying that she's not ready to take that step forward in their relationship.

However, only a handful of episodes later in "[[Sub Rosa (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sub Rosa]]", it is revealed that neither Beverly or Jean-Luc has been able to let go of those feelings and they are back to where they started, trying to pretend the feelings don't exist and that they have no problem being "just friends" with one another.

In the series finale "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]", it is revealed that in an alternate future, Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard had been married and then divorced — still evidently having feelings for each other after so many years. Little information is given about the circumstances of their marriage or separation. In the present, during the episode, the two share a kiss. However that timeline, as well as that version of the future, is destroyed when Picard changes the past.

In the four ''Next Generation'' movies, the flirtation between Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard remains, though it is not as obvious as previous episodes and most certainly not part of the substantial movie plots. The most noteworthy moment between the two happens in one of the deleted scenes of the last ''Next Generation'' movie, ''[[Star Trek Nemesis]]''.

Following the television series and films, the relationship between Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard continued throughout the [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' [[Pocket Books]] series. Beverly and Jean-Luc have married, but still serve together on the ''Enterprise''-E. They have a son named René Jacques Robert Francois Picard, named after Picard's older brother (Robert) and nephew (René).

==On board the ''Enterprise''==
Dr. Crusher was appointed Chief Medical Officer of the Federation starship ''Enterprise''-D in 2364, and joined the ship at Farpoint Station with Wesley, reporting on board on stardate 41154. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint") Picard initially had reservations about her presence, but she assured him that the past would have no effect on her duties and she had no problem serving under his command, as she herself enlisted for the posting.

An energy-based lifeform from the Beta Renner cloud was accidentally trapped aboard the ''Enterprise'' later in 2364. It initially inhabited Lieutenant Worf's body, but next moved to Crusher. It controlled her for a brief period of time, attempting to learn how to use the ''Enterprise'' navigational systems in order to return home. The being then transferred itself to the ship's computer system, then took control of Captain Picard.

In mid 2364, Captain Picard invited Crusher on a holodeck adventure set in the fictional world of Dixon Hill. They were joined by Data and ship's historian, Whalen. Unfortunately, a malfunction in the holodeck systems due to a Jarada scan caused the safeties to become disengaged, trapping the group at the whim of Cyrus Redblock. They were later freed, but not before Redblock shot Whalen and threatened to kill Beverly.

Doctor Crusher was offered a position as head of Starfleet Medical in 2365 and left the Enterprise during that year. She was replaced by Dr. Katherine Pulaski. While at Starfleet Medical, she decided to return to the ship as soon as it was allowed the following year.

The reason for Beverly's return was never explicitly stated.

Dr. Quaice retired in 2367 shortly after the death of his wife, and the ''Enterprise''-D picked him up at [[Starbase]] 133 to ferry him home. Although he was in good spirits, he was slightly saddened at the prospect of facing the future without many of his friends, a feeling Beverly knew all too well. At the same time, Wesley Crusher was experimenting with a novel warp bubble. Beverly became trapped in this bubble, and her thoughts at the time created a universe where everyone and everything quickly began disappearing. With the assistance of The Traveler, Wesley was able to create a gateway back to the normal universe. Dr. Crusher was able to deduce what was happening in her universe, and escaped just before the bubble collapsed.

Beverly was questioned in connection with the explosion that crippled the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp core in 2367. Her testimony was twisted by Admiral Norah Satie in order to implicate the quarter-Romulan crewman Simon Tarses in the incident, later determined to be an accident.

When the ''Enterprise'' entered a temporal causality loop while exploring the Typhon Expanse, Beverly's feelings of déjà vu during a poker game and evidence of temporal phenomena lead to a solution which allowed the ship to break the cycle.

The senior staff of the ''Enterprise'' traveled back to the late 19th century in order to stop Devidian lifeforms from feeding on the neural energy of humans from that era, and prevent the apparent death of Commander Data in that time. Beverly assumed the guise of a nurse and determined why the Devidians traveled back to that era, and was almost a victim of their energy-draining device.

In 2369, Beverly developed a close friendship when she mentored Amanda Rogers, who was aboard the ''Enterprise'' as part of her Starfleet officer's training. It was later discovered that Rogers was the child of two former members of the Q Continuum who had abandoned the Continuum and had established a new life in Kansas as humans. They were killed when a tornado struck their home. It was later revealed that this was punishment levied by the Continuum. Q appeared on the ''Enterprise'' and, in his own way, began to mentor Rogers in the ways of the Continuum. Beverly objected to Q's interference and was silenced briefly by Q when he transformed her into a dog. Rogers, using her new-found powers, restored Beverly to Human form.

That same year, Admiral Alynna Nechayev assigned Crusher, along with Captain Picard and Lieutenant Worf, to a covert mission to seek out and destroy a Cardassian metagenic weapon on Celtris III. Her purpose was to locate and destroy any biological material related to the weapon. The group went through a rigorous training program for the mission, and it was physically straining on Beverly. She used her charms to get a Ferengi, DaiMon Solok, to secure the team passage to Celtris III, and navigated the dangerous caves of Celtris to what was believed to be the launching point for the weapon. It turned out to be a ruse intended to capture Picard, although Worf and Crusher escaped. As a form of psychological torture under Gul Madred, Picard was offered freedom, but was told Beverly had been captured. Madred said that she would be tortured if Picard left, forcing the captain to stay.

As a fully certified bridge officer, Crusher commanded the ''Enterprise-D'' on several occasions, most notably in 2370 while nearly the entire crew was searching for Data on a renegade Borg planet. The ship was attacked by a Borg vessel, but her quick thinking allowed the ''Enterprise'' to escape and destroy the Borg ship. She also occasionally commanded night watch shifts in order to stay on top of starship operations.

==Reception==
The character of Beverly Crusher has generally been positively received. Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised [[Gates McFadden]]'s performance, as well as the inclusion of a strong, likable female character in the series, but lamented that the character's potential was never fully realized, saying that Crusher "should've been one of [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|''TNG'']]'s best characters" but that "too often, her character has been relegated to back-up roles, interjecting occasional medical jargon to give color to scenes, or else worrying to one side about whether or not [[Wesley Crusher|Wesley]] was getting enough fun in his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Handlen|first1=Zack|title=''Star Trek: The Next Generation'': "Suspicions"/"Rightful Heir"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/star-trek-the-next-generation-suspicionsrightful-h-60368|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion|Onion Inc.]]|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McFadden left the series at the end of the first season and was replaced by [[Diana Muldaur]] as Doctor [[Katherine Pulaski]] in the second season. An official announcement stated that McFadden had left the series to pursue other career options. McFadden herself got a call from her agent who told her that the producers decided to go in another direction with the character. Like the other cast members, McFadden was surprised.&lt;ref name="The Official Star Trek p. 43"&gt;("Gates McFadden - Dr. Beverly Crusher", The Official Star Trek: The Next Generation Magazine Vol. 12, p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to a letter-writing campaign, support from Patrick Stewart, and a personal invitation from Rick Berman, McFadden was brought back to the TNG cast for the third and subsequent seasons. McFadden was absent for the filming of all of the second season's episode and only appeared on screen in three episodes where stock footage from first-season episodes was used.&lt;ref name="The Official Star Trek p. 43"/&gt;

In an interview in May 2006, executive producer [[Rick Berman]] revealed that Gates McFadden was fired at end of the first season of ''The Next Generation'' because head writer [[Maurice Hurley]] "....had a real bone to pick"&lt;ref&gt;http://trekmovie.com/2009/08/26/rick-berman-talks-18-years-of-trek-in-extensive-oral-history/ ''Rick Berman Talks 18 Years of Trek In Extensive Oral History'' Written Summary quote&lt;/ref&gt; with McFadden and did not like her acting. Berman brought her, and the character of Beverly Crusher, back for third season after Hurley departed the show's writing staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://trekmovie.com/2009/08/26/rick-berman-talks-18-years-of-trek-in-extensive-oral-history/ ''Rick Berman Talks 18 Years of Trek In Extensive Oral History'' quoted and expanded from Written Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cancer registry''' is a systematic collection of data about [[cancer]] and [[tumor]] diseases. The data are collected by [[National Cancer Registrars Association|Cancer Registrar]]s. Cancer Registrars capture a complete summary of patient history, diagnosis, treatment, and status for every cancer patient in the United States, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Khatib|first1= O|last2= Aljurf|first2= M|title= Cancer Prevention and Control in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: The Need for a Public Health Approach|journal= Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther|volume= 1|issue= 1|date= Jan–Mar 2008|pages= 44–52|pmid= 20063528|doi=10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was established in 1973 as a result of the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]]. The National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) was established by Congress through the Cancer Registries Amendment Act in 1992, and administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/about.htm|title= About the Program|publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date= 2016-04-20|access-date= 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPCR and SEER together collect cancer data for the entire U.S. population. CDC and NCI, in collaboration with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, have been publishing annual federal cancer statistics in the United States Cancer Statistics: Incidence and Mortality report. Information maintained in the cancer registry includes: demographic information, medical history, diagnostic findings, cancer therapy and follow up details.&lt;ref name="NCRAUSAInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ncra-usa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3301 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107205328/http://www.ncra-usa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3301 |title= Cancer Registrar FAQ|publisher= National Cancer Registrars Association|archive-date= 2011-11-07|accessdate= 2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data is used to evaluate patient outcome, quality of life, provide follow-up information, calculate survival rates, analyze referral pattern, allocate resources at regional or state level, report cancer incidence as required under state law, and evaluate efficacy of treatment modalities.&lt;ref name="NCRAUSAInfo" /&gt;

There exist population-based cancer registries, [[hospital]] cancer registries (also called hospital-based cancer registries), and special purpose registries.

== History ==
In 1926, Yale-New Haven Hospital became the first to set up a cancer registry. In 1956, the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) formally adopted a policy to encourage, through their Approvals Program, the development of hospital-based cancer registries. In 1973, The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of NCI establishes the first national cancer registry program. In 1992, U.S. Public Law 102-515 establishes the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and is administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[http://training.seer.cancer.gov/registration/registry/history/dates.html]. By 1993, most states considered cancer a reportable disease.

== Population-based cancer registry ==

Population-based cancer registries monitor the frequency of new cancer cases (so-called [[incident cases]]) every year in well defined populations and over time by collecting case reports from different sources (treatment facilities, clinicians and [[pathologist]]s, and death certificates). The frequency of these incident cases are expected per 100,000 of the mother population. If an unexpected accumulation can be observed, a hypothesis about possible causes is generated. This hypothesis is investigated in a second step by collecting more detailed data. The aim is to recognize and to reduce risks. Population-based registries can also monitor the effects of preventive measures. All population-based central registries in the United States and Canada are members of the [[North American Association of Central Cancer Registries]]. This organization acts as a voice for the registries when dealing with national standard-setting organizations, sets standards for digital cancer record transmission, and certifies the registries for the quality of their data, among other functions.

== Hospital cancer registry ==

Hospital cancer registries aim at the improvement of [[cancer therapy]]. Therefore they have to collect detailed data about diagnosis and therapy. Improvements can be achieved by:

* comparison of therapy - which therapy is the best
* comparison of therapists - which hospital, which physician has the best results under the same conditions ([[quality management]])
* support of treatment - registries can improve information about a patient and help to provide an optimal treatment by planning therapies and generating reminders

== Cooperation of registries ==

Since the data needed by hospital cancer registries usually include those of population-based cancer registries and both use the same [[Medical classification|classifications]], data can be sent from a hospital cancer registry to a population-based registry thus reducing documentation efforts.

== Cancer reporting standards ==

Hospital and population-based cancer registries report their incidence data to national organizations that aggregate and publish the data. The way in which these data are formatted to be submitted to these organizations are determined by standards released by standard-setting organizations. Edits are run on the data to check for inaccuracies and duplicate cases before being submitted electronically. Different organizations have different standards for data reliability and completeness, and some award certifications based on the adherence to these standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.naaccr.org/Certification/WhoisCertified.aspx |title= Who is certified|publisher= North American Association of Central Cancer Registries|access-date= 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SEER Registries==

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute collects and publish data on cancer incidence and survival throughout the United States. The information from population-based cancer registries covers approximately 28 percent of the US population. This coverage includes 26 percent of African Americans, 41 percent of Hispanics, 43 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 54 percent of Asians, and 71 percent of Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders.  The SEER program population-based cancer registries include Arizona Indians, Cherokee Nation, Connecticut, Detroit, Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics (Atlanta, Great Georgia, and Rural Georgia), Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose-Monterey), Greater California, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Los Angeles, Louisiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Seattle-Puget Sound, and Utah. Selection of the geographic areas is based on the ability to operate and maintain a high quality population-based cancer reporting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Overview of the SEER Program|url= http://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html|publisher= National Cancer Institute|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)==

The program has state-based cancer registries that collect, analyze and report cancer cases and deaths to a central cancer registry. NPCR was established in 1992 and administered by the CDC.  NPCR supports central cancer registries in 45 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Pacific Island Jurisdictions (covers approximately 96% of the U.S. population). State Cancer Registries monitor cancer trends, determine cancer patterns, direct planning and evaluation of cancer control programs, help set priorities for allocating health resources, promote research, and provide information on cancer incidence.
The data collected helps public health professionals understand and address the cancer burden. The ninth volume of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, published by International Agency for Research on Cancer, includes cancer incidence data from 32 NPCR-funded registries. NPCR’s future direction is to expand the use of information technology designed to support, improve, and enhance the management and exchange of electronic data in cancer surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= National Program of Cancer Registries|url= https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/about.htm|date= 2016-04-20|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swedish Cancer Registry==

The Swedish Cancer Registry was established in 1958. The health care providers in Sweden are required to report newly detected cancer cases diagnosed at clinical, morphological, and laboratory examination (as well as those discovered during autopsy) to the registry. Every year, the regional registries send cancer data to the National Cancer Register. The information available in the registry include patient’s personal information (PIN, sex, age and place of residence), medical records (date of diagnosis, site of the tumor, method used for diagnosis, and hospital where the patient is being treated), and follow-up data (date and cause of death or date of migration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Swedish Cancer Registry|url= http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/register/halsodataregister/cancerregistret/inenglish|publisher= [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15093">The '''Center for Food Safety''' ('''CFS''') is a [[501c3]], U.S. environmental, non-profit organization, based in [[Washington, D.C.]] It maintains an office in [[San Francisco]], California.  The executive director is Andrew Kimbrell, an attorney.   Its stated mission is to protect human health and the environment, focusing on food production technologies such as [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified plants and organisms]] (GMOs). It was founded in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2015/02/10/center-food-safety-fws-campaign-save-monarchs-inadequate-misses-major-driver|title=Center for Food Safety: FWS Campaign to Save Monarchs is Inadequate, Misses Major Driver in Population Decline|work=[[Common Dreams]]|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program services ==
The largest program services conducted by the Center for Food Safety include:

=== Fields of activity and legal action ===

The Center for Food Safety has won legal cases related to food and agricultural issues.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The CFS has participated in legal actions against manufacturers of [[genetically modified crops]], such as GE alfalfa, wheat, rice, beets, and claims to have successfully stopped the commercialization of at least seven of these in the US.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This includes the introduction of controversial [[Pharming (genetics)|Pharming plants]] (GE plants which produce [[biopharmaceuticals]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = No paradise for pharming| publisher =[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]| url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/22360/title/No-paradise-for-pharming/ | accessdate = 2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFS has also been an advocate for GE food labeling at both the state and federal level, pushing for new legislation and generating public support across the country for the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to take action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/05/08/genetically-modified-foods/8860423/ Vermont gov signs law to require labels on GMO foods] (May 2014, [[USA Today]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its work on GE foods, the Center for Food Safety has filed numerous legal petitions concerning the food industry, to halt the use of dangerous feed additives in industrial livestock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vermont gov signs law to require labels on GMO foods| publisher=[[USA Today]]| url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/05/08/genetically-modified-foods/8860423/ | accessdate = 2014-10-08  }}

(University of Minnesota entomology department website)&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization works on: [[genetically modified foods]] animals and organisms (GMO), organic food standards, [[aquaculture]], pesticides and pollinators, [[animal cloning]], [[food irradiation]], [[CAFOs]] (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations - huge animal growing factories) and animal drugs, synthetic hormones (such as [[bovine somatropin]]), and [[mad cow disease]].

The Center for Food Safety has organized a grass-roots action network dedicated to "building a socially just, democratic, and sustainable food system". The CFS has more than 700,000 members nationwide.

== Executive director Andrew Kimbrell ==

The center's executive director is Andrew Kimbrell, a public interest attorney, environmental activist, and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Andrew Kimbrell | publisher= [[The Huffington Post]]| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-kimbrell/ | accessdate = 2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Technotopia, Andrew Kimbrell, The dark side of technology| publisher=[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|YES! Magazine]]| url = http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/technology-who-chooses/technotopia | accessdate = 2014-10-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Senior Attorney and Policy Director for the Foundation for Economic Trends, Kimbrell initiated several federal court cases.  Many of these were against governmental agencies. He was able to successfully appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court as part of a coalition of  organizations, resulting in the regulation of motor vehicles carbon dioxide pollution under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/The_Real_Price_of_Gas.pdf|title=American Coalition for Ethanol|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413020749/http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/The_Real_Price_of_Gas.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massachusetts v.

==Legal cases against genetically modified crops==

The Center for Food Safety has been an associated party in challenges against the planting of [[genetically modified crops]] in the US.

===Alfalfa===
In April, 2004, [[Monsanto]] petitioned the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) for deregulation of their product [[Roundup Ready]] [[Alfalfa]] (RRA). After performing an [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Assessment]], APHIS deregulated the product in 2005. In 2006, this decision was challenged by Geertson Seed Farms and other parties including the Center for Food Safety.&lt;ref name=Geertson&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1160802.html|title=GEERTSON SEED FARMS DC DC v. JOHANNS|work=Findlaw|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a decision by the US District Court of San Francisco to suspend the deregulated status of RRA and place an injunction on the sale and planting of RRA until the completion of an [[Environmental Impact Statement]].&lt;ref name=Geertson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Koons&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/06/21/21greenwire-supreme-court-lifts-ban-on-planting-gm-alfalfa-57894.html Supreme Court Lifts Ban on Planting GM Alfalfa New York Times, Energy &amp; Environment, Retrieved 28 August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Supreme Court]] reversed the District Court decision in 2010, in the case of [[Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms]]. This 7-1 decision in favor of Monsanto Company declared the injunction against RRA invalid, allowing the sale and planting of the product; it did not, however, restore the deregulated status of the crop.&lt;ref name=Koons /&gt; Upon completion of the Environmental Impact Statement, RRA was officially deregulated in January 2011.&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2011/01/0035.xml|title=USDA Announces Decision to Fully Deregulate Roundup Ready Alfalfa - USDA  Newsroom|work=usda.gov|accessdate=16 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910020304/http://www.usda.gov//wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2011%2F01%2F0035.xml|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Food Safety also launched a separate lawsuit against RRA in the case Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack, in October, 2012. The CFS alleged that RRA had been improperly reviewed by APHIS, arguing that it should be considered a "Plant Pest" under the [[Plant Protection Act]]. In 2013 the United States District Court of San Francisco issued a ruling for the case in favor of the defendant, Thomas Vilsack, Secretary of APHIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/05/17/12-15052.pdf] Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack (17 May 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sugar beets===
In 2009–2010, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] has been considering the case involving the planting of genetically modified [[sugar beets]]. This case involves Monsanto's breed of pesticide-resistant sugar beets. This lawsuit was also organised by Center for Food Safety.

Earlier in 2010, Judge Jeffrey S. White allowed the planting of GM sugar beets to continue, but he also warned that this may be blocked in the future while an environmental review was taking place.  Finally, on 13 August 2010, Judge White ordered the halt to the planting of the genetically modified sugar beets in the US. He indicated that "the Agriculture Department had not adequately assessed the environmental consequences before approving them for commercial cultivation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/business/14sugar.html Judge Revokes Approval of Modified Sugar Beets], by ANDREW POLLACK, New York Times, August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The herbicide and pesticide chemical arms race ===
In a 2012 article on the Huffington Post blog website, Kimbrell claimed that the Monsanto developed soy, corn and cotton seeds, resistant to [[Agent Orange]] (despite the fact that the APHIS  application doesn't include 2,4,5-T ) and other chemicals the like of it, as well as [[Dow Chemical]]'s developments, are promoting a major boost in the usage of these herbicides and pesticides some of which have been proven to be highly toxic.&lt;ref name="armsrace"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-kimbrell/24-d-_b_1406473.html Less than One Month to Comment on Corn Resistant to Agent Orange Herbicide 2,4-D], On the chemical arms race with weeds (May 2012, Huffington Post website)&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments have been made to combat newly resistant weeds and insects, immune to developed pesticides and herbicides, which became "a problem needing national attention" according to a [[National Academy of Sciences]] committee.&lt;ref name="armsrace" /&gt;

Kimbrell's most alarming claim is that according to some, the reliance on this non-diverse type of grain, may be "a threat to global food production".&lt;ref name="armsrace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/955.full Gene amplification delivers glyphosate-resistant weed evolution], by [http://www.uwa.edu.au/person/stephen.powles Professor Stephen B. Powels] of the [[University of Western Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One month later, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) decided to reaffirm its denial of the petition, and to allow continued usage of these chemicals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/cb/csb_page/updates/2012/2-4d-petition.html EPA first denial of  petition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514100127/http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/cb/csb_page/updates/2012/2-4d-petition.html |date=May 14, 2014 }} April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) gave a green light to allow the seeds to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/01/06/agent-orange-gmo-after-usda-backs-24-d-seeds-michael-pollan-marion-nestle-lead-activist-hype-of-discredited-link/ Agent Orange GMO? After USDA backs 2,4-D seeds, Michael Pollan and Marion Nestle lead activist hype of discredited link] ([[Forbes]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The [[Center for Global Food Issues]] (CGFI), a pro genetically-engineered food organisation, claims that in one case, Kimbrell was said to have released a baseless food poisoning scare in the Wall Street Journal, following a request to exempt Monsanto from recalling of CANOLA oil from seed with a not yet US approved  gene, (although approved in Canada) found in small quantities in their oil, after deciding to concentrate on a different gene that had similar results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgfi.org/2002/04/anti-biotech-group-scares-wall-street-journal/ Anti biotech group scares Wall Street Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521080556/http://www.cgfi.org/2002/04/anti-biotech-group-scares-wall-street-journal/ |date=May 21, 2014 }} (CGFI Website) The FDA according to this article replied that there was no need for concern, for several detailed reasons given in the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

GE crop development scientists, molecular biologists, pro GE organisations, and the broader scientific community disagree with anti GE organisations such as the CFS, and argue that the FDA and the courts are careful, scientific and truthful, and that most of the anti GE claims from organisations like CFS are based on emotion, on misrepresented facts and not on science and the scientific method nor do they reflect the consensus held among scientists regarding GE crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academicsreview.org/2010/03/food-safety-focus-on-real-risks-not-fake-ones/ Food Safety: Focus on Real Risks, Not Fake Ones] (Academics Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edith Frances Mulhall Achilles''' (August 6, 1892 &amp;ndash; March 1989), was an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] who worked in [[school psychology|school]] and [[clinical psychology]]. Over the course of her career, Achilles focused on the [[memory development|development of memory]] and recognition in children, and looked into [[psychological research methods|test methods]] for measuring these skills.

==Early life and education==
Edith Frances Mulhall Achilles was born August 6, 1892 in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. Little of Achilles' early life is known until she began her education at [[Barnard College]] at [[Columbia University]]. After earning her [[Bachelor of science degree|B.S.]] in 1914, Achilles received an [[Master of Arts Degree|A.M.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. at [[Columbia University]] in 1915 and 1918, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Commencement, Volumes 154-165|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|page=42|edition=Vol. 164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BgoTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA42&amp;lpg=RA6-PA42&amp;dq=Frances+Mulhall+Achilles#v=onepage&amp;q=Frances%20Mulhall%20Achilles&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 November 2015|ref=columbia|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Edith married Paul Strong Achilles, a fellow student at Columbia University. Edith and Paul had one daughter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science|last = Ogilvie|first = Marilyn|publisher = Routledge|year = 2000|isbn = 0-415-92039-6|location = New York, NY|pages = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After receiving her Ph.D. in 1918, Achilles began teaching at Columbia University and worked in the fields of school and clinical psychology. Once Paul earned his Ph.D. and began working in the field of psychology too, his work largely overshadowed Edith's. Edith worked for a number of years at Columbia University and [[the Psychological Corporation]], which Paul directed from 1932-1946. Edith and Paul divorced in the 1930s, but Edith continued to work in the field of psychology. She consulted at [[Oxford University]] and was a trustee of her [[alma mater]], Barnard College, for several years. Edith's work over the course of her career centered on how children develop memory and recognition, and what methods might be used as reliable tests of this development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Works ==
Edith published two notable papers during her career. The first, published in 1920, was entitled ''Experimental Studies in Recall and Recognition.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Experimental studies in recall and recognition : Achilles, Edith Mulhall, b. 1892 : Free Download &amp; Streaming|url = https://archive.org/details/experimentalstud00achi|website = Internet Archive|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second paper was published in 1935, in partnership with Clairette Papin Armstrong and M.J. Sacks. It was called ''A Report of the Special Committee on [[Immigration]] and [[Naturalization]] of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York Submitting a Study on Reactions of [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] Children in New York City to Psychological Tests.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Report of the Special Committee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York Submitting a Study on Reactions of Puerto Rican Children in New York City to Psychological Tests|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3TBVGwAACAAJ|publisher = Special Committee on Immigration and Naturalization|date = 1935-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Health emergency car speeding in Lisbon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|INEM's ambulance speeding in response to a medical emergency in Lisbon.]]
'''Emergency medical services in Portugal''' are organized in three separate systems, one each covering [[Continental Portugal]], the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]. The largest system is SIEM, which covers the territory of Continental Portugal.

The modern Portuguese emergency medical services were created in 1964, and were initially provided only in the major cities of [[Lisbon]], and later [[Porto]], [[Coimbra]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Setúbal]] and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], by [[Public Security Police|PSP Police]] ambulances and staff. These services were accessible through a telephone call to the national emergency number 115. In 1971, the National Ambulance Service (SNA) was created. It was later absorbed into the National Institute of Medical Emergencies (INEM) when it was created 10 years later. The Integrated Medical Emergency System (SIEM) was created as a part of INEM in 1980. In the 1990s the national emergency number 115 was replaced by the [[112 (emergency telephone number)|European common emergency number 112]].

==Services in Continental Portugal==
In Continental Portugal, there are three major emergency medical services providers: the National Institute of Medical Emergencies (INEM), the fire departments, and the Portuguese Red Cross. 

INEM is the agency of the [[Ministry of Health (Portugal)|Portuguese Ministry of Health]] responsible for coordinating the Integrated Medical Emergency System (SIEM) of Continental Portugal, and directly providing some of its emergency medical services. Of the services provided by INEM, some are operated by their own staff (e.g. guidance centers and ambulances in major cities), while the operation of others is delegated to the staff of local fire departments, and of the Portuguese Red Cross, but using INEM's equipment (e.g. ambulances in small towns).

Fire departments are traditionally the major providers of local emergency medical services outside of major cities in their respective [[Area of responsibility|areas of responsibility]], which usually coincide with the territory of a municipality. Virtually all of the more than 400 fire departments include an emergency medical services unit. The services are provided through the use of the departments' own equipment and/or, with equipment delegated by INEM. In major cities, the emergency medical service units of fire departments serve as backups or reinforcements to INEM.

The Portuguese Red Cross - through its Corps of Rescue Units (CORUS) - is another major provider of medical emergency services. It usually acts as a backup or reinforcement to both INEM and the fire departments.

===Integrated Medical Emergency System (SIEM)===
The Integrated Medical Emergency System ({{lang-pt|Sistema Integrado de Emergência Médica}}) or SIEM, is centrally managed by the National Institute of Medical Emergencies (INEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.min-saude.pt/NR/rdonlyres/14CD45A7-C4A6-403C-BB3F-45C77BED6C9C/0/35133516.pdf |title=Decreto-Lei n.o 220/2007 de 29 de Maio''. Diário da República, 1.a série—N.o 103—29 de Maio de 2007|format=PDF |date=29 May 2007 |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers Continental Portugal and operates like other organised [[Emergency medical services]] around the world.

In Portugal, the free of charge phone number for emergency medical service is the Europe wide [[112 (emergency telephone number)]]. When someone dials "1-1-2", the call is directed to a PSP Police dispatch center. The PSP dispatch center redirects the call accordingly for the type of emergency to the appropriate emergency services. In continental Portugal medical emergency calls are directed to one of INEM's urgent patient guidance centers ({{lang-pt|centro de orientação de doentes urgentes}}) or CODU's. There are four regional CODU's; [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Coimbra]] and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]. Additionally, there is the CODU-Mar that responds to maritime medical emergencies.

Under the coordination of CODU's, a number of specialized mobile resources operate, including [[ambulance]]s, [[fly car]]s, [[air ambulance]]s and [[motorcycle ambulance]]s. The ambulances are either directly operated by INEM from its regional delegations, or are operated from the medical emergency and reserve posts installed in the local fire departments, or local delegations of the [[Portuguese Red Cross]].

Besides CODU's, SIEM also operates INEM's Anti-Poison Information Center (CIAV), which provides 24/7 toxicological medical information at a national level (including in the Azores and Madeira), as well as the Pediatric Inter-Hospital Transport (TIP) subsystem, which provides emergency transportation of high risk newborns to specialized hospital units.

===Mobile Resources===
SIEM includes standard medical emergency mobile resources, some of them directly operated by INEM, while others are operated by fire departments, the Portuguese Red Cross, or other entities. The following resources exist:
* ''Ambulância de emergência médica'' (AEM) - [[basic life support]] ambulance, crewed by two [[emergency medical technician]]s. All AEM ambulances are owned by INEM, but the operation of some is delegated to other entities such as local fire departments. AEM's are complemented by fire department owned fire rescue ambulances (ABSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inem.pt/PageGen.aspx?WMCM_PaginaId=27944|title=Ambulâncias SBV do INEM|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Ambulância de suporte imediato de vida'' (SIV) - immediate life support ambulance, similar to an AEM, but with an emergency medical [[nurse]] in its crew instead of a second emergency medical technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inem.pt/PageGen.aspx?WMCM_PaginaId=27955|title=Ambulâncias SIV do INEM|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Viatura médica de emergência e reanimação'' (VMER) - resuscitation and emergency medical vehicle (fly car), crewed by an emergency medical [[physician]] and a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inem.pt/PageGen.aspx?WMCM_PaginaId=27966|title=VMER do INEM|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ambulância de suporte avançado de vida pediátrico'' - pediatric advanced life support ambulance, crewed by a physician, nurse, and an emergency medical technician.
* ''Helicóptero de emergência médica'' - medical emergency helicopter (air ambulance), crewed by two pilots, a physician and a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inem.pt/PageGen.aspx?WMCM_PaginaId=27977|title=Helicóptero do INEM|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services in the Portuguese Atlantic Islands==
As part of their unique administrative powers, the [[autonomous region of Portugal|Portuguese autonomous region]]s of The Azores and Madeira have their own separate emergency medical services, each controlled by their respective regional secretaries of Health. These services are smaller than those on continental Portugal, but share many common features with SIEM.

===Madeira===


In Madeira, emergency medical services are coordinated by the Regional Medical Emergency Service (SEMER), which mirrors the role and function of INEM on continental Portugal specifically for the region. SEMER includes the Rapid Intervention Medical Team (EMIR), which is prepared to provide medical rescue in any part of the region, including rescue in maritime and air environments if needed. 

===The Azores===


In the Azores, emergency medical services are centrally managed by the Regional Civil Protection and Fire Service. 

===Air ambulance===


Unlike continental Portugal, where air ambulance services are typically provided directly by INEM with its own helicopters, in the Atlantic islands, the [[Portuguese Air Force]] is in charge of emergency patient evacuations between islands, and from ships. Rotary and/or fixed wing aircraft (usually [[EADS CASA C-295]] aircraft operated by the [[502 Squadron (Portugal)|502 Squadron]], and [[EH-101]] helicopters operated by the [[751 Squadron]]), are used in combination if needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5699">'''Eugen C. Botezat''' (March 15, 1871&amp;ndash;December 1964) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born [[Romania]]n zoologist.

Born in [[Tereblecea]], in [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Bukovina]], his parents Constantin and Domnica were teachers. He attended three grades of primary school in his native village from 1877 to 1879, followed by a fourth in [[Siret]], where he learned German. Botezat went to high school in [[Czernowitz]] (''Cernăuți'') and [[Suceava]], graduating in 1892.&lt;ref name="c135"&gt;Crețu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; He studied natural sciences at the [[German University in Prague]]. In 1897, he became a teaching assistant at its zoology institute; a year later, he received a doctorate. From 1898 to 1919 he taught natural sciences at the normal school in Czernowitz, paying particular attention to students from rural backgrounds like himself. In 1907, he became assistant professor of histology at [[Czernowitz University]],&lt;ref name="i103"/&gt; and also performed laboratory research on the comparative anatomy and histology of sensory organs in vertebrates. In 1913, upon being nominated by [[Ion Th. Simionescu]], he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="c136"&gt;Crețu, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, when the local schools were closed due to the Russian occupation, he taught at [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi National College|the high school]] in [[Rădăuți]].&lt;ref name="i103"&gt;Ichim, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he formed part of the Romanian National Council that approved Bukovina's union with Romania.&lt;ref name="c136"/&gt;

In 1919, soon after Bukovina came under Romanian administration, he became a full professor of zoology at Cernăuți University, remaining as such until retiring in 1938. During this period, he was dean of the philosophy and then of the natural sciences faculty,&lt;ref name="i103"/&gt; as well as university rector from 1922 to 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Bozgan, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; His scientific activity was known abroad as well as domestically, with many of his studies appearing in German.&lt;ref name="i103"/&gt; He made important advances in the histology of sensory organs in mammals and birds, publishing 34 articles on morphology, physiological anatomy and cynegetics.&lt;ref name="c136"/&gt; His discoveries pertained to the nerve endings in the [[tactile corpuscle]]s of mammals, taste buds in birds, the neurofibrillary structure of nerve endings, the double innervation of [[striated muscle tissue]] and the epidermis, and glandular activity in sensory cells. Botezat's ecological studies, undertaken during his many walks through the woods of Bukovina, focused on wild animals in their natural habitat: wild boar, deer, bears, wolves and lynx. He described the biological meaning of [[bird vocalization]] and was concerned with the [[balance of nature]].&lt;ref name="b146"&gt;Bejinariu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

An avid hunter, Botezat was also concerned with the biology and ecology of hunting in Bukovina. He studied the varieties of [[red deer]] living in the area's section of the [[Carpathians]], analyzing the formation of their antlers and classifying them. He argued that the Austrian administration, particularly after 1870, mismanaged hunting, as it prioritized the shooting of the best specimens by nobles without concern for the state of the forests or the remaining deer. He recommended that, on the contrary, the weakest animals should be the ones targeted for hunting.&lt;ref name="i104"&gt;Ichim, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1940, during the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation of Northern Bukovina]], he temporarily took over the university and handed over its administration to the Soviets, who treated him with respect. He took refuge in unoccupied Romania via Germany, settling in [[Bucharest]]. His valuable collection of hunting trophies and scientific displays was lost during World War II.&lt;ref name="i1034"/&gt; In 1948, the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|stripped him of Academy membership]].&lt;ref name="otiman"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Păun Otiman]], [http://www.akademos.asm.md/files/1948_anul%20imensei%20jertfe%20a%20Academiei%20romane.pdf "1948–Anul imensei jertfe a Academiei Române"], in ''Academica'', Nr. 4 (31), December 2013, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1964.&lt;ref name="i1034"&gt;Ichim, pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7390">Although they vary in particulars, [[polymyositis]], [[dermatomyositis]] and [[inclusion body myositis]] are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/inflammatory_myopathies/detail_inflammatory_myopathies.htm] primarily characterized by chronic [[inflammation]] of human [[skeletal muscle]] tissue&lt;ref name="Lundberg 2000"&gt;Lundberg I. and Y-L Chung, 2000. Treatment and Investigations of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. "Rheumatology". 39:7-17.&lt;/ref&gt; that ultimately causes the [[necrosis]] of muscle cells.  This degeneration leads to muscle tissue wasting, weakness and fatigue among other serious effects.  Until recently, exercise has been avoided as a type of therapy, and even forbidden due to the risk of triggering or amplifying inflammation.  However, several studies have been conducted to test this assumption and have shown that [[Aerobics|aerobic exercise]] as well as [[Strength training|resistance training]] can maintain and even improve quality of life for IIM-affected individuals without increased [[inflammatory response]].&lt;ref name="Painelli 2009"&gt;Painelli VdS, B Gualano, GG Artioli, AL de Sa Pinto, E Bonfa, AH Lancha Jr., FR Lima, 2009. The possible role of physical exercise on the treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. ''Autoimmunity Reviews''. 8:355-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of exercise therapy: trials==

With the main goals of treatment being improved functionality and quality of life, exercise programs should focus on “functional” exercises (e.g. walking, walking up/down stairs, sit-to-stand), when applicable. Performing functional exercises increases (a) the efficiency of the exercise program and (b) the likelihood the improvements will be transferred to activities of daily living.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, L.G., Collier, K.E., Edwards, D.J., Phillippe, D.L., Eastwood, P.R., Walters, S.E., Thickbroom, G.W., Mastaglia, F.L. (2009). Improvement in aerobic capacity after an exercise program in sporadic inclusion body myositis. Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease, 10(4), 178-184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isometric activity===
In 1993, [[isometric exercise]] training was applied for four weeks resulting in isometric peak power at 60% of maximal voluntary contraction.&lt;ref name="Hicks 1993"&gt;Hicks JE, F Miller, P Plotz, TH Chen and I Gerber, 1993. Isometric exercise increases strength and does not produce sustained creatinine phosphokinase increases in a patient with polymyositis. ''Journal of Rheumatology''. 20:1399-140l.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in isometric power was later shown to have no significant effect on serum [[creatine kinase]] (CK) after two weeks of [[strength training]].&lt;ref name="Escalante  1993"&gt;Escalante A, L Miller and TD Beardmore, 1993. Resistive exercise in the rehabilitation of polymyositis/dermatomyositis. ''Journal of Rheumatology''. 20:1340-1344.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerobic activity===
A six-week training program in 1998 that included 30 minutes of [[aerobic exercise|aerobic activity]] three times per week set at 60% maximum heart rate (predicted by age) resulted in increased [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]] (i.e. maximal oxygen consumption or aerobic capacity), diminished pain, reduced muscle impairment, and improved quality of life.&lt;ref name="Wiesinger 1998"&gt;Wiesinger GF, M Quittan, M Aringer, A Seeber, B Volc-Platzer, J Smolen, et al, 1998. Improvement of physical fitness and muscle strength in polymyositis/dermatomyositis patients by a training programme. ''British Journal of Rheumatoloty''. 37:196-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight bearing activity===
The results produced by aerobic activity were repeated in 1999 &lt;ref name="Alexanderson 1999"&gt;Alexanderson H, CH Stenstrom and I Lundberg, 1999. Safety of a home exercise programme in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis: A pilot study. ''Rheumatology''. 38, 608-611.&lt;/ref&gt; where for 12 weeks, weight-bearing exercise was added for patients not exhibiting marked physical incapacity as measured by the Functional Index in Myositis. [http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/39/1/7] (see Functional Assessment section). Confirmed by MRI and muscle biopsy, both the 1998 and 1999 studies showed that there were no significant changes in levels of [[creatine kinase]] and [[aldolase]], and no increase in muscle inflammation. In 2001, 22 patients were placed on a three-week physical therapy and exercise program, and found that creatine kinase levels actually dropped in 20 of the patients.&lt;ref name="Heikkila 2001"&gt;Heikkila S, JV Viitanen, H Kautiainen, T Rajamaki, P Mantyvuo, and T Harju, 2001. Rehabilitation in Myositis: Preliminary Study. ''Physiotherapy''. 87:301-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest study to date was a six-month exercise program demonstrating a significant improvement in exercise capacity, VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[isokinetic exercises|isokinetic]] strength, and the ability to perform daily tasks compared to controls.&lt;ref name="Wiesinger 1998"/&gt;

===Stretching and range of motion activity===
Chest expansion and thoracic extension exercises may offer preventive support to those at risk of [[restrictive lung disease]] through the effects of IIM, and patients with inclusion body myositis may also be able to prevent contracture and extend functional daily activities through stretching and range of motion exercises&lt;ref name="Boon 2000"&gt;Boon AJ and KA Stolp-Smith, 2000. Inclusion Body Myositis Masquerading as Polymyositis: A Case Study. ''Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation''. 81:1123-1126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring==
It is important to recognize that all described exercise programs were conducted by physicians or physiotherapists during the stable phase of the disease (except Painelli&lt;ref name="Painelli 2009" /&gt;). Patients were monitored closely for indicators of deleterious effects, such as increases in serum creatine kinase, inflammation or weakness.  Monitoring of this kind can only be done in conjunction with a medical team who is aware of the risks posed by increased [[inflammatory response]] in patients with IIM.

==Future research==
The pathophysiology of IIMs is not well understood. Muscle weakness can be caused by a single or combined effect on muscle tissue by inflammation, inflammatory infiltrates, muscle atrophy, metabolic abnormalities that indicate disordered energy metabolism,&lt;ref name="Lundberg 2000" /&gt; and possibly neuropathy,&lt;ref name="Hermanns 2000"&gt;Hermanns B, M Molnar and JM Schroder, 2000. Peripheral neuropathy associated with hereditary and sporadic inclusion body myositis: confirmation by electron microscopy and morphometry. ''Journal of the Neurological Sciences''. 179:92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Therefore, physical exercise has the potential to cause harm.

However, the results of these exercise studies, at minimum, show that exercise can attenuate muscle damage due to disease, inactivity and steroid use.&lt;ref name="Painelli 2009" /&gt;  They reflect the benefit of exercise through the strengthening of complement (non-diseased) muscles, and should encourage further studies to confirm whether diseased muscle may experience regeneration. The definition of improvement must be established,&lt;ref name="Lundberg 2000" /&gt; and reproducible longitudinal studies must be conducted to determine the efficacy of exercise as therapy for IIM.

'''Harold G. Koenig''' is a [[psychiatrist]] on the faculty of [[Duke University]].  His ideas have been covered in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and other news media with regard to [[Religion and health|religion, spirituality and health]], a focus of some of his research and clinical practice. [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]] has provided great financial support to his activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blindfaithunholy00sloa|title=Blind faith : the unholy alliance of religion and medicine|last=Sloan|first=Richard P.|date=2006|publisher=New York : St. Martin's Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60-63|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic career==
Koenig graduated with a B.S. in [[history]] from [[Stanford University]] (1974), later receiving his MD (1982) from [[University of California, San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="cvkoenig"&gt;[http://spiritualityandhealth.duke.edu/images/pdfs/Koenig_Full_CV.pdf Curriculum Vitae: Harold G. Koenig], accessed 1 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Clinical Assistant Professor in Psychiatry (1992) and has been Professor of Psychiatry (2004-) at [[Duke University]] Medical Center.

He is currently director of Duke's Center for the Study of Religion/Spirituality and Health.

==Research==
Koenig has published over 280 scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals, scholarly professional journal articles and 60 chapters in professional books.&lt;ref name=cvkoenig/&gt; In a cooperation with [[Raphael M. Bonelli]] from [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]] he undertook the first systematic [[evidence based]] analysis on the connection between [[mental disorder]]s and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonelli | first1 = RM | last2 = Koenig | first2 = H | year = 2013 | title = Mental Disorders, Religion and Spirituality 1990 to 2010: A Systematic Evidence-Based Review | url = | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 52| issue = 2| pages = 657–73| pmid = 23420279 | doi=10.1007/s10943-013-9691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conclude that there is good [[evidence]] that religious involvement is correlated with better mental health in the areas of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and [[suicide]]; some evidence in [[Stress-related disorders]] and [[dementia]]; insufficient evidence in [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]], and no data in many other mental disorders.

==Media coverage==
Koenig's ideas have been covered in a wide variety of news media, ranging from BBC radio to the Vatican Radio.&lt;ref name=cvkoenig/&gt; Examples include:

* In 2009, ''Newsweek'' featured comments from Koenig, stating that he was "leading the charge for a better understanding of patients' religious and spiritual beliefs in the medical setting. 'It just makes too much sense,' he says, when patient after patient tells him, 'Doctor, religion is the most important thing; it keeps me going.' Koenig advocates that doctors take spiritual histories of any patient they are likely to have an ongoing relationship with, asking questions like: 'Is religion a source of comfort or stress? Do you have any religious beliefs that would influence decision-making? Do you have any spiritual needs that someone should address?'"&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Kalb (2003, Nov. 10). "[http://www.newsweek.com/faith-healing-133365 Can Religion Improve Health? While The Debate Rages In Journals And Med Schools, More Americans Ask For Doctors' Prayers ]." ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The reserve's sand dunes, [[salt marsh]], pasture and pools are important for breeding birds like [[pied avocet]], and wintering [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[wader]]s. There are a range of coastal habitats including, freshwater pools, grazing marsh and saltmarsh. Much of the site consists of natural habitats maintained largely by coastal processes.&lt;ref name=NWT/&gt;

'''''Honey, We're Killing the Kids''''' is the name of a [[BBC Three]] television series in which parents are shown the consequences of poor parenting.  The program shows [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images and technology]] of what their children may look like as adults if they continue with their present life-style, dietary and exercise habits.  The name of this show is a parody of the name from Disney's ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise)|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' movies and TV series.

==Format==
First, a family with issues relating to their parenting, dietary and exercise habits is introduced. Then, the children are examined by physicians and psychologists, and every aspect of their eating habits and physical activity is analysed by an expert team. Then, the parents are shown what their children may look like by taking present-day photos of them and age-progressing the photos with a computer year by year until age forty. The parents are frequently brought to tears when presented with the likelihood of their children's unhappy future appearance and significantly reduced life expectancy.

Some traits are exaggerated for effect. Highly variable traits such as clothes, hairstyles, jewelry, eyeglasses, facial hair, and so forth are added to the computer generated images based on guesses by the show at the social and educational impact current poor parenting may have on the children's future lives. These guesses at highly variable traits are swayed depending on the outcome predicted by the show's child experts based upon the likely life expectancy, state of health and emotional stability of the children. Bad haircuts and glasses may be used for the previous version while the finished version has the computer generated images smiling and wearing a suit. Another example, in the premier TLC episode, an eight-year-old boy was given a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]], an earring, nerdy-looking eyeglasses, and a [[soul patch]] at age fifteen. In another episode, an eight-year-old girl was given a bad case of acne as she went through her teenage years. [[Rosacea]], obesity, tooth decay, and hair loss also seem to be common ailments added to the age-progression. These guesses at personal traits are present in all episodes to dramatise the harmful physical, emotional effects of a poor diet and poor parenting, and the major impact the show's experts say these are likely to have on the children's future well being.

The show follows families' home lives for a period of four weeks. During this period they follow a manual of instructions written by experts including a child psychologist, a fitness expert and a dietician. At weekly interventions to this regime they are criticized by the show's host and given three new 'rules' targeted at each family specifically, to help them be better parents. Rules have been primarily aimed at the children, including both diet and exercise, but there have also been a couple of rules for adults, such as giving up smoking (and in one case going back to university). Practices such as "Home Cooking" and "Get Active" have been introduced, but also recommendations aimed at fostering emotional stability such as "Honey Time", a practice encouraged where the parents set aside time before bedtime, to praise positive things their children have done that day.&lt;ref name=lopez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allpsych.com/journal/parentingskills.html|author=William Lopez|title=Successful Parenting Skills that Shape Children's Behaviors|date=15 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that positive reward and praise of children is likely to enhance their social and educational chances in later life, by making them more confident and emotionally secure.

Many families are from socially deprived backgrounds and derive significant benefit from simple improvements in diet. The show also features many second families or [[blended families]] reflecting widespread social upheaval and change in traditional modes of parenting, and focusing on the dilemmas of stepparents and stepchildren.

Despite the arguably exaggerated computer generated images, the show has contributed to a widespread public debate about parenting which has included the television series [[Jamie's School Dinners]] initiated by [[Jamie Oliver]] in the UK. Perceived as a worthy enterprise by public broadcasters, the show continues to be commissioned internationally.

== International versions of the show ==
* The American edition of the one-hour weekly series appeared on [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] in the United States and the [[Food Network (Canada)|Food Network]] in Canada; the first season was hosted by Dr. [[Lisa Hark]], a [[nutritionist]]. The second season is hosted by [[Felicia Stoler]]. 
* The British edition is hosted by [[Kris Murrin]]. 
* The Australian version of the show is hosted by Child Development Specialist Dr. [[Anne Purcell]] and airs on [[Network Ten]]. 
* The New Zealand version of the show is hosted by Dr. Louise Schofield, and airs on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]. 
* The Ukrainian version of the show, ''Dorogaya, my ubivaem detei'' or ''Kohana, my vbyvaiemo ditey'' (Дорогая, мы убиваем детей/Кохана, ми вбиваємо дітей) is aired on the [[:uk:СТБ|STB Channel]]. It has become an internet meme due to scenes from an episode featuring a computer-addicted boy called Alexander Fokin, who has become known as "Sashko" on the Russian-speaking Internet and the "No New Memes Kid" or "Crazy Ukrainian Kid" on the English-speaking Internet.
* The Russian version of the show, however, will be aired on the one of the channels. This version was aired on [[Ren-TV]] channel, it was named as "Honey, we're losing our kids".

'''John E. Pickering''' (27 April 1918 – 19 September 1997) was a pioneer in the field of [[radiobiology]], [[aviation medicine]] and [[space medicine]] and a [[Colonel]] in the [[United States Air Force]]. He spent much of his career in the Department of Radiobiology, Air University, [[Randolph Air Force Base#School of Aviation Medicine|School of Aviation Medicine]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas. Pickering was involved with the first tests involving [[nuclear powered aircraft]]. Pickering co-wrote President [[John F. Kennedy]]’s last official speech before the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|fateful trip]] to [[Dallas, Texas]] in 1963. Colonel Pickering was a founding member and director of the [[Health Physics Society]], the author of textbooks and many scientific papers.&lt;ref&gt;Government Services, Air Force. JAMA. (1958).  168(14):1915. doi:10.1001/jama.1958.03000140077020&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
John E. Pickering was born 27 April 1918 in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] and died in 1997. In 1942 Lieutenant Pickering, USAF married Virginia Copeland and the couple had 3 children, Patricia, Peggy and John R. The family were lifelong Methodists and members of the Central United Methodist Church of Albuquerque since 1989 when they moved to [[New Mexico]]. He was buried at the Santa Fe National Cemetery, Santa Fe County, New Mexico in burial plot: [Section: Y, Row: 0, Site: 288B]. At the time of his death he resided in Tijeras, New Mexico near Albuquerque, New Mexico and was buried on 22 September 1997.

Pickering attended the [[University of Arizona]] and in 1940 received [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degrees in [[chemistry]] and [[engineering]] and completed [[Master of Science|MS]] degrees in [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] in 1941.

In May 1942 Pickering graduated at the top of the class and received a [[commission (document)|commission]] as a [[second lieutenant]]. His first assignment took him to [[Naval Air Station Albany|Turner Field]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In September 1942 he was transferred to [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Force]] Navigation School at [[Selman Army Airfield|Selman Field]] near [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. At Selman Field, Pickering advanced in position from [[Flight instructor|instructor]], [[flight commander]], flight control officer, squadron commander, and administrative executive with the [[Combat systems officer|Navigation Training Group III]].

In 1945 Pickering was assigned to [[Chanute Air Force Base|Chanute Field]] in [[Illinois]]. He completed courses in [[weather forecasting]] and advanced [[meteorology]], and graduated at the top of the class. His next post was a short stint as a weather officer in [[San Francisco]], California.
After San Francisco, Pickering was transferred to [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]] in [[Texas]] and was charged with training [[United States Air Force Academy|air cadets]] in [[meteorology]]. He published his first book, “Student Handbook of Weather” in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, John E. (1946). “Student Handbook of Weather”. U.S. Air Force.&lt;/ref&gt; His next book came in 1947, “Air Navigation”.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, John E. (1947). “Air Navigation”. U.S. Air Force.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 1947, Pickering was sent to the [[University of Chicago]] graduate school to complete studies for a [[Ph.D.]] in [[nuclear chemistry]] and [[physics]]. He returned in July 1948 before studies were completed, based on the needs of the [[Air Force]]. His assignment this time was with the School of Aerospace Medicine at Randolf Field as a [[research assistant]] in the Department of [[Biophysics]].

In 1958 Colonel John E. Pickering, Chief, Department of [[Radiobiology]], was named director of medical research at the U. S. [[Brooks Air Force Base#Aerospace Medicine|School of Aerospace Medicine]], [[San Antonio, Texas]].

===President Kennedy's speech, "Cap over the Wall"===
On 21 November 1963, Colonel Pickering and Lt. Gen. [[George E. Schafer]] co-wrote the technical portions of [[John F. Kennedy]]’s ‘Cap over the Wall’ speech. Kennedy visited [[Brooks Air Force Base]] to dedicate the [[Brooks Air Force Base#Aerospace Medicine|Aerospace Medical Center]]. This was President Kennedy’s last official act as President before [[Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks marks JFK's 40th anniversary visit. http://www.af.mil/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Print.aspx?PortalId=1&amp;ModuleId=850&amp;Article=138100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JFK&gt;Remarks at Aero-Space Medical Health Center dedication, San Antonio, Texas, 21 November 1963. http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-048-017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excerpt from JFK's "Cap Over the Wall" speech, 21 November 1963====
An excerpt form the 'Cap Over the Wall' speech, with the closing 2 paragraphs from [[John F. Kennedy]]:
{{quote|[[Frank O’Connor]], the Irish writer, tells in one of his books how, as a boy, he and his friends would make their way across the countryside; and when they came to an orchard wall that seemed too high to climb, too doubtful to try, too difficult to permit their journey to continue, they took off their caps and tossed them over the wall - - and then they had no choice but to follow them.
	My friends, this nation has tossed its cap over the wall of space - - and we have no choice but to follow it.  Whatever the difficulties, they must be overcome.  Whatever the hazards, they must be guarded against.  With the vital help of this Aerospace Medical Center, with the help of all who labor in this space endeavor, with the help and support of all Americans, we will climb this wall with both safety and speed - - and we shall then explore all the wonders and treasures that lie on the other side.&lt;ref name=JFK/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;President John F.

'''Lake Rotorangi''' is the largest [[lake]] in the [[New Zealand]] region of [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LINZ|26553||2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reservoir]] was created in 1984 by the damming of the [[Patea River]].

== History ==
Lake Rotorangi was formed in 1984 as a reservoir for generating electricity. The lake was formed by building an 80-metre high earth wall dam near the end of Ball Road in [[South Taranaki District]]. The dam created then filled the [[Patea River]] valley for a distance of about 46 kilometres to make the longest reservoir of its type in [[New Zealand]].

The [[Patea Dam]] is owned by Trust Power and rated at 31 MW output (115 GWh per annum). Patea is operated as a peaking station. With around one week's storage capacity, the station generates electricity over periods when electricity prices are highest. It is also a public camping ground, used in the summer time for various water sports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10135">{{merge to|Okinawa diet|date=June 2018|discuss=Talk:Okinawa Prefecture#Merger proposal: High life expectancy in Okinawa to this article}}
[[File:Deployment of U.S. Forces in Japan outside Okinawa.jpg|thumb|Okinawa is seen on the bottom left-hand side of the map of Japan.]]
Okinawa had the longest life expectancy in all [[prefectures of Japan]] for almost 30 years prior to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hokama|first=Tomiko|last2=Binns|first2=Colin|date=2008-10-01|title=Declining longevity advantage and low birthweight in Okinawa|journal=Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health|volume=20 Suppl|pages=95–101|issn=1010-5395|pmid=19533867}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative life expectancy of Okinawans has since declined, due to many factors including westernization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In fact, in 2000 Okinawa dropped in its ranking for longevity advantage for men to 26th out of 47 within the [[prefectures of Japan]].

[[Japan]] has the highest life expectancy of any country: 90 for women and for men, 84.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blue Zones Solution: Eating and Living Like the World's Healthiest People|last=Buettner|first=Dan|publisher=National Geographic|year=2015|isbn=1426211929|location=|pages=|quote=|via=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to the USA where the average life expectancy for women is 81 years old, and 76 for men.

There are more than 400 centenarians in Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;''The Okinawa Diet Plan'', Bradley Willcox, MD, D. Craig Willcox, PhD and Makoto Suzuki, MD, copyright 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are a myriad of factors that could account for differences in life expectancy, cuisine could be the largest factor. People from all around the world have tried to emulate the "[[Okinawa diet]]" to reap its health benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/japan-has-highest-life-expectancy-any-major-country-why-n130871|title=Japan Has The Highest Life Expectancy Of Any Major Country. Why? - NBC News|newspaper=NBC News|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be because it is nutritionally dense yet low in calories.

== Diet ==
[[File:Okinawa soba and goya chanpuru.jpg|thumb|The plate to the right is the national dish, gōyā chanpurū, made with bitter melon known as goyain.]]
[[Okinawan cuisine]] consists of smaller meal portions of green and yellow vegetables, fish, relativity smaller amounts of rice compared to mainland Japan, as well as pork, soy and other legumes. Pork and fish are often served in broth with a variety of ingredients and herbs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The center of the Okinawa diet is the Satsuma sweet potato. The sweet potato provides a large source of energy while keeping calories low. The sweet potato also contributes the self-sufficiency of the island. Contrary to the regular potato, the Okinawa sweet potato does not have a large effect on blood sugar. Not only is the potato used but so are the leaves from the plant. The leaves are used often in miso soup. The Okinawan bitter melon is proven to have some anti-diabetic effects. In Okinawa the bitter melon is called goyain and is served in the national dish, goya champuru. The bitter melon is effective in regulating blood sugar similar to the sweet potato.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another low-calorie staple in Okinawa is seaweed, particularly, knobu or [[kombu]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This plant, like much of the greenery from the island, is rich in protein, amino acids and minerals such as iodine. Another seaweed commonly eaten is wakame. Like knobu, wakame is rich in minerals like iodine, magnesium and calcium. Seaweed and tofu in one form or other are eaten on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sho|first=H.|date=2001-01-01|title=History and characteristics of Okinawan longevity food|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–164|issn=0964-7058|pmid=11710358|doi=10.1046/j.1440-6047.2001.00235.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to gerontologist Kazuhiko Taira, the most common cooking fat used traditionally in Okanawa is a monounsaturated fat-lard.  Although often called a “saturated fat,” lard is 50 percent monounsaturated fat (including small amounts of health-producing antimicrobial palmitoleic acid), 40 percent saturated fat and 10 percent polyunsaturated. Taira also reports that healthy and vigorous Okinawans eat 100 grams  each of pork and fish each day. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/soy-alert/how-much-soy-do-okinawans-eat-2/; Taira, Kazuhiko. In Franklyn, Deborah. Take a Lesson from the People of Okinawa, Heath, September 1996, 57-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turmeric]] is prevalent in the Okinawan diet. It has been noted throughout history, especially in South Asia for its health benefits. The Okinawan use turmeric as a spice and also as tea.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Turmeric, like many herbs, poses antioxidant properties and anti-aging properties. Moreover, turmeric has a correlation to mental health and dementia. Consumers are less likely to develop mental health illness in later age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tapsell, L. C., Hemphill, I., Cobiac, L., Sullivan, D. R., Fenech, M., Patch, C. S., ... &amp; Fazio, V. A. (2006). Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future.&lt;/ref&gt; (However, there are no double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, peer reviewed studies showing that consumers of turmeric or any other herb are less likely to develop mental illness at any stage of life.)

Overall, the diet leads to many benefits seen among people of Okinawa. These include little weight gain with age, low BMI throughout life, and low risk from age related disease.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Willcox | first1 = B.

As mentioned earlier the diet is rich in ingredients that supposedly possess anti-aging and antioxidant properties. However, no ingredients or foods of any kind have ever been scientifically shown to possess anti-aging properties. Research using 100 items from the Okinawa diet shows that some of the diet contains anti-obesity properties or "anti-obese activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niwano|first=Yoshimi|last2=Beppu|first2=Fumiaki|last3=Shimada|first3=Taichi|last4=Kyan|first4=Rika|last5=Yasura|first5=Kazumasa|last6=Tamaki|first6=Minori|last7=Nishino|first7=Michinori|last8=Midorikawa|first8=Yoshiyuki|last9=Hamada|first9=Hiroki|date=2008-12-07|title=Extensive Screening for Plant Foodstuffs in Okinawa, Japan with Anti-Obese Activity on Adipocytes In Vitro|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11130-008-0102-z|journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition|language=en|volume=64|issue=1|pages=6–10|doi=10.1007/s11130-008-0102-z|issn=0921-9668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Caloric restriction (CR) or dietary restriction (DR) are helpful tools in understanding age and diet related health complications. In the 1972 Japan National Nutrition Survey it was determined that Okinawan adults consumed 83% of what Japanese adults did and that Okinawan children consumed 62% of what Japanese children consumed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It should be noted that today the difference in life expectancy between Okinawan and mainland Japanese is decreasing as the Okinawan are losing their dietary advantage. Recently, there is a decreasing trend in the life expectancy in Okinawa. This is evidenced by low birth weight, poor lactation, and the fact that the life expectancy for Okinawan men is lower than the national average. Scientist such as Dr. Éric Le Bourg believe that the Okinawa diet has more of a deleterious effect then beneficial one. Le Bourg and others alike think that the low protein intake can cause harmful effects on a human as they have done in animal studies. The individuals with a lower protein consumption were more vulnerable to pathogens. Another plausible reason for the decrease in life expectancy is westernization. After World War II, Okinawans started to consume more calories. This in part is due to Americanization of the diet, such as with fast food.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gavrilova|first=Natalia S.|last2=Gavrilov|first2=Leonid A.|title=Comments on Dietary Restriction, Okinawa Diet and Longevity|url=http://www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000329894|journal=Gerontology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=221–223|doi=10.1159/000329894|pmc=3362219|pmid=21893946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and customs ==
Okinawa and Japan have food-centered cultures. Festivities often include food or are food-based. Moreover, the food in Japan tends to be seasonal, fresh and raw. Portion sizes are small and meals are brought out in stages that starts with an appetizers, many main courses including sashimi (raw fish) and suimono (soup), sweets and tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/e36_food.pdf|title=Japanese Food Culture|last=|first=|date=|website=Web Japan|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since food culture is linked to ancestral traditions, the food culture and presentation is preserved, passing low-calorie food from generation to generation.  A belief still prevalent in Okinawa is the healing power of food. Food is regarded as medicine which helps contribute to the longevity of Okinawa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The concept of "food is medicine" came to the island from China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">The '''Medical Practitioners' Union''' ('''MPU''') is a section of [[Unite the Union]], a [[trade union]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The union was founded as the '''Medico-Political Union''' in 1914 and was renamed the Medical Practitioners' Union in 1922.  It amalgamated with the [[Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs]] in 1970 under the leadership of [[Hugh Faulkner (doctor)|Hugh Faulkner]].  It remained a distinct section through a series of mergers which formed [[Manufacturing, Science and Finance]], [[Amicus]] and ultimately Unite.&lt;ref name="records"&gt;[http://mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk/records/MPU Records of the Medical Practitioners' Union], [[University of Warwick]] Modern Records Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The union published ''Medical World''.  This originated in 1913 as the official journal of the [[State Medical Service Association]], but was adopted as the official union journal the following year.&lt;ref name="records" /&gt;  The union opposed the [[British Medical Association]].  It aimed to extend the provision of medical care by the state, while retaining the independence of [[general practitioners]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cooter, ''[http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2465/2/2465.pdf The Rise and Decline of the Medical Member: Doctors and Parliament in Edwardian and Interwar Britain]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21755">'''Mental health courts''' link offenders who would ordinarily be [[Imprisonment|prison-bound]] to long-term community-based treatment. They rely on [[mental health]] assessments, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing judicial monitoring to address both the mental health needs of offenders and public safety concerns of communities. Like other [[problem-solving courts]] such as [[drug court]]s, [[domestic violence court]]s, and [[community court]]s, mental health courts seek to address the underlying problems that contribute to [[Crime|criminal behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;There is a growing body of literature about problem-solving courts. For an explanation of the six key principles underlying problem-solving courts, see {{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/Principles.pdf|title=Principles of Problem-Solving Justice |publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health courts share characteristics with [[crisis intervention]] teams, jail diversion programs, specialized [[probation]] and [[parole]] caseloads, and a host of other collaborative initiatives intended to address the significant overrepresentation of people with [[mental illness]] in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice reports that 16 percent of inmates in the U.S. reported either a mental condition or an overnight stay in a mental hospital, and were identified as mentally ill. See {{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/mhtip.pdf |title=Mental Health and Treatment of Inmates and Probationers |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the United States in the early 1980s, Judge Evan Dee Goodman helped establish a court exclusively to deal with mental health matters at Wishard Memorial Hospital. The mentally ill were frequently arrested and had charges pending when the treatment providers sought a civil commitment to send their patient for long-term psychiatric treatment. Judge Goodman's court at Wishard Hospital could serve both purposes. The probate part of the mental health court would handle the civil commitment. The criminal docket of the mental health court could handled the arrest charges.  The criminal charges could be put on diversion, or hold, allowing the patient's release from jail custody. The civil commitment would then become effective and the patient could be sent to a state hospital for treatment. Judge Goodman would schedule periodic hearings to learn of the patient's progress. If warranted, the criminal charges were dismissed, but the patient still had obligations to the civil commitment.

In addition to arranging inpatient treatment, Judge Goodman often put defendants on diversion, or on an outpatient commitment, and ordered them into outpatient treatment. Judge Goodman would have periodic hearings to determine the patient's compliance with the treatment plan. Patients who did not follow the treatment plan faced sanctions, a modification of the plan, or if they were on diversion their original charge could be set for trial.

Judge Goodman's concept and the original mental health court were dissolved in the early 1990s. In 1995, Judge Goodman was reprimanded for nepotism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/indiana/supreme-court/1995/49s00-9406-jd-581-4.html Matter of Goodman], 649 N.E.2d 115 (1995), No. 49S00-9406-JD-581, Supreme Court of Indiana, April 27, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, many of the professional mental health workers who had worked with Judge Goodman sought to re-establish a mental health court in Indianapolis. Representatives of the county's mental health service providers and other stake holders began meeting weekly. The group decided to accept the name of the PAIR Program (PAIR stood for Psychiatric Assertive Identification and Referral).  After, a couple years of lobbying the local authorities in Marion County, Indiana, the mental health court began as a formal program in 1996. Many consider this to be the nation's first mental health court in this second wave of mental health court initiatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since the PAIR Program did not operate with any new funds, there was not much scholarly research and therefore the accomplishments of Judge Goodman and the PAIR Program are frequently overlooked.  The current PAIR Program is a comprehensive pretrial, post-booking diversion system for mentally ill offenders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/FAQs.asp?topic=MenHea&lt;/ref&gt;  A program launched in Broward County, Florida was the first court, to be recognized and published as a specialized mental health court.   Overseen by Judge [[Ginger Lerner-Wren]], the Broward County Mental Health Court was launched in 1997, partially in response to a series of suicides of people with mental illness in the county jail.  The Broward court and three other early mental health courts, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage, AK]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino, CA]], and [[King County, Washington|King County, WA]], were examined in a 2000 [[Bureau of Justice Assistance]] monograph, which was the first major study of this emerging judicial strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/html/bja/mentalhealth/contents.html|title=EMERGING JUDICIAL STRATEGIES FOR THE MENTALLY ILL IN THE CRIMINAL CASELOAD: MENTAL HEALTH COURTS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, SEATTLE, SAN BERNARDINO,AND ANCHORAGE|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the establishment of the Broward County Mental Health Court, other mental health courts began to open in jurisdictions around the U.S., launched by practitioners who believed that standard punishments were ineffective when applied to the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the factors contributing to the development of mental health courts see {{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/rethinkingtherevolvingdoor.pdf |title=Rethinking the Revoling Door: A Look at Mental Illness in the Courts |publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Alaska, for example, the state's first mental health court (established in Anchorage in 1998) was spearheaded by Judge Stephanie Rhoades, who felt probation alone was inadequate. "I started seeing a lot of people in criminal misdemeanors who were cycling through the system and who simply did not understand their probation conditions or what they were doing in jail. I saw police arresting people in order to get them help. I felt there had to be a better solution," she explained in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Document.viewDocument&amp;documentID=722&amp;documentTopicID=25&amp;documentTypeID=8]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mental health courts were also inspired by the movement to develop other problem-solving courts, such as drug courts, domestic violence courts, community courts and parole reentry courts. The overarching motivation behind the development of these courts was rising caseloads and increasing frustration—both among the public and among system players—with the standard approach to case processing and case outcomes in state courts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/p-s%20court%20primer%20PDF3.pdf|title=Problem-Solving Courts: A Brief Primer | publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In February 2001, the first juvenile mental health court opened in [[Santa Clara, California]].

Since 2000, the number of mental health courts has expanded rapidly. There are an estimated 150 courts in the U.S. and dozens more are being planned.&lt;ref&gt;See page vii of {{cite web|url=https://csgjusticecenter.org/courts/publications/improving-responses-to-people-with-mental-illnesses-the-essential-elements-of-a-mental-health-court/ |title=Improving Responses to People with Mental Illnesses: The Essential Elements of a Mental Health Court |publisher=Council of State Governments Justice Center and the Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing survey conducted by several organizations identified more than 120 mental health courts across the country as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentalhealthcourtsurvey.com&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of courts was spurred in large part by the federal Mental Health Courts Program&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/grant/mentalhealth.html&lt;/ref&gt; administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which provided funding to 37 courts in 2002 and 2003.

In England, UK, two pilot mental health courts was launched in 2009 in response to a review of people with mental health problems in the criminal justice system. They were considered a success which met needs that would have otherwise gone unmet; however they required financial support and wider changes to the system, and it is not clear whether they will be more broadly implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/09/17/specialist-mental-health-courts-are-a-good-idea-which-may-never%C2%A0happen/|title=Specialist Mental Health Courts are a good idea which may&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;happen|date=17 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Mental health courts vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but most share a number of characteristics. The Council of State Governments Justice Center has defined the "essential elements"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csgjusticecenter.org/courts/publications/improving-responses-to-people-with-mental-illnesses-the-essential-elements-of-a-mental-health-court/ |title=Improving Responses to People with Mental Illnesses: The Essential Elements of a Mental Health Court |publisher=Council of State Governments Justice Center and the Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; of mental health courts. The CSG Justice Center, in a publication detailing the essential elements, notes that the majority of mental health courts share the following characteristics: 
* A specialized court docket, which employs a problem-solving approach to court processing in lieu of more traditional court procedures for certain defendants with mental illness.
* Judicially supervised, community-based treatment plans for each defendant participating in the court, which a team of court staff and mental health professionals design and implement.
* Regular status hearings at which treatment plans and other conditions are periodically reviewed for appropriateness, incentives are offered to reward adherence to court conditions, and sanctions are imposed on participants who do not adhere to the conditions of participation.
* Criteria defining a participant's completion of (sometimes called graduation from) the program.

==Court process==
Potential participants in a mental health court are usually screened early on in the criminal process, either at the jail or by court staff such as pretrial services officers or social workers in the public defender's office. Most courts have criteria related to what kind of charges, criminal histories, and diagnoses will be accepted. For example, a court may accept only [[defendant]]s charged with misdemeanors, who have no history of violent crimes, and who have an Axis I diagnoses as defined by the [[DSM-IV]].

Defendants who fit the criteria based on the initial screening are usually given a more comprehensive assessment to determine their interest in participating and their community treatment needs. Defendants who agree to participate receive a treatment plan and other community supervision conditions. For those who adhere to their treatment plan for the agreed upon time, usually between six months and two years, their cases are either dismissed or the sentence is greatly reduced.  If the defendant does not comply with the conditions of the court, or decides to leave the program, their case returns to the original criminal calendar where the prosecution proceeds as normal.  As a rule, most mental health courts use a variety of intermediate sanctions in response to noncompliance before ending a defendant's participation. An essential component of mental health court programs for protection of the public is a dynamic risk management process that involves court supervised case management with interactive court review and assessment.

As in other problem-solving courts, the [[judge]] in a mental health court plays a larger role than a judge in a conventional court. Problem-solving courts rely upon the active use of judicial authority to solve problems and to change the behavior of litigants. For instance, in a problem-solving court, the same judge presides at every hearing.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The rationale behind this is not only to ensure that the presiding judge is trained in pertinent concepts, such as mental illness, drug addiction, or domestic violence, but also to foster an ongoing relationship between the judge and participants.&lt;ref&gt;“Instead of passing off cases — to other judges, to probation departments, to community-based treatment programs — judges at problem-solving courts stay involved with each case throughout the post-adjudication process. Drug court judges, for example, closely supervise the performance of offenders in drug treatment, requiring them to return to court frequently for urine testing and courtroom progress reports.” From {{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/p-s%20court%20primer%20PDF3.pdf|title=Problem-Solving Courts: A Brief Primer | publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}. In addition, for a detailed description of the role of the judge in a problem-solving court, see Chapter 4 in {{Cite book|isbn=978-1565849730|title=Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice |publisher=The New Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the judge has final say over a case, mental health courts also take a team approach in which the defense counsel, prosecutor, case managers, treatment professionals, and community supervision personnel (for example, probation) work collaboratively to, for example, craft systems of sanctions and rewards for offenders in drug treatment. Many mental health courts also employ a full-time coordinator who manages the docket and facilitates communication between the different team members.

==Criticisms==
Some have criticized mental health courts for deepening, as opposed to lessening, the involvement of people with mental illness in the [[criminal justice]] system.  They argued that this was particularly true in mental health courts that focus on misdemeanor offenders who would have received short jail sentences or probation if not for the mental health court. These critics urged mental health courts to accept defendants charged with felonies, which many of the more recent courts, such as the Brooklyn Mental Health Court,&lt;ref name="BMHC"/&gt; have started to do.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive analysis of the Brooklyn Mental Health Court, see {{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/buildingtrust.pdf |title=Building Trust and Managing Risk: A Look at a Felony Mental Health Court |publisher=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 11, 587-604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have also raised concerns about the use of mental health courts to coerce people into treatment, the requirement in some courts that defendants enter a guilty plea prior to entering the court, and about infringement on the privacy of treatment information.  Furthermore, many have noted that the rise of mental health courts is, in large part, the result of an underfunded and ineffective community mental health system, and without attention to the deficiencies in community treatment resources, mental health courts can only have a limited impact.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&amp;pageID=660&amp;nodeID=1 for a summary of a roundtable discussion in which statewide coordinators of problem-solving courts noted a lack of resources can undermine the work of a problem-solving court.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, it has been noted that when scarce mental health services are redirected to those who have come in contact with the criminal justice system, it creates a perversion in the system were a person's best bet for obtaining services is to get arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xQf5_1grKcI%3d&amp;tabid=104 |title=The Role of Mental Health Courts in System Reform |publisher=Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Because mental health courts are such a new phenomenon, there is little in the way of outcome data to determine their impact.  Several studies of the Broward County court were released in 2002 and 2003 and found that participation in the court led to a greater connection to services. A 2004 study of the [[Santa Barbara County, California]], Mental Health Court found that participants had reduced criminal activity  during their participation. An evaluation of the Brooklyn Mental Health Court&lt;ref name="BMHC"&gt;[http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=603&amp;currentTopTier2=true]&lt;/ref&gt; documented improvements in several outcome measures, including substance abuse, psychiatric hospitalizations, homelessness and recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/BMHCevaluation.pdf|title=The Brooklyn Mental Health Court Evaluation: Planning, Implementation, Courtroom Dynamics, and Participant Outcomes |publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2011 meta-analysis of literature on the effectiveness of mental health courts in the United States, it was found that mental health courts reduced recidivism by an overall effect size  of −0.54.&lt;ref&gt;Sarteschi, C, Vaughn, M and Kim, K 'Assessing the Effectiveness of Mental Health Courts: A Quantitative Review' (2011) 39 Journal of Criminal Justice 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, an  [[Urban Institute]] evaluation found that participants in two New York City mental health courts were significantly less likely to re-offend than similar offenders whose cases are handled in the traditional court system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban.org/publications/412603.html|title=Criminal Justice Interventions for Offenders With Mental Illness: Evaluation of Mental Health Courts in Bronx and Brooklyn, New York |publisher=Urban Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pancreaticobiliary maljunction''' is a [[congenital malformation]], in which the pancreatic and [[bile duct]]s join anatomically outside the duodenal wall, forming a markedly long common channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19896105 | doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2009.08.024 | volume=7 | title=Pancreaticobiliary maljunction | year=2009 | journal=Clin.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4154">The '''Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme''' (PPRS) is the mechanism used by the [[UK Department of Health]] to ensure that the [[National Health Service|NHS]] has access to good quality branded medicines at reasonable prices. It involves a non-contractual agreement between the UK Department of Health and [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]] (ABPI). The scheme applies to all branded, licensed medicines available on the NHS. The purpose of the scheme is to achieve a balance between reasonable prices for the NHS and a fair return for the [[Pharmaceutical industry in the United Kingdom|pharmaceutical industry]].

The current PPRS scheme, using a [[value-based pricing]] mechanism, came into effect on 1 January 2014, to run for no less than five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pharmaceutical-price-regulation-scheme-2014|title=Pharmaceutical price regulation scheme 2014 - GOV.UK|author=|date=|work=www.gov.uk|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced an earlier scheme running from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health [http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_098498.pdf The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2014 [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] successfully appealed against a decision of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence appraisal committee in respect of [[Kadcyla]] on the basis that it should have considered that under the scheme, the industry had agreed to cap growth in the drugs bill to 0–1.9% a year for the next five years. Roche said this had “fundamentally changed” the nature of how NICE should consider cost effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal finds NICE decision on £90k breast cancer drug 'unfair'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/appeal-finds-nice-decision-on-90k-breast-cancer-drug-unfair/5077722.article#.VLMIdSusUk4|access-date=11 January 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 23rd August 2017, the UK Government launched a [https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/statutory-scheme-to-control-cost-of-branded-medicines-consultation consultation] relating to the PPRS, following legislation that was recently passed.

==Purpose and objectives==
As the primary buyer of medicines in the UK, the Department of Health has an interest in ensuring medicines are available at reasonable prices. However it is also important that pharmaceutical companies, represented by the ABPI, are able to maintain sufficient levels of [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and [[competitiveness]] to enable them to invest in sustained [[research and development]]. The 2009 PPRS agreement outlines its primary objectives as to:
# Deliver value for money
# Encourage innovation
# Promote access and uptake for new medicines
# Provide stability, sustainability and predictability

==Patient access schemes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The 2009 PPRS agreement allows for patient access schemes. These allow for the provision of a drug which would not otherwise be supported by [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] and available on the NHS due to insufficient evidence of its [[cost-effectiveness]]. Patient access schemes can be either financially based or outcome-based. Financially based schemes are where the company does not alter the [[list price]] of the drug but offers discounts or rebates linked to numbers or types of patients treated, response of patients treated, or the number of doses required. Or, alternatively, the company may alter the list price. Outcome-based schemes take place when a company agrees to a later increase in price, or a rebate, once the value of the drug has been proven. Alternatively risk-sharing agreements can be put in place whereby outcomes are measured and price adjustments take place accordingly.

'''Phenazepam''' (also known in [[Russia]] as '''bromdihydrochlorphenylbenzodiazepine''') is a [[benzodiazepine]] drug, which was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int|title=World Health Organization|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and now produced in Russia and some [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries. Phenazepam is used in the treatment of various [[Mental disorder|psychiatric]] and [[neurological disorder]]s. It can be used as a premedication before surgery as it augments the effects of anesthetics and reduces anxiety. Recently, phenazepam has gained popularity as a [[recreational drug]]; misuse has been reported in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Corkery | first1 = J.

==Indications==
* [[Neurosis]], neurosis-like, [[Personality disorder|psychopathic]] (personality disorder), psychopathic-like and other conditions accompanied by fear, anxiety, increased irritability, and [[emotional lability]]
* [[Brief reactive psychosis]] and [[hypochondriasis]]-senestopathic syndrome

Usually, a course of treatment with phenazepam should not normally exceed 2 weeks (in some cases therapy may be prolonged for up to 2 months) due to the risk of drug [[Benzodiazepine misuse|abuse]] and [[Benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]]. To prevent [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]], it is necessary to reduce the dose gradually.&lt;ref name = "PI" /&gt;

==Side effects==
Side effects include [[hiccups]], [[dizziness]], [[ataxia|loss of coordination]] and [[sedation|drowsiness]], along with [[anterograde amnesia]] which can be quite pronounced at high doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Jon|author2=David Golz |author3=Mary Jo Brasher |title=Phenazepam and its effects on driving|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date=January 2013|volume=37|issue=1|pages=25–29|url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/1/25.abstract|accessdate=31 January 2013|doi=10.1093/jat/bks080|pmid=23074215}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other benzodiazepines, in case of abrupt discontinuation following prolonged use, severe withdrawal symptoms may occur including [[Anxiety|restlessness]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[seizure]]s, [[convulsion]]s and [[death]], though because of its long half-life, these withdrawal symptoms may take two or more days to manifest.

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = A.

Phenazepam should not be taken with alcohol or any other CNS depressants. Phenazepam should not be used therapeutically for periods of longer than one month including tapering on and off the drug as recommended for any benzodiazepine in the British national formulary. Some patients may require longer term treatment.

Phenazepam was found to be a component in some herbal incense mixtures in Australia &amp; New Zealand in 2011, namely "Kronic". The particular product variety was withdrawn shortly from the market after and replaced with a new formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Couch | first1 = R. A.

==Synthesis==
{{Rough translation|Russian|Русский|section}}
First, 2-(o-chlorobenzoylamino)-5-bromo-2-chlorobenzophenone is prepared by [[acylation]] of [[4-Bromoaniline|p-bromoaniline]] with o-chlorobenzoic acid [[acyl chloride]] in the presence of a [[zinc chloride]] catalyst. This is hydrolysed with aqueous [[sulfuric acid]] to yield 2-amino-5-bromo-2'-chlorobenzophenone, which is then acylated with [[hydrochloride]] of [[aminoacetic acid]] [[acyl chloride]] in [[chloroform]] to form 2-(aminomethylkarbonylamino)-5-bromo-2-chlorobenzophenone [[hydrochloride]], which is converted to a [[Base (chemistry)|base]] with aqueous [[ammonia]] and then thermally [[Cyclic compound|cyclized]] to bromodihydrochlorophenylbenzodiazepine (phenazepam).

This method of Phenazepam synthesis was developed in the 1970s at the Physico-Chemical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name="Glushkov-Yakhontov"/&gt;

==Detection in biological fluids==
Phenazepam may be measured in blood or plasma by chromatographic methods. Blood phenazepam concentrations are typically less than 30 μg/L during therapeutic usage, but have frequently been in the 100–600 μg/L range in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedicalpublications.com/phenazepam.pdf R.

==Legal status==

===China===
As of October 2015, phenazepam is a controlled substance in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Under federal United States law, phenazepam is not currently classified as a controlled substance, as the [[Federal Analog Act]] only provides for automatic assumed classification of chemicals "substantially similar" to existing Schedule I or Schedule II drugs, whereas all controlled benzodiazepines under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] are classified as Schedule IV. Although phenazepam is currently not controlled, sale for human use remains illegal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/CriminalInvestigations/ucm323965.htm | date = October 10, 2012 | title = New York Nurse Sentenced for Selling Unapproved "Party Drug" Phenazepam on the Internet | quote = sale for human consumption is prohibited in the United States except for research under strictly regulated terms | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppliers attempt to circumvent this regulation by placing a "Not for human use" disclaimer on the product's label.

Individual states in the United States often ban these analog drugs by name as they appear. Since 2012, [[Louisiana]] has classified phenazepam as a controlled dangerous substance.&lt;ref name="Louisiana Phenazepam Ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ksla.com/story/18578228/bill-to-ban-zannie-passes | title = Bill to Ban Zannie Passes | accessdate = 2012-05-21 | date = 2012-05-21 | publisher = KSLA 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban affects several products, some of which were sold at retail stores under the guise of [[air freshener]] or similar, containing phenazepam yet claiming not to be for human use. This legislation was introduced after one such product, branded as "Zannie" and marketed as an air freshener rapidly gained publicity as the subject of numerous media reports, attracting the attention of officials.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The ensuing investigation effort, led by Senator Fred Mills and Louisiana Poison Center Director Mark Ryan, positively identified the active ingredient of "Zannie" as phenazepam. According to Ryan, [[chemical analysis]] identified the active ingredient as "100 percent phenazepam".&lt;ref name="Louisiana Phenazepam Ban"/&gt;

Paul Halverson, director and state health officer for the Arkansas Department of Health, approved an emergency rule to ban the sale and distribution of phenazepam shortly after the Louisiana ban.

===United Kingdom===
Phenazepam is a class C drug in the UK.&lt;ref name="frank"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/phenazepam | title = PHENAZEPAM | accessdate = 2013-02-11 | publisher = Talk To Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK home office banned importation of phenazepam on Friday 22 July 2011&lt;ref name="import"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/drug-law/phenazepam/ | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120412094313/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/drug-law/phenazepam/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-04-12 | title = Phenazepam / Home Office | accessdate = 2013-02-11 | date = 2012-04-12 | publisher = UK Home Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it drafted legislation, released in January 2012&lt;ref name="draft legislation"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There was a new discussion about its fate on April 23, 2012, where it was decided that the bill would be rewritten and phenazepam would still be banned.&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;
{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmgeneral/deleg1/120423/120423s01.htm | title = Draft Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2012 | accessdate = 2012-05-04 | date = 2012-04-23 | publisher = UK Home Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was eventually banned on June 13, 2012 as a class C, schedule II drug.&lt;ref name="control 2dpmp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2012/014-2012/ | title = A Change to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971: control of pipradrol-related compounds and phenazepam | accessdate = 2012-07-30 | date = 7 Jun 2012 | publisher = UK Home Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewhere===
Phenazepam was classified as a narcotic in Finland in July, 2014.&lt;ref name="finlandscheduling"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2014/20140589 |title=Valtioneuvoston asetus huumausaineina pidettävistä aineista, valmisteista ja kasveista annetun valtioneuvoston asetuksen liitteen IV muuttamisesta
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenazepam is considered a narcotic in Norway, as per a March 23, 2010 Health Department addition to the Regular Narcotic List.

In Russia, while the drug is considered a prescription medication (but not a controlled one, as all other benzodiazepines except [[tofisopam]]), some pharmacies sell it without prescriptions required.

In Estonia, phenazepam is a Schedule IV substance under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Schedule IV is the lowest classification of psychoactive substances in Estonia. It includes prescribable drugs, including other benzodiazepines.

===UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs===
On 8 March 2016 at its 59th Session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) added Phenazepam to relevant schedules of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2016/March/seven-substances-scheduled-at-the-59th-session-of-the-commission-on-narcotic-drugs.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Photosensitivity]]''' is an abnormal skin reaction to direct sunlight exposure. It is unrelated to a [[sunburn]]. These reactions are due to photosensitization, the accumulation of photosensitive compounds beneath the skin. In some cases, the [[photodynamic]] substances come from ingested plants or drugs, after being metabolized or not. In other cases, the photodynamic substances may be produced in the body itself due to inborn errors in [[pigment metabolism]], especially those involving the [[heme]] synthesis. Photosensitivity reactions are usually seen in herbivorous or omnivorous animals, though such reactions are not uncommon among carnivores.

==Effects of photosensitivity==
Photosensitivity reactions are characterized by severe [[inflammation]] of the skin with depigmentation and ulceration. In some cases (Type I), pigments are excreted through urine or deposited in hard tissues such as bones and teeth, causing discolouration. Affected animals should be protected from direct sunlight until the photodynamic compounds have been completely eliminated from the body or the appropriate treatments have been given.

==Biological mechanism of photosensitivity reactions==
Photodynamic compounds are activated by sunlight, which excites them to a higher energy state. They immediately release the excess energy and transfer it to the surrounding acceptor molecules, such as enzymes or free radicals. These molecules are thus activated and cause the skin reaction.

==Classification of photosensitivity reactions==
Photosensitivity reactions are classified by origin into four types:  Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV.

===Type I Photosensitivity===
Type I Photosensitivity occurs when the photodynamic compounds need not undergo metabolism to be activated and so may accumulate under the skin directly following ingestion. Examples of plants producing Type I Photosensitivity include [[biserrula]] (''Biserrula pelecinus'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | author1=Jane C. Quinn | author2=Yuchi Chen | author3=Belinda Hackney | author4=Muhammad Shoaib Tufail | author5=Leslie A. Weston | author6=Panayiotis Loukopoulos | title = Acute-onset high-morbidity primary photosensitisation in sheep associated with consumption of the Casbah and Mauro cultivars of the pasture legume biserrula | work = BMC Veterinary Research | year = 2018 | doi= 10.1186/s12917-017-1318-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; , [[Buckwheat]] and [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] (''Hypericum perforatum''). Certain drugs such as [[phenothiazine]] or its derivatives may also lead to photosensitivity reactions, commonly in sheep. Phenothiazine is converted by the body into the photodynamic compound phenothiazine sulfoxide.

===Type II Photosensitivity===
Type II Photosensitivity is caused by inborn errors in the metabolism of certain biological pigments. In the absence of some key metabolic enzymes, the products of intermediary metabolism accumulate. They are either eliminated through the urine and body fluids or are deposited in some body tissue, such as bone and teeth. A common condition seen in animals is [[congenital porphyria]] due to the accumulation of [[Uroporphyrin]], which is deposited in the teeth and bones, giving them a pink discolouration, or excreted through the urine, exhibiting a pinkish [[fluorescence]] under ultraviolet light.

===Type III Photosensitivity===
Type III (aka hepatic photosensitivity) is the most common type of photosensitivity reaction seen in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Photosensitization: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/72900.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this type, the photodynamic substance is [[phylloerythrin]], a derivative of chlorophyll produced in the body.  Normally, phylloerythrin is secreted into the intestine by the biliary system and excreted through the feces.  In Type III Photosensitivity, damage to the [[biliary transport mechanism]] prevents the excretion of phylloerythrin, allowing the photodynamic substance to enter the circulatory system and accumulate under the skin.  This condition is exacerbated by the presence of hepatic parasites.

===Type IV Photosensitivity===
Type IV Photosensitivity occurs following the ingestion of certain plants, such as [[alfalfa]]. The reason is obscure or idiopathic.

==Treatment==
Affected animals should be transferred to shade. To overcome shock, [[corticosteroid]] therapy and fluid infusions may be tried. [[Antihistamines]] are also useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">'''Plasma Economy''' ({{zh|c=血浆经济}}) was a 1991-1995 [[plasmapheresis]] campaign by the [[Henan]] provincial government in [[China]], in which [[blood plasma]] were extracted in exchange for money. The campaign attracted 3 million donors of mostly rural Chinese, and it is estimated at least 40% of the blood donors subsequently contracted [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="SingTao"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5009fd442433b459f7b6ab09fe890e4a|title=Blood Plasma Economy Accelerates AIDS Crisis in China|last=Kam Tsang|date=Aug 1, 2003|publisher=Sing Tao Daily|accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plasma Economy campaign boomed due to demand by biotech companies, and became a lucrative source of income for middlemen. The campaign had low health and safety standards, and lacked proper sterilization procedures; needles, blood bags, and other equipment in contact with blood were often recycled and reused. It is estimated that by 2003, over 1.2 million people had contracted AIDS in Henan Province alone.&lt;ref name="SingTao"/&gt;

==History==
''[[Caijing]]'' noted that China's [[blood donation]] system is largely monetarily driven, and while attempts had been made in the 1980s to move to a voluntary system, they were mostly unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Caijing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.caijing.com.cn/2005-05-02/100013788.html|title=China's Plasma Economy|last=Lei Yongjian|date=May 2, 2005|publisher=Caijing|accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, China restricted the import of blood products, while called for local investment by foreign pharmaceutical companies, especially to the province of [[Henan]], where numerous plasmapheresis stations were built. The selling of blood plasma were seen by locals as a method to reduce poverty.

In [[plasmapheresis]], blood plasma is taken from donors, while the remaining blood constituents such as [[red blood cell]]s are returned to the donor. The blood plasma is then sold to pharmaceutical companies to produce blood-based products. As a cost-cutting measure, some stations mixed several bloods in the same centrifuge, resulting in large-scale blood contamination.&lt;ref name="Caijing"/&gt; As a result, by 1995, such stations were shut down in Henan province, while blood collection was restricted by area, although demand for blood plasma still remained strong.

The impact of the Plasma Economy campaign had a long-lasting effect. It is estimated that by 1999, the Caixian County in Henan had 43% of its blood donors being infected with AIDS,&lt;ref name="Caijing"/&gt; while in the village of Wenlou, over 65% of its residents had contracted HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1359670.stm|title=Bad blood spreads Aids in China|last=Adam Brookes|date= 30 May 2001|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons''' ('''PAHs''', also '''''polyaromatic hydrocarbons''' or '''polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons'''''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) are [[hydrocarbon]]s—[[organic compound]]s containing only carbon and hydrogen—that are composed of multiple [[aromatic ring]]s (organic rings in which the [[electron]]s are [[delocalization|delocalized]]). The simplest such chemicals are [[naphthalene]], having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds [[anthracene]] and [[phenanthrene]].

PAHs are uncharged, non-polar molecules found in [[coal]] and in [[tar]] deposits.  They are also produced by the thermal decomposition of [[organic matter]] (for example, in engines and incinerators or when biomass burns in [[forest fires]]).

PAHs are abundant in the [[universe]], and have recently been found to have formed possibly as early as the first couple of billion years after the [[Big Bang]], in association with formation of [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanet]]s. Some studies suggest that PAHs account for a significant percentage of all [[carbon]] in the [[universe]].

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed as possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for [[abiotic]] syntheses of [[material]]s required by the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|earliest forms of life]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Physicochemical properties and bonding===
PAHs are [[Chemical polarity#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]] and [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]]. Larger PAHs are generally [[solubility|insoluble]] in water, although some smaller PAHs are soluble and known contaminants in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Xinliang |last1=Feng |first2=Wojciech |last2=Pisula |first3=Klaus |last3=Müllen |title=Large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Synthesis and discotic organization |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |date=2009 |volume=81 |issue=2 |page=2203–2224 |doi=10.1351/PAC-CON-09-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Guidelines for drinking-water quality |edition=2nd |chapter=Addendum to Vol. 2. Health criteria and other supporting information |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger members are also poorly soluble in [[organic solvent]]s and in [[lipid]]s. They are usually colorless.

The [[aromaticity]] varies for PAHs. According to '''Clar's rule''',&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Clar | first = E. | date = 1964 | title = Polycyclic Hydrocarbons | location = New York, NY | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | lccn = 63012392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[resonance structure]] of a PAH that has the largest number of disjoint aromatic [[pi bond|pi sextets]]—i.e. [[benzene]]-like moieties—is the most important for the characterization of the properties of that PAH.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Portella | first1 = G. | last2 = Poater | first2 = J. | last3 = Solà | first3 = M. | title = Assessment of Clar's aromatic π-sextet rule by means of PDI, NICS and HOMA indicators of local aromaticity | journal = Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry | date = 2005 | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 785–791 | doi = 10.1002/poc.938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

For example, in [[phenanthrene]] one Clar structure has two sextets—the first and third rings—while the other resonance structure has just one central sextet; therefore in this molecule the outer rings have greater aromatic character whereas the central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In contrast, in [[anthracene]] the resonance structures have one sextet each, which can be at any of the three rings, and the aromaticity spreads out more evenly across the whole molecule.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This difference in number of sextets is reflected{{clarify|date=January 2014}} in the differing [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet–visible spectra]] of these two isomers; the highest-wavelength absorbance of phenanthrene is at 293&amp;nbsp;nm, while anthracene is at 374&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The ultraviolet spectra of aromatic hydrocarbons: Predicting substitution and isomerism changes |first= Philip E. |last= Stevenson |journal= Journal of Chemical Education |year= 1964 |volume= 41 |issue= 5 |pages= 234–239 |doi= 10.1021/ed041p234 |bibcode= 1964JChEd..41..234S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Clar structures with two sextets each are present in the four-ring [[chrysene]] structure: one having sextets in the first and third rings, one in the second and fourth rings, and one in the first and fourth rings.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Superposition of these structures reveals that the aromaticity in the outer rings is greater (each has a sextet in two of the three Clar structures) compared to the inner rings (each has a sextet in only one of the three).

Enzymes in the [[cytochrome]] family ([[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP1B1]]) metabolize PAHs to diol epoxides.&lt;ref name=Nebert2004&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R400004200| issn = 1083-351X| volume = 279| issue = 23| pages = 23847–23850| last1 = Nebert| first1 = D.

Low molecular weight PAHs, with two to four aromatic hydrocarbon rings, are more potent as [[co-carcinogen]]s during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation in a key gene related to cell replication) is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate.&lt;ref name=Ramesh2004 &gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10915810490517063| issn = 1092-874X| volume = 23| issue = 5| pages = 301–333| last1 = Ramesh| first1 = A.| last2 = Walker| first2 = S.

Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate. These PAHs do not need to be enzymatically metabolized first. Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Adult exposure to PAHs has been linked to [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/03602530600632063| pmid = 16877260| issn = 0360-2532| volume = 38| issue = 3| pages = 411–450| last1 = Korashy| first1 = H.

This enzyme then metabolically processes the PAHs to quinone metabolites that bind to DNA in reactive adducts that remove purine bases. The resulting mutations may contribute to unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells or to their migration to the inside of the artery, which are steps in [[atheroma|plaque]] formation.&lt;ref name=Lewtas2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramos2005 /&gt; These quinone metabolites also generate [[reactive oxygen species]] that may alter the activity of genes that affect plaque formation.&lt;ref name=Ramos2005 /&gt;

==Detection and optical properties==
A spectral database exists&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221" /&gt; for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/|title=NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database|website=www.astrochem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of PAHs in materials is often done using [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] or [[liquid chromatography]] with [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-visible]] or [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]] spectroscopic methods or by using rapid test PAH indicator strips.

PAHs possess very characteristic [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV absorbance spectra]]. These often possess many absorbance bands and are unique for each ring structure. Thus, for a set of [[isomer]]s, each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also [[fluorescent]], emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting [[semiconductor|semi-conducting]] and other behaviors.

NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] includes instruments for obtaining both images and spectra of light emitted by PAHs associated with [[star formation]]. These images can trace the surface of star-forming [[molecular cloud|clouds]] in our own galaxy or identify star forming galaxies in the distant universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.spitzer.caltech.edu/features/articles/20050627.shtml|title=Understanding Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons|date= 2005-06-27|author=Robert Hurt|website=Spitzer Space Telescope|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, PAHs were detected in the [[upper atmosphere]] of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest [[moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="IAA-20130606"&gt;{{cite news|last=López Puertas |first=Manuel |url= http://www.iaa.es/content/pahs-titans-upper-atmosphere |title=PAHs in Titan's Upper Atmosphere |date= 2013-06-06 |work=[[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] |accessdate= 2013-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, researchers reported low-temperature chemical pathways from simple [[organic compound]]s to complex PAHs. Such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of PAHs in the low-temperature atmosphere of [[Saturn]]{{'s}} moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and may be significant pathways, in terms of the [[PAH world hypothesis]], in producing presursors to biochemcals related to life as we know it.&lt;ref name="DG-20181008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=“A Prebiotic Earth” – Missing Link Found on Saturn’s Moon Titan |url=https://dailygalaxy.com/2018/10/a-prebiotic-earth-missing-link-found-on-saturns-moon-titan/ |date=11 October 2018 |work=DailyGalaxy.com |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NA-20181008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao, Long et al. |title=Low-temperature formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Titan’s atmosphere |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-018-0585-y |date=8 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Astronomy]] |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12244">'''Pregnancy school''' is a type of school in the United States exclusively for pregnant girls. [[New York City]], among other cities and states, opened a series of these schools in the 1960s and moved pregnant girls out of their regular high schools into these special schools. As of May 2007, the city is planning on shutting these schools down due to a history of low test scores and poor attendance.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/education/24educ.html|title=New York’s Schools for Pregnant Girls Will Close|first=Julie|last=Bosman|date=24 May 2007|website=NYTimes.com|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy schools also exist in places such as [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Florida]], although attendance has been declining in all of them.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Rationale==
Many educators who have become founders of these schools see many factors that point toward a demand for pregnancy schools in America. Fans of literature can note some of society's harshest feelings preserved in ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and that book is dated from 1850. What motivates the various personalities who go on to create these schools is that they believe not much has changed since Hawthorne's time when one considers the harassment and gossip a pregnant teen may have to endure in a modern high school. In addition, with the every day burdens of being pregnant such as morning sickness and weekly pre natal appointments, people who are sympathetic to these young women want to help using resources available to them.

==General characteristics==
The biggest help all of these schools have to offer is their daycare centers where students may drop their babies off while they attend class. However, many schools provide a variety of other health services depending on outside funding they may receive, These services may include, but are not limited to: prenatal and postnatal care and management, preconception services for prevention of pregnancy and diseases, parenting education and counseling, HIV screening and counseling; also depending on the availability of appropriate facilities and doctors, baby-child examinations, immunizations, also management and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copecenternorth.dadeschools.net/about.html|title=About us|first=Simone|last=Maranzana|website=Copecenternorth.dadeschools.net|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
The New York public school system is trying to incorporate programs for pregnant teens inside their existing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-york.educationbug.org/public-schools/high/65163-pregnant-teens-school.html|title=Pregnant Teens School - New York, New York|website=New-york.educationbug.org|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest remaining schools, were founded nearly 30 years ago, such as the Martha Nielsen School in the Bronx and there may still be a demand as the CDC reports "there are nine times as many teen mothers in America than in other developed countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57411981-10391704/u.s-teen-pregnancy-rates-at-an-all-time-low-across-all-ethnicities/|title=U.S. teen pregnancy rates at an all-time low across all ethnicities|website=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although other reports have concluded that, at least in the state of New York, the schools should be shut down with the student population dwindling to its most recent enrollment of 323 students from 1,500 in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; New York has struggled to find support and funding for these schools in addition to qualified educators to teach the required material for the students to truly earn their [[G.E.D.]] With activities like quilt sewing as a substitute for learning geometry, Cami Anderson, the superintendent whose district includes the Program for Pregnant Students acknowledges, “It’s a separate but unequal program.”&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Despite the separate schools being shut down, the Program for Pregnant Students still tries to offer women of the public school system contraceptives and academic help within the system that remains.

===Chicago===
Simpson Academy is a school in Chicago where women can transfer out of their public high schools and into a "constantly motivating" environment. As of 2011 there were 300 girls who are pregnant or parenting in grades 6 through 12 and in the past year, the academy has maintained s steady enrollment status. The main focus of this school seems to be moral support. Instead of feeling isolated, the pregnant students depend on each other for affirmation and motivation. This community based environment helps the Simpson Academy stay effective in student attendance and large graduating classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-15/news/ct-x-pregnant-simpson-graduation-20110615_1_black-teens-pregnant-students-adolescent-health |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108112140/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-15/news/ct-x-pregnant-simpson-graduation-20110615_1_black-teens-pregnant-students-adolescent-health |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles===
The City of Angels follows a similar structure to the New York school district in that there are alternative schools within the existing school district that cater to the student's needs. Pregnant minor schools consist of small campuses located throughout the District. Their primary goal is to provide interim educational opportunities to expectant mothers so that they may continue their education and be graduated. Schools provide counseling by school nurses, information on health and nutrition, and pre-natal and infant care instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notebook.lausd.net/portal/page?_pageid=33,255549&amp;_dad=ptl&amp;_schema=PTL_EP|title=Los Angeles Unified School District|website=notebook.lausd.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other companies reaching out to the school system for added support and making more resources available to the district, like Student Health and Human Services. In 1994, The Teen Parent Program began providing advocacy, support services, and resource and referral information to assist pregnant and parenting students within the Los Angeles Unified School District. The program is a partnership between Student Health and Human Services (SHHS) and the [[Educational Equity Compliance Office]] (EECO) providing technical assistance to school and community agencies that work with teen parents. The partnership serves to assist the District in protecting the educational and civil rights of pregnant students and teen parents under federal Title IX and California law. Their website reads, "It is our goal to ensure equal access to the quality educational programs and support services that are critical to removing barriers to school success for young parents and their children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090108234231/http://www.lausd.net/lausd/offices/eec/parenting.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
Florida appears to be the state with the most private schools which are exclusive only to pregnant teen. St. Gerard Campus in St. Augustine, Florida is a specific school whose staff works extra hard for their students by providing counseling, baby supplies, and connections with adoption agencies. But St. Gerard does not stop at academics and health care, campus also serves as a non-profit maternity home for the pregnant teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stgerardcampus.org/Contact.html|title=St Gerard Campus — Contact Us|website=Stgerardcampus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique residential program where mothers can live on campus with their child is helpful to mothers who struggle to find day care and is likely accomplished with private funding and donations that many other organizations who struggle going through the public school system, may never receive.

==Controversy==
As of 2010, Parenthood is the leading cause of teen girl dropout rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unpublished tabulations by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002/2004, The National Center for Educational Statistics: Washington, DC|accessdate=March 1, 2010|url=http://nces.ed.gov/edat/|website=Nces.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a statistic like that, educators needed to find a remedy to help young women work for high school diplomas, while still being prepared for parenthood. Also the necessity for these women to be educated bears more weight than one would think. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy stresses that children of uneducated parents are more likely to drop out of school themselves. “The relationship between education and teen pregnancy works both ways. That is, teen pregnancy often has a negative impact on education...” However they continue to argue that the problem is self healing. If these women can stay on the educational track they would consequently have more success, despite their first unplanned pregnancy, “It is also the case that school achievement, attendance, and involvement helps reduce the risk of teen pregnancy. Put another way, staying in school and getting an education helps prevent teen pregnancy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/why-it-matters/pdf/education.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903222701/http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/why-it-matters/pdf/education.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; With rising teen pregnancy rates, some institutions have taken action in other ways like this Louisiana Charter school who mandated pregnancy tests for all their female students before resuming school in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48554183/ns/today-back_to_school/t/schools-policy-requires-girls-take-pregnancy-tests/#.UGh9YM0TVPJ|title=School's policy requires girls to take pregnancy tests|first=Lisa|last=Flam|website=Today.msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Delhi Charter School was made to drop its classroom ban on pregnant students and the ability to mandate pregnancy tests for students suspected of being pregnant on the grounds that the tests were an invasion of privacy. The schools are overwhelmed with the problem and are trying to find solutions for handling these situations. However researchers caution schools about how to handle pregnant students because according to the ACLU, 70 percent of teen moms leave school, in part because of illegal discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org|title=American Civil Liberties Union|website=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strong minority of people have taken action by developing these pregnancy schools. Arguing that what these teen mom's need is not fear and rejection from the school system, but support and a safe environment to learn in that caters to their unique situation that is slowly becoming more common. Cope Center North, a school in Miami, FL uses this quote by Maya Angelou to explain, "You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise." This school is not only an educational program, but a fully functioning medical center for pregnant teens so they can stay in school and still make appointments for the pre and post natal care they need while having the ability to maintain perfect attendance in all their classes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Programs==
In addition to the programs mentioned above, there are research-based programs of social emotional intelligence and emotional regulation designed explicitly for teen parents, such as the non-profit Lionheart Foundation's POWER SOURCE PARENTING: Growing Up Strong and Raising Healthy Kids.

'''Public Health England''' ('''PHE''') is an [[executive agency]] of the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that began operating on 1 April 2013. Its formation came as a result of reorganisation of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) in [[England]] outlined in the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]]. It took on the role of the [[Health Protection Agency]], the [[National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse]] and a number of other health bodies.&lt;ref name=structurePHE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Structure%20of%20Public%20Health%20England.pdf |title=Structure of Public Health England |publisher=Department of Health |accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and resources==
PHE's mission is "to protect and improve the nation’s health and to address inequalities". It employs 5,000 staff (full-time equivalent), who are mostly scientists, researchers and public health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Public Health England|title=About|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england/about|accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It announced plans to move its headquarters and 2,750 staff to [[Harlow]] on a former GlaxoSmithKline site in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Health England closer to moving to Essex|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20203460.article|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Initially, aside from back office functions such as personnel and finance or management functions such as strategy and programme management, PHE has the following divisions:
*Health protection:
**Chemical, [[radiation poisoning|radiative]], and environmental hazards
***Research
***National poisons database

**Health promotion (such as healthy diet or anti-smoking marketing)
**Health screening programmes (such as cancer screening, [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] checks, cardiovascular disease screening, etc.)
**[[Health equity|Reducing health inequalities]]
**Specialist healthcare commissioning (in relation to major incidents, etc.)
**National Cancer Intelligence Network (and other networks)
*Knowledge and Information
**Substance misuse treatment monitoring
**Disease registration
**Research and development
*Operations:
**Microbiology unit
***Microbe production
***Research
***References
***Specialist services

***Preparation and response against major incidents
***Local centres (several centres per regional unit, except London)
****Local health protection
****Substance misuse treatment services (over more than one centre)
****Local specialist commissioning (in relation to major incidents, etc.) and advice

[[Duncan Selbie]] is the Chief Executive.

==Campaigns==
PHE took over the responsibility for Be Clear on Cancer campaigns after it was created in the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRUK Be Clear on Cancer|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/spotcancerearly/naedi/beclearoncancer/beclearoncancer|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns have been run on Lung Cancer, Bowel Cancer, Oesophago-gastric and Kidney &amp; Bladder Cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Choices|url=http://www.nhs.uk/be-clear-on-cancer/|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHE is also responsible for Change4Life and ACT FAST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHE Campaigns|url=http://campaigns.dh.gov.uk/category/beclearoncancer/|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 it launched a new campaign  against smoking called Smokefree Health Harms on television and billboards across England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Powerful anti-smoking campaign launched to show cyanide and arsenic damage|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/29/powerful-anti-smoking-campaign-launched-to-show-cyanide-and-arsenic-damage-4244319/|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=Metro|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and other published comment==
Public Health England has been criticised for its underweighting of mental health within its overall  resourcing and agenda; in 2011 the Royal College of Psychiatrists stated its concern that there appeared to be "few, or no, commitments or resources within either the Department of Health or Public Health England to take the public mental health agenda forward."&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmhealth/1048/1048vw45.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency was criticised by Professor [[Martin McKee]], in January 2014, who said that continuing health inequalities among London boroughs was a scandal and claimed coalition reforms had left it unclear who was supposed to analyse health data and tackle the problems highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top 10 causes of death in London boroughs highlight health inequalities |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/08/top-10-causes-death-london-health-inequalities |accessdate=8 January 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency was criticised by [[The Lancet|Lancet]] for allegedly using weak evidence in a review of [[electronic cigarettes]] to endorse an estimate that e-cigarette use is 95% less hazardous than smoking. Lancet wrote "it is on this extraordinarily flimsy foundation that PHE based the major conclusion and message of its report". Lancet found this "raises serious questions not only about the conclusions of the PHE report, but also about the quality of the agency's peer review process."&lt;ref name="Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal |title=E-cigarettes: Public Health England's evidence-based confusion |url=http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2900042-2/fulltext |journal=Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9996 |year=2015 |pages=829 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00042-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of the PHE report subsequently published a document clarifying that their endorsement of the 95% claim did not stand on the single study criticised in the Lancet, but on their broad review of toxicological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underpinning evidence for the estimate that e-cigarette use is around 95% safer than smoking: authors’ note|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/456704/McNeill-Hajek_report_authors_note_on_evidence_for_95_estimate.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency has also been criticised for "serious questions about transparency and conflicts of interest" regarding this review, that PHE's response "did not even begin to address the various relationships and funding connections" in question, and that this "adds to questions about the credibility of the organisation’s advice".&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gornall, Jonathan |title = Public Health England’s troubled trail|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5826|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=351|issue=1136|year=2015|pages=5826 |doi=10.1136/bmj.h5826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The integrity of Public Health England was recently thrown into question when a question in the [[House of Lords]] revealed that a position underpinning UK Government policy, namely "that well run and regulated modern municipal waste incinerators are not a significant risk to public health remains valid" was asserted in advance of the results having been obtained from a study commissioned by Public Health England to answer the question whether municipal waste incinerators did, in fact, constitute a significant risk to public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Countess of Mar|title=Incinerators: Health Hazards (HL3533).

The '''Qwensel House''' is the oldest wooden house in [[Turku]], [[Finland]]. It is [[bourgeois]] housing from the [[Autarky|autarchic]] times that has survived in its entirety. The house was built approximately in the year 1700 in an area that was reserved for the nobility in the city plan made up by [[Peter Brahe]] in 1652. Today, the Qwensel House operates as the Turku Pharmacy Museum and [[café]].

==Pharmacy Museum==
The shop wing of the building was furnished with a [[pharmacy]] in the 19th century. The pharmacy has a material room and a herb room, two laboratories and an office. The office has the oldest survived pharmacy interior in Finland.

The exhibition wing of the building has [[Åke Lydman]]'s collection of pharmacy utensils on display. There is also a pharmaceutical research laboratory and pharmacy history exhibition in the wing. In addition to the main exhibitions, there are also varying smaller exhibitions and programmes held at the museum every year.

The use of pharmaceutical herbs can be studied with the lead of an "[[apothecary]]" at the Children's Pharmacy, the courtyard and outdoors. The authentic pharmacy cabinet is from the Uusikaarlepyy Pharmacy.

The former [[stable]], toilet and [[barn]] are located at the northern end of the Pakaritupa wing of the building. The Pipping family used to have a garden with [[apple trees]] and plants along Linnankatu (formerly Kuningattarenkatu).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turku.fi/Public/?contentid=9062&amp;nodeid=4561&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Santiago José Celis''' (1782 in [[Ahuachapán]] - [[April 16]] [[1814]] in [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]]) was a [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] [[physician]] who participated in the [[1811 Independence Movement]].

==Biography==
Celis was born into a [[Creole peoples|Creole family]]. At a young age he moved to the Guatemalan capital to receive the best possible education of the time. In 1794 he enrolled at the Tridentino School. On the 16 of August 1800 he received the rank of Bachelor of Medicine at the [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]] from which he received his master's degree, finally graduating on 11-12 August 1802. His master's degree was partly achieved by his essays and new ideas for the treatment and evolution of gangrenous inflammations. He married Ana Andrade Canes, a relative of [[Jose Simeón Canes]].

As a doctor he promoted the [[vaccination]] against [[smallpox]] in San Salvador. As a Creole he was aligned to the cause of the Independence of Central America from the colonial powers and joined the independence movement which reached a high on November 5, 1811 in the capital of San Salvador. Celis, active in the revolutionary movement against the Spanish domination, joined a further uprising on 24 January 1814. Two days later, Celis was captured and jailed in Fijo jail in San Salvador. He was incarcerated for almost three months but due to torture he received in prison, he died on 16 April 1814.

[[File:SaulMerin1.jpg|thumbnail|Saul Merin (Jerusalem, 2004)]]
'''Saul Cvi Merin''' ({{lang-he|שאול מרין}}; August 25, 1933 – August 28, 2012) was an Israeli [[ophthalmologist]] specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of [[Retinal diseases|retinal]] and  [[Genetic disease|genetic]] [[eye diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohneyehospital.org/saul-merin-friend-hospital-group-passes-away-jerusalem |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102111215/http://www.stjohneyehospital.org/saul-merin-friend-hospital-group-passes-away-jerusalem|archivedate=2 January 2013|title=Saul Merin, Friend to the Hospital Group, Passes Away in Jerusalem |publisher=St John Eye Hospital |date=1943-08-03 |accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''Inherited Eye Diseases'' is now in its second edition.

As Professor of Ophthalmology at Israel's [[Hadassah Hospital]], Merin worked at the [[St John Eye Hospital Group]]'s East Jerusalem hospital, where he worked with ophthalmologists working in the area of the [[Palestinian National Authority]].

While based primarily in Israel, worked for 25 years with [[The University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary]], where was a [[visiting professor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/com/eye/Department/Publications/Annual%20Reports/AR2004/AR04%20alumni.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218212919/http://www.uic.edu/com/eye/Department/Publications/Annual%20Reports/AR2004/AR04%20alumni.pdf|archivedate=18 February 2012|work=Alumni &amp; Friends|title=Saul D. Merin, MD|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
Merin escaped [[deportation]] by train to [[Auschwitz]] on August 3, 1943, and was hidden by Aniela (Zawadzka) Szwajce in [[Będzin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4832513 About Zawadzka] at the Righteous Among the Nations Database, [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt; a town in southwest [[Poland]], until arrival of the Soviet army in January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/magazine/magazine_new/mag_36/Prayer.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080906090725/http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/magazine/magazine_new/mag_36/Prayer.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-09-06|title=No Prayer, No Breakfast|author=Mordechai Paldiel|work=Yad Vashem magazine|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Israel in 1949.

==Career==
He studied at the Medical School of [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem from 1953-1960. Following conscription into Army Service in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] from 1961-1963, he
trained in ophthalmology at [[Hadassah Medical Center]] under Professor I.C. Michaelson from 1963-1969, and was made a specialist in ophthalmology in 1969.

He worked in [[Malawi]] from 1965-1967, and made several professional tours in Africa.

He was awarded fellowships{{which|date=December 2014}} and had additional training at the [[Hospital for Sick Children]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in [[pediatric ophthalmology]], and at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[Illinois]], USA for further medical study of the [[retina]].

He was Professor of Ophthalmology at Hebrew University from 1979 until his death. He was Chairman of the [[Israel Ophthalmological Society]] from 1976-1982, Chairman of the [[Israel Society for Vision and Eye Research]] from 1985-1995, Chairman of the [[Israel Board of Ophthalmology]], from 1989-1995, and Chairman of the Unit of Ophthalmology, at Hadassah Hospital on [[Mount Scopus]] from 1979-1998.

Prof. Merin died in August 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10175">Many types of '''sense loss''' occur due to a dysfunctional sensation process, whether it be ineffective [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], [[nerve damage]], or cerebral impairment. Unlike [[agnosia]], these impairments are due to damages prior to the [[perception]] process.

==Vision loss==
{{Main|Vision loss}}

Degrees of vision loss vary dramatically, although the [[ICD-9]] released in 1979 categorized them into three tiers: [[normal vision]], [[low vision]], and [[blindness]].  Two significant causes of vision loss due to sensory failures include media opacity and [[optic nerve]] diseases, although [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[retinal disease]] can also lead to blindness.  Most causes of vision loss can cause varying degrees of damage, from total blindness to a negligible effect. Media opacity occurs in the presence of [[opacity (optics)|opacities]] in the eye tissues or fluid, distorting and/or blocking the [[image]] prior to contact with the [[photoreceptor cells]].  Vision loss often results despite correctly functioning retinal receptors. Optic nerve diseases such as [[optic neuritis]] or [[retrobulbar neuritis]] lead to dysfunction in the afferent nerve pathway once the signal has been correctly transmitted from retinal photoreceptors.

Partial or total vision loss may affect every single area of a person's life. Though loss of eyesight may occur naturally as we age, trauma to the eye or exposure to hazardous conditions may also cause this serious condition. Workers in virtually any field may be at risk of sustaining eye injuries through trauma or exposure. A traumatic eye injury occurs when the eye itself sustains some form of trauma, whether a [[penetrating injury]] such as a laceration or a non-penetrating injury such as an impact. Because the eye is a delicate and complex organ, even a slight injury may have a temporary or permanent effect on eyesight.

==Hearing loss==
{{Main|Hearing loss}}
Similarly to vision loss, [[hearing loss]] can vary from full or partial inability to detect some or all [[frequency|frequencies]] of sound which can typically be heard by members of their [[species]].  For [[humans]], this range is approximately 20 [[hertz|Hz]] to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz at ~6.5 [[decibel|dB]], although a 10&amp;nbsp;dB correction is often allowed for the [[elderly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Phonological features, auditory objects, and illusions | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 60–89 | doi = 10.1016/j.wocn.2009.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary causes of hearing loss due to an impaired sensory system include long-term exposure to [[environmental noise]], which can damage the [[mechanoreceptors]] responsible for receiving [[sound|sound vibrations]], as well as multiple diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[meningitis]], which damage the [[cochlea]] and [[auditory nerve]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bizley | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Walker | first2 = K. M. M. | year = 2010 | title = Sensitivity and Selectivity of Neurons in Auditory Cortex to the Pitch, Timbre, and Location of Sounds | url = | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 453–469 | doi = 10.1177/1073858410371009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss may be gradual or sudden. Hearing loss may be very mild, resulting in minor difficulties with conversation, or as severe as complete deafness. The speed with which hearing loss occurs may give clues as to the cause. If hearing loss is sudden, it may be from [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or a problem with [[blood circulation]]. A gradual onset is suggestive of other causes such as [[aging]] or a [[tumor]]. If you also have other associated neurological problems, such as [[tinnitus]] or [[vertigo]], it may indicate a problem with the nerves in the ear or brain. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral hearing loss is most often associated with conductive causes, trauma, and acoustic neuromas. Pain in the ear is associated with ear infections, trauma, and obstruction in the canal.

==Anosmia==
{{Main|Anosmia}}
Anosmia  is the inability to perceive [[odor]], or in other words a lack of functioning [[olfaction]]. Many patients may experience unilateral or bilateral anosmia.

A temporary loss of smell can be caused by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell. The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as congenital anosmia.

The diagnosis of anosmia as well as the degree of impairment can now be tested much more efficiently and effectively than ever before thanks to "smell testing kits" that have been made available as well as screening tests which use materials that most clinics would readily have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig JC |title=Grating orientation as a measure of tactile spatial acuity |journal=[[Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–206 |year=1999 |pmid=10527368 |doi= 10.1080/08990229970456|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cases of congenital anosmia remain unreported and undiagnosed. Since the disorder is present from birth the individual may have little or no understanding of the sense of smell, hence are unaware of the deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08990220310001622997 |title=Decline of tactile acuity in aging: a study of body site, blood flow, and lifetime habits of smoking and physical activity, Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research, Informa Healthcare |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somatosensory loss==
The [[somatosensory system]] is a complex sensory system made up of a number of different receptors, including thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. It also comprises essential processing centres, or sensory modalities, such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception. The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.

While touch (also called tactile or tactual perception) is considered one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with "somatic senses" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.

Insensitivity to [[somatosensory]] stimuli, such as [[heat]], [[cold]], [[touch]], and [[pain]], are most commonly a result of a more general physical impairment associated with [[paralysis]]. Damage to the [[spinal cord]] or other major [[nerve fiber]] may lead to a termination of both [[afferent nerve|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve|efferent]] signals to varying areas of the body, causing both a loss of touch and a loss of [[motor coordination]]. Other types of somatosensory loss include [[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]], which consists of ineffective afferent neurons with fully functioning efferent neurons; essentially, motor movement without somatosensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | year = 1976 | title = Acute Central Cord Syndrome Injury Mechanisms and Stress Features | doi = 10.1097/brs.0b013e3181c94cb8 | journal = Spine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = E955–E964 | pmid=20543769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing. In most cases it often leads to issues with touch. Sometimes people cannot feel touch at all while other times a light finger tap feels like someone has punched them. There are medications and therapies{{such as?}} that can help control the symptoms of sensory loss and deprivation.

==Ageusia==
{{main|Ageusia}}

Ageusia is the loss of taste, particularly the inability to detect [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]], [[saltiness]], and [[umami]] (meaning "pleasant/savory taste"). It is sometimes confused with anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell). Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True ageusia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia (a partial loss of taste) and dysgeusia (a distortion or alteration of taste).

Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the [[lingual nerve]] and the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]. The lingual nerve passes taste for the front two-thirds of the tongue and the glossopharyngeal nerve passes taste for the back third of the tongue. The lingual nerve can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.

Taste loss can vary from true [[ageusia]], a complete loss of taste, to [[hypogeusia]], a partial loss of taste, to [[dysgeusia]], a distortion or alteration of taste.  The primary cause of ageusia involves damage to the [[lingual nerve]], which receives the stimuli from [[taste buds]] for the front two-thirds of the [[tongue]], or the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], which acts similarly for the back third. Damage may be due to neurological disorders, such as [[Bell’s palsy]] or [[multiple sclerosis]], as well as [[infectious diseases]] such as meningoencephalopathy.  Other causes include a [[vitamin B]] deficiency, as well as taste bud death due to acidic/spicy foods, [[radiation]], and/or [[tobacco]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macaluso | first1 = E. | year = 2010 | title = Orienting of spatial attention and the interplay between the senses.

A '''settling basin''', '''settling pond''' or '''decant pond''' is an earthen or concrete structure using [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] to remove [[settleable matter]] and [[turbidity]] from [[wastewater]]. The basins are used to control [[water pollution]] in diverse industries such as [[agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District. Sunnyside, WA.

Appendix E: Wastewater Treatment."] January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material suspended in that water.  Although turbidity often varies directly with weight or volumetric measurements of settleable matter, correlation is complicated by variations in size, shape, [[refractive index]], and [[specific gravity]] of suspended matter.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th edition (1975) APHA, AWWA &amp; WPCF {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} p.131&lt;/ref&gt;  Settling ponds may be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Jackson &amp; Bursztynsky p.8.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range of Applications==
Settling basins are used as a separation mechanism to eliminate rejected products (i.e. waste solids management strategies) of a specified size and quantity in various fields, such as aquaculture, mining, dairy, food processing, alcohol production and wine making. Regular draining and desilting of settling basins is required to maintain satisfactory performance.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Western Regional Aquaculture Center, University of Washington. Seattle, WA (2001). "Settling Basin Design." WRAC Publication No. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaculture===

All materials not removed from the system during harvesting are categorized as wastes including uneaten feed, excreta, chemicals and therapeutics, dead and moribund fish, escaped fish and pathogens. Settling basins in the field are simple ponds dug downstream of the farm to optimally remove suspended solids effectively, produce clarified effluent, and accumulate and thicken sludge to minimal volume. If impairment occurs in any of these functions, this might have a great impact on pond performance, which could lead to damaging the effectiveness of the process.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Cripps, S. J., Bergheim A., Solids management and removal for intensive land-based aquaculture production systems,Aquacu;ture Engineering 22 (2000), page 33-68, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===

Wastewater produced by mining industries contribute to the acidity, suspended material and dissolved heavy metal ions in the aquatic environment, causing environmental problems for biological life and discoloration of the receiving waters. The application of settling basins by the Coeur d’Alene mining district of northern Idaho, United States, globally known to produce lead, zinc and silver, to treat wastewater has greatly improved the quality of water discharge from mining operations.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Williams, R. E. &amp; Mink, L. L., Settling Ponds As A Mining Wastewater Treatment Facility, Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology, Moscow, 164, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy Waste===

By reducing flow velocity to limit solids being transported along with fast flowing liquid, separation can occur. Approximately 35% – 60% of the solids is removed from dilute liquid slurry, with 10 minutes detention time, with a common detention time of 30 to 60 minutes. Due to the inadequate consideration of critical design criteria, most settling basins built were oversized and had low efficiency.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. (2000): Ponds--Planning, Design, and Construction; Agriculture Handbook Number 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Settling basins used in dairy production reduce the nutrient-loading on a vegetative filter strip from lot runoff, thus decreasing the required lagoon volume for a new facility. Moreover, settling basins are useful to remove unwanted solid materials, such as hay, straw and feathers from the waste stream before flowing to the lagoon, aids to reduce smell and avoid crust formation on the lagoon surface. A baffle may be used to retain the floating solids removed. There are two types of settling basins, based on the method of removing solids. With one type, the solids are removed mechanically (after the free water has drained away), usually with a front-end or skid-steer loader. The other type uses hydraulic (pump) removal of the solids. Typically, pumping is initiated when the basin is half full of solids and the remainder is water. Vigorous agitation is needed to mix the liquid and the solids, preferably by propeller-type agitators or pumps with agitation nozzles.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Fulhage, C. D., Pfost D. L. &amp;Feistner J. W., Settling Basins and Terraces for Cattle Manure, University of Missouri Extension, EQ386, new March 2002, accessed date 12 October 2013, http://extension.missouri.edu/p/EQ386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and limitations over competitive processes==
Settling Basins are designed to retain water long enough so that suspended solids can settle to obtain a high purity water in the outlet and also provide the opportunity for pH adjustment.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;“Settling Basins and Wetlands” – Alabama Aquaculture Best Management Practice (BMP)&lt;/ref&gt; Other processes that could be used: thickeners, clarifiers, hydro cyclones and membrane filtration are highly used techniques in the field.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;R K Sinnott 2003, Coulson &amp; Richardson's Chemical Engineering, Vol 6, 3rd edn, Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to those processes, settling basins have a simpler and cheaper design, with fewer moving parts; demanding less maintenance, despite requiring cleaning and vacuuming of the quiescent zones at least once every two weeks.

However, settling basins can introduce new kinds of water contamination, particularly if the water supply is from a well. The basin can catch windblown contaminants, and if the water is retained for a long period, algae grows in the pool, leading to greater filtration problems. Settling ponds may also be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by Brownian motion. Usually, it can only remove particles ranging from sand (2mm in diameter) to silt (0.002mm in diameter).

==Design considerations==
Wastewater enters the basin and very fine particles in the water are [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|separated]] by means of [[gravity]]. The water must be in the basin long enough for the desired particle size to be removed. Smaller particles require longer periods for removal and thus larger basins. In some basins a [[flocculation|flocculant]] may be added to help smaller particles stick together and form larger particles. [[Stokes' law]] can be used to calculate the size of a settling basin needed in order to remove a desired particle size.  Stokes' law gives a settling velocity determining an effective settling basin depth; so solids removal depends upon effective settling basin surface area, while the depth component of settling basin volume remains important for storage of settled solids.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Jackson &amp; Bursztynsky pp.8.12&amp;8.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation of required settling time surface area to settling basin geometry requires consideration of short circuiting and turbulence induced by wind, bottom scour, or inlet and overflow design.  Settling basin geometry is important because effective time of settling within the basin will be the time a volume of water spends in non-turbulent conditions before reaching the settling basin overflow.  Median time is always less than the mean time calculated by dividing available volume by anticipated flow.  The median time of passage through a short, wide settling basin may be significantly less than the median time of passage through a long, narrow settling basin.  Settling basins with overflow structures near the entrance points may hold a large volume of stagnant water while newly admitted water rapidly reaches the overflow point before settling can occur.  Effective surface area for settling seldom extends perpendicularly more than a tenth the distance of a flow line from basin entrance to overflow unless baffles are installed.&lt;ref name="gjb"&gt;Goldman, Jackson &amp; Bursztynsky p.8.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective surface area and geometry may change as accumulating sediment fills part of the originally constructed volume.  Short cut channels may rapidly form through heavier sediment accumulations near the entrance to the settling basin.  Flow through shallow portions of the settling basin may cause turbulence resuspending sediment from the bottom of the basin.  Two feet has been recommended as a minimum settling basin depth to avoid bottom scour.&lt;ref name="gjb"/&gt;

'''Shanigaram Reservoir''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]:{{lang|te|శనిగరం జలాశయం}}) also known as '''Shanigaram Cheruvu''' is a medium irrigation project constructed across the [[Shanigaram River]], at Shanigaram Village, [[Karimnagar District]], [[Telangana]].

This is one of the oldest reservoir constructed in 1891 under [[Nizam]] rule. Project construction cost was 560 Seers (504&amp;nbsp;kg) of Gold (1 [[Seer (unit)|Seer]] = 80 [[Tola (unit)|Tula]] = 933.1 [[Gram]]).

As part of [[Sriram Sagar]] Stage-II work, this reservoir will be filled by lift canal from [[Thotapally Reservoir]] in which water carried from [[Mid Manair Dam|Mid Manair]] through MMD Right Canal. Both Reservoirs and MMD Right Canal construction is in progress,{{when|date=June 2018}}; it is expected to finish by end of 2015.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''The Social Enterprise Investment Fund''' (SEIF) was a United Kingdom [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] fund which provided investment to assist social enterprises delivering health and social care services. Established in 2007 with funding of £100 million, it provided grants and loans until 2011, with a further £19 million proposed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tsrc/research/social-enterprise/seif-evaluation.aspx|title=SEIF (Social Enterprise Investment Fund) evaluation|date=4 December 2012|website=Third Sector Research Centre|publisher=University of Birmingham|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-enterprise-investment-fund-to-reopen-for-applications|title=[Withdrawn] Social Enterprise Investment Fund to reopen for applications - GOV.UK|date=12 June 2012|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 2009, the fund was managed on behalf of the Department for Health by a consortium consisting of [[Futurebuilders England]] and [[Partnerships UK]].

==Context==

The Government's vision for reform in health and social care services includes developing a provider market that is increasingly plural and diverse. This sets the context for new kinds of organizations to emerge, including social enterprises which provide more choices for patients and a higher quality, more responsive service.

The White Paper, [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Ourhealthourcareoursay/index.htm 'Our Health, Our Care, Our Say' (January 2006)] identified social enterprises as key means of delivering high quality health and social care services tailored to the needs of communities. It included a commitment to establish a ''SEIF'' from April 2007 to:

* provide advice to social entrepreneurs who want to develop new models to deliver health and social care services;
* provide increased choice and more integrated services;
* ensure services become more personalised to the needs of the individual;
* address the problems of start up;
* address current barriers to entry around [[access to finance]]; and
* address risks and skills to develop viable business models.
  
Most recently the [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085825 High Quality Care For All: NHS Next Stage Review Final Report and the Primary and Community Care Strategy] set out a vision for this change, stating the need to empower staff and give patients more choice.

The NHS Next Stage Review includes a number of recommendations that present huge opportunities for new and existing social enterprises. Significant recommendations include:

* the ability to create new social enterprises to deliver primary and community services;
* giving NHS staff the 'right to request' from their PCT to enable them to set up a social enterprise; and
* to allow NHS staff to explore setting up a social enterprise if they believe that this could provide them with independence, flexibility and responsiveness to innovate and improve services and outcomes for patients.

==What the fund provides==

The SEIF provides investment to new and existing social enterprises that are delivering or planning to bid for health and social care services contracts. The investments take the forms of loans, grants and professional support.

'''The University of Miami [[Justice for Janitors]] campaign''' was a nine-week strike lasting from February 28 to May 3, 2006.  It featured striking [[janitor|custodial workers]] at the [[University of Miami]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] challenging [[UGL Limited|UNICCO]] (a company that provides maintenance, facility management, and cleaning and janitorial services for industrial, office, retail, and education facilities).  The work action focused on achieving a [[living wage]], affordable health insurance, and better working conditions for [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) member employees.

== Background ==
Prior to the strike at UM, a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-based company, UNICCO (now UGL Limited),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugl-unicco.com UNICCO]; Web page; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt; had already drawn negative attention for some of its business practices.  From 1999-2001, four deaths and one serious injury of UNICCO employees were reported in separate incidents, and in 2003, two employees died in an incident at a workplace in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&amp;p_id=11715 ''OSHA UNICCO Assessment'']; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] web; accessed March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Investigations of these incidents indicated that UNICCO was in violation of numerous workplace standards and resulted in the [[National Council for Occupational Safety and Health]] placing UNICCO on its "Workplace Health and Safety Dirty Dozen Report."&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.rcn.com/jbarab/Final%20Dirty%20Dozen%20Report.pdf The National Council for Occupational Safety and Health]; PDF auto-download; RCN .com; retrieved .&lt;/ref&gt;  A salary survey for 1999-2000 conducted by the [[Chronicle for Higher Education]] found UM's custodial workers to be the second lowest in pay ($13,120/year) and UM to be one of only 12 universities among the 195 surveyed whose custodial workers' wages did not exceed the U.S. federal [[poverty threshold|poverty line]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcs.harvard.edu/~pslm/livingwage/08_03_che.html ''Living Wage Report'']; [[Harvard University]] online; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Liberman, the senior vice president for business and finance at UM at the time, stated, "we don't raise any questions about their business…[and] allow them to pay whatever they want to pay as long as they can recruit and retain workers, and still make a buck at the end of the day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~pslm/livingwage/08_03_che.html ''How Much Should Colleges Pay Their Janitors?'']; Van Der Werf, Martin; Harvard University; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this report, the UM Faculty Senate began addressing the issue in October 2001.  In two separate resolutions, passed on October 24 and December 12 of that year, the faculty senate recommended to UM President [[Donna Shalala]] that the university needed to change its policies for companies which provided contracted labor.  These recommendations went unheeded at the time.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;[http://lsj.sagepub.com/content/early/2008/01/18/0160449X07311856 ''The 2006 Justice of Janitors Campaign at UM'']; Albright, Jason; [[Sage Publications]] online; retrieved ???.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign ==
Formal organization of UM janitorial workers by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) began to take place in February 2005.  The SEIU had been a primary organizer of the "Justice for Janitors" campaign.  The SEIU sought the help of South Florida Interfaith Worker Justice (SFIWJ) early in its campaign in Florida, which signaled the start of an important partnership between the movement and religious organizations.  During the fall of 2005, an ally was found in the group, Students Toward a New Democracy (STAND), which attempted to "create an activist culture in an historically apathetic student body."&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;  In order to improve STAND's capabilities, SEIU brought in students from [[Harvard]] (who had previously conducted a successful three-week living wage campaign), and students from [[Georgetown University]] to help teach organizational tactics to UM students.

=== Strike and protests ===
Following their majority approving an unfair labor practice strike against UNICCO on February 26, 2006, the janitors officially went on strike.  In order to show solidarity with the striking workers, over one hundred UM professors and faculty held classes off campus in venues such as churches, houses, and even a park so as to not interfere with the campaign's [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]].&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;  Out of the 200 UM janitors, SEIU reported that approximately half participated in the strike from the beginning.  UNICCO, however, disputed these claims, asserting that SEIU was exaggerating the numbers, and that 148 out of the 206 workers had reported for work the previous day.  At the same time the SEIU announced that a ten-day strike notice had been issued to the UM medical school, with the potential of adding 200 janitors to the work action.&lt;ref name="Ledger"&gt;Gresko, Jessica. "University of Miami Campus Janitors Go On Strike." Lakeland Ledger. March 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, members of the campaign launched a two-pronged action in an attempt to garner media attention.  First, a group of seventeen people (consisting of union members, students, clergy, and community members) formed a human chain across US Route 1 outside of the UM campus, blocking  traffic.  Just as these seventeen people were arrested, another group (consisting of seventeen students and the campus chaplain) occupied the Ashe Building which housed the UM admissions office.  After a thirteen-hour occupation,  Shalala agreed to have a meeting with the students, workers, and the SEIU.&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;

=== Fasting in Freedom Village ===
Beginning April 5, the campaign featured [[hunger strikes]] and [[fasts|fasting]] (which took place in "Freedom Village"—the name given to the campaign's base of operations).  The hunger strikes began with the workers, some of whom had previously participated in hunger strikes in their previous homeland of Cuba.&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;  In addition to eight workers, seven students joined in the hunger strike.  SEIU originally opposed this form of protest because of the obvious health implications involved, but as they began to support the idea of hunger strikes, they also provided nurses at Freedom Village to monitor the safety of those fasting.  After more than two weeks, some people taking part in the strike were being hospitalized.  Rather than ending the hunger strike altogether, leaders decided to recruit others to do the fasting (such as SEIU president [[Andy Stern]] and executive vice president [[Eliseo Medina]]).  The UM custodial strike attracted national attention, including visits by several out-of-town political and labor leaders in support of the strike.  Notable people such as [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] President [[John Edwards]]; [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] President [[James P. Hoffa]]; and civil rights leader [[Charles Steele, Jr.]] made visits to the campus to show support.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;Wides-Munoz, Laura. "University janitors, contract workers OK union." Sarasota Herald-Tribune. June 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution of strike==
On May 1, 2006, it was announced that UNICCO and the SEIU had reached an agreement that an independent third party (the American Arbitration Association—AAA) would determine whether or not a super-majority of UNICCO custodians at UM wished to unionize.  UNICCO had finally agreed to the use of a [[card check]] vote (as opposed to the [[secret ballot]] system they had originally lobbied for).  The agreement established a code of conduct governing how both the employer and the union would interact with the workers during the process.  Both sides agreed not to interfere with the workers' decision on whether or not to form a union.

=== Agreement ===
SEIU secured a super-majority approval (more than 60%) from the 425 UNICCO workers at UM and UM's Jackson Memorial Hospital to unionize.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt;   The UM janitors returned to work on May 3, 2006, signifying the end of their nine-week-long strike.  Following the vote, UM janitor Maritza Perez (who had worked for UNICCO for eleven years) said, "I'm going to return [to work] with my head held high, protected by the name of the union, which is rare in the state of Florida."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seiu.org/mediakit/pdfs_1/Miami_Herald--UM_Janitors_end_2_month-strike.pdf ''UM Janitors End 2-month Strike'']; auto-download PDF; Boodhoo, Niala; SEIU .com; retrieved .&lt;/ref&gt;

== University responses ==
On January 17, 2006, as the SEIU began ramping up efforts at UM, president Shalala issued a statement addressing the university's non-authorized solicitation regulations.  Her letter emphasized the university's commitment to remain neutral regarding any labor issues between UNICCO and the SEIU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefire.org/public/pdfs/2ec8cf8e622eca29c7f2bab87ab82b2e.pdf?direct ''University of Miami'']; E-Veritas; [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education|The Fire]]; [[University of Miami]]; accessed ???.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the movement started gaining significant momentum in late March, UM announced a new policy setting higher standards for companies contracted by the university.  This resulted in setting a minimum wage of $8.00 per hour; the recognition of performance and length of service in pay scales; and the offering of affordable health insurance to university employees.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Housekeeper wages increased from $6.40 to $8.00; and  groundskeeper wages increased from $6.40 to $9.30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/president/dialogue/dialogue_04_12_06.htm ''Dialogue with Donna Shalala'']; April 12, 2006; Miami EDU; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt;  In an April 12 press release (following the storming of the administration building by protestors), Shalala condemned the actions of the protestors, and stated: "it was the student organization STAND that delivered the message that [the outside protestors] were not welcome on campus today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/president/dialogue/dialogue_03_20_06.htm ''Dialogue with Donna Shalala'']; March 20, 2006; Miami EDU; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses by University governmental bodies==
The strike was the subject of several motions by university governmental bodies, including one passed on March 28 by the Faculty Senate, which urged UM to stipulate that its contractors provide a living wage, health insurance, and a fair workplace.  The resolution further stated that should UNICCO's contract not be renewed by UM, that the successful bidder be required to hire those workers currently employed by UNICCO at UM.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.miami.edu/faculty-senate/2005-legislation/2005-14.pdf ''Miami EDU legislation—2004-14(D)'']; March 28, 2006; PDF download; Faculty Senate Memorandum; [[University of Miami]]; p.1; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another resolution, this one by the UM Student Government, was an April 19 mandate "strongly" disapproving of recent campus disruptions by several of the pro-strike organizations (ACORN, JWJ, SEIU, and STAND), and which called on them to end the disruptions immediately.  The actions by these groups mentioned in the resolution included the harassing of UM students, the disruption of a class taught by Shalala, trespassing on private property, and "vandalizing the back entrance of the Ashe Building with [[graffiti]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.edu/alumni/news/pdf/20060421.unicco.sg.pdf ''A Resolution Disapproving of Recent Campus Disruptions—Action 07009'']; PDF auto-download; Student Senate; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results affecting employees==
In addition to the SEIU being elected as the union for UM workers, the original policy changes implemented by UM in late March 2006 were kept, along with some additional improvements.&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;

==Disciplinary charges against students==
Approximately 20 University of Miami students allegedly involved in pro-union activities received official notices to appear before a university Dean on charges that they were being investigated for "major violations".  SEIU representatives asked for amnesty for the students as part of the negotiated settlement on May 1, but were told the request was not negotiable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Velamentous cord insertion''' is an abnormal condition during [[pregnancy]]. Normally, the [[umbilical cord]] inserts into the middle of the [[placenta]] as it develops. In velamentous cord insertion, the umbilical cord inserts into the [[fetal membranes]] (choriamniotic membranes), then travels within the membranes to the placenta (between the [[amnion]] and the [[chorion]]). The exposed vessels are not protected by [[Wharton's jelly]] and hence are vulnerable to rupture. Rupture is especially likely if the vessels are near the [[cervix]], in which case they may rupture in early [[Childbirth|labor]], likely resulting in a [[stillbirth]].  This is a serious condition called [[Vasa praevia|vasa previa]].  Not every pregnancy with a velamentous cord insertion results in vasa previa, only those in which the blood vessels are near the cervix.

When a velamentous cord insertion is discovered, the obstetrician will monitor the pregnancy closely for the presence of vasa previa.  If the blood vessels are near the cervix, the baby will be delivered via cesarean section as early as 35 weeks to prevent the mother from going into labor, which is associated with a high infant mortality.  Early detection can reduce the need for emergency [[cesarean section]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid17272203"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hasegawa J, Matsuoka R, Ichizuka K, Sekizawa A, Okai T|title=Velamentous cord insertion: significance of prenatal detection to predict perinatal complications|journal=Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol|volume=45|issue=1|pages=21–5|date=March 2006|pmid=17272203|doi=10.1016/S1028-4559(09)60185-6|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
