'''Aleuromancy''' is the use of [[flour]] for [[divination]].&lt;ref name="words"&gt;{{cite news|author = Stanley M. Aronson|title = Commentary - Navigating the sea of words|quote = |publisher = Providence Journal-Bulletin|date = January 8, 2001|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''aleuron'', meaning flour, and ''manteia'', meaning divination.&lt;ref name="words"/&gt;  

== Description==
Divination with flour is attested in [[cuneiform]] tablets from the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Mesopotamian Astral Divination | author = David Brown | journal = East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine | volume = 25 | year = 2006 | page = 200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flour was poured out in small heaps and the interpretation was based on the observation of their shapes and orientation.

In its original form, slips of paper containing philosophical writings would be baked inside of cakes or cookies, which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told.  Similarly, the Greeks would bake slips of paper with sentences on them inside of balls of flour, mix the balls nine times, and distribute them.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  | title = Aleuromancy  | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | volume =   | pages = 17  | publisher = Harper Element  | year = 2006  | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[fortune cookie]]s are a variant on these forms of divination.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; 

Another form of aleuromancy consisted of interpreting patterns of flour left in a bowl after a flour and water slurry had been mixed in it and poured away.

'''Arthur John MacLean''' (6 July 1858 – 24 February 1943) was an [[Anglican]] [[bishop]] in the later decades of the 19th century and first four of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur John Maclean, bishop of Moray, Primus'', Snow, W. G. S.; Edinburgh,William Blackwood and Sons (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

Maclean was born into an ecclesiastical family.  His father, the Rev Arthur J. Macleane (he later dropped the final "e" from the surname), began a career in the [[East India Company]] before returning to England, obtaining a degree [[Trinity College Cambridge]], being ordained and securing appointment as inaugural Principal of [[Brighton College]] (1846–51). He held two subsequent headships and was editor of various Classical texts, especially [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Who's Who (UK)|“Who was Who” 1897-2007]] London, [[A &amp; C Black]], 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-19-954087-7}}; Martin D.

He was a younger brother of the chronicler don [[Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl]].

Alva received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Mexico]] in 1622, and subsequently a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]]. He probably entered the priesthood in 1625. In 1634 he published a [[Nahuatl]]-language [[confessionary]], for the use of priests administering [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]]. Around 1640 he translated and adapted [[Spanish Baroque literature#The theater|Spanish plays]] into the Nahuatl language and Nahua culture; these were then used by [[Horacio Carochi]] to draw examples from for [[Arte de la lengua mexicana con la declaración de los adverbios della|his grammar of Nahuatl]], published in 1645. Alva was one of the examiners who approved the grammar for publication, writing that ''"the author, by dint of study, has attained the ability to explain masterfully in the Mexican'' [i.e. Nahuatl] ''and Otomi languages what the very natives, although they reach an understanding of it, hardly manage to express."''&lt;ref&gt;Carochi (2001): p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shaykhtabarsi 2008.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Shrine of Shaykh Ṭabarsí]]
'''Shaykh Ṭabarsí''', or more correctly the Shrine of [[Shaykh Tabarsí]], was the location of a battle between the forces of the [[Shah]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and the [[Bábís]] (followers of the [[Báb]]) over the period October 10, 1848 to May 10, 1849, when the prince resorted to a plan of betrayal to capture the remaining Bábís. It is located in [[Mazandaran Province]], [[Iran]].

== Leading up to the Battle ==
[[Mullá Husayn-i-Bushru'i]], one of the most prominent Bábís, marched with 202 of his fellow disciples, under instructions from the Báb, from Mashhad to the Shrine of Shaykh Tabarsí with the [[Black Standard]] raised, fulfilling an Islamic prophecy.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Momen | first = Moojan|authorlink= Moojan Momen  | title =The Social Basis of the Babi Upheavals in Iran (1848-53): A Preliminary Analysis |journal =International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume =15 | issue =2 | pages =157–183 | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date = May 1983 | jstor =162988  | doi=10.1017/s0020743800052260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission was most likely proclamatory but possibly also to rescue another Bábí leader, [[Quddús]], who was under house arrest in Sárí. After being rebuffed at the town of Barfurush the group took up making defensive fortifications at the Shrine of the Shaykh. Upon arriving at the shrine, the Bábís, numbering a little over 300 according to Bábí and Bahá'í sources and according to court historians, were now under imminent attack from government forces.

A scholarly review finds reasonable support for between 540 and 600 people present including over a hundred villagers who joined locally after those that arrived from across the country. A census of the Bábís who had traveled some distance to the Shrine shows 14 major former clerics of Islam, 122 minor former clerics of Islam, 12 nobility or high government officials, 5 wholesale merchants, 9 retail merchants, 39 guild tradesmen, 6 unskilled laborers, 6 peasants, and 152 unclassified.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; Different sources have some similarities of which cities/provinces they came from — the highest numbers coming from [[Isfahan]], [[Boshruyeh]], Miyami, and [[Bahnemir]], though 33 locations are listed among the places of origin of the participants.

Sources describe the building of the fort as a matter of self-defence. The Bábí's spent many months under attack in the fort, resorting to eating the leather of their own clothes to remain alive.

== During the battle ==
Over the weeks that followed, more and more Bábís joined the fort with numbers rising to perhaps six hundred.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable of the late arrivals is Quddús who joined after being released by Tabarsí Bábís on October 20.

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] see the battle, which was led by Mullá Husayn, as a heroic stand against oppressive government forces that lasted several months.

At last, having finally been reduced to near-starvation by the encirclement, the Bábí defenders surrendered on the guarantee of safe passage — a guarantee that was immediately violated, with most of the former “garrison” massacred on the spot on May 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.executedtoday.com/2016/05/16/1849-quddus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qudd%C3%BAs]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}

== After the battle ==
It is believed that eight of the disciples of the [[Báb]] also called the [[Letters of the Living]] were killed in the series of battles:

*[[Mullá Husayn-i-Bushru'i]]
*[[Muhammad-Hasan-i-Bushru'i]]
*[[Muhammad-Baqir-i-Bushru'i]]
*[[Mullá Mahmud-i-Khu'i]]
*[[Mullá Jalil-i-Urumi]]
*[[Mullá Ahmad-i-Ibdal-i-Maraghi'i]]
*[[Mullá Yusif-i-Ardibili]]
*[[Mullá Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Qazvini]]

[[Quddús]] was taken prisoner in the city of Barfurush. There the high priest rallied the townsfolk into a vicious frenzy. Quddus was then left to the hands of the mob who beat him to death on May 16, 1849. What remained of Quddus' body was gathered by a friend and buried nearby.&lt;ref&gt;The Dawnbreakers pg. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle is considered the most important upheaval of the Bábí religion because the Báb himself instructed [[Mullá Husayn]]-i Bushru'i to initiate it with raising the "Black Standard" as well as a call for support of the collective initiative of Bábís, the episode included two leading figures of the religion in Mulla Husayn and Quddús and overall nine out of eighteen of the [[Letters of the Living]], and actually reached a widespread response from across the country.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; No other upheaval the Bábís suffered had this pattern of importance in it.

It was mentioned in some French language newspaper accounts from the [[Journal de Constantinople]] in March 1849.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://bahai-library.com/pdf/journal-de-constantinople/ocr-ed_pdfs/1849/journal_constantinople_1849-03-24_p1.pdf Nouvellees de Perse], ''Journal de Constantinople'', March 24, 1849, p. 1, bottom fourth column, above middle

[[File:Bhavishya Purana, Bhavishyottara, Sanskrit, Devanagari.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A page from the Bhavishyottara section of ''Bhavishya Purana'' (Sanskrit, Devanagari)]]
{{Hindu scriptures}}

The '''''Bhavishya Purana''''' (''{{IAST|Bhaviṣya Purāṇa}}'') is one of the eighteen major works in the [[Purana]] genre of [[Hinduism]], written in [[Sanskrit]].{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=71}}{{Sfn|Winternitz|1922|p=541}} The title ''Bhavishya'' means "future" and implies it is a work that contains prophecies regarding the future, however, the "prophecy" parts of the extant manuscripts are a modern era addition and hence not an integral part of the Bhavishya Purana.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}}{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=215 with note 1180}} Those sections of the surviving manuscripts that are dated to be older, are partly borrowed from other Indian texts such as ''Brihat Samhita'' and ''Shamba Purana''.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=72}} The veracity and authenticity of much of the ''Bhavishya Purana'' has been questioned by modern scholars and historians, and the text is considered an example of "constant revisions and living nature" of Puranic genre of Hindu literature.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=153}}{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=48-49 with note 246}} The modern addition of prophecy part in the Bhavishya Purana has been allegedly used to misguide others.

The text exists in many inconsistent versions, wherein the content as well as their subdivisions vary, and five major versions are known.{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=215 with note 1180}} Some manuscripts have four ''Parvan'' (parts), some two, others don't have any parts.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=71}}{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}} The text as it exists today is a composite of material ranging from medieval era to very recent. The available versions of ''Bhavishya Purana'' are based on a printed text  published during the British colonial era.

The first 16 chapters of the first part of the ''Bhavisya Purana'' is called ''Brahmaparvan''. It shows similarities to, and likely borrowed verses from some version of the [[Manusmriti]].{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarma | first=KV | title=Review of The Manava Dharmasastra I-III and the Bhavisya Purana by Ludwik Sternbach | journal=J. Royal Asiatic Soc. G.B. Irel. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=109 | issue=02 | year=1977 | page=217 |doi=10.1017/s0035869x00133957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of the [[Varna (Hinduism)|caste]]-related and women's rights related discussion in the ''Bhavishya Purana'' is egalitarian and challenge those found in the 19th-century published manuscripts of the Manusmriti.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=152 with footnotes}}&lt;ref name="Raj Arora 1972"&gt;Raj Arora (1972), Historical and cultural data from the Bhavisya Purana, Sterling Publishers, {{oclc|844555576}}, pages viii-ix, 92-119, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lallanji174&gt;L Gopal (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=FfNjAAAAMAAJ Bhavisya Purana Brahma Parvan Chapters 40-44], Journal: Purana, Volume XXVIII, Issue 2 (July), pages 174-196&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahmaparvan part of the ''Bhavishya Purana'' includes a 169 chapters compendium of [[Surya]] (Sun god) related literature, that overlaps with Zoroastrianism-related views.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=72}} These Sun-related sections are a notable and important part of the ''Bhavishya Purana'', and it may be related to the migration or interaction between people of Persia and central Asia with those in Indian subcontinent.{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=49 with note 247}}{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=217-219}}

The second part of the text, called ''Madhyamaparvan'', is a Tantra-related work.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=153}} The "prophecy"-related third part ''Pratisargaparvan'' includes sections on Christianity, Islam, Bhakti movement, Sikhism, British rule, and considered by scholars as a 19th-century creation.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=153-154}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=72}} The fourth part of the text called ''Uttaraparvan'', is also known as ''Bhavishyottara Purana''. This last part describes festivals related to various Hindu gods and goddesses and their ''Tithis'' (dates on lunar calendar), as well as mythology and a discussion of [[Dharma]] particularly ''vrata'' (vow) and ''dana'' (charity).{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=153-154}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=72}} The text also has many ''Mahatmya'' chapters on geography, travel guide and pilgrimage to holy sites such as [[Uthiramerur]],{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=154 with footnotes}}{{Sfn|Ariel Glucklich|2008|p=146, '''Quote:''' The earliest promotional works aimed at tourists from that era were called ''mahatmyas''}} and is one of the ''Tirtha''-focussed Puranas.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=78}}

==Dating and texts==
In records of land grants of the fifth century CE verses are quoted which occur only in the ''[[Padma Purana|Padma]]'', ''Bhavishya'', and ''[[Brahma Purana]]s'', and on this basis Pargiter in 1912 assigned these particular Puranas to the early centuries CE.  [[Moriz Winternitz|Maurice Winternitz]] considers it more probable that these verses, both in the inscriptions and in the puranas, were taken as quotations from earlier [[dharmaśāstra]]s, and thus argues that chronological deductions cannot be made on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;For the fifth century CE land grant references, citation to Pargiter (1912), and debunking of the theory, see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 526, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maurice Winternitz, the text which has come down to us in manuscript form under this title is certainly not the ancient work which is quoted in the ''{{IAST|Āpastambīya Dharmasūtra}}''.&lt;ref&gt;For statement that the extant text is not the ancient work, see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;  A quotation appearing in the ''{{IAST|Āpastambīya Dharmasūtra}}'' attributed to the ''{{IAST|Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa}}'' cannot be found in the extant text of the Purana.&lt;ref&gt;For the quotation in ''{{IAST|Āpastambīya Dharmasūtra}}'' attributed to the ''{{IAST|Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa}}'' not extant today, see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Some manuscripts of the ''Bhavishya Purana'' assert that it has five parts (Sanskrit: ''parvans''),&lt;ref&gt;''Bhavishya Purana''  I.2.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; but the extant printed editions contain four parts (''Brāhma'', ''Madhyama'', ''Pratisarga'', and ''Uttara'').&lt;ref&gt;For self-report of five parts, but only four parts in the printed text, see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  These four parts have distinctive content and dating.

The ''Brahmaparvan'' contains 215 chapters, the ''Madhyamaparvan'' has three sections with a cumulative total of 62 chapters, the ''Pratisargaparvan'' has four sections with 7, 35, 32 and 26 chapters sequentially, and the ''Uttaraparvan'' has 208 chapters. Some manuscripts of the text do not have these ''Parvans'' and have different number of chapters.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}} The ''Madhyamaparvan'' part is a Tantra-related work, while the "prophecy"-related third part ''Pratisargaparvan'' is likely a 19th-century creation.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=72}}

The text is sometimes titled ''{{IAST|Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa}}''.{{Sfn|Winternitz|1922|p=541}} In the ''[[Padma Purana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Mathett, Freda, "''The Purāṇas''" in Flood (2003), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; it is classified in the ''rajas'' category, which contains puranas related to [[Brahma]].{{Sfn|Wilson|1864|p=xii}}&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathett, Freda, "''Purāṇa''" in Flood (2003), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars consider the ''Sattva-Rajas-Tamas'' classification as "entirely fanciful" and there is nothing in this text that actually justifies this classification.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=21}}

==Contents==
Despite being labelled a purana or "tales of ancient times", the work relates only a few legends. It is one of several puranas in which a list of royal dynasties of the "past" are followed by lists of kings predicted to rule in the future.&lt;ref&gt;For the ''{{IAST|Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa}}'' as one of several puranas predicting future kings (others being the ''Matsya'', ''Vāyu'', ''{{IAST|Brahmāṇḍa}}'', ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'', ''Bhāgavata'', and ''{{IAST|Garuḍa}}'' Puranas, see: Winternitz, volume 1, pp. 523–524.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brāhmaparvan===
This part of the text has 215 chapters.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}} It covers topics such as rites of passage, ceremonies and feasts.&lt;ref&gt;For the characterization of the content, see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 541-542.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also covers the duties and rights of women, a discussion on the nature of people and how to identify good and bad characters, and a caste-related discussion. According to Arora, and other scholars,{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=478-479 with note 2648}}&lt;ref name=lallanji174/&gt; the [[caste]]-related and women's rights related discussion in the ''Bhavishya Purana'' is egalitarian, similar to those found in ''[[Brahma Purana]]'' and [[Vajrasuchi Upanishad]], all three of which challenge the views expressed in the Manusmriti.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=152 with footnotes}}&lt;ref name="Raj Arora 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For women and varna-related discussion, signs of people, see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=478-479 with note 2648}}

The Brahmaparvan also includes sections on festival dates and methods for worshipping [[Brahma]], [[Ganesha]], [[Murugan|Skanda]], and the [[Nāga]].{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}}&lt;ref&gt;For Brahma, Ganesha, Skanda, and the Snakes see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable section deals with Sun worship in a place called "Śākadvīpa" which may be a reference to [[Scythia]].&lt;ref&gt;For the sun worship in "Śākadvīpa", which may be Scythia, see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a large number of chapters on Sun worship, solar myths, and Śāka-dvipa, see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; This overlaps with Zoroastrianism-related views,{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=72}} and may be related to ancient migration or interaction between Persia and central Asia with Indian subcontinent.{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=49 with note 247}}{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=218-219}} These chapters are the most comprehensive and important source of sun-worship tradition in India, and may be related to the escape and resettlement of people from Persia into western India during the mid to late medieval era.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=217-219 with footnotes}}

===Madhyamaparvan===
The second part of the ''Bhavisya Purana'' has 62 chapters on [[Tantra]].{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}}

This is not mentioned in other Indian text, states Hazra, to have been a part of the ''Bhavishya Purana'', and therefore he states that it may be "a late appendage" abounding in Tantric theories of the 2nd-millennium.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation from Hazra regarding the ''Madhyamaparvan'' as a late appendage, see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; However, states Rocher, the tantra sections of this Purana were likely part of the text by about 1500 CE.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=153 with footnote 92}}

===Pratisargaparvan===
The Pratisarga parvan has 100 chapters,{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}} which deal with topics such as the genealogy of the kings and sages, and prophecies.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=153}} It is written as a universal history with the first and the second chapters (called Khandas) deal with old time, the third part with the medieval, while the fourth deals with the new age.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel1999p217"/&gt; This section has led scholars to question the veracity and authenticity of much of the ''Bhavishya Purana'', and as evidence that the Puranas were not scriptures, but texts that were constantly revised and of living nature, both over time and over geography.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=8-13, 153}}{{Sfn|K P Gietz|1992|p=48-49 with notes 246-247}}&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel1999p217"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV-RrRoMzbgC|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-34050-0|pages=216–218, 271–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alf Hiltebeitel]], who has translated and summarized this part of the ''Bhavisya Purana'',&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel1999p217"/&gt; considers that 1739 marks the [[terminus a quo]] (completed after year) for the text's history of the [[Mughals]] and the same terminus a quo would apply to Pratisargaparvan's first khanda Genesis-Exodus sequence, and the [[diptych]] in the section concerning "[[Jesus|Isha Putra]]" (Jesus Christ) and [[Muhammad]] in its third chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] ''Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics'' 2009 Page 276 "Thus 1739 could mark a terminus a quo for the text's history of the Mughals. If so, the same terminus would apply to its Genesis-Exodus sequence in its first khanda, its Jesus-Muhammad diptych in its third (the Krsnam&amp;acaritd), and the history ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Mention of [[Queen Victoria]]'s Calcutta places the [[terminus ad quem]] (completed before year) at mid to late 19th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Alf Hiltebeitel ''Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics'' 2009 Page 277 "Since references to Queen Victoria's Calcutta provide a mid- to even late-nineteenth-century terminus ad quem for other ... but of the Genesis-Exodus sequence and the Krsnarrrtacarita—with its Jesus and Muhammad passages— as well."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonazzoli, Giorgio: Christ in the Bhavisya Purana [Engl.]. (a methodological approach to Bhav. P. III. 3.2.21-32), Journal: ''Purana'' issue 21, January 1979, pp. 23-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Hiltebeitel states that this part of the ''Bhavisya Purana'' was mostly likely composed in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV-RrRoMzbgC|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-34050-0|pages=217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uttaraparvan===
The ''Uttaraparvan'' is large with 208 chapters.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=151-154}} Though nominally attached to the ''Bhavishya Purana'', is usually considered to be an independent work, also known as the ''{{IAST|Bhaviṣyottara Purāṇa}}'', and as such is included among the [[Puranas#Upapuranas|Upapuranas]] (Lesser Puranas).&lt;ref&gt;For independent classification of the Uttaraparvan as the {{IAST|Bhaviṣyottara Purāṇa}} see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''{{IAST|Bhaviṣyottara Purana}}'' is primarily a handbook of religious rites with a few legends and myths.&lt;ref&gt;For the contents of the {{IAST|Bhaviṣyottara Purana}} and characterizing it as a continuation of the ''Bhavishya Purana'' see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rajendra Hazra characterizes it as "a loose collection of materials taken from various sources" that is lacking in many of the traditional five characteristics of a purana, but which offers an interesting study of vows, festivals, and donations from sociological and religious point of view.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation related to loose collection of materials see: Hazra, Rajendra Chandra, "The {{IAST|Upapurāṇas}}" in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1962), volume 2, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bhavishya Purana'' also includes ''Mahatmya'' (travel guides) to pilgrimage sites such as [[Uthiramerur]].{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=154 with footnotes}}{{Sfn|Ariel Glucklich|2008|p=146, '''Quote:''' The earliest promotional works aimed at tourists from that era were called ''mahatmyas''}}

[[File:Nicolas Poussin - The Institution of the Eucharist - WGA18310.jpg|thumb|The ''Institution of the Eucharist'' by [[Nicolas Poussin]], 1640]]
In [[Christian theology]], the term '''Body of Christ''' has two main but separate meanings: it may refer to [[Jesus']] words over the bread at the [[Last Supper]] that "This is my body" in {{bibleverse||Luke|22:19–20|RSV}}, or to the usage of the term by the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:12–14|KJV}} and {{bibleverse|Ephesians|4:1–16|KJV}} to refer to the [[Christian Church]]. It may also refer to Christ's post-resurrection body in [[Heaven]]. Christ also associated himself with the poor of the world and this is also called the Body of Christ.“If we truly wish to encounter Christ, we have to touch his body in the suffering bodies of the poor, as a response to the sacramental communion bestowed in the Eucharist. The Body of Christ, broken in the sacred liturgy, can be seen, through charity and sharing, in the faces and persons of the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters.” said [[Pope Francis]] on launching the [[World Day of the Poor]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/launching-world-day-poor-francis-says-no-christian-may-disregard-serving-them&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant differences in how Christians understand the term as used by Christ at the [[Last Supper]] and as developed in Christian theology of the [[Eucharist]]. For some it may be symbolic, for others it becomes a more literal or mystical understanding.

As used by Saint [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in the [[Pauline epistles]] it refers to the Christian Church as a group of believers. In [[Roman Catholic theology]] the use of the phrase "mystical body" distinguishes the mystical body of Christ, the Church, from the physical body of Christ, and from a "moral body" such as any club with a common purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'', a papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, sections 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eucharist and Real Presence==

===Catholicism===
{{Devotions to Christ}}
While teaching that in the bread consecrated in the [[Eucharist]] there is absolutely no change open to the senses or to scientific investigation, the Catholic Church supports the [[Real Presence]], i.e. that the reality of the bread is changed into that of the body of Christ. The Church teachings refer to this change as one of the "[[substance theory|substance]]" or "[[transubstantiation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm Council of Trent, The Thirteenth Session] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211215226/http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm |date=February 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects the term   "[[consubstantiation]]", which suggests that the substance or reality of the bread remains after the consecration, instead of being converted or changed into that of the body of Christ. At the same time, the Church holds that all that can be examined either directly or by scientific investigation&amp;nbsp;{{endash}} what in [[philosophy]] are called the "[[accident (philosophy)|accidents]]" (as opposed to the reality)&amp;nbsp;{{endash}} remains quite unchanged.

In the [[Roman Rite]], the priest or other minister who gives the consecrated [[Host (Holy Communion)|host]] to a communicant says: "The body of Christ", indicating what is held to be the reality of what is given.

Since the consecrated bread is believed to be the body of Christ and sacred, what remains of the host after celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is kept in the [[church tabernacle]]. This is primarily for the purpose of taking Communion to the sick, but also to serve as a focal point for private devotion and prayer. On appropriate occasions, there may be public [[Eucharistic adoration]].

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] also believes that the Eucharistic elements of bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. It has authoritatively used the term "[[Transubstantiation]]" to describe this change, as in ''The Longer Catechism of The Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church''&lt;ref&gt;"The bread and wine are changed, or ''transubstantiated'', into the very Body of Christ, and into the very Blood of Christ" ([http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm question 339]).&lt;/ref&gt; and in the decrees of the 1672 [[Synod of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;"In the celebration (of the Eucharist) we believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be present, not typically, nor figuratively, nor by superabundant grace, as in the other Mysteries, nor by a bare presence, as some of the Fathers have said concerning Baptism, or by impanation, so that the Divinity of the Word is united to the set forth bread of the Eucharist hypostatically, as the followers of Luther most ignorantly and wretchedly suppose, but truly and really, so that after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, the bread is transmuted, ''transubstantiated'', converted and transformed into the true Body Itself of the Lord, Which was born in Bethlehem of the ever-Virgin, was baptised in the Jordan, suffered, was buried, rose again, was received up, sitteth at the right hand of the God and Father, and is to come again in the clouds of Heaven; and the wine is converted and ''transubstantiated'' into the true Blood Itself of the Lord, Which as He hung upon the Cross, was poured out for the life of the world." ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Decree XVII])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
Historically, various Protestant theologians expressed different opinions regarding the Eucharist and the body of Christ. In contrast to [[Zwingli]], [[Martin Luther]] reasoned that because divinity involves [[omnipresence]], the body of Christ can be present in the Eucharist because of its participation in the divine nature.&lt;ref name=Hans676 &gt;''The Encyclopedia of Protestantism'' by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} page 676&lt;/ref&gt; A long debate took place between Luther and Zwingli on the issue of omnipresence, with each providing a variety of theological and biblical arguments to support his view.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Wylie (2002), ''The History of Protestantism'' {{ISBN|0-923309-80-2}}, pp. 595–596&lt;/ref&gt;

In current [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teachings, the Body of Christ is used in a somewhat similar form to the Catholic teachings, but the Lutherans reject the Catholic teaching of [[transubstantiation]]. For the Lutheran, the Body of Christ is the formal title of the [[sacramental bread]] in the [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Eucharist]], as seen in the Lutheran [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]. It is also said in the [[Words of Institution]]&amp;nbsp;{{endash}} see [[Luther's Small Catechism]]. A similar teaching is taught in various [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches.

[[John Calvin]] disagreed with Luther's reasoning about omnipresence and, like Zwingli, argued that human presence requires a specific location.&lt;ref name=Hans676 /&gt; Calvin stated that Christ's body was present in the first Eucharist during the [[Last Supper]], but was thereafter in heaven.&lt;ref name=Hans676 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackwell27 /&gt; [[Melanchthon]] was accused of supporting Calvin, and the debates between the various groups eventually caused a further rift between the followers of Luther and Zwingli.&lt;ref name=Blackwell27 &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Protestantism'' by Alister E. McGrath, Darren C. Marks 2003 {{ISBN|0-631-23278-8}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Church==
{{main|Christian Church}}

===Catholicism===
[[File:Challoner Douai Bible (1749).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], from the [[Douai Bible]], 1749]]{{quote|''For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many.'' — [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#12:12|1 Corinthians 12:12–14]]}}
The first meaning that Catholics attach to the expression "Body of Christ" is the Catholic Church. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval, as "summing up the faith of the holy doctors and the good sense of the believer", the reply of Saint [[Joan of Arc]] to her judges: "About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P28.HTM#-117 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 795] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225045654/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P28.HTM#-117 |date=December 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same passage, it also quotes [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]: "Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not only Christians, but Christ himself. Do you understand and grasp, brethren, God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we have become Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we together are the whole man.... the fullness of Christ then is the head and the members. But what does 'head and members' mean? Christ and the Church." In light of all this, the Catholic Church calls itself the "universal sacrament of salvation" for the whole world, as it dispenses the sacraments which give the grace of Christ to the recipient.

Saint [[Paul the Apostle]] spoke of this unity of Christians with Christ, referred to in the New Testament also in images such as that of the vine and the branches,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|15:4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of a single body that has Christ as its head in {{bibleverse||Romans|12:5}},{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:12–27}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:6}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|5:23}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:18}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Colossians|1:24}}.

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, "the comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the intimate bond between Christ and his Church. Not only is she gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three aspects of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically noted: the unity of all her members with each other as a result of their union with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the Church as bride of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P28.HTM#-117 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 789] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225045654/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P28.HTM#-117 |date=December 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism spells out the significance of each of these three aspects.

To distinguish the Body of Christ in this sense from his physical body, the term "Mystical Body of Christ" is often used. This term was used as the first words, and so as the title, of the [[encyclical]] [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi_en.html ''Mystici Corporis Christi''] of [[Pope Pius XII]]. In that document, Pope Pius XII in 1943 states, "the mystical Body of Christ... is the Catholic Church." But in 1964 the Catholic bishops gathered at the [[Second Vatican Council]], while acknowledging that “full incorporation” in the Church required union with the [[Pope|Sovereign Pontiff]], described various degrees of being “conjoined” or “related” to the Church including all persons of good will,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lumen Gentium#People of God (Chapter II)|Vatican II Decree on the Church]]&lt;/ref&gt; which was not something new.&lt;ref&gt;''Lumen Gentium'', Chapter 2, Footnote 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this understanding, [[Karl Rahner]] coined the term “anonymous Christians”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rahner#Anonymous Christianity|Anonymous Christians]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Orthodox see the description of the Church (''[[Ecclesia (Church)|Ecclessia]]'') as the "Body of Christ" as being inextricably connected to [[Holy Communion]]. According to Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] (c. 35–107), the unity of the Church is expressed in Eucharistic terms. Just as there are many offerings made throughout the world on any given day, and yet all partake of one and the same Body of Christ, so the Church, though existing in many separate localities, is only one.

===Protestantism===
In modern teachings, the "Body of Christ" is used by other [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s to collectively describe believers in Christ, as opposed to only those who are members of the Catholic Church. In this sense, Christians are members of the universal body of Christ not because of identification with the institution of the Church, but through identification with Christ directly through faith.  This theology is based on several passages in the [[Bible]], including {{bibleverse||Romans|12:5}},{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:12–27}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:6}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|5:23}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:18}} and {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:24}}.  [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is seen as the "head" of the body, which is the church, while the "members" of the body are seen as members of the [[Ecclesia (Church)|Church]]. In this way, Protestantism defines the "Body of Christ" in a much broader way than does the Catholic Church. This has allowed for a broad base within Christianity to call themselves part of the "Body of Christ."

'''''Buddha Is as Buddha Does: The Ten Original Practices for Enlightened Living ''''' is a book written by [[Surya Das]], published in 2008. It is conceived as a guide for spiritual development based on the [[pāramitā]]s, traditional [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings. The Sanskrit term is usually translated as "perfections", but the practices are best understood as a set of virtuous actions. Surya Das explains each of the ten virtues, offering various exercises and tips to apply the teaching. This is accompanied by anecdotes, traditional stories and the examples of historical figures in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2389 |title=''Buddha Is As Buddha Does'' (review) |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526092744/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2389 |archivedate=2012-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surya Das also offers examples of Westerners who embody these virtues, from the Catholic saint [[Father Damien|Damien]], who worked with lepers on the Hawaiian island of Molokai, to [[Oprah Winfrey]], a model of shrewd and skillful action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/books/books.php?id=16746 |title= ''Buddha Is As Buddha Does'' - Book review |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diydharma.org/buddha-buddha-does-part-1-how-be-bodhisattva-lama-surya-das-and-ken-wilber |title= ''Buddha Is As Buddha Does''  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The journal was first published in 1981 by the East-West Religions Project at the [[University of Hawaii]] after it hosted a conference in Honolulu in June 1980. [[David W. Chappell]] (University of Hawaii) served as founding [[editor-in-chief]], working with [[Roger Corless]] and other founding contributors. The [[University of Hawaii Press]] began distributing the journal in 1984 and became the publisher in 1988. In 1996, the editorship passed to Terry C. Muck and [[Rita M. Gross]]. In 2006, the editorship passed to [[Francis Tiso]] of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. In 2009, [[Mahinda Deegalle]] ([[Bath Spa University]]) became editor. In 2012, Wakoh Shannon Hickey began editing the journal. In 2013, she was joined by co-editor C. Denise Yarbrough.

The '''Cambridge Platform''' is a statement describing the system of church government in the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]] of [[colonial New England]]. It was written in 1648 in response to [[Presbyterian]] criticism and in time became regarded as the religious constitution of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts]]. The platform explained and defended [[congregational polity]] as practiced in New England and also endorsed most of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]]. The document was shaped most directly by the thinking of [[Puritan]] ministers [[Richard Mather]] and [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].

==Background==
The [[Puritans]] who settled [[colonial New England]] were [[Calvinists]] who believed in [[Congregationalist polity|congregational church government]] and that the church should include only [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerated]] persons as full members. Because of this, they became known as Congregationalists and their churches became known as Congregational churches. In New England, Congregationalism was the [[established religion]]—Congregational churches were supported financially by taxation and, in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts]], only Congregational church members could vote.{{Sfn|Walker|1894|pp=114,221}}

In the 1640s, Congregationalism came under increased scrutiny from [[English Presbyterianism|English Presbyterians]], who were gaining power as a result of the [[English Civil War]]. As Calvinists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians were nearly identical in their beliefs with the exception of church government. [[Presbyterian polity]] gave authority to [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] rather than to church members. In addition, Presbyterians did not insist upon a regenerate church membership and allowed all "non-scandalous" churchgoers to receive the [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|Lord's Supper]].{{Sfn|Cooper|1999|p=69}}

In 1645, local Presbyterians led by [[William Vassal]] and [[Robert Child (agriculturalist)|Robert Child]] led a protest against Massachusetts' policies on church membership and voting. Child threatened to take his complaints to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], provoking fear among colonial leaders that the English government might intervene to force Presbyterianism on New England. The Cambridge Synod was called in response to these attacks on Congregationalism.{{Sfn|Cooper|1999|pp=75–76}}

==Synod==
In May 1646, a group of Massachusetts ministers asked the colony's [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] to call for a meeting of the colony's churches for the purpose of establishing a uniform set of practices. Specific points of concern involved church membership and [[Reformed baptismal theology|baptism]] of the children of non-members.{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=145}} The Cambridge [[Synod]] first met on September 1, 1646, and would continue to meet periodically until August 1648 when its work was completed. Its membership included ministers and [[Laity|lay]] delegates from all but four of the 29 churches in Massachusetts, and it also had the support of the 24 churches in the other Puritan colonies of [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]]. Some churches in these colonies also sent ministers and delegates.{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=146}}

The synod tasked [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]], [[Richard Mather]] and Ralph Partridge of Duxbury to each write a model of church government for the group's consideration. Ultimately, Mather's ''Platform of Church Discipline'' was adopted by the synod, and it included much that had been previously written on church government by Mather and Cotton.{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=148}} The General Court also requested that the synod adopt a confession of faith. By this time, the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which had been written by English Puritans, had already been adopted by Parliament. The synod unanimously voted to accept the doctrinal portions of the confession, stating that they "do judge it to be very holy, orthodox, and judicious in all matters of faith; and do therefore freely and fully consent thereunto, for the substance thereof."{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=148}} The synod disagreed with portions of the Confession dealing with presbyterian church polity.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Contents==
===Congregational polity===
The platform is organized into a preface and 17 chapters. The preface, written by John Cotton, counters various criticisms leveled against the New England churches and defends their [[orthodoxy]].{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=148}} The first four chapters explain that [[congregational polity]] is the only form of church government authorized in the [[Bible]].{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=148}} 

A Congregational church is defined as "a company of saints by calling, united into one body by a holy covenant, for the public worship of God, and the mutual edification one of another, in the fellowship of the Lord Jesus."{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=51}} A local church is a "visible political union" that saints enter into by voluntary, mutual consent on the basis of a [[church covenant]].{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=54}} This distinguished the Congregationalists from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Church of England]], in which everyone within a certain region was given membership in the church.{{Sfn|Miller|1991|p=59}}

The platform states that a church should operate under a [[mixed government]], with elements of [[monarchy]] ([[Jesus Christ]] is [[Kingly office of Christ|king]] and [[head of the church]]), [[democracy]] (congregational governance) and [[aristocracy]] (rule by officers).{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=64}} The authority given to the congregation includes choosing its own officers, admitting new church members, public [[censure]], [[excommunication]], and restoration to church fellowship.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=65}}

===Church officers===
The two offices are [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] and [[deacon]].{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=148}} Furthermore, there were two types of elders: [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s (who could hold the title of [[pastor]] or teacher depending on their specific roles) and [[Laity|lay]] elders (called [[ruling elders]]).{{Sfn|Cooper|1999|p=26}} Both pastors and teachers can administer sacraments and execute church discipline, but pastors "attend to exhortation, and therein to administer a word of wisdom", while teachers "attend to doctrine, and therein to administer a word of knowledge".{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=58}} 

Ruling elders, together with the ministers, are responsible for overseeing the spiritual affairs of the church, including examining any potential officers or members before being approved by the church, ordaining officers chosen by the church, receiving and preparing accusations to be presented to the church, pronouncing sentence of censure or excommunication with consent of the church, moderating church business meetings, acting as guides and leaders in church administration, and admonishing church members when needed.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=59,66}} Deacons oversee the worldly or financial affairs of the church, which include collecting contributions and gifts, paying the ministers and distributing charity to the poor. In addition to the two offices, the platform also states that elderly widows may also have a ministry within the church, including "giving attendance to the sick, and to give succor unto them, and others in the like necessities."{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=60}}

Church members elect their officers and can depose them as well.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=61}} The platform recommends that when possible neighboring churches be consulted concerning the trial of officers. It rejects any right of government officials, [[diocesan bishop]]s or [[Advowson|patrons]] to appoint church officers.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=62}} After election, officers are to be ordained by [[laying on of hands]], prayer and [[fasting]]; nevertheless, the platform notes that it is election that makes one an officer, not ordination. Normally, elders are to perform the laying on of hands. If a church lacked elders, however, church members themselves could ordain their officers or the church could invite elders from neighboring churches to perform the ordination.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=63}}

===Church membership===
Chapter 12 requires that persons who wish to become church members must first be examined by the elders for evidence of [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] of sin and [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in Jesus Christ. The person would then be expected to give a "relation" or public account of their [[Puritans#Conversion|conversion experience]] before the entire congregation prior to becoming a member. Those who suffered from "excessive fear or infirmity" could give their confession to the elders in private, however.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=63}} Those who were baptized as children are also required to be examined before they can exercise the privileges of full membership, such as participating in the Lord's Supper.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|p=71}} 

Chapter 13 describes procedures for transferring from one Congregational church to another, and chapter 14 describes procedures for censuring and excommunicating members who refuse to repent of offenses.{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=148}}

===Relations with other churches and the state===
Though distinct and without authority over one another, the platform affirms that Congregational churches should maintain [[Communion (religion)|communion]] with each other. Six ways of showing the communion of churches are identified:
# taking thought for each other's welfare
# consulting on any topic or cause where another church has more familiarity or information about a topic
# admonishing another church, even to the point of convening a synod of neighboring churches and ceasing communion with the offending church
# allowing members of one church to fully participate and receive the Lord's Supper in another church
# sending letters of recommendation when a member goes to a new church, due to a seasonal or permanent relocation
# financial support for poor churches{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|pp=78–80}} 

Congregational churches may call for elders and other congregational representatives to meet together in a synod or church council to argue, debate and determine matters of religion. Civil authorities may also call synods to provide religious advice and counsel. Because each Congregational church is self-governing, synods can only advise and recommend. Synods cannot exercise jurisdiction or authority over a local church.{{Sfn|Cambridge Platform|1648|pp=81–82}} 

Chapter 17 affirms that church officers many not interfere with the civil government nor government officials with the church. However, the government should punish [[idolatry]], [[blasphemy]], [[heresy]], and "the venting of corrupt and pernicious opinions".{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=149}}

==Use and influence==
The Cambridge Platform was completed by the synod in 1648 and commended by the General Court as an accurate description of Congregational practice after the churches were given time to study the document, provide feedback, and finally ratify it. While the platform was legally nonbinding and intended only to be descriptive, it soon became regarded by ministers and lay people alike as the religious constitution of Massachusetts, guaranteeing the rights of church officers and members.{{Sfn|Cooper|1999|p=79–84}} 

Congregational minister [[Albert Elijah Dunning]] wrote that it was "the most important document produced by the Congregationalists of the seventeenth century, for it most clearly represents the belief of the churches and their system of government for more than one hundred years."{{Sfn|Dunning|1894|p=149}} In Connecticut, it would be replaced by the [[Saybrook Platform]] of 1708, which moved the Congregational churches closer to a presbyterian form of government.{{Sfn|Walker|1894|pp=207–208}}

The document has real ramifications for the polity of some denominations today. For example, the congregations of the [[United Church of Christ]] and [[Unitarian Universalist]] churches, and other modern-day descendants of the Puritan churches, continue to claim congregational polity as their local church organization, but have created large denominational administrations to maintain ministerial oversight and promote intradenominational communication.  When some [[Churches of the Standing Order]] in [[New England]] became [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] following the [[Unitarian Controversy]], they kept a congregational polity. That polity continued to deeply influence the polity and organization of the American Unitarian Association, and, in turn, that of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]—an organization that, while radically different theologically than the signers of the 1648 document, nonetheless shares a great deal of the same polity.

Its influence extended beyond what is today the United States. The platform helped shape the [[Savoy Declaration]] of 1658 produced by English Congregationalists.{{Sfn|Bremer|2008|p=139}}

{{Thomism}}
'''Concupiscence''' (from [[Late Latin]] noun ''concupiscentia'', from the Latin verb ''[[:wikt:concupiscere|concupiscere]]'', from ''con-'', "with", here an intensifier, + ''cupi(d)-'', "desiring" + ''-escere'', a verb-forming suffix denoting beginning of a process or state) is an ardent, usually sensual, longing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Concupiscence&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=Concupiscence – Define Concupiscence at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Catholic theology]], concupiscence is seen as a desire of the lower appetite contrary to reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04208a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Concupiscence|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nine occurrences of ''concupiscence'' in the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]] 4:12, [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 7:7, Romans 7:8, [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] 3:5, [[Epistle of James]] 1:14, James 1:15, [[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] 1:4, and 1 John 2:17.
&lt;/ref&gt; and three occurrences in the ''[[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 7:8, [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] 3:5 and [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|I Thessalonians]] 4:5.
&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also one of the English translations of the [[Koine Greek]] epithumia (ἐπιθυμία),&lt;ref&gt;"epithumia" is also translated as wish or desire (or in a biblical context, longing, lust, passion, covetousness, or impulse).  See [[wikt:επιθυμία]].&lt;/ref&gt; which occurs 38 times in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark 4:19, Luke 22:15, John 8:44, Romans 1:24, Romans 6:12, Romans 7:7,8, Romans 13:14, Galatians 5:16,24, Ephesians 2:3, Ephesians 4:22, Philippians 1:23, Colossians 3:5, 1Thessalonians 2:17, 1Thessalonians 4:5, 1Timothy 6:9, 2Timothy 2:22, 2Timothy 3:6, 2Timothy 4:3, Titus 2:12, Titus 3:3, James 1:14,15, 1Peter 1:14, 1Peter 2:11, 1Peter 4:2,3, 2Peter 1:4, 2Peter 2:10,18, 2Peter 3:3, 1John 2:16(twice),17, Jude 1:16,18, and Revelation 18:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish roots==
In Judaism, there is an early concept of ''[[yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew: יצר הרע for "evil inclination"). This concept is the inclination of humanity at creation to do evil or violate the [[will of God]]. The ''yetzer hara'' is not the product of [[original sin]] as in Christian theology, but the tendency of humanity to misuse the natural survival needs of the physical body. Therefore, the natural need of the body for food becomes [[gluttony]], the command to procreate becomes sexual sin, the demands of the body for rest become [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]], and so on.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Judaism, the ''yetzer hara'' is a natural part of God's creation, and God provides guidelines and commands to help us master this tendency. This doctrine was clarified in the [[Sifre]] around 200-350 CE. In Jewish doctrine, it is possible for humanity to overcome the ''yetzer hara''. Therefore, for the Jewish mindset, it is possible for humanity to choose good over evil, and it is the person's duty to choose good  (see: Sifrei on Deuteronomy, P. Ekev 45, Kidd. 30b).

==Augustine==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Involuntary [[sexual arousal]] is explored in the [[Confessions (Augustine)|''Confessions'']] of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], wherein he used the term "concupiscence" to refer to [[Christian views on sin|sinful]] [[lust]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/19/how-st-augustine-invented-sex |title=How St. Augustine Invented Sex |first=Stephen |last=Greenblatt |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |date=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that Adam's sin&lt;ref&gt;Augustine taught that Adam's sin was both an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') and of pride and disobedience to God of Adam and Eve. He thought it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: self-centeredness or failure in seeing truth. Augustine wrote to [[Julian of Eclanum]]: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit'' (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; PL 44, 795). This particular sin would not have taken place if [[Satan]] had not sown into their senses ''"the root of evil"'' (''radix Mali''): ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus'' (''Contra Julianum'', I, 9.42; PL 44, 670)&lt;/ref&gt; is transmitted by concupiscence, or "hurtful desire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talentshare.org/~mm9n/articles/sindeath/3.htm ORIGINAL SIN]- Biblical Apologetic Studies - Retrieved 17 May 2014.  Augustine of Hippo (354–430) taught that Adam's sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or "hurtful desire", sexual desire and all sensual feelings resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Nicholson - [https://books.google.com/books?id=MeOx95oNQ9YC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=concupiscence,+or+%22hurtful+desire%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=625Trlcg97&amp;sig=s0voWp6ENrROdPRPxKOVKAKHcSM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7Lx2U67yH42NqgatjYHwCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=concupiscence%2C%20or%20%22hurtful%20desire%22&amp;f=false A Plain But Full Exposition of the Catechism of the Church of England... (Google eBook)] page 118. Retrieved 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in humanity becoming a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], not a [[Psychology|psychological]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]] explained Augustine's doctrine pointing out that the ''libido'' (''concupiscence''), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a ''libido actualis'', i.e. sexual lust, but ''libido habitualis'', i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature: ''Libido quae transmittit peccatum originale in prolem, non est libido actualis, quia dato quod virtute divina concederetur alicui quod nullam inordinatam libidinem in actu generationis sentiret, adhuc transmitteret in prolem originale peccatum. Sed libido illa est intelligenda habitualiter, secundum quod appetitus sensitivus non continetur sub ratione vinculo originalis iustitiae. Et talis libido in omnibus est aequalis'' (STh Iª–IIae q. 82 a. 4 ad 3).&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not ''a being'' but a ''bad quality'', the [[privation of good]] or a wound.&lt;ref&gt;''Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor''. (''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', I, 25. 28; PL 44, 430; cf. ''Contra Julianum'', VI, 18.53; PL 44, 854; ibid. VI, 19.58; PL 44, 857; ibid., II, 10.33; PL 44, 697; ''Contra Secundinum Manichaeum'', 15; PL 42, 590.&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted that sexual concupiscence (''libido'') might have been present in the perfect human nature in [[paradise]], and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine wrote to [[Julian of Eclanum]]: ''Quis enim negat futurum fuisse concubitum, etiamsi peccatum non praecessisset? Sed futurus fuerat, sicut aliis membris, ita etiam genitalibus voluntate motis, non libidine concitatis; aut certe etiam ipsa libidine – ut non vos de illa nimium contristemus – non qualis nunc est, sed ad nutum voluntarium serviente'' (Contra Julianum, IV. 11. 57; PL 44, 766). See also his late work: ''Contra secundam Iuliani responsionem imperfectum opus'', II, 42; PL 45,1160; ibid. II, 45; PL 45,1161; ibid., VI, 22; PL 45, 1550–1551. Cf.{{cite book|title=Le mariage chrétien dans l'oeuvre de Saint Augustin. Une théologie baptismale de la vie conjugale|last=Schmitt|first=É.|year=1983|series =Études Augustiniennes| location=Paris|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustine's view (termed "Realism"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit.

==Pelagius==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
The main opposition came from a monk named [[Pelagius]] (354–420 or 440). His views became known as [[Pelagianism]]. Although the writings of Pelagius are no longer extant, the eight canons of the [[Council of Carthage (418)]] provided corrections to the perceived errors of the early Pelagians. From these corrections, there is a strong similarity between Pelagians and their Jewish counterparts on the concepts of concupiscence. Pelagianism gives mankind the ability to choose between good and evil within their created nature. While rejecting concupiscence, and embracing a concept similar to the ''yetzer hara'', these views rejected humanity's universal need for grace.

==Catholic teaching==
The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (CCC) teaches that Adam and Eve were constituted in an original "state of holiness and justice" (CCC 375, 376 398), free from concupiscence (CCC 377). The preternatural state enjoyed by Adam and Eve afforded endowments with many prerogatives which, while pertaining to the natural order, were not due to human nature as such. Principal among these were a high degree of infused knowledge, bodily immortality and freedom from pain, and immunity from evil impulses or inclinations. In other words, the lower or animal nature in man was perfectly subject to the control of reason, and the will subject to God. Besides this, the Catholic Church teaches that our first parents were also endowed with sanctifying grace by which they were elevated to the supernatural order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14519a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The Garden of Eden|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By sinning, however, Adam lost this original "state", not only for himself but for all human beings (CCC 416).

According to Catholic theology man has not lost his natural faculties: by the sin of Adam he has been deprived only of the Divine gifts to which his nature had no strict right: the complete mastery of his passions, exemption from death, sanctifying grace, and the vision of God in the next life. The Creator, whose gifts were not due to the human race, had the right to bestow them on such conditions as he wished and to make their conservation depend on the fidelity of the head of the family. A prince can confer a hereditary dignity on condition that the recipient remains loyal, and that, in case of his rebelling, this dignity shall be taken from him and in consequence from his descendants. It is not, however, intelligible that the prince, on account of a fault committed by a father, should order the hands and feet of all the descendants of the guilty man to be cut off immediately after their birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Original Sin|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of original sin, according to Catholics, human nature has ''not'' been totally corrupted (as opposed to the teaching of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]]); rather, human nature has only been weakened and wounded, subject to ignorance, suffering, the domination of death, and the inclination to sin and evil (CCC 405, 418). This inclination toward sin and evil is called "concupiscence" (CCC 405, 418). [[Baptism]], CCC teaches, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God.  The inclination toward sin and evil persists, however, and he must continue to struggle against concupiscence (CCC 2520).

It should be noted that in this evolutionary era Catholic teaching on original sin focuses more on its results than on its origins. As Cardinal Ratzinger had intimated in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://novusordowatch.org/cardinal-ratzinger-denies-original-sin/|title="Cardinal" Ratzinger denies Original Sin|website=Novus Ordo Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Pope Benedict XVI]] clarified in 2008: "How did it happen? This remains obscure.... Evil remains mysterious. It is presented as such in great images, as it is in chapter 3 of Genesis, with that scene of the two trees, of the serpent, of sinful man: a great image that makes us guess but cannot explain what is itself illogical."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20081203.html|title=General Audience of 3 December 2008: Saint Paul (15). The Apostle’s teaching on the relation between Adam and Christ {{!}} BENEDICT XVI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic and Protestant differences==
The primary difference between [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology and most of the many different [[Protestant]] theologies on the issue of concupiscence is whether it can be classified as sin by its own nature. Different Protestant denominations tend to see concupiscence as sin itself, an act of the sinner.  The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that while it is highly likely to cause sin, concupiscence is not sin itself.  Rather, it is "the tinder for sin" which "cannot harm those who do not consent" ([[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 1264).&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', New York: Doubleday Publications, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

This difference is intimately tied with the different traditions on [[original sin]]. Much Protestant theology holds that the original [[Wiktionary:prelapsarian|prelapsarian]] nature of humanity was an innate tendency to good; the special relationship [[Adam and Eve]] enjoyed with God was due not to some supernatural gift, but to their own natures. Hence, in some Protestant traditions, the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] was not the destruction of a supernatural gift, leaving humanity's nature to work unimpeded, but rather the corruption of that nature itself. Since the present nature of humans is corrupted from their original nature, it follows that it is not good, but rather evil (although some good may still remain). Thus, in some Protestant traditions, concupiscence is evil in itself. The [[Thirty-nine articles]] of the Church of England state that "the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Articles|title=Common Prayer|year=1562|author=Church of England|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Catholicism, while also maintaining that [[original righteousness|humanity's original nature is good]] (CCC 374), teaches that even after this gift [[original sin|was lost after the Fall]], human nature still cannot be called evil, because it remains a natural creation of God. Despite the fact that humans sin, [[Catholic theology]] teaches that human nature itself is not the ''cause'' of sin, although once it comes into contact with sin it may produce more sin.

The difference in views also extends to the relationship between concupiscence and original sin.

Another reason for the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their position on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the [[Magisterial Reformation|magisterial]] reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin even if it is not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The [[Scholastics]] and magisterial reformers have different views on the issue of what is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of [[free will|will]] or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be.

Some Protestants believe that concupiscence is the primary type of sin; thus they might refer to it simply as sin, or, to distinguish it from particular sinful acts, as "humanity's sinful nature." Thus, ''concupiscence'' as a distinct term is more likely to be used by Catholics.

==Sensuality==
[[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century described two divisions of "sensuality":  the ''concupiscible'' (pursuit/avoidance instincts) and the ''irascible'' (competition/aggression/defense instincts). With the former are associated the [[wikt:emotion|emotion]]s of [[joy]] and [[wikt:sadness|sadness]], [[wikt:love|love]] and [[wikt:hate|hate]], [[wikt:desire|desire]] and [[Wiktionary:repugnance|repugnance]]; with the latter, [[wikt:daring|daring]] and [[wikt:fear|fear]], [[wikt:hope|hope]] and [[wiktionary:despair|despair]], [[wikt:anger|anger]].

==Islam==
[[Al-Ghazali]] in the 11th century discussed concupiscence from an Islamic perspective in his book ''[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat]]'' (''The Alchemy of Happiness''), and also mentioned it in ''The Deliverer from Error.'' In this book, amongst other things, he discusses how to reconcile the concupiscent and the irascible souls, balancing them to achieve happiness. Concupiscence is related to the term "[[nafs]]" in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/tah/index.htm|title=The Alchemy of Happiness Index|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of al-Andalus}}
{{History of Spain}}

A '''''converso''''' ({{IPA-es|komˈbeɾso|lang}}; {{IPA-pt|kõˈvɛɾsu|lang}}; feminine form '''''conversa'''''), "a convert", ({{Etymology|la|{{smallcaps|conversvs}}|converted, turned around}}) was a [[Jew]] who converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]], particularly during the 14th and 15th centuries, or one of their descendants.

The majority of Spain's Jews converted to Christianity as a result of the [[pogroms]] in 1391. Those who remained openly practising Jews were expelled by the [[Catholic monarchs]] [[Ferdinand I of Spain|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Spain|Isabella]] in the [[Alhambra decree]] in 1492, following the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'' (reconquest) of Spain. However, even a significant proportion of these remaining practising Jews chose to join the already large ''converso'' community rather than face exile. In order to safe-guard the [[Old Christian]] population and make sure that ''converso'' "[[New Christians]]" were true to their new faith, the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition]] was established in Spain in 1481.&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Gojman de Backal, "Conversos" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, vol. 1, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conversos'' who did not fully or genuinely embrace Catholicism, but continued to practise [[Crypto-Judaism|Judaism in secrecy]] were referred to as ''judaizantes'' ("[[Judaizers]]") and pejoratively as ''[[marrano]]s'' ("swine").

[[New Christian]] converts of [[Muslim]] origin were known as ''[[morisco]]s''. Unlike ''marranos'', ''moriscos'' were subject to an edict of expulsion even after their conversion to Catholicism, which was implemented severely in the eastern region of Valencia and less so in other parts of Spain.

Conversos played an important role in the 1520-1521 [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], a popular uprising and civil war centered in the region of Castile against the imperial pretensions of the Spanish monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5446436&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Ferrand Martinez]], Archdeacon of [[Ecijia]], directed a 13-year [[anti-Semitic]] campaign that began in 1378. Martinez used a series of provocative sermons, through which he openly condemned the Jews with little to no opposition. He rallied non-Jews against the Jews by creating a constant state of fear through riots. Martinez’s efforts led to a series of outbreaks on June 4, 1391,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lea|first=Henry Charles|date=1896-01-01|title=Ferrand Martinez and the Massacres of 1391|jstor=1833647|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=1|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.2307/1833647}}&lt;/ref&gt; where several synagogues in Seville were burned to the ground and churches were erected in their place. Amidst this outbreak, many Jews fled the country, some converted to Christianity in fear, and some were sold to Muslims. Martinez set in motion the largest forced mass conversion of Jews in Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both the Church and the Crown had not anticipated such a large-scale conversion stemming from an unplanned anti-Semitic campaign led by Ferrand Martinez. The new converts, most of whom were forced, due to their large numbers, were victims of a new problem. A problem that temporarily solved the Jewish presence in Spain, however, led to the creation of a new group that was neither completely Catholic or Jewish.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heretics or Daughters of Israel|last=Melammed|first=Renee|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3–10, 86–95, 166–174|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversos, who were now fully privileged citizens, competed in all aspects of the economic sphere. This resulted in a new wave of racial anti-Semitism that was targeted at the conversos. This anti-Semitism evolved into small and large riots in Toledo, 1449, that now oppressed not the Jews by the Christians, but the New Christians (conversos) by the Old Christians. Thus, the Crown established a National Inquisition in 1478, that would test the loyalty and purity of a newly baptized Christian (converso). Due to continued oppression, some Jews and conversos fled Spain, others created a community that ensure the survival of Judaism in the Iberian Peninsula, although outwardly practising Christianity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Perpetuation of Jewish heritage ==
Conversas played a pivotal role in keeping Jewish traditions alive by observing many Jewish holidays like Shabbat. Conversas also cooked and baked traditional Jewish dishes in honor of the [[Sabbath]] (starting on Friday sundown), [[Yom Kippur]], and other religious holidays. During festivals like [[Sukkot]] and [[Passover]], Conversas participated by giving clothing articles and ornaments to Jewish women, they also attended a [[seder]] or obtained a baking [[matzah]]. Conversas also ensured that their household maintained similar dietary regulations as their Jewish counterparts, they did so by eating only [[kosher]] birds and other animals. Conversas also financially contributed to the growth of the Jewish/Converso community and synagogue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Jewish community and the conversos exchanged books and knowledge, Jews taught conversos how to read to ensure a constant growth of their Jewish heritage. In order to take a stance against the church and its principles, some conversos performed professional work even on Sundays.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The traditional Jewish [[Purim]] was kept by the conversos in disguise of a Christian holiday, they named it: "[[Festival of Santa Esterica]]".

==Description==
''Conversos'' were subject to suspicion and harassment from both what was left of the community they were leaving and that which they were joining.&lt;ref&gt;A very recent book that highlights such issues in the sixteenth century is James Nelson Novoa, ''Being the Nação in the Eternal City: New Christian Lives in Sixteenth-Century Rome'' (Peterborough: Baywolf Press, 2014); https://books.google.com/books?id=KcFMBAAAQBAJ&lt;/ref&gt; Both Christians and Jews called them ''tornadizo'' (renegade). [[James I of Aragon|James I]], [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] and [[John I of Castile|John I]] passed laws forbidding the use of this epithet. This was part of a larger pattern of royal oversight, as laws were promulgated to protect their property, forbid attempts to convert them back to Judaism or the Muslim faith, and regulate their behavior, preventing their cohabitation or even dining with Jews, lest they convert back.

Conversos did not enjoy legal equality. [[Alfonso VII of León|Alfonso VII]] prohibited the "recently converted" from holding office in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. They had supporters and bitter opponents in the Christian secular of general acceptance, yet they became targets of occasional pogroms during times of social tension (as during an epidemic and after an earthquake). They were subject to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition|Portuguese inquisitions]].

While "pure blood" (so-called ''[[limpieza de sangre]]''), free of the "taint" of non-Christian lineage, would come to be placed at a premium, particularly among the nobility, in a 15th-century defense of ''conversos'', Bishop [[Lope de Barrientos]] would list what Roth calls "a veritable 'Who's Who' of Spanish nobility" as having ''converso'' members or being of ''converso'' descent. He pointed out that given the near-universal conversion of Iberian Jews during [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] times, (quoting Roth) "[W]ho among the Christians of Spain could be certain that he is not a descendant of those ''conversos''?"{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

With advances in science able to trace individuals' ancestry via their DNA, according to a widely publicized study (December 2008) in the ''American Journal of Human Genetics'',  modern Spaniards (and Portuguese) have an average admixture of 19.8 percent from ancestors originating in the Near East during historic times (i.e. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Jews and Levantine Arabs) - compared to 10.6 percent of North African - Berber admixture.&lt;ref name=pmid19061982&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.11.007 |title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula |year=2008 |last1=Adams |first1=Susan M. |last2=Bosch |first2=Elena |last3=Balaresque |first3=Patricia L. |last4=Ballereau |first4=Stéphane J. |last5=Lee |first5=Andrew C. |last6=Arroyo |first6=Eduardo |last7=López-Parra |first7=Ana M. |last8=Aler |first8=Mercedes |last9=Grifo |first9=Marina S.

== By country ==

=== In Italy ===
Specific groups of conversos left Spain and Portugal after the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1492, in search for better life. They left for other parts of Europe, especially Italy,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Question of Identity: Iberian Conversos in Historical Perspective|last=Melammed|first=Renee Levine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0195170717|location=New York|pages=109–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were inevitably looked at with suspicion and harassment, both in their old and new communities. Subsequently, many conversos who arrived in Italian cities did not openly embrace their Judaism, since they were tempted by the advantages they could seek in the Christian world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The first three cities to accept the conversos who openly converted back to Judaism, were Florence, Ferrara and Ancona. Most of these conversos appeared after 1536 from Portugal, and most lived in [[Florence]]. In 1549, [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Duke Cosimo de Medici]] allowed the Portuguese conversos to trade and reside within Florence. Most of the re-converted Jews lived in the ghetto of Florence, and by 1705 there were 453 Jews in the city.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conversos arrived to [[Ferrara]] in 1535, and were able to assimilate with their neighbors, perform circumcisions, and return openly to Judaism, due to the [[Letters patent|Lettres Patentes]] issued by [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke Ercole II]]. After the plague in 1505 and the eventual fall of Ferrara in 1551, many of these Jews relocated North towards the economically stable ports in Venice. Venice slowly became a center for conversos who either stopped temporarily on their way to Turkey, or stayed permanently as residents in the ghetto Jewish community port. Venetian leaders were convinced to openly accept conversos to practice Judaism, because they recognized that if conversos were not welcome in Venice, they would take their successful trades to the country’s economic rival of Turkey. A Portuguese converso in Venice, named Abraham de Almeda, connected strongly with Christianity, however, turned to the Jewish members of his family when in need for financial for moral support. As a result, many of the conversos during this period struggled with their Christian and Jewish identities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conversos in the city of [[Ancona]] faced difficult lives living under the pope, and eventually fled to Ferrara in 1555. Portuguese conversos in Ancona were falsely misled that they were welcome to Ancona and that they could openly convert back to Judaism. Their fate was overturned by the succeeding pope, [[Pope Paul IV]]. The conversos in Ancona faced traumatic emotional damage after the pope imprisoned 102 conversos who refused to reside in the ghetto and wear badges to distinguish themselves. In 1588, when the duke granted a charter of residence in return for the conversos building up the city’s economy, they refused, due to accumulated skepticism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Corpus Mysticum: Essai sur L'Eucharistie et l’Église au moyen âge''''' was a book written by [[Henri de Lubac]], published in [[Paris]] in 1944. The book aimed to, in de Lubac's words, retrieve the doctrine that "the Church makes the [[eucharist]] and the eucharist makes the church".&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'' (2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book traces patristic and medieval uses of the Latin phrase ''corpus mysticum'' ("mystical body"). In de Lubac's time, especially as evidenced in [[Pope Pius XII]]'s 1943 encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'', this phrase was typically used to refer to the Church as the "mystical body" of Christ.

From his historical study, however, de Lubac argued that the phrase ''corpus mysticum'' referred initially to Christ's ''eucharistic'' body, and not to the visible Church as an institution. This association had been lost in the late medieval period. De Lubac argued that it was important to recover the pre-modern understanding of ''corpus mysticum'', according to which Christ should be regarded as mystically present and at work where and when the eucharist was being celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'' (2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac's argument did not have great immediate impact, but was hugely influential in the eucharistic ecclesiology developed (or rehabilitated) at [[Vatican II]].

'''''{{transl|ar|ALA|Da‘wah}}''''' (also '''''daawa''''', '''''daawah''''' or '''''dakwah'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dakwah (Malaysia) |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e480 |website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |accessdate=2 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahin |first1=Audrey |title=Historical Dictionary of Indonesia |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9780810874565 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YcuhCgAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left:1px"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; {{lang-ar|دعوة}} "invitation") is the [[Proselytism|proselytizing or preaching]] of [[Islam]].

== Etymology ==
''Da‘wah'' literally means "issuing a summons" or "making an invitation". Grammatically, the word represents a [[gerund]] of a verb with the  [[triconsonantal root]] ''d-ʕ-w'' {{lang|ar|دعو}} meaning variously "to summon" or "to invite" . A [[Muslim]] who practices ''da‘wah'', either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dā‘ī}}'' ({{lang|ar|داعي}}, plural ''{{transl|ar|ALA|du‘āh}}''/''{{transl|ar|ALA|du‘āt}}'' {{lang|ar|دعاة}}).

A ''dā‘ī'', as a person who invites people to understand Islam through [[dialogue]], may be regarded{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a [[missionary]] inviting people to the faith, prayer and manner of Islamic life.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Islam ==

The term ''da'wah'' has other senses in the [[Qur'an]]. In ''[[sura]]'' (chapter) 30:25, for example, it denotes the call to the [[Resurrection of the dead|dead to rise]] on the [[Day of Judgment]]. When used in the Qur'an, it generally refers to [[Allah]]'s invitation to live according to His will. Thus, when used in the first centuries of Islam, it usually referred to that message and was sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[Sharia|sharī‘a]]'' and ''[[Deen (Arabic term)|dīn]]''.

''Da‘wah'' is also described as the duty to "actively encourage fellow Muslims in the pursuance of greater piety in all aspects of their lives", a definition which has become central to [[contemporary Islamic thought]].&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Islam"&gt;See entry for ''da‘wah'' in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==During Muhammad's era==

Some men came to Muhammad and requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam,&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 187"/&gt; but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah, who wanted revenge for the [[Expedition of Abdullah Ibn Unais|assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan]] (Chief of the [[Banu Lahyan]] tribe) by Muhammad's followers.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite book|author=Watt, W.

===Post-Muhammad===
After Muhammad's death in 632, from the available historical evidence, it appears that after Muhammad's death Muslims did not immediately embark upon da'wa activities—during and after the rapid conquests of the Byzantine and Persian lands, they ventured little if at all to preach to local non-Muslims. Da'wa came into wider usage almost a hundred years after Muhammad's death, in the wake of 'Abbasid propaganda against the then ruling Umayyad clan in the 720s. However, the 'Abbasid da'wa ceased as soon as the 'Abbasids were in power—a fact that attests to its political nature. Da'wa as a truly missionary activity, albeit still within the Muslim Umma, appeared in the form of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] da'wa of the 9th through 13th centuries. Isma'ilis, in many ways, can be seen as the pioneers of the organized Muslim missionary activities: their highly institutionalized and sophisticated da'wa structure has hardly been repeated until today. Moreover, for the Isma'ilis, da'wa was a state priority. The Isma'ili da'wa encompassed extra- and intra-ummatic forms and blended both theology and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[Racius, Egdunas. "Blending of Politics and the Islamic Da'Wa." Politologija.2 (2005): 91–122. ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

In [[Islamic theology]], the purpose of ''da‘wah'' is to invite people, Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the worship of God as expressed in the Qur'an and the ''[[sunnah]]'' of the [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and to inform them about Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam quote"&gt;"''Da‘wah'' produces converts to Islam, which in turn [increases] the size of the Muslim ''[[Ummah]]'' [community of Muslims]."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Da'wah'' as the "Call towards God" is the means by which Muhammad began spreading the message of the Qur'an to mankind. After Muhammad, his followers and the ''[[Ummah]]'' (Muslim community) assumed responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Islam"/&gt; They convey the message of the Qur'an by providing information on why and how the Qur'an preaches [[Tawhid|monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Qur'an ''[[Ayah|ayat]]'' (verses) 6:19 and 16:36.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad saw Islam as the true religion and mission of all earlier prophets.  He believed that their call had been limited to their own people but that his was universal. His mission as the final prophet was to repeat to the whole world this call and invitation (dawa) to Islam.  Muhammad wrote to various non-Muslim rulers, inviting them to convert.&lt;ref&gt;[Sookhdeo Patrick, and Murray, Douglas. 2014. Dawa: The Islamic Strategy for Reshaping the Modern World. Isaac Publishing.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proselytism ==

The importance of ''Dawah'' has been emphasised many times in the Quran:

{{Quote| Who is better in speech than one who calls to Allah, does righteous deeds and says indeed I am among the Muslims.|Quran |Sura 41 (HAA-meem-shisdah), ayah 33&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|41|33|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|You are the best nation raised up for humankind. You enjoin righteousness, forbid corruption and you believe in [[Allah]].|Quran |Sura 3 (Al-Imran), ayah 110&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|110|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Let there arise among you a group inviting to all that is good, enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. Those are the successful ones.|Quran |Sura 3 (Al-Imran), ayah 104&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|104|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good preaching.|Quran |Sura 16 (An-Nahl), ayah 125&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|125|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''[[Hadith]]'' ("sayings") of [[Muhammad]], ''dawah'' is mentioned to emphasise importance and virtues:

: "Whoever directs someone to do good will gain the same reward as the one who does good."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, {{vol.|3}}, {{p.|1050}}, {{no.|4665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Whoever calls to guidance will receive the same reward as the one who follows him without any decrease in the reward of his follower."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, {{vol.|4}}, {{p.|1406}}, {{no.|6470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: "For Allah to guide someone by your hand is better for you than having red camels."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al Bukhari, {{vol.|4}}, {{pp.|156|7}}, {{no.|253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|ancient Arabia]], [[camel]]s{{spaced ndash}}especially of a reddish hue{{spaced ndash}}were considered particularly valuable property.)
: "Convey from me, even if it be only a single verse."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari, {{vol.|4}}, {{p.|442}}, {{no.|667}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad]] sent [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] to [[Yemen]] and told him “You will be going to Christians and Jews, so the first thing you should invite them to is the assertion of the oneness of Allah, Most High. If they realize that, then inform them that Allah has made five daily prayers obligatory on them. If they pray them, then inform them that Allah has made the payment of charity from their wealth obligatory on their rich to be given to their poor. If they accept that, then take it from them and avoid the best part of people’s property.”&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari, {{vol.|9}}, {{pp.|348|9}}, {{no.|469}} and Sahih Muslim, {{vol.|1}}, {{pp.|15}}, {{no.|28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proselytizing methods ==

===Gentleness===
With regard to Muhammad's mild nature in preaching [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And by the mercy of Allah you dealt with them gently. If you were harsh and hardhearted, they would have fled from around you. (Quran {{cite quran|3|159|s=ns|b=n}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Quran says about [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]] who preached to Pharaoh, the claimant of God:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So speak to him, both of you, mildly in order that he may reflect or fear God. (Quran {{cite quran|20|44|s=ns|b=n}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Muhammad was reported by his wife, [[Aisha]] to have said “Whenever gentleness is in a thing, it beautifies it, and whenever it is withdrawn from something, it defaces.”&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 4, p. 1370, no. 6274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad was quoted by Jareer as saying,“One deprived of gentleness is deprived of all good."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari, {{vol.|4}}, {{p.|1370}}, {{nos.|6270|6271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in politics===
Muslims made it a part of their political theory (through relating da'wa to jihad) and life (using the concept of da'wa in their political agendas). Taken in general, the intertwining of da'wa and politics, then, has been a feature throughout the Muslim history, though practical implications of this have been different in different ages.&lt;ref&gt;Racius, Egdunas. "Blending of Politics and the Islamic Da'Wa." Politologija.2 (2005): 91–122. ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wisdom===
:"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided ...". ''Sura'' "An-Nahl" 16:125.

A classical example of diversion in ''dawah'' can be seen in the case of Prophet [[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]] in prison when two prisoners asked him to interpret their dreams. One of them said: “I saw myself pressing wine.” The other said: “I saw myself carrying bread on my head and birds were eating from it.” They asked: “Inform us of the interpretation of these things. Indeed, we believe you are one of the righteous.” He replied: “Whenever food came to you as your provision, I informed you about it before it came. That is from what my Lord has taught me.... As for one of you, he will pour wine for his lord to drink, and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. This is the case judged concerning which you both inquire.” "[[Yusuf (sura)|Sura Yusuf]]" 12:35–41.

===Speaking a common language===
:“I did not send any messenger except that he spoke the language of his people to explain to them.” ''Sura'' "[[Ibrahim]]" 14:4.

===Location===
Doing ''dawah'' in the right location. For example, [[Mount Safa]] in the time of Muhammad was used for announcements. So Muhammad went there to make his point. He chose that particular location because he knew the people who he was inviting to [[Islam]]. He knew their nature and characteristics, so he chose Mount Safa. He climbed up to its summit and addressed his people saying: “O people of [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]], if I were to tell you there was an army behind this hill would you listen to me?”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kalamullah.com/Books/Dawah.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proselytizing movements ==

Modern ''dawah'' movements are varied in their objectives and activities. Examples include:
* The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] has focused on a methodology of building [[grassroots]] institutions and funding welfare projects, which has helped it survive decades of repression under various dictatorships in many Middle Eastern countries, with the group and its many offshoots still enjoying popular support and power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=30044 32,000 Muslim Brothers Detained Under Old Regime Emergency Law].

* [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] has focused on presenting Islam as a complete way of life and on the methodology of building [[grassroots]] institutions and funding welfare projects.
* [[Tablighi Jamaat]] works on trying to bring the Muslims back to the fundamental practices of Islam such as worship; they do this by encouraging members to speak and to teach them the virtues of good actions. The movement has a following of between 100 and 150 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inter-islam.org/Miscellaneous/jamaat.htm The Tablighi Jamaat Movement]. Inter-islam.org. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ahmed Deedat]] was a notable debater who was a [[revolutionary]] figure among Muslims for his effort in debating Christian polemics. Many Muslim debaters from popular debaters to grassroots ''dawah'' campaigners use his books and videos as reference material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipci.co.za/e-books/ E-Books]. IPCI.

* [[Zakir Naik]] was a student of Ahmed Deedat and followed in his teacher's footsteps by debating Christian polemics and by holding Q&amp;A sessions with Christians. Zakir Naik is particularly notable for taking the effort of debating Christian polemics to the Muslim mainstream with his popular channel [[Peace TV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irf.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=54] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919205448/http://www.irf.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=54|date=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] is a movement which focuses on educating the Muslim masses about the [[Caliphate]] and on establishing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/index.php/EN/def Hizb ut Tahrir]. Hizb ut Tahrir. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[iERA]] is a research institute based in London which seeks to debate Muslim and non-Muslim intellectuals, help new Muslims, train speakers and produce academic research papers on ''dawah'' issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iera.org.uk/ Islamic Education and Research Academy]. iERA. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hikmah Times]] In Singapore there is a significant impact of the Islamic Dawah (Invitation) movement. There are many local/international organisations (e.g. Hikmah Times).
* The [[Deen Mohammad Shaikh]] mission has converted over 110,000 Hindus to [[Islam]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/325623/100000-conversions-and-counting-meet-the-ex-hindu-who-herds-souls-to-the-hereafter/ 100,000 conversions and counting, meet the ex-Hindu who herds souls to the Hereafter]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dream question''' (Hebrew: 'She'elat Halom') is a practice of [[divination]] whereby a person attains a [[prophecy|prophetic]] state while dreaming, receiving a divine answer to a question meditated on before sleep. 

The early medieval master [[Hai Gaon]] notes a method for attaining a dream question involving fasting, purification, and meditation on a text. Based on comments by [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and others, scholar Moshe Idel has identified this text with Exodus 14:19-21, each verse of which contains 72 consonants alluding to a mystical [[gematria|series of Hebrew letters]] said to represent the true name of God. 

In their autobiographical writings from the early 17th century, both mystic [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Hayyim Vital]] and rabbi [[Leon of Modena]] claim matter-of-factly to have asked a dream question.

'''Dāna''' ([[Devanagari]]: दान) is a [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] word that connotes the virtue of generosity, [[charity (practice)|charity]] or giving of [[alms]] in Indian philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0435302993}}, pages 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ckc17/&gt; It is alternatively transliterated as ''daana''.&lt;ref name=shahsoulful&gt;Shah et al (2013), Soulful Corporations: A Values-Based Perspective on Corporate Social Responsibility, Springer, {{ISBN|978-8132212744}}, page 125, Quote: "The concept of Daana (charity) dates back to the Vedic period. The Rig Veda enjoins charity as a duty and responsibility of every citizen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Hasan and J Onyx (2008), Comparative Third Sector Governance in Asia, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1441925961}}, page 227&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], dāna is the practice of cultivating generosity. It can take the form of giving to an individual in distress or need.&lt;ref name=ganguli311/&gt; It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.&lt;ref name=ganguli/&gt;

According to historical records, dāna is an ancient practice in Indian traditions, tracing back to [[Vedic]] traditions.&lt;ref name="shahsoulful"/&gt;&lt;ref name=birunihind/&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
Dāna (Sanskrit: दान) means giving, often in the context of donation and charity.&lt;ref name=sedict&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dAna&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 दान] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In other contexts, such as rituals, it can simply refer to the act of giving something.&lt;ref name=sedict/&gt; Dāna is related to and mentioned in ancient texts with concepts of ''Paropakāra'' (परोपकार) which means benevolent deed, helping others;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=paropakAra&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 परोपकार] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helena Águeda Marujo and Luis Miguel Neto (2013), Positive Nations and Communities, Springer, {{ISBN|978-9400768680}}, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dakshina'' (दक्षिणा) which means gift or fee one can afford;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dakSiNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 दक्षिणा] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bhiksha'' (भिक्षा), which means alms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dakSiNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhikSA] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Garcia Gomez et al. (2014), Religious Perspectives on Human Vulnerability in Bioethics, Springer, {{ISBN|978-9401787352}}, pages 170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.&lt;ref name=kandm3&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 361-382&lt;/ref&gt;

While dāna is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called ''utsarga''. This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facility among others.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, page 54-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in Hindu scriptures===
The ''[[Rigveda]]'' has the earliest discussion of ''dāna'' in the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=rhdana&gt;R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rigveda'' relates it to ''satya'' "truth" and in another hymn points to the guilt one feels from not giving to those in need.&lt;ref name=rhdana/&gt; It uses ''da'', the root of word ''dāna'', in its hymns to refer to the act of giving to those in distress. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]], for example, translates Book 10, Hymn 117 of the Rig veda as follows:
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;The Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape,
The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds none to comfort him,
The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat,
Hardens his heart against him, when of old finds not one to comfort him.

Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food, and the feeble,
Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in future troubles,
No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food, will offer nothing.

Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer pathway,
Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling,
The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food – I speak the truth – shall be his ruin,
He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats with no partaker.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Rigveda]], X.117|&lt;ref name=rthg&gt;[[s:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 117|The Rig Veda]], Mandala 10, Hymn 117, Ralph T. H. Griffith (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Upanishads]], composed before 500 BCE, present some of the earliest Upanishadic discussion of dāna. [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion or love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (dāna).&lt;ref name=kane/&gt;
{{quote|तदेतत्त्रयँ शिक्षेद् दमं दानं दयामिति&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/brinew-proofed_sa.html|title=॥ बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत् ॥|work=sanskritdocuments.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

[[Chandogya Upanishad]], Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] (asceticism), '''dāna''' (charity), arjava (straightforwardness), [[ahimsa]] (non-injury to all sentinent beings) and satyavacana (truthfulness).&lt;ref name=kane&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n61/mode/2up Samanya Dharma], History of Dharmasastra, Vol. 2, Part 1, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' describes the right and wrong forms of ''dāna'' in verses 17.20 through 17.22.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 653-655&lt;/ref&gt; It defines ''sāttvikam'' (good, enlightened, pure) charity, in verse 17.20, as one given without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person. It defines ''rajas'' (passion, ego driven, active) charity, in verse 17.21, as one given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruits and results, or grudgingly. It defines ''tamas'' (ignorant, dark, destructive) charity, in verse 17.22, as one given with contempt, to unworthy person(s), at a wrong place and time. In Book 17, Bhadwad Gita suggests steadiness in ''sattvikam dāna'', or the good form of charity is better; and that ''tamas'' should be avoided.&lt;ref name=ckc17&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 634-661&lt;/ref&gt; These three psychological categories are referred to as the ''[[guṇa]]s'' in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Theos Bernard (1999), Hindu Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813731}}, pages 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adi Parva]]'' of the Hindu Epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes.&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n143/mode/2up Adi Parva], Chapter XCI, verses 3-4, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 87 of ''Adi Parva'', it calls sweet speech and refusal to use harsh words or wrong others even if you have been wronged, as a form of charity. In the ''[[Vana Parva]]'', Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, "conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty".&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n737/mode/2up Vana Parva], Chapter CXCIV, verse 6, page 291&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Anushasana Parva]]'' in Chapter 58, recommends public projects as a form of dāna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data9/upload/0288/145&amp;first=1&amp;last=537&amp;barcode=99999990290213 Anushasana Parva]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062735/http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata9%2Fupload%2F0288%2F145&amp;first=1&amp;last=537&amp;barcode=99999990290213 |date=February 22, 2014 }} The Mahabharata, Translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the building of drinking water tanks for people and cattle as a noble form of giving, as well as giving of lamps for lighting dark public spaces.&lt;ref name=ganguli/&gt; In later sections of Chapter 58, it describes planting public orchards, with trees that give fruits to strangers and shade to travelers, as meritorious acts of benevolent charity.&lt;ref name=ganguli&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/306/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C. Roy (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 59 of Book 13 of the ''Mahabharata'', [[Yudhishthira]] and Bhishma discuss the best and lasting gifts between people:

{{quote|An assurance unto all creatures with love and affection and abstention from every kind of injury, acts of kindness and favor done to a person in distress, whatever gifts are made without the giver's ever thinking of them as gifts made by him, constitute, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest and best of gifts (dāna).|The Mahabharata, XIII.59&lt;ref name=ganguli311&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/310/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LIX] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original: −

The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' discusses when dāna is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures exist in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'', written between 200 BCE and 400 CE, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It discusses charity, dedicating Chapter 23 of Book 1 on Virtues to it.&lt;ref name=gutenberg/&gt; ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' suggests charity is necessary for an virtuous life and happiness. He states in Chapter 23: "Giving to the poor is true charity, all other giving expects some return"; "Great, indeed, is the power to endure hunger.
Greater still is the power to relieve other's hunger"; "Giving alms is a great reward in itself to one who gives".&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=December 16, 2014 }} see Chapter 23, Book 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tirukkural-tirukkural/oclc/777453934?referer=di&amp;ht=edition Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai : Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 101, he states: "Believing wealth is everything, yet giving away nothing, is a miserable state of mind"; "Vast wealth can be a curse to one who neither enjoys it nor gives to the worthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_101.htm Wealth That Benefits No One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216063951/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_101.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} see Chapter 101, Book 1&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Mahabharata, Tirukkuṛaḷ also extends the concept of charity to deeds (body), words (speech) and thoughts (mind). It states that a brightly beaming smile, the kindly light of loving eye, and saying pleasant words with sincere heart is a form of charity that every human being should strive to give.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H. Drew, Rev John Lazarus, and Mr F W Ellis (1886), WH Allen &amp; Company; see section 1.2.6 Verse 93; page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in rituals===
Dāna is also used to refer to [[ritual|rituals]]. For example, in a [[Hindu wedding]], ''kanyādāna'' (कन्यादान) refers to the ritual where a father gives his daughter's hand in marriage to the groom, after asking the groom to promise that he will never fail in his pursuit of [[dharma]] (moral and lawful life), [[artha]] (wealth) and [[kama]] (love). The groom promises to the bride's father, and repeats his promise three times in presence of all gathered as witness.&lt;ref&gt;P.H. Prabhu (2011), Hindu Social Organization, {{ISBN|978-8171542062}}, see pages 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, PV (1974), History of Dharmasastra: Ancient and Medieval Civil Law in India (Vol 2.1), Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. pages 531–538&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of charity includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, godāna (donation of a cow),&lt;ref&gt;Padma (1993), The Position of Women in Mediaeval Karnataka, Prasaranga, University of Mysore Press, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; bhudāna (भूदान) (donation of land), and ''vidyādāna'' or [[jnana|jñānadāna]] (विद्यादान, ज्ञानदान): Sharing knowledge and teaching skills, ''aushadhādāna'' (औषधदान): Charity of care for the sick and diseased, ''abhayadāna''(अभयदान): giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and ''anna dāna'' (अन्नादान): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Abbe Dubois and Henry Beauchamp (2007), Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies, {{ISBN|978-1602063365}}, pages 223, 483-495&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effect of dāna===
Charity is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity principle]].&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt;
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Living creatures get influenced through dānam,
Enemies lose hostility through dānam,
A stranger may become a loved one through dānam,
Vices are killed by dānam.&lt;/poem&gt;
|A Hindu Proverb|&lt;ref name=krma365&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 365-366&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other Hindu texts, such as ''Vyasa Samhita'', state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives.&lt;ref&gt;MN Dutt (1979), {{Google books|tws7AAAAMAAJ|The Dharma-shastras}}, Volumes 3, Cosmo Publishers, pages 20-29&lt;/ref&gt; The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a [[dharma|dharmic]] act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; The donor's intent and responsibility for diligence about the effect of dāna on the recipient is considered as important as the dāna itself. While the donor should not expect anything in return with dāna, the donor is expected to make an effort to determine the character of the recipient, likely return to the recipient and to the society.&lt;ref name=kandm3/&gt; Some medieval era authors state that ''dāna'' is best done with ''shraddha'' (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without ''anasuya'' (finding faults in the recipient).&lt;ref name=bilimoriadaana/&gt; These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of "unquestioning hospitality", where the ''dāna'' ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.&lt;ref name=bilimoriadaana&gt;P Bilimoria et al. (2007), Dana as a Moral Category, in Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 196-197 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dāna in historical records===
[[Al-Biruni]], the Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about 1017, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, "It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible."&lt;ref name=birunihind&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 2), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000157.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), pages 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms.&lt;ref&gt;Al Biruni states that another one-ninth is put into savings/reserve, one-ninth in investment/trade for profits&lt;/ref&gt; Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve.| Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī, Tarikh Al-Hind, 11th century AD&lt;ref name="birunihind"/&gt;}}

''Satram''s, called ''Choultry'', ''Dharamsala'' or ''Chathram''s in parts of India, have been one expression of Hindu charity. Satrams are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major [[Hindu temple]] sites in [[South Asia]] as well as near major temples.&lt;ref&gt;KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kota Neelima (2012), Tirupati, Random House, {{ISBN|978-8184001983}}, pages 50-52; Prabhavati C. Reddy (2014), Hindu Pilgrimage: Shifting Patterns of Worldview of Srisailam in South India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415659970}}, page 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/sanctuaries-of-times-past/article487938.ece Sanctuaries of times past] The Hindu (June 27, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hindu temple]]s served as charitable institutions. [[Burton Stein]]&lt;ref name=burste/&gt; states that South Indian temples collected donations (melvarum) from devotees, during the [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire]] periods in 1st millennium through first half of 2nd millennium AD.&lt;ref&gt;SK Aiyangar, Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120618503}}, pages 158-164&lt;/ref&gt; These ''dāna'' were then used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.&lt;ref name=burste&gt;Burton Stein, The Economic Function of a Medieval South Indian Temple, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19 (February, 1960), pp 163-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton Stein (February 4, 1961), The state, the temple and agriculture development, The Economic Weekly Annual,  pp 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu treatises on dāna===
''[[Mitākṣarā]]'' by [[Vijñāneśvara]] is an 11th-century canonical discussion and commentary on dāna, composed under the patronage of [[Chalukya dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion about charity is included in its thesis on ''ācāra'' (moral conduct).

Major Sanskrit treatises that discuss ethics, methods and rationale for charity and alms giving in Hinduism include, states Maria Heim,&lt;ref name=heim45/&gt; the 12th-century ''Dāna Kānda'' "Book of Giving" by Laksmidhara of [[Kannauj]], the 12th-century ''Dāna Sāgara'' "Sea of Giving" by Ballālasena of [[Bengal]], and the 14th-century sub-book ''Dānakhanda'' in ''Caturvargacintamani'' "The Gem of the Four Aims of Human Life" by Hemadiri of Devagiri (modern [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra]]). The first two are few hundred page treatises each, while the third is over a thousand-page compendium on charity, from a region that is now part of modern-day eastern [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]; the text influenced Hindus of Deccan region and South India from 14th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=heim45&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Merit (Buddhism)}}
[[File:Three monks chanting in Lhasa, 1993.jpg|thumb|250px|Three [[bhikkhu|monks]] chanting in [[Lhasa]], Tibet. 1993.]]
Dāna as a formal religious act is directed specifically to a monastic or spiritually-developed person. In Buddhist thought, it has the effect of purifying and transforming the mind of the giver.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generosity developed through giving leads to experience of material wealth and possibly being reborn in happy states. In the [[Pāli Canon]]'s ''[[Dighajanu Sutta]]'', generosity (denoted there by the Pāli word ''cāga'', which can be synonymous with ''dāna'') is identified as one of the four traits conditioning happiness and wealth in the next life. Conversely, lack of giving leads to unhappy states and poverty.

Dāna leads to one of the [[pāramitā]]s or "perfections", the ''dānapāramitā''. This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Buddhists believe that giving without seeking anything in return leads to greater spiritual wealth. Moreover, it reduces the acquisitive impulses that ultimately lead to continued [[dukkha|suffering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Tsong-kha-pa |authorlink= Je Tsongkhapa |translator= the Lamrim Chenmo Translation Committee|editor=Guy Newland |others=Joshua Cutler, ed. in chief |title= The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Volume II |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002|publisher= Snow Lion |location= Canada |language= |isbn= 1-55939-168-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}: 236, 238&lt;/ref&gt; from [[egotism]].

==Jainism==
Dana is, as with Hindu texts like Mitaksara and Vahni Purana and in Buddhist texts, described as a virtue and [[duty]] in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0521605137}}, pages 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an act of compassion, and must be done with no desire for material gain.&lt;ref name=thomaswatts&gt;Thomas Watts (2006), Encyclopedia of World Poverty, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-1412918077}}, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Four types of Dana are discussed in the texts of Jainism: ''Ahara-dana'' (donation of food), ''Ausadha-dana'' (donation of medicine), ''Jnana-dana'' (donation of knowledge) and ''Abhaya-dana'' (giving of protection or freedom from fear, asylum to someone under threat).&lt;ref name=thomaswatts/&gt; Dāna is one of ten means to gain positive karma, in the soteriological theories of Jainism. Medieval era texts of Jainism dedicate a substantial portion of their discussions to the need and virtue of Dāna.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2007), Dāna as a Moral Category, in Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges (Editors: P Bilimoria et al.), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 193-205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
Dāna, called [[Vand Chhako]], is considered one of three duties of Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml Sikh Beliefs] BBC Religions (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The duty entails sharing part of one's earnings with others, by giving to charity and caring for others. Examples of dāna in Sikhism include [[selfless service]] and [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Fleming, Thinking about God and Morality, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0435307004}}, page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] sometimes described the practice (''patipatti'') of his teaching as '''''the gradual training''''' ([[Pali]]: ''anupubbasikkhā'') because the [[eightfold path]] involves a process of mind-body transformation that unfolds over a sometimes lengthy period.

{{quote|Just as the ocean has a gradual shelf, a gradual slope, a gradual inclination, with a sudden drop-off only after a long stretch, in the same way this discipline of [[Dhamma]] (dhamma-[[vinaya]]) has a gradual training (anupubbasikkhā), a gradual performance (anupubbakiriyā) , a gradual progression (anupubbapatipadā), with a penetration to [[gnosis]] only after a long stretch.|[[Udana]], 5.5}}

The emphasis on gradual training may be understood by the fact that just as the human habits which give rise to suffering have been built up over a long period of time those same habits similarly take a long time to undo requiring a sustained effort achievable only with a genuine commitment to training.

The '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[San Marino]]''' reaches back to the Middle Ages.

[[San Marino]] is a small land locked country in central [[Italy]]. There has been a [[Jews|Jewish]] presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=S&amp;artid=214 jewishencyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of Jews in [[San Marino]] dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;Gasperoni, Michael, ''[http://www.publibook.com/librairie/livre-universitaire.php?isbn=9782748372236 La Communauté juive de la République de Saint-Marin, XVI-XVII siècles]''. Paris: Publibook, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were required to wear special badges and live by specific restrictions, but were also afforded official protection from the government and had never to live in a [[ghetto]] .

During [[World War II]], San Marino provided a harbor for more than 100,000 Italians and Jews from [[Nazism|Nazi]] and Italian persecution. Today, there are only small numbers of Jews in San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/san_marino.html jewishvirtuallibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaak Izrailevich Brodsky''' ({{lang-ru|Исаак Израилевич Бродский}}; {{lang-uk|Іса́к Ізраїльович Бро́дський}}, {{OldStyleDateDY|6 January|1884|25 December 1883}}&amp;nbsp;– 14 August 1939) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Jewish painter whose work provided a blueprint for the art movement of [[socialist realism]]. He is known for his iconic portrayals of [[Lenin]] and idealized, carefully crafted paintings dedicated to the events of the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

==Life and career==
Brodsky was born in the village of [[Berdyansk Raion|Sofiyivka]] near [[Berdyansk]] in what is now [[Ukraine]] to Yisrael, a Jewish merchant. He studied at [[Grekov Odessa Art school|Odessa Art Academy]] and the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in Saint Petersburg. In 1916 he joined the Jewish Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. When Brodsky asked [[Lenin]] to autograph his painting ''Lenin'', he said: "I am signing to what I don't agree with for the first time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoletie.ru/cgi-bin/email.cgi?data=040914170030&amp;rubrica=101 Stoletie.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodsky was on good terms with many leading Russian painters, including his mentor, [[Ilya Repin]]. He was an avid art collector who donated numerous first-class paintings to museums in his native Ukraine and elsewhere. His superb art collection included important works by Repin, [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Valentin Serov]], [[Isaak Levitan]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]]. After his death Brodsky's apartment on Arts Square in St. Petersburg was declared a national museum. His art collection is still on exhibit there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rah.ru/content/ru/main_menu_ru/section-museum_activity/section-museum_departments/museum-2005-02-02-13-44-10.html Webpage of the Isaak Brodsky Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011617/http://www.rah.ru/content/ru/main_menu_ru/section-museum_activity/section-museum_departments/museum-2005-02-02-13-44-10.html |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodsky was an Honoured Artist of the [[Russian SFSR]] and a member of the Union of Russian Artists. He was the first painter to be awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjcc.ru/Galereia_MEOC/Brodskii_Isaak/index.html MJCC.ru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504073810/http://mjcc.ru/Galereia_MEOC/Brodskii_Isaak/index.html |date=2007-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he was appointed Director of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|All-Russian Academy of Arts]]. From 1934 to 1939 he was also a head of personal Art workshop in institute, where his pupils included the well-known Soviet painters [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Alexander Laktionov]], [[Yuri Neprintsev]], [[Piotr Belousov]], [[Piotr Vasiliev]], [[Mikhail Kozell]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|''The Leningrad School of painting.

His memoirs were published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua/gallery/artist/brodskii-ii-1883|title=Ленинградский художник Бродский Исаак Израилевич|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism.

==History==
According to [[census of India prior to independence|censuses of the British Raj period]], most Sikh Jats were converted from [[Hindu Jat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The transformation of Sikh society&amp;nbsp;— Page 92 by Ethne K. Marenco - ''The gazetteer also describes the relation of the Jat Sikhs to the Jat Hindus ...to 2019 in 1911 is attributed to the conversion of Jat Hindus to Sikhism. ...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social philosophy and social transformation of Sikhs by R. N. Singh (Ph. D.) Page 130 - ''The decrease of Jat Hindus from 16843 in 1881 to 2019 in 1911 is attributed to the conversion of Jat Hindus to Sikhism.'' ...&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities of the Punjab region, and between communities such as the Jats and the more martial [[Rajput]]s, has been ambiguous over many centuries. The various groups often claim similar origins while asserting their distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799 |first=Purnima |last=Dhavan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780199756551 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFvyzStjpf8C&amp;pg=PA134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jats started to follow the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]] in small numbers and these swelled after the formation of the [[Khalsa]].&lt;ref&gt;The Sikh Revolution By Jagjit Singh {{ISBN|81-88306-00-2}} page 205 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perspectives on Sikh Studies and The Development of Sikh Militarisation by Jagjit Singh Page 92 onwards courtesy http://www.globalsikhstudies.net/pdf/per-sikh-studies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the vanguard of Sikh resistance against the [[Mughal Empire]] from the 18th century onwards. [[W. H. McLeod]], basing his work on the [[martial race]] theory, says that the Jats began to join Sikhism in large numbers during the period of the sixth guru, Hargobind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sikhspectrum.com/2004/02/the-mcleod-controversy/#/0 | title=The Mcleod Controversy | publisher=Sikh Spectrum | date=February 2004 | accessdate=28 December 2011 | author=Ishwinder Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=The Jats have long been distinguished by their martial traditions and by the custom of retaining their hair uncut.

At least seven of the 12 Sikh ''[[Misl]]s'' (Sikh confederacies) were led by Jat Sikhs.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Influence of Sikhism on Jats==
[[Irfan Habib]] has argued that Sikhism did much to uplift the social status of Jat people, who were previously regarded in the Punjab as being of [[Shudra]] or [[Vaishya]] status in the Hindu ritual ranking system of [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punjabiuniversity.ac.in/newspup/pages/archiveSep08.html |title=Sikhism uplifted the social status of Jat community of Punjab says Irfan Habib |publisher=Punjabheritage.org |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127182238/http://punjabiuniversity.ac.in/newspup/pages/archiveSep08.html |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kishan Singh says {{quote|A serious contradiction afflicts the Jat farmer of the Punjab. He has unflinching faith in Guru Gobind Singh, yet at the same time he is inbued with traits typical of a Jat. There are two sides to the Jat’s known traits. One has a positive effect in the sense that it saves him from feeling inferior; and the other side is negative. It makes him overbearing and arrogant which is a disease. A Jat’s negative traits can be suppressed only through the true spirit of Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsikhnews.com/13%20August%202008/The%20Malaise%20of%20Jat%20Consciousness.htm |title=WSN-Op-Ed-The Malaise of Jat Consciousness |publisher=Worldsikhnews.com |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Army recruits==

Jat Sikhs, according to Major[[Arthur Edward Barstow|A. E. Barstow]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Edward Barstow|Barstow, A. E.]], (Major, 2/11th Sikh Regiment-Late 15th Ludhiana Sikhs), The Sikhs: An Ethnology (revised at the request of the Government of India), reprinted by B.R. Publishing Corporation, Delhi, India, 1985, pp. 62–63, first published in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; were very good soldiers due to the influence of Sikhism,&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, A.E., (Major, 2/11th Sikh Regiment-Late 15th Ludhiana Sikhs), The Sikhs: An Ethnology (revised at the request of the Government of India), reprinted by B.R. Publishing Corporation, Delhi, India, 1985, pp. 155, first published in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; and possessed more of a martial quality than their non-Sikh [[Jat]] brethren. Barstow further comments, that due to their diet and their fondness for wrestling (something encouraged and taught by Guru Angad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of Sikh Gurus [Paperback] | publisher=Lotus Book | author=Prithi Pal Singh | authorlink=Development and Transformation of Sikhs into the Khalsa | year=30 Sep 2007 | location=UK | pages=184 | isbn=81-8382-075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikhism.about.com/od/angaddev/tp/Angad_Dev_Second_Guru.htm |title=Guru Angad Dev&amp;nbsp;– Profile of Angad Dev&amp;nbsp;– Second Sikh Guru |publisher=Sikhism.about.com |date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Sikh people) and weightlifting, they possessed good physical attributes for soldiery. According to R. W. Falcon, Jat Sikhs (alongside other Sikhs) were seen as a good source for recruitment.&lt;ref name="Falcon"&gt;Falcon, R.W. (Captain, 4th Sikh Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force), Handbook on Sikhs: for the use of Regimental Officers, Printed at the Pioneer Press, Allahabad, India, 1896, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Captain A. H. Bingley they were particularly loyal soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Bingley, A.H. (Captain, 7th-Duke of Connaught's own Bengal Infantry, Handbook for the Indian Army: Sikhs, Compiled under the orders of the Government of India, Printed at the Government Central Printing Office, Simla, India, 1899, pp. 90–91, 11, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judah Loew ben Bezalel''', alt. Löw, Loewe, Löwe, or Levai, (between 1512 and 1526? – 17 September 1609)&lt;ref&gt;Bohemia, as a Catholic country, adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] in 1584.  On the Julian calendar it was 7 September.  His gravestone, as quoted by Gal Ed, Megilas Yuchsin and others, gives his date of death as Thursday 18 Elul 5369.&lt;/ref&gt; widely known to scholars of [[Judaism]] as the '''Maharal of Prague''', or simply '''The Maharal''', the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[acronym]] of "''Moreinu Ha-Rav Loew''" ("Our Teacher, Rabbi Loew"), was an important [[Talmud]]ic scholar, [[Kabbalah|Jewish mystic]], and [[philosopher]] who, for most of his life, served as a leading [[rabbi]] in the cities of [[Mikulov]] in [[Moravia]] and [[Prague]] in [[Bohemia]]. Due to his unprecedented impact on Jewish study, he is considered one of the most important rabbis of all times.

Within the world of [[Torah]] and Talmudic scholarship, Loew is known for his works on [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Jewish mysticism]] and his work ''Gur Aryeh al HaTorah'', a supercommentary on [[Rashi]]'s Torah commentary. He is also the subject of a 19th-century [[legend]] that he created [[Golem#The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague|the Golem of Prague]], an animate mythological being fashioned from clay.

Rabbi Loew is buried at the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague]] in [[Josefov]], where his grave and intact tombstone can still be visited.  His descendants' [[surname]]s include Braude, Leib, Loewy, Loeb, Lowy, Lowi, Low-Beer, Loew, Oppenheimer, Pfaelzer, Lowenstein and Keim.

There is no documented evidence of his having received formal religious education, leading scholars to conclude that he was an extremely gifted [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Yehudah_Leib_ben_Betsalel YIVO Encyclopedia - Yehudah Leib ben Betsalel].&lt;/ref&gt;

His family consisted of his wife, Pearl, six daughters, and a son, Bezalel, who became a Rabbi in [[Kolín]], but died early in 1600.
He was independently wealthy, probably as a result of his father's successful business enterprises. He accepted a rabbinical position in 1553 as ''Landesrabbiner'' of [[Moravia]] at [[Mikulov]] (Nikolsburg), directing community affairs but also determining which tractate of the [[Talmud]] was to be studied in the communities in that province. He also revised the community statutes on the election and taxation process. Although he retired from Moravia in 1588 at age 68, the communities still considered him an authority long after that.

One of his activities in Moravia was the rallying against slanderous slurs on legitimacy (''Nadler'') that were spread in the community against certain families and could ruin the finding of a [[shidduch|marriage partner]] for the children of those families. This phenomenon even affected his own family. He used one of the two yearly grand sermons (between [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]] 1583) to denounce the phenomenon.

He moved back to Prague in 1588, where he again accepted a rabbinical position, replacing the retired Isaac Hayoth. He immediately reiterated his views on ''Nadler''. On 23 February 1592, he had an audience with [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]], which he attended together with his brother Sinai and his son-in-law Isaac Cohen; Prince Bertier was present with the emperor. The conversation seems to have been related to [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism, [[Hebrew]]: קַבָּלָה) a subject which held much fascination for the emperor.

In 1592, the Maharal moved to Poznań, where he had been elected as [[Chief Rabbi]] of Poland. In Poznań he composed ''Netivoth Olam'' and part of ''Derech Chaim'' (see below).

;Davidic Line
According to Jewish tradition, the Maharal's family descended [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]] from the Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the [[Davidic line|Davidic dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Towards the end of his life he moved back to Prague, where he died in 1609. He was buried in the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague]]. &lt;!--A daughter of the Maharal, born c. 1565, married Rabbi Zachariah Mendel Gelernter, died ? Poznan{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.--&gt;

==His name==
[[Image:CZ-Cechy-znak.png|thumb|100px|Coat of arms of Bohemia]]

His name "Löw" or "Loew", derived from the German ''Löwe'', "[[lion]]" (cf. the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''Leib'' of the same origin), is a [[kinnui]] or substitute name for the Hebrew [[Judah (given name)|Judah]] or ''Yehuda'', as this name - originally of the [[tribe of Judah]] - is traditionally associated with a lion. In the [[Book of Genesis]], the patriarch [[Jacob]] refers to his son Judah as a ''Gur Aryeh'', a "Young Lion" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him.&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=49&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. The ''Maharal's'' classic work on the [[Rashi]] commentary of the [[Torah]] is called the ''Gur Aryeh al HaTorah'' in Hebrew, meaning "Young Lion [commenting] upon the [[Torah]]".

The Maharal's tomb in Prague is decorated with a heraldic shield with a lion with two intertwined tails (''queue fourchee''), alluding both to his first name and to [[Bohemia]], the arms of which has a two-tailed lion.

==Influence==

===Disciples===
It is unknown how many Talmudic rabbinical scholars the Maharal taught in Moravia, but the main disciples from the Prague period include Rabbis [[Yom Tov Lipmann Heller]] and [[David Gans|David Ganz]]. The former promoted his teacher's program of regular [[Mishnah]] study by the masses, and composed his ''Tosefoth Yom Tov'' (a Mishnah commentary incorporated into almost all published editions of the Mishnah over the past few hundred years) with this goal in mind. David Ganz died young, but produced the work ''Tzemach David'', a work of Jewish and general history, as well as writing on [[astronomy]]; both the MaHaRal and Ganz were in contact with [[Tycho Brahe]], the famous astronomer.

===Jewish philosophy===
In the words of a modern writer, the Maharal "prevented the Balkanization of Jewish thought" (Rabbi Yitzchak Adlerstein 2000, citing Rabbi [[Nachman Bulman]]).

His works inspired the Polish branch of [[Hasidism]], as well as a more recent wave of [[Torah]] scholars originating from [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], most markedly Rabbi [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] (1892–1953) as well as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (1864–1935). A more recent authority who had roots in both traditions was Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner|Isaac Hutner]] (1906–1980). Rabbi Hutner succinctly defined the [[ethos]] of the Maharal's teachings as being ''Nistar BeLashon Nigleh'', meaning (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]): "The [[Kabbalah|Hidden]] in the [[language]] of the [[Talmud|Revealed]]". That is, the Maharal couched kabbalistic ideas in non-kabbalistic language. As a mark of his devotion to the ways of the Maharal, Rabbi Hutner bestowed the name of the Maharal's key work the ''Gur Aryeh'' upon a branch of the yeshiva he headed when he established its [[kollel]] (a [[yeshiva]] for post-graduate Talmud scholars) which then became a division of the [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]] in New York during the 1950s, known as [[Kollel Gur Aryeh]]. Both of these institutions, and the graduates they produce, continue to emphasize the intellectual teachings of the Maharal. Rabbi Hutner in turn also maintained that Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808–1888) (19th century [[Germany]]) must also have been influenced by the Maharal's ideas basing his seemingly [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[World view|Weltanschauung]] on the more abstract and abstruse teachings of the hard-to-understand Jewish Kabbalah.

Rabbi Judah Loew was not a champion of the open study of [[Kabbalah]] as such, and none of his works are in any way ''openly'' devoted to it. Instead, what they attempt to do is to make the ideas of the Kabbalah (which he held to be the most deeply true of all the Torah) accessible to the average educated reader, by presenting them in a rigorously philosophical form, couched in terms that are accessible to the public. According to R. Loew, only the greatest of Torah scholars are able to perceive the full intent of the Kabbalistic works in their complex entirety. Therefore, although kabbalistic doctrine permeates his writings, it is always presented in a rational and philosophic form. His main kabbalistic influences appear to have been the [[Zohar]], [[Sefer Yetzirah]], and traditions of the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]], as [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]] had not by that time reached Europe.

Faced with the Aristotelian interpretation of Talmudic Aggadot by [[Azariah dei Rossi]], he was indignant at what he termed the trivialization of the Sages' deep wisdom. In his work ''Be'er ha-Golah'' he vigorously disputes all of dei Rossi's theses, sternly upholding the subtly allegorical nature of Aggadah and demonstrating its independence from (and superiority to) the superficial observations of natural science. At the same time he was entirely in favor of scientific research, so long as the researcher did not use his observations as permission to contradict the final authority of divine revelation. His constant thesis is that the Talmudic, Midrashic, and Aggadic teachings refer always to matters far beyond the competence of natural science.

===Descendants===
Among his many descendants were [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], founder of [[Chabad]] Hasidism. Through this paternal line, Loew is the ancestor of many prominent later Jewish individuals, including [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], seventh Rebbe of [[Lubavitch]], and [[Yehudi Menuhin]], the famous violinist. Maharal is also the ancestor of [[Rebbe]] [[Nachman of Breslov]].

===Legend of the golem===
{{Main|Golem#The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague}}
The Maharal is the subject of the legend about the creation of a [[golem]], a creature made out of clay to defend the [[Jew]]s of the Prague [[Ghetto]] from [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] attacks, particularly the [[blood libel]]. He is said to have used [[Jewish mysticism|mystical powers]] based on the [[esoteric]] knowledge of how [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] created [[Adam and Eve|Adam]].&lt;ref name=newlife&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Bilefsky |authorlink=Dan Bilefsky |coauthors= |title=Hard Times Give New Life to Prague’s Golem |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/11/world/europe/11golem.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=print |quote=The Golem, according to Czech legend, was fashioned from clay and brought to life by a rabbi to protect Prague’s 16th-century ghetto from persecution, and is said to be called forth in times of crisis. True to form, he is once again experiencing a revival and, in this commercial age, has spawned a one-monster industry. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general view of historians and critics is that the legend is a German literary invention of the early 19th century. The earliest known source for the story thus far is the 1834 book ''Der Jüdische Gil Blas'' by Friedrich Korn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/titleinfo/419103|title=Freimann-Sammlung / Der jüdische Gil Blas|website=sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, J. S., [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50025868/Der-judische-Gil-Blas-1834 ''Der jüdische Gil Blas''], Leipzig, 1834, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; It has been repeated and adapted many times since.

[[Neopaganism]] (also [[modern paganism]] or contemporary paganism) encompasses a wide range of religious groups and individuals. These may include old [[occult]] groups, those that follow a [[New Age]] approach, those that try to reconstruct old [[ethnic religion]]s, and followers of the pagan religion of [[Wicca]]. For organizations, the founding year is given in brackets.

== Early movements ==

== Witchcraft ==
{{main|Wicca|Contemporary witchcraft}}
{{see also|Category: Wiccan traditions}}
Wicca originated in 1940s Britain and became the mainstream of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] in the 1970s. There are two core traditions of Wicca which originated in Britain, Gardnerian and Alexandrian, which are sometimes referred to as British Traditional Wicca. From these two arose several other variant traditions. Wicca has also inspired a great number of other [[witchcraft]] traditions in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], most of which base their beliefs and practices on Wicca. Many movements are influenced by the [[Goddess movement|Movement of the Goddess]], and [[New Age]] and [[feminism|feminist]] worldviews.

'''''Lucifer''''' was a journal published by [[Helena Blavatsky]]. The first edition was issued in September 1887 in London. The journal published articles on philosophical, theosophical, scientific and religious topics. It also contained book reviews, for example of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.{{Sfn|Lucifer}}

==History==
The journal was first published by Blavatsky. From 1889 until Blavatsky's death in May 1891 [[Annie Besant]] was a co-editor. Besant then published the journal until September 1895, when [[G. R. S. Mead|George Robert Stowe Mead]] became a co-editor. The journal appeared twelve times a year and was 80 to 90 pages long.{{Sfn|Lucifer}} The last of twenty volumes was published in August 1897. More than 2800 articles were published in this journal between 1887 and 1897.{{Sfn|Index}} Then the journal was renamed to ''The Theosophical Review''.{{Sfn|Review}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46293">[[File:Magdalen-asylum.jpg|300px|thumb|Irish Magdalene Laundry, {{circa|lk=no}} early 1900s]]

The '''Magdalene Laundries in Ireland''', also known as [[Magdalene asylum]]s, were institutions of confinement, usually run by [[Roman Catholic]] orders, which operated from the 18th to the late 20th centuries. They were run ostensibly to house "[[Fallen woman|fallen women]]", an estimated 30,000 of whom were confined in these institutions in [[Ireland]]. In 1993, a [[mass grave]] containing 155 corpses was uncovered in the convent grounds of one of the laundries.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; This led to media revelations about the operations of the secretive institutions. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a £50 million compensation scheme for survivors was set up by the Irish Government. The religious orders which operated the laundries have rejected activist demands that they financially contribute to this program.&lt;ref name=comp/&gt;

==History==
The ''Dublin Magdalen Asylum,'' (sometimes called ''Magdalen Asylum for Penitent Females'') on Lower Leeson Street was the first such institution in Ireland. It was a Church of Ireland-run institution, and accepted only Protestant women. It was founded in 1765 by Lady [[Arabella Denny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy |first=Rebecca Lea|title=Origins of the Magdalene laundries: an analytical history |publisher=McFarland|year=2010|page=238|isbn= 978-0-7864-4446-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIRJkAbmaiEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=%22Arabella+Denny%22+leeson+street#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arabella%20Denny%22%20leeson%20street&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ireland's Catholic-run Magdalene asylums survived the longest. For a list of closing dates of laundries, please read this official report from Justice for Magdalene.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/2013Magdalen-P%20I%20Chapter%203%20History%20(PDF%20-%203824KB).pdf/Files/2013Magdalen-P%20I%20Chapter%203%20History%20(PDF%20-%203824KB).pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's Magdalene laundries were quietly supported by the state, and operated by religious communities for more than two hundred years.

On laundries, James Smith asserts that the "Irish variety took on a distinct character".&lt;ref&gt;Smith xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates were required to work, primarily in laundries, since the facilities were self-supporting. Andrea Parrot and Nina Cummings wrote, "The cost of violence, oppression, and brutalization of women is enormous" and in their struggle to survive, the inmates suffered not only physically, but spiritually and emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;Parrot, Cummings 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belfast]] the [[Church of Ireland]]-run [[Ulster Magdalene Asylum]] was founded in 1839 on [[Ormeau Road#Donegall Pass|Donegall Pass]]. Similar institutions were run by Catholics on [[Ormeau Road]] and by [[Presbyterians]] on Whitehall Parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/exhibition/belfast/government_politics_institutions.html Government, politics and institutions in Belfast in the early twentieth century] - National Archives of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fallen women==
In the late 18th century, the term "fallen women" primarily referred to prostitutes, but by the end of the 19th century, Magdalene laundries were filled with many different kinds of women, including girls who were "not prostitutes at all", but either "seduced women" or women who had yet to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cai.ucdavis.edu/waters-sites/prostitution/FallenWomen.htm |last=Greene |first=Amy |title=Fallen Women |website=cai.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2013}} According to Frances Finnegan, author of ''Do Penance or Perish: A Study of Magdalen Asylums in Ireland'', "Missionaries were required to approach prostitutes and distribute religious tracts, designed to be read in 'sober' moments and divert women from their vicious lives".&lt;ref name="Finnegan_a"&gt;^ Finnegan 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, "the consignment even of genuine prostitutes" to these laundries "seldom reduced their numbers on the streets, any more than did an individual prostitute's death", because, according to Finnegan, "so long as poverty continued, and the demand for public women remained, such losses were easily replaced".&lt;ref name="Finnegan_a" /&gt;  Raftery wrote that the institutions were failing to achieve their supposed objective; "the institutions had little impact on prostitution over the period", and yet they were continuing to multiply, expand and, most importantly, profit from the free labour.  Since they were not paid, Raftery asserted, "it seems clear that these girls were used as a ready source of free labour for these laundry businesses".&lt;ref&gt;Raftery 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the state of Ireland and its government was heavily intertwined with religion. Finnegan wrote:

{{quote|The issue of continued demand for prostitutes was barely confronted, so absorbed were moralists with the disgraceful and more visible evidence of supply.  And while acknowledging that poverty, overcrowded slum housing and lack of employment opportunities fuelled the activity…they shirked the wider issues, insisting on individual moral (rather than social) reform.&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finnegan wrote that based on historical records, the [[religious institute]]s had motivations other than simply wanting to curtail prostitution; these multiple motivations led to the multiplication of these facilities.&lt;ref name="Finnegan_b"&gt;^ Finnegan 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Finnegan, as the motivations started to range from a need to maintain social and moral order within the bounds of patriarchal structure, to a desire to continue profiting from a free workforce, Magdalen laundries became a part of a large structure of suppression.&lt;ref name="Finnegan_b" /&gt;  
With the multiplication of these institutions and the subsequent and "dramatic rise" in the number of beds available within them, Finnegan wrote that the need to staff the laundries "became increasingly urgent".&lt;ref name="Finnegan_b" /&gt;  This urgency, Finnegan claims, resulted in a new definition of "fallen" women, one that was much less precise and was expanding to include any women who appeared to challenge traditional notions of Irish morality.  She further asserted that this new definition resulted in even more suffering, "especially among those increasing numbers who were not prostitutes but unmarried mothers – forced to give up their babies as well as their lives".&lt;ref name="Finnegan_c"&gt;^ Finnegan 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;^ Smith 42&lt;/ref&gt;  And as this concept of "fallen" expanded, so did the facilities, in both physical size and role in society.

Women were branded as both a mother and a criminal if they happened to have a child out of wedlock. The choices the women at the time had were very limited. They had no social welfare system; therefore many resorted to prostitution or entered these mother and child homes, also known as Magdalen Laundries.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, James M, Irelands Magdalen Laundries and the Nations Architecture of Confinement, Manchester University press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
Several religious institutes established even more Irish laundries, reformatories and industrial schools, sometimes all together on the same plot of land, with the aim to "save the souls primarily of women and children".&lt;ref name="Raftery"&gt;^ Raftery 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples were [[Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge]] and the [[Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy]], who ran the largest laundries in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-ireland-oversaw-abusive-catholic-laundries|title=Report: Ireland oversaw harsh Catholic laundries|last=Pogatchnik|first=Shawn|date=2013-02-05|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "large complexes" became a "massive interlocking system…carefully and painstakingly built up…over a number of decades"; and consequently, Magdalen laundries became part of Ireland's "larger system for the control of children and women" (Raftery 18). Women and "bastard" children were both "incarcerated for transgressing the narrow moral code of the time" and the same religious congregations managed the orphanages, reformatory schools and laundries.&lt;ref name="Raftery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raftery_a"&gt;^ Raftery 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, these facilities "all helped sustain each other – girls from the reformatory and industrial schools often ended up working their entire lives in the Magdalen laundries".&lt;ref name="Raftery" /&gt;  
Almost all the institutions were run by female religious congregations,” i.e. sisters, and were scattered throughout the country "in prominent locations in towns and cities".&lt;ref name="Raftery_a" /&gt; In this way, according to Raftery, they were powerful and pervasive, able to effectively control the lives of women and children from "all classes".&lt;ref&gt;Raftery 284&lt;/ref&gt;  
This second incarnation of Magdalen laundries vastly differed from the first incarnation, due to their "longevity" and "their diverse community of female inmates, including hopeless cases, mental defectives…[and] transfers from industrial and reformatory schools".&lt;ref name="Smithxv_a"&gt;^ Smith xv, xvi&lt;/ref&gt;  These particular institutions intentionally shared "overriding characteristics, including a regime of prayer, silence, work in a laundry, and a preference for permanent inmates", which, as Smith notes, "contradicts the religious congregations' stated mission to protect, reform, and rehabilitate".&lt;ref name="Smithxv_a" /&gt;
As this expansion was taking place and these laundries were becoming a part of a large network of institutions, the treatment of the girls was becoming increasingly violent and abusive.  According to Finnegan and Smith, the asylums became "particularly cruel", "more secretive" in nature and "emphatically more punitive".&lt;ref name="Finnegan_c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  Though these women had committed no crime and had never been put on trial, their indefinite incarceration was enforced by locked doors, iron gates and prison guards in the form of apathetic sisters.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  By 1920, according to Smith, Magdalen laundries had almost entirely abandoned claims of rehabilitation and instead, were "seamlessly incorporated into the state's architecture of containment".&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

According to historian Frances Finnegan, in the beginning of these asylums' existence, because many of the women had a background as prostitutes, the women (who were called "children") were regarded as "in need of penitence", and until the 1970s were required to address all staff members as "mother" regardless of age. To enforce order and maintain a [[monastic]] atmosphere, the [[Incarceration|inmates]] were required to observe strict [[silence]] for much of the day.

As the phenomenon became more widespread, it extended beyond prostitution to petty criminals, orphans, [[intellectual disability|mentally disabled]] women and [[Child abuse|abused girls]]. A 2013 report made by an inter-departmental committee chaired by Senator [[Martin McAleese]] found no evidence of unmarried women giving birth in the asylum.&lt;ref name="Reportof"&gt;"Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries". Department of Justice and Equality. Retrieved 29 June 2013. ''Page citations needed.''&lt;/ref&gt; Even young girls who were considered too promiscuous and flirtatious, or too beautiful, were sent to an asylum by their families.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This paralleled the practice in state-run [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylums]] in Britain and Ireland in the same period, where many people with alleged "[[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|social dysfunction]]" were committed to asylums.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Without a family member on the outside who could vouch for them, many incarcerated individuals stayed in the asylums for the rest of their lives, many taking religious vows.

Given Ireland's historically conservative [[sexual morality|sexual values]], Magdalen asylums were a generally accepted social institution until well into the second half of the twentieth century.

An estimated 30,000 women were confined in these institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/feb/16/features.review1?guni=Article:in%20body%20link|title=The sisters of no mercy|publisher=The Observer|author=Fintan O'Toole|date=16 February 2003|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 10,000 of whom were admitted  since Ireland's independence in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/9850681/Ireland-apologises-for-Magdalene-laundries.html|title=Ireland apologises for Magdalene laundries|publisher=Daily Telegraph|author=Bruno Waterfield|date=5 Feb 2013|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith asserts that "we do not know how many women resided in the Magdalen institutions" after 1900.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  Vital information about the women's circumstances, the number of women, and the consequences of their incarceration is unknown.  "We have no official history for the Magdalen asylum in twentieth-century Ireland", Smith wrote.&lt;ref name="Smith_a"&gt;^ Smith 138&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the religious institutes' "policy of secrecy", their penitent registers and convent annals remain closed to this day, despite repeated requests for information.&lt;ref name="Raftery 9"&gt;Raftery 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith xvi"&gt;Smith xvi&lt;/ref&gt;  As a direct result of these missing records and the religious institutes' commitment to secrecy, Magdalen laundries can only exist "at the level of story rather than history".&lt;ref name="Smith_a" /&gt;  Though Ireland's last Magdalen asylum imprisoned women until 1996, there are no records to account for "almost a full century" of women who now "constitute the nation's disappeared", who were "excluded, silenced, or punished", and whom Smith says "did not matter or matter enough" to a society that "sought to negate and render invisible their challenges" to conceived notions of moral order.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

==Mass grave==
[[File:Magdalene seat, St Stephen's Green Park, Dublin.jpg|thumb|Magdalene seat, St Stephen's Green Park, Dublin]]
In Dublin in 1993, the [[Sisters of Our Lady of Charity]] had lost money in share dealings on the stock exchange; to cover their losses, they sold part of the land in their convent to a property developer.{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=first mention of the Sisters requires explanation: what connection had they with the laundries? Owners of the land? Administering the laundries? Something else?}} This led to the discovery of 133 corpses in a [[mass grave]]. The Sisters arranged to have the remains cremated and reburied in another mass grave at [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], splitting the cost of the reburial with the developer who had bought the land. It later transpired that there were 22 more corpses than the sisters had applied for permission to exhume. In all, 155 corpses were exhumed and cremated.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Ryan, Carol.

Though not initially reported, this eventually triggered a public scandal, bringing unprecedented attention to the secretive institutions. In 1999, former asylum inmates [[Mary Norris]], Josephine McCarthy and Mary-Jo McDonagh gave accounts of their treatment. The 1997 [[Channel 4]] documentary ''[[Sex in a Cold Climate]]'' interviewed former inmates of Magdalene Asylums who testified to continued [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]] and [[physical abuse]] while being isolated from the outside world for an indefinite amount of time. Allegations about the conditions in the convents and the treatment of the inmates were made into an award-winning 2002 film ''[[The Magdalene Sisters]]'', written and directed by [[Peter Mullan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/controversial-film-sisters-hits-dvd |title=Controversial film 'Sisters' hits DVD |publisher=[[The Michigan Daily]] |date=2004-04-15 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Mary Raftery]] wrote in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' that in the early 1940s, some Irish state institutions, such as the [[Irish Army|army]], switched from commercial laundries to "institutional laundries" (Magdalene laundries).&lt;ref name=it-state-apology&gt;{{cite news

The ''Irish Times'' revealed that a ledger listed [[Áras an Uachtaráin]], [[Guinness]], [[Clerys]], the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]], [[Dr Steevens' Hospital]], the [[Bank of Ireland]], the [[Department of Defence (Ireland)|Department of Defence]], the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries]], [[CIÉ]], [[Portmarnock Golf Club]], Clontarf Golf Club and several leading hotels amongst those who used a Magdalene laundry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Reparations==

Since 2001, the Irish government has acknowledged that women in the Magdalene laundries were victims of abuse. However, the Irish government has resisted calls for investigation and proposals for compensation; it maintains the laundries were privately run and abuses at the laundries are outside the government's remit.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In contrast to these claims, evidence exists that Irish courts routinely sent women convicted of petty crimes to the laundries, the government awarded lucrative contracts to the laundries without any insistence on protection and fair treatment of their workers, and Irish state employees helped keep laundry facilities stocked with workers by bringing women to work there and returning escaped workers.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==2013 publication of inquiry report==
Having lobbied the government of Ireland for two years for investigation of the history of the Magdalene laundries, advocacy group Justice for Magdalenes presented its case to the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Committee Against Torture]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; alleging that the conditions within the Magdalene laundries and the exploitation of their labourers amounted to human-rights violations.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; On 6 June 2011, the panel urged Ireland to ''"investigate allegations that for decades women and girls sent to work in Catholic laundries were tortured."''&lt;ref name="AssocPress"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.philstar.com/breaking-news/693553/un-panel-urges-ireland-probe-catholic-torture |title=UN panel urges Ireland to probe Catholic torture |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cocat&gt;{{cite web

==State apology and compensation==
On 19 February 2013, the Taoiseach Enda Kenny issued a formal state apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/tearful-kenny-says-sorry-to-the-magdalene-women-29082107.html|title=Tearful Kenny says sorry to the Magdalene women|date=20 February 2013|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the laundries as "the nation's shame" and said, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Therefore, I, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, the government and our citizens deeply regret and apologise unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them, and for any stigma they suffered, as a result of the time they spent in a Magdalene Laundry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Enda|last=Kenny|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1054290/magdalene-laundries-irish-pm-issues-apology|title=Magdalene Laundries: Irish PM Issues Apology|work=Sky News|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900034?opendocument Text of Taoiseach's apology in the Dáil] Oireachtas Éireann, 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Taoiseach also outlined part of the compensation package to be offered to victims of the Magdalene Laundries. He stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"That's why the Government has today asked the President of the Law Reform Commission Judge John Quirke to undertake a three month review and to make recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the help that the government can provide in the areas of payments and other supports, including [[medical card]], psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Enda|last=Kenny|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/state-apology-magdalene-laundries-801121-Feb2013/|title=Kenny "deeply regrets and apologises unreservedly" to Magdalene women in emotional speech|work=The Journal|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Catholic reaction==

In February 2013, a few days after the publication of the McAleese Report, two sisters gave an interview for [[RTÉ Radio 1]] under conditions of anonymity for themselves and their institute. They described the Irish media coverage of the abuse at the laundries (which they claimed not to have participated in), as a "one-sided anti-Catholic forum". They displayed no remorse for the institutes' past: "Apologize for what? Apologize for providing a service? We provided a free service for the country". They complained that "all the shame of the era is being dumped on the religious orders... the sins of society are being placed on us". On hearing the interview, a survivors' group announced to the press that they were "shocked, horrified and enormously upset" by the sisters' portrayal of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womensenews.org/story/religion/130529/nuns-claim-no-role-in-irish-laundry-scandal#.U9bM6PldVx8|title=Nuns Claim No Role in Irish Laundry Scandal|publisher=WeNews|author=Claire Mc Cormack|date= May 30, 2013|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a detailed commentary by the president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]], a U.S. [[advocacy group]], published in July 2013, it is claimed that "No one was imprisoned, nor forced against her will to stay. There was no slave labor, ... It’s all a lie." The inmates are described as "prostitutes, and women seen as likely candidates for the 'world’s oldest profession'. Unmarried women, especially those who gave birth out-of-wedlock, were likely candidates. Contrary to what has been reported, the laundries were not imposed on these women: they were a realistic response to a growing social problem [prostitution]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/myths-of-the-magdalene-laundries/|title=Myths of the Magdelene Laundries|publisher=Catholic League For Religious And Civil Rights|author=Bill Donohue|date=July 15, 2013|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, while the abuse of inmates was still occurring, the English writer [[Halliday Sutherland]] was touring Ireland to collect material for his book ''Irish Journey''. When he applied for permission to visit the [[Galway]] asylum, [[Michael Browne (Bishop of Galway)|Michael Browne]], the local bishop, reluctantly granted him access only on condition that he allow his account to be [[Censorship|censored]] by the Mother Superior.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday Sutherland, ''Irish Journey'', G.

The religious institutes, the [[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]], and [[Sisters of Charity]], have refused demands from the Irish government, the [[UN]] [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and the UN [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] to contribute to the compensation fund for surviving victims, an estimated 600 of whom were  still alive in March 2014.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/magdalene-compensation-snub-is-rejection-of-laundry-women|title=Magdalene compensation snub is ‘rejection of Laundry women’|publisher=The Irish Post|author=Niall O Sullivan |date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0205/502368-vatican-abuse/|title=UN calls for Magdalene laundries investigation, demands Vatican turn over child abusers to police|publisher=RTÉ News|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0523/619228-magdalene-redress/|title=UN criticises religious orders over refusal to contribute to Magdalene redress fund|publisher=RTÉ News|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-nuns-orders-confirm-they-will-not-pay-Magdalene-Laundry-victims.html|title=Irish religious orders confirm they will not pay Magdalene Laundry victims|publisher=Irish Central|author=Cahir O'Doherty|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a monument was erected in [[Ennis]] at the site of the former Industrial School and Magdalene laundry in appreciation of the Sisters of Mercy. As recently as 2015, Ennis Municipal Local Council felt confident enough (despite the findings of the McAleese and Ryan reports) to rename a road (which ran through the site of the former Industrial School and Laundry) in honour of the Sisters of Mercy. There are conflicting views to the appropriateness of these gestures in this County Clare town.

==Media representations==

===''The Magdalene Sisters''===
''[[The Magdalene Sisters]]'', a 2002 film by Peter Mullan, is centered on four young women incarcerated in a Dublin Magdalen Laundry from 1964 to 1968.  The film is loosely based on and "largely inspired" by the 1998 documentary ''[[Sex in a Cold Climate]],'' which documents four survivors' accounts of their experiences in Ireland's Magdalen institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, James.  Ireland's Magdalen Laundries and the Nation's Architecture of Containment. South Bend, IN: The University of Notre Dame Press, 2007 139&lt;/ref&gt;  One survivor who saw Mullan's film claimed that the reality of Magdalen asylums was "a thousand times worse".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sex in a Cold Climate]]''.  Dir. Steve Humphries.  Prod. Steve Humphries.  Testimony Films, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/04/1048962932185.html?oneclick=true |title=A very Irish sort of hell |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2003-04-05 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Smith wrote that "Mullan offsets the long historical silence" that allowed the laundries and the violations of the religious institutes to "maintain their secrecy and invisibility".&lt;ref name="SmithJames"&gt;Smith, James.  Ireland's Magdalen Laundries and the Nation's Architecture of Containment. South Bend, IN: The University of Notre Dame Press, 2007 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is a product of a collective, including the four survivors (Martha Cooney, Christina Mulcahy, Phyllis Valentine, Brigid Young) who told their story in ''Sex in a Cold Climate'', the historical consultant and researchers of the documentary who contributed historical information (Miriam Akhtar, Beverely Hopwood and Frances Finnegan), the directors of both movies (Steve Humphries and Peter Mullan, respectively), the screenwriter of ''The Magdalene Sisters'' who created a narrative (Peter Mullan again) and the actors in the film.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Maria Bolognesi''' (21 October 1924 – 30 January 1980) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Throughout her life she suffered from debilitating diseases and was subject to various demonic possessions and visions. Her numerous visions were of [[Jesus Christ]] and through Him saw [[Heaven]] while also receiving the [[stigmata]] herself.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2014/01/blessed-maria-bolognesi-mystic-who.html|title=Blessed Maria Bolognesi - The mystic who suffered a demonic possession|date=2014|publisher=Mystics of the Church|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolognesi was beatified on 7 September 2013 and Cardinal [[Angelo Amato]] presided over the beatification on the behalf of [[Pope Francis]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/blessed-maria-bolognesi/|title=Blessed Maria Bolognesi|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=24 March 2014|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beatification cause opened under [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1992 while [[Pope Benedict XVI]] had named her as [[Venerable]] in mid-2012.

==Life==
Maria Bolognesi was born as Maria Semiolo on 21 October 1924 in Rovigo to Giuseppe Samiolo. Her natural father - himself illegitimate - did not want to wed her mother and split from her which left Bolognesi to live until 1929 in her mother's home with her mother's name. Her maternal grandmother Cornetto Cesira was perhaps the most influential individual in her childhood in terms of instilling in the girl a religious education and love for [[God]]. Bolognesi received the name of her stepfather after her mother married Giuseppe Bolognesi in 1929; the pair went to live with him.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Her step-grandfather was Luigi Bolognesi.

In 1932 she ran a high fever and her mother at the same time had contracted [[meningitis]] and was on her deathbed. Bolognesi had begun to prepare for her [[First Communion]] at this time and the [[nun]] that was instructing her at the time told her that [[Jesus Christ]] would grant her a wish. She wished that her mother would recover and she managed to recover from the disease; Bolognesi went on to make her [[First Communion]] on 22 May 1932 with much emotion.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Her stepfather often beat her mother due to his somewhat abrasive nature but he and her mother still had their son Luigi on 21 June 1940. In summer 1941 she received [[demonic possession]] and could not enter a church as a result with the blessings of [[priests]] failing to have an effect on her. She was at one stage even tied to a chair so that Father Santo Magro could bless her but this too failed.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Bolognesi was taken to a mental hospital for evaluation but the Bishop of Rovigo Guido Maria Mazzocco blessed her from the window of his residence before she was taken there. The doctors later deemed her to be sane because she felt normal and was relieved of the possession.

She grew up in a poor household and was able to attend the first and second grade of her [[primary education|initial schooling]] while her peers often marginalized her. She dropped out of school as a child in order to work to support her parents and siblings and worked as an [[agricultural]] [[laborer]] in order to achieve this.

Bolognesi received her first vision of Jesus Christ in the evening of 1–2 April - on the occasion of [[Holy Thursday]] - bestowing upon her three [[Ring (jewellery)|rings]] and five [[rubies]] which was a representation of the [[Five Wounds]]. In the vision the Lord assured her that she would learn how to read and also promised her that her mother would turn from her sins - her mother began converting back to the faith on 15 March 1947.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Around this time her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] was the old priest Bassiano Paiato. On 8 May 1942 she had another vision of Christ. On 11 April 1942 she began to wear a black habit with the express permission of Father Paiato. Difficulties began to arise at this time for Father Magro became skeptical of her experiences and began to besmirch her in public to his parishioners. Difficulties escalated on 5 March 1948 when three male criminals attacked her while back on 27 February the Lord had warned her about this and told her that her guardian angel would be there with her. Bolognesi was knocked unconscious and was tied and muffled with flesh stripped from her legs and hands. She was left injured in the snow with two toenails almost torn off.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Because people were skeptical of this the police sergeant took her to the magistrate and accused her of having faked the account though she was later absolved of these charges on 25 October 1948.

In the 1940s she began to suffer from [[arthritis]] as well as suffering from both [[colitis]] and [[appendicitis]] while almost becoming blind in 1950. For treatment she would often have to go to Rovigo and [[Padua]]. Her new spiritual director from 28 June 1951 was Mgr. Rodolfo Barbieri and her first meeting with him was less than a month after. Bolognesi looked after [[orphans]] and assisted children whose parents were without jobs and would also make frequent visits to the sick in hospitals. In 1944 she gained the pierced wound on her side while in July 1951 suffering the pain of the Lord's flagellation; this culminated on 25 January 1954 when she wrote in her spiritual journal of a wound that had opened up in her right hand - the first signs of the [[stigmata]]. In August 1954 she resided with some [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian nuns]] in [[Ferrara]] and there received the wounds in her feet; she was hospitalized in February 1955 and had a vision telling her to leave Rovigo on 16 March. She went to a spiritual retreat in [[Sperlinga]] and received the left wound of the stigmata on 2 April 1955. En route back home from Sperlinga she stopped at [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] where she had a fever and her shoes full of blood. She found an inn and remained there and had a vision of Christ on [[Good Friday]] 8 April 1955 at 3:00pm.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Barberi's poor health led to Mgr. Adelino Marenga becoming her new spiritual director on 24 September 1956 and she met him in their first meeting on the following 14 October. Bolognesi received a vision of Christ again at 3:00pm on 1 November 1957 in which He took her to see both Heaven and Purgatory and in spring 1958 was bedridden until 1959. She visited the tomb of [[Gemma Galgani|Saint Gemma Galgani]] in [[Lucca]] on 29 September 1959 - to whom she fostered a devotion to.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; On 3 July 1959 she had another vision in which Christ said He would take her to Heaven and she saw it again on the following 6 July. She saw Heaven once again on 21 October 1959 at 2:00am in which she was roused from her sleep and then again on 22 January 1960. Marenga died in 1964 and her final spiritual director was Mgr. Aldo Balduin.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

Bolognesi suffered a [[heart attack]] in 1971. She had taken up painting in 1968 due to poor health that led to this heart attack. It was said that [[Padre Pio]] used to appear to her in bilocation in her Rovigo home even after the friar had died in 1968.

Bolognesi died due to a heart attack on 30 January 1980 at 2:00am and her remains were later transferred to the parish of Bosaro.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 18 February 1992 in which she was titled as a [[Servant of God]] after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the official "[[nihil obstat]]" to the cause in which it allowed for it to open on a diocesan level. The diocesan process opened on 21 October 1992 and concluded its work on 8 July 2000 before the C.C.S. validated the process in [[Rome]] on 25 May 2001 and received the official [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation later in 2007.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The board of theologians met on two occasions on 19 February 2010 - in which another meeting was requested to discuss her writings and religious experiences - and on 24 June 2011 when definitive approval for the cause was issued. The C.C.S. met on 6 March 2012 and also approved the cause. On 10 May 2012 she was proclaimed to be [[Venerable]] after [[Pope Benedict XVI]] confirmed that she had lived a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The process for the miracle required for beatification was investigated - the healing of a man named Marco - from 23 September 2004 until 13 December 2005 and was issued validation on 18 May 2007 before receiving the approval of a medical board on 5 July 2012; theologians also approved this miracle on 17 November 2012 as did the C.C.S. on 9 April 2013. [[Pope Francis]] issued the final approval needed to the miracle - and her beatification - on 2 May 2013. Bolognesi was beatified in Rovigo on 7 September 2013 and Cardinal [[Angelo Amato]] presided on the pope's behalf.

The current [[postulator]] assigned to the cause is the Rev. Raffaele Talmelli.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Midas gold2.jpg|thumb|In the [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] version of the Midas myth, Midas' daughter turns to a golden statue when he touches her (illustration by [[Walter Crane]] for the 1893 edition)]]

'''Midas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|d|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μίδας}}) is the name of at least three members of the royal house of [[Phrygia]].

The most famous '''King Midas''' is popularly remembered in [[Greek mythology]] for his ability to turn everything he touched into [[gold]]. This came to be called the ''golden touch'', or the ''Midas touch''.&lt;ref&gt;In [[alchemy]], the transmutation of an object into gold is known as ''[[chrysopoeia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phrygian city [[Midaeum]] was presumably named after this Midas, and this is probably also the Midas that according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] founded [[Ancyra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.4.5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], legend held that Midas died of starvation as a result of his "vain prayer" for the gold touch.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics, 1.1257b.&lt;/ref&gt; The legends told about this Midas and his father [[Gordias]], credited with founding the Phrygian capital city [[Gordium]] and tying the [[Gordian Knot]], indicate that they were believed to have lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BC, well before the [[Trojan War]]. However, [[Homer]] does not mention Midas or [[Gordias]], while instead mentioning two other Phrygian kings, [[Mygdon of Phrygia|Mygdon]] and [[Otreus]].

Another King Midas ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC, up until the sacking of Gordium by the [[Cimmerians]], when he is said to have committed suicide. Most historians believe this Midas is the same person as the ''Mita'', called king of the [[Mushki]] in Assyrian texts, who warred with [[Assyria]] and its [[Ancient Anatolians|Anatolian]] provinces during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Encyclopædia Britannica; also: "Virtually the only figure in [[Phrygia]]n history who can be recognized as a distinct individual", begins Lynn E. Roller, "The Legend of Midas", ''Classical Antiquity,'' '''2'''2 (October 1983):299-313.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A third Midas is said by [[Herodotus]] to have been a member of the royal house of Phrygia and the grandfather of an [[Adrastus]] who fled Phrygia after accidentally killing his brother and took asylum in [[Lydia]] during the reign of [[Croesus]]. Phrygia was by that time a Lydian subject. Herodotus says that Croesus regarded the Phrygian royal house as "friends" but does not mention whether the Phrygian royal house still ruled as (vassal) kings of Phrygia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus I.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
[[Image:MidasSehri.Tomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Midas Monument]], a [[Phrygia|Phrygian]] rock-cut tomb dedicated to Midas (700 BCE).]]
There are many, and often contradictory, legends about the most ancient King Midas. In one, Midas was king of [[Pessinus]], a city of [[Phrygia]], who as a child was adopted by King [[Gordias]] and [[Cybele]], the [[goddess]] whose consort he was, and who (by some accounts) was the goddess-mother of Midas himself.&lt;ref&gt;"King Midas, a Phrygian, son of Cybele" ([[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 274).&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts place the youth of Midas in [[Macedon]]ian Bermion (See [[Bryges]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Bromium" in Graves 1960:83.a; Greek traditions of the migration from Macedon to Anatolia are examined— as purely literary constructions— in Peter Carrington, "The Heroic Age of Phrygia in Ancient Literature and Art" ''Anatolian Studies'' '''27''' (1977:117-126).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[Mygdonia (Europe)|Mygdonia]],&lt;ref&gt;Mygdonia became part of [[Macedon]] in historical times.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] referred to a wild rose garden at the foot of Mount Bermion as "the garden of Midas son of Gordias, where roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 8.138.1&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus says elsewhere that Phrygians anciently lived in Europe where they were known as [[Bryges]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 7.73&lt;/ref&gt; and the existence of the garden implies that Herodotus believed that Midas lived prior to a Phrygian migration to Anatolia.

According to some accounts, Midas had a son, [[Lityerses]], the demonic reaper of men, but in some variations of the myth he instead had a daughter, Zoë or "life". According to other accounts he had a son [[Anchurus]].

[[Arrian]] gives an alternative story of the descent and life of Midas. According to him, Midas was the son of Gordios, a poor peasant, and a [[Telmissus|Telmissian]] maiden of the prophetic race. When Midas grew up to be a handsome and valiant man, the Phrygians were harassed by civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord. While they were still deliberating, Midas arrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly, wagon and all. They, comparing the oracular response with this occurrence, decided that this was the person whom the god told them the wagon would bring. They therefore appointed Midas king and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father’s wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the king. In addition to this the following saying was current concerning the wagon, that whosoever could loosen the cord of the yoke of this wagon, was destined to gain the rule of Asia. This someone was to be [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, Alexandri Anabasis, B.3.4-6&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of the legend, it was Midas' father [[Gordias]] who arrived humbly in the cart and made the [[Gordian Knot]].

Herodotus said that a "Midas son of Gordias" made an offering to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] of a royal throne "from which he made judgments" that were "well worth seeing", and that this Midas was the only foreigner to make an offering to Delphi before [[Gyges of Lydia]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus I.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The historical Midas of the 8th century BC and Gyges are believed to have been contemporaries, so it seems most likely that Herodotus believed that the throne was donated by the earlier, legendary King Midas. However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Encyclopædia Britannica, notes to Penguin edition of Herodotus.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myths ==
=== Golden Touch ===

One day, as [[Ovid]] relates in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' XI,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses11.html On-line text at Theoi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysus]] found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the [[satyr]] [[Silenus]], was missing.&lt;ref&gt;This myth appears in a fragment of [[Aristotle]], ''Eudemus'', (fr.6); [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was aware that Midas mixed water with wine to capture Silenus (''Description of Greece'' 1.4.1); a muddled version is recounted in [[Flavius Philostratus]]' ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', vi.27: "Midas himself had some of the blood of [[satyr]]s in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a satyr once, trespassing on his kinship with Midas, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them. Well, Midas, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a satyr is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you; so he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and let the satyr get at it, and the latter drank it up and was overcome".&lt;/ref&gt; The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian [[peasant]]s who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''Varia Historia'' iii.18 relates some of Silenus' accounts (Graves 1960:83.b.3).&lt;/ref&gt; On the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus in [[Lydia]]. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into [[gold]].

Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched an oak twig and a stone; both turned to gold. Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he touched every rose in the rose garden, and all became gold. He ordered the servants to set a feast on the table. Upon discovering how even the food and drink turned into gold in his hands, he regretted his wish and cursed it. [[Claudian]] states in his ''In Rufinum'': "So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold; but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold, cursed his prayer."&lt;ref&gt;Claudian, ''In Rufinum'': "sic rex ad prima tumebat Maeonius, pulchro cum verteret omnia tactu;
sed postquam riguisse dapes fulvamque revinctos in glaciem vidit latices, tum munus acerbum sensit et inviso votum damnavit in auro."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a version told by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in ''[[A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys]]'' (1852), Midas' daughter came to him, upset about the roses that had lost their fragrance and become hard, and when he reached out to comfort her, found that when he touched his daughter, she turned to gold as well. Now, Midas hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be delivered from starvation. Dionysus heard his prayer, and consented; telling Midas to wash in the river [[Pactolus]]. Then, whatever he put into the water would be reversed of the touch.

Midas did so, and when he touched the waters, the power flowed into the river, and the river sands turned into gold. This explained why the river Pactolus was so rich in gold, and the wealth of the dynasty claiming Midas as its forefather no doubt the impetus for this [[origin myth]]. Gold was perhaps not the only metallic source of Midas' riches: "King Midas, a Phrygian, son of [[Cybele]], first discovered black and white lead".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 274&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ears of a Donkey ===
[[File:Gordion82.JPG|thumb|The "Tomb of Midas" in [[Gordion]], dated 740 BC.]]
Midas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the fields and satyrs.&lt;ref&gt;This myth puts Midas in another setting. "Midas himself had some of the blood of satyrs in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears" was the assertion of [[Flavius Philostratus]], in his ''Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]'' (vi.27), not always a dependable repository of myth. ([http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_26.html on-line])&lt;/ref&gt; Roman mythographers&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] ''On Divination''i.36; [[Valerius Maximus]], i.6.3; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], xi.92f.&lt;/ref&gt; asserted that his tutor in music was [[Orpheus]].

Once, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of [[Apollo]], and challenged Apollo to a trial of skill (also see [[Marsyas]]). [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire. Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said "Must have ears of an ass!", which caused Midas's ears to become those of a [[donkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is illustrated by two paintings, ''"[[Apollo and Marsyas]]"'' by [[Palma il Giovane]] (1544–1628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment. Midas was mortified at this mishap. He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his [[barber]] of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it. However, the barber could not keep the secret. He went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up. A thick bed of reeds later sprang up in the meadow, and began whispering the story, saying "King Midas has an ass' ears".&lt;ref&gt;The whispering sound of reeds is an ancient [[literary trope]]: the Sumerian ''Instructions of Shuruppak'' (3rd millennium BCE) warn "The reed-beds are ..., they can hide (?) slander". ([http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr561.htm ''Instructions of Shuruppak'', lines 92-93]).&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources said that Midas killed himself by drinking the blood of an [[ox]].
 
Sarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of [[Arzawa|Mira]], on a seal inscribed in both [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiform and [[Luwian]] hieroglyphs. In this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks to justify the exotic attribute.

The stories of the contests with Apollo of Pan and Marsyas were very often confused, so [[Titian]]'s ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]'' includes a figure of Midas (who may be a self-portrait), though his ears seem normal.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', pp. 27-28, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Similar myths in other cultures ====
In pre-Islamic legend of Central Asia, the king of the [[Ossounes]] of the [[Yenisei]] basin had [[donkey's ears]]. He would hide them, and order each of his barbers murdered to hide his secret. The last barber among his people was counselled to whisper the heavy secret into a well after sundown, but he didn't cover the well afterwards. The well water rose and flooded the kingdom, creating the waters of [[Lake Issyk-Kul]].&lt;ref&gt;The legend is related in [[Ella Maillart]], [[Dervla Murphy]], ''Turkestan solo: a journey through Central Asia'' (1938) 2005:48f; a wholly separate origin uncontaminated by the legend of Midas is not likely.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Irish legend, the king [[Labraid Loingsech]] had horse's ears, something he was concerned to keep quiet. He had his hair cut once a year, and the barber, who was chosen by lot, was immediately put to death. A widow, hearing that her only son had been chosen to cut the king's hair, begged the king not to kill him, and he agreed, so long as the barber kept his secret. The burden of the secret was so heavy that the barber fell ill. A [[druid]] advised him to go to a crossroads and tell his secret to the first tree he came to, and he would be relieved of his burden and be well again. He told the secret to a large [[willow]]. Soon after this, however, a harper named Craiftine broke his instrument, and made a new one out of the very willow the barber had told his secret to. Whenever he played it, the harp sang "Labraid Lorc has horse's ears". Labraid repented of all the barbers he had put to death and admitted his secret.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text039.html 1.29]-[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text040.html 1.30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historicity==
The King Midas who ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC is known from Greek and Assyrian sources. According to the former, he married a Greek princess, [[Hermodike II (Demodike II, Hermodice II, Damodice II)|Damodice]] daughter of Agamemnon of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], and traded extensively with the Greeks. Damodice is credited with inventing coined money by [[Julius Pollux]] after she married Midas.&lt;ref&gt;The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, Martin Persson Nilsson, University of California Press, 1972, pg48&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe this Midas donated the throne that [[Herodotus]] says was offered to the [[Oracle of Delphi]] by "Midas son of Gordias" (see above). Assyrian tablets from the reign of [[Sargon II]] record attacks by a "Mita", king of the [[Mushki]], against Assyria's eastern Anatolian provinces. Some historians believe Assyrian texts called this Midas king of the "Mushki" because he had subjected the eastern Anatolian people of that name and incorporated them into his army. Greek sources including [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] I.3.21.&lt;/ref&gt; say that Midas committed suicide by drinking bulls' blood during an attack by the Cimmerians, which [[Eusebius]] dated to around 695 BC and [[Julius Africanus]] to around 676 BC. Archeology has confirmed that [[Gordium]] was destroyed and burned around that time.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible tomb==
[[Image:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations055 kopie1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Reconstruction of the Tumulus MM burial, [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara, Turkey.]]

In 1957, [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney Young]] and a team from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] opened a chamber tomb at the heart of the Great Tumulus (in Greek, Μεγάλη Τούμπα)—53&amp;nbsp;metres in height, about 300&amp;nbsp;metres in diameter—on the site of ancient [[Gordium|Gordion]] (modern Yassihöyük, Turkey), where there are more than 100 [[tumulus|tumuli]] of different sizes and from different periods.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli: The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1,'' (1981):79-102.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered a royal burial, its timbers dated as cut to about 740 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=DeVries |chapter=Greek Pottery and Gordion Chronology |editor-first=Lisa |editor-last=Kealhofer |title=The Archaeology of Midas and the Phrygians: Recent Work at Gordion |year=2005 |pages=42ff. |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology |isbn=1-931707-76-6 }} {{cite journal |first=Sturt |last=Manning |title=Anatolian Tree Rings and a New Chronology for the East Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=294 |issue=5551 |year=2001 |pages=2532–2535 [p. 2534] |doi=10.1126/science.1066112 |pmid=11743159|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; complete with remains of the funeral feast and "the best collection of Iron Age drinking vessels ever uncovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/1026/title/King_Midas_Modern_Mourners |work=Science News |title=King Midas' modern mourners |date=November 4, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This inner chamber was rather large: 5.15&amp;nbsp;metres by 6.2&amp;nbsp;metres in breadth and 3.25&amp;nbsp;metres high.

As this funerary monument was erected before the traditional date given for the death of King Midas in the early 7th century BC, it is now generally thought to have covered the burial of his father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5902">[[Image:Nydammose.2.jpg|thumb|300px|A modern-day view of what was once the Nydam Bog.]]

'''Nydam Mose''' ('''"Nydam Bog"''') is an archaeological site located at [[Øster Sottrup]], a town located in [[Sundeved]], eight kilometres from [[Sønderborg]], [[Denmark]].

==History==
In the [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age]], the site of the bog was a sacred place, where the weapons and ships of vanquished armies were offered to the [[Germanic paganism|indigenous gods]] in thanks for victory over the fallen enemy. Many items were deliberately destroyed (bent, broken or hacked into pieces) in ritual sacrificial acts, from the period 200 to 400 AD. Nydam Bog has played a role in the Danish national claim for [[Southern Jutland]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

The first known finds from the bog date from the 1830s, when a local farmer gave old swords and shields as toys to his children.

Amongst numerous other items, three boats were found in Nydam Bog. In particular, the 23 metre long oak boat, commonly known as "the Nydam Boat", maintains a distinguished position amongst Danish Iron Age finds, as it is the oldest known rowing vessel in [[Northern Europe]]. The oak (''egetræsbåden'') boat is on display at the archaeological museum in [[Gottorp|Gottorp Castle]], [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]], [[Germany]].

==Excavation==
[[Image:Nydammose.12.jpg|thumb|Objects discovered in Nydam Bog on display at Gottorp Castle.]]
===First excavation===
From 1859 to 1863, archaeologist Conrad Engelhardt excavated the bog. Engelhardt found weapons, tools, pieces of clothing and two intact clinker built boats, one made of oak and one made of pine. The weapons include [[lance]]s, [[spear]]s, [[bow (weapon)|bows]], [[arrow]]s and round [[shield]]s. Under these finds were the remains of a third boat, which apparently had been demolished already during the sacrifice. 

Engelhardt’s work ceased with the outbreak of the [[Second Schleswig War]] in early 1864. Some of the discoveries from the bog were lost during the Second Schleswig War. The smaller of the two boats, perhaps 19 meters long and made of pine, was hacked up and used as firewood by troops.

===Second excavation===
The [[National Museum of Denmark]] resumed excavation of the bog in 1989. During excavation a large quantity of weapons have come to light, in the form of swords, spears, bows and arrows; and also personal effects such as belt buckles, brooches and ornate clasps. These finds originate from the Iron Age, in the period between 250 and 550.

==Nydam boat==
[[Image:Nydamboat.2.jpg|thumb|The Nydam oak boat on display at [[Gottorf Castle]], [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]], [[Germany]].]]
The sacrifice site was probably used on different occasions during the years 200–450. The oak boat was the first boat found, and the only one still preserved. It has been [[Dendrochronology|dendro dated]] to 310–320. The oak boat is considered the oldest Nordic shipfind and the oldest known [[clinker built]] boat. It is 23&amp;nbsp;m long, c 4&amp;nbsp;m wide, of clinker type, and built for 15 pairs of oars. The Nydam Boat is the largest and best preserved of the boats found in Nydam Bog and is now displayed at [[Gottorf Castle]] in Schleswig, Germany. It once weighed over three tonnes and was rowed by thirty men.

==Nydam Society==
Interest in the archaeology of Nydam Bog has always been particularly lively in the local area. The Nydam discoveries were and remain a significant theme in the relationship between Danish and German cultures in the border region. On this basis, the "Society for Nydam Research" – commonly known as the Nydam Society - was formed in 1983. Through its work, this interest group has contributed to the resumption of National Museum of Denmark’s investigation of the bog.

Today, the site is a green meadow. Parking is available on Nydamvej. From here, there is a path (''Nydamstien'') to the small white house, ''Nydamhuset'', which is situated beside the site of the archaeological discoveries. It takes about 10 minutes to walk there.

The Nydam Society's long-standing desire to build a replica of the Nydam Boat has been realized. The Nydam Tveir was built employing the techniques of the time – both to exploit the material characteristics of the timber and to develop an understanding of how large vessels were built in that period. Construction of a replica of the Nydam Boat was based on the oak boat found in 1859. The construction of the Nydam Boat was divided into two phases. Phase 1 was a feasibility study to investigate the construction of the boat. Here the builders investigated prerequisites and gathered experience for use in Phase 2, which comprised building the complete boat.

'''''Philosophy in the Boudoir''''' (''La philosophie dans le boudoir'') is a 1795 book by the [[Marquis de Sade]] written in the form of a dramatic dialogue. Though initially considered a work of [[pornography]], the book has come to be considered a socio-political drama. Set in a bedroom, the two lead characters make the argument that the only moral system that reinforces the recent political [[French Revolution|revolution]] is [[libertinism]], and that if the people of France fail to adopt the libertine [[philosophy]], France will be destined to return to a monarchic state.&lt;ref&gt;"The Marquis de Sade: A Very Short Introduction" by John Phillips, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter titled "Fifth Dialogue", there is a lengthy section where the character Chevalier reads a philosophical pamphlet titled "Frenchmen, Some More Effort If You Wish To Become Republicans". The pamphlet clearly represents Sade's philosophy on [[religion]] and [[morality]], a philosophy he passionately hopes the citizens of France will embrace and codify into the laws of their new republican government.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy in the Bedroom" by Marquis de Sade, translated by Joachim Neugroschel, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Continually throughout the work, Sade makes the argument that one must embrace [[atheism]], reject society's beliefs about pleasure and pain, and further makes his argument that if any crime is committed while seeking pleasure, it cannot be condemned.&lt;ref name="seaver"&gt;"Philosophy in the Bedroom" by Marquis de Sade, translated by Richard Seaver and Austryn Wainhouse, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''Eugénie''', a 15-year-old girl who at the beginning of the dialogue is a [[virgin]], naïve of all things sexual, who has been brought up by her mother to be well-mannered, modest, decent and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedient]].
*'''Madame de Saint-Ange''', a 26-year-old libertine woman who is the owner of the house and bedroom in which the dialogue is set. She invites Eugénie for a two-day course on being libertine.
*'''Le Chevalier de Mirval''', Madame de Saint-Ange's 20-year-old brother. He aids his sister and Dolmancé on the ordeal of "educating" Eugénie.
*'''Dolmancé''', a 36-year-old atheist and bisexual (though with a strong preference for men), and friend of Le Chevalier's. He is Eugénie's foremost teacher and "educator".
*'''Madame de Mistival''', Eugénie's provincial, self-righteous mother.

==Plot==
In the introduction, the Marquis de Sade exhorts his readers to indulge in the various activities in the play. He says that the work is dedicated to "voluptuaries of all ages, of every sex" and urges readers to emulate the characters. "Lewd women", he writes, "let the voluptuous Saint-Ange be your model; after her example, be heedless of all that contradicts pleasure's divine laws, by which all her life she was enchained." He then urges "young maidens" to copy Eugénie; "be as quick as she to destroy, to spurn all those ridiculous precepts inculcated in you by imbecile parents". Finally, he urges male readers to "study the cynical Dolmancé" and follow his example of selfishness and consideration for nothing but his own enjoyment.

Dolmancé is the most dominant of the characters in the dialogue. He explains to Eugénie that [[morality]], [[compassion]], [[religion]], and [[modesty]] are all absurd notions that stand in the way of the sole aim of human existence: pleasure. Like most of Sade's work, ''Philosophy in the Boudoir'' features a great deal of [[sex]] as well as libertine philosophies. Although there is some torture, the dialogue contains no actual murder, unlike many of Sade's works.

Dolmancé and Madame de Saint-Ange start off by giving Eugénie their own brand of [[sex education]], explaining the biological facts and declaring that physical pleasure is a far more important motive for sex than that of reproduction. Both characters explain that she will not be able to feel "true pleasure" without pain. Then they eagerly get down to the practical lessons, with Le Chevalier joining them in the fourth act and swiftly helping to take away Eugénie's [[virginity]].

Eugénie is instructed on the pleasures of various sexual practices and she proves to be a fast learner. As is usually the case in Sade's work, the characters are all [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[sodomy]] is the preferred activity of all concerned, especially Dolmancé, who prefers male sexual partners and will not have anything other than anal intercourse with females. Madame de Saint-Ange and her younger brother, the ''Chevalier'', also have sex with one another, and boast of doing so on a regular basis. Their [[incest]] — and all manner of other sexual activity and taboos, such as sodomy, [[adultery]] and [[homosexuality]] — is justified by Dolmancé in a series of energetic arguments that ultimately boil down to "if it feels good, do it". The Marquis de Sade believed this was his ultimate argument: if a crime (even murder) took place during one's desire for pleasure, then it could not be punished by law. He was backed in this thought through his belief that [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] was wrong about mankind, that mankind is neither good or evil, it is his will that is ultimately evil. (Sodomy was illegal and punishable by death in France at the time the dialogue was written, and Sade himself was convicted of sodomy in 1772.)

The corruption of Eugénie is actually at the request of her father, who has sent her to Madame de Saint-Ange for the very purpose of having his daughter stripped of the morality her virtuous mother taught her.

The dialogue is split into seven parts, or "dialogues", and was originally illustrated by Sade himself. There is a lengthy section within the fifth dialogue titled "''Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans''", in which the Marquis de Sade argued that, having done away with the [[monarchy]] in the [[French Revolution]], the people of France should take the final step towards liberty by abolishing religion too. "Frenchmen, I repeat it to you: Europe awaits her deliverance from ''specter'' and ''censer'' alike. Know well that you cannot possibly liberate her from royal tyranny without at the same time breaking for her the fetters of religious superstition; the shackles of the one are too intimately linked to those of the other; let one of the two survive, and you cannot avoid falling subject to the other you have left intact. It is no longer before the knees of either an imaginary being or a vile impostor a republican must prostrate himself; his only gods must now be ''courage'' and ''liberty''. Rome disappeared immediately Christianity was preached there, and France is doomed if she continues to revere it".&lt;ref name="seaver" /&gt;

In the final act, Eugénie's mother, Madame de Mistival, arrives to rescue her daughter from the "monsters" who have corrupted her. Eugénie's father, however, warns his daughter and friends in advance and urges them to punish his wife, whose person and virtue he clearly loathes. Madame de Mistival is horrified to find that not only did her husband arrange for their daughter's corruption, but Eugénie has already lost any moral standards she previously possessed, along with any respect or obedience towards her mother. Eugénie refuses to leave and Madame de Mistival is soon stripped, beaten, whipped and raped, her daughter taking an active part in this brutality and even declaring her wish to kill her mother. Dolmancé eventually calls in for a servant who has [[syphilis]] to rape Eugénie's mother. Eugénie sews up her vagina and Dolmancé her anus to keep the polluted seed inside and she is then sent home in tears, knowing her daughter has been lost to the corrupt, libertine mentality of Dolmancé and his accomplices.

'''''Rast Goftar'''''  ("The Truth Teller") was an Anglo-Gujarati paper operating in [[Bombay]] that was started in 1851 by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and [[Kharshedji Rustomji Cama|Kharshedji Cama]] and championed social reform among [[Parsi]]s in Western India.

== Background ==
A riot between Parsis and Muslims concerning the printing of a picture of Mahomet in 1851 was an immediate cause of the founding of the paper. As the Riots in [[Bombay]] continued, the Parsis became frustrated with their leaders, and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] started the paper with the purpose of voicing the grievances of the poor and middle class of his people. Postal rates tended to limit their circulation to local or nearby areas, but sometimes enthusiasm for a cause led the managers of a paper to distribute several copies of each issue free. Thus, the founders of the paper lost some 10,000 rupees by distributing the first issues of the ''Rast Goftar'' free, impatient at the state of [[Parsi]] society, obviously in a hurry to reform it.

In 1857 the proprietors of ''Rast Goftar'' in Bombay converted their property into a joint-stock concern so that Nasarvanji Cama, who had financed the paper from the beginning, would not be the sole loss-bearer. K. R. Cama, Sorabji Shapoorji Bengalee, and Nowroji Fardonji all became proprietors. The local governments subsidized several vernacular journals in northern India, though only a few in Bengal and Bombay. Their subsidy consisted in subscribing to a certain fixed number of copies of the journals concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Uma Das|date=1977-01-01|title=The Indian Press 1870-1880: A Small World of Journalism|jstor=311549|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=11|issue=2|pages=213–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858 circulation rose from 432 to 852, a number then unheard of for native journalism. The  widened from exclusively Parsi topics to larger questions of Indian politics. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Rebellion of 1857]], the paper remained loyal to the British, and it even began the first English columns in Gujarat, mostly written by Nowroji Fardoonj. By the 1870's ''Rast Goftar'' was one of the four daily newspapers operating in [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]], and it was not only vigorous in itself, but was also the cause of vigor in other journals either by way of antagonism or support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karkaria|first=R.P.|date=October 1898|title=The Revival of the Native Press of Western India- The Rast Goftar|url=|journal=Calcutta Review|publisher=University of Calcutta|volume=107|pages=238–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion in [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]]''' is characterized by a largely homogeneous Armenian Apostolic population. Prior to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] a large population of [[Shia Islam|Shia Islamic]] [[Azerbaijanis]] also populated the area. While ownership is disputed, most of the region is claimed and governed by the ''de facto'' independent [[Republic of Artsakh]].

== History ==

=== Arrival of Islam ===
[[Islam]] arrived in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] with [[Arabs]] in the seventh century, gradually increasing as Islamic nations ruled the region.

=== Safavid Dynasty ===
In the sixteenth century, the first shah of the [[Safavid]] Dynasty, [[Ismail I]] (r. 1486-1524) established [[Shia Islam]] as the state religion. The Safavid Dynasty would have a strict policy of enforcing Shia Islam, which would bring political conflict with the Sunnis of the neighbouring [[Ottoman Empire]].

=== Russian Empire ===
In 1806, Northern Azerbaijan was annexed by the Russian Empire from the Persian Qajar Dynasty, this region also included Nagorno-Karabakh.

===Azerbaijan Democratic Republic===
In 1918, the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918 - 1920)]] declared independence from Russia during the [[Russian Civil War|Russian Civil war]]. But was promptly incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]] in 1920.

===Soviet era===
During the Soviet era, state atheism was enforced, which resulted in all of Nagorno-Karabakh's Churches and Mosques being closed.

=== After the collapse of USSR ===
After the collapse of USSR, the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] began. During which most of the local Sunni [[Azerbaijanis|Azeri]] population was deported by [[Armed Forces of Armenia|Armenian forces]]. The Azeri's which had stayed soon after emigrated back to Azerbaijan.

'''[[Sacred grove]]s of [[India]]''' are forest fragments of varying sizes, which are communally protected, and which usually have a significant religious connotation for the protecting community. Hunting and logging are usually strictly prohibited within these patches.&lt;ref&gt;Gadgil, M. and Vartak, V.D. ; Sacred groves of India : A plea for continued conservation
Journal of [[Bombay Natural History Society]], 72 : 314-320, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of forest usage like [[honey]] collection and [[Coarse woody debris|deadwood]] collection are sometimes allowed on a sustainable basis. Sacred groves did not enjoy protection via federal legislation in India. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Traditionally, and in some cases even today, members of the community take turns to protect the grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00000166/00/sudha.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012512/http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00000166/00/sudha.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-10|title=Wayback Machine|date=2007-06-10|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the introduction of the protected area category [[Conservation reserves and community reserves of India|community reserves]] under the [[Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002]] has introduced legislation for providing government protection to community held lands, which could include sacred groves.

Indian sacred groves are often associated with temples, monasteries, shrines or with burial grounds. Historically, sacred groves find their mentions in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts, from sacred tree groves in Hinduism to sacred deer parks in Buddhism for example.&lt;ref name=remains&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist remains in India|first=Dr. A.|last=Sen|publisher=Maha Bodhi Book Agency|location=Calcutta|year=2008|isbn=81-87032-78-2|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred groves may be loosely used to refer to natural habitat protected on religious grounds. Other historical references to sacred groves can be obtained in ''Vrukshayurveda'' an ancient treatise, ancient classics such as as [[Kalidasa]]'s [[Vikramuurvashiiya]]. There has been a growing interest in creating green patches such as ''[[Nakshatravana]]'' grove.

[[File:Banyan tree at Kanhirathara, Chirakkal.jpg|thumbnail|Banyan Tree at a temple in [[Kannur]], India]]
The Hindu tradition considers forests to be of three types - ''Tapovan'', ''Mahavan'' and ''Sreevan''. ''Tapovan'' are forests associated with penance (''Tapas''), and are inhabited by saints and ''rishis''. ''Mahavan'' refers to the grand natural forests. ''Tapovan'' and ''Mahavan'' are considered to be a ''Raksha'' ("sanctuary") for flora and fauna as ordinary human beings are not allowed to enter these forests. ''Sreevan'', which means, "forests of prosperity", consists of dense forests and groves. From the former, people would collect dry wood, leaves, forest produce and a limited amount of timber, though natural ecosystem would not be unnecessarily disturbed. Groves were considered as spaces of forests from where harvesting could be done. Sometimes, specific trees like mango trees could be planted and nurtured here. Groves were associated with religious rites, festivals and recreation. Typical recreational activities associated with these groves included ''jhoola''/ ''jhoolan''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ranchor Prime, Vedic Ecology: Practical Wisdom for Surviving the 21st Century, Mandala Publishing, Novato, CA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the villages, ''Panchavati'', or a cluster of five trees that represented the forests, were maintained. These trees represented the five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Planting and nurturing of trees has been a highly evolved practice in ancient India.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Vrukshayurveda, authored by Surapala, translated by Nalini Sadhale, Agri-History Bulletin No.1, Asian Agri-History Foundation, Secunderabad&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vrukshayurveda'', the science of plant life and also a 10th-century treatise of that title on the subject ascribed to Surapala, dealt with various species of trees and their growth. Verses 9-23 from this text indicate how mystical beliefs and conservation of ecology was inter-connected.

:''A person is honored in [[Vaikuntha]] for as many thousand years as the days he resides in a house where [[tulasi]] is grown.''

:''And if one properly grows [[bilva]], which pleases [[Lord Siva]], in his family, the goddess of riches resides permanently passes on to the sons and grandsons''

:''He who plants even a single [[Sacred_Fig|asvattha]], wherever it may be, as per the prescribed mode, goes to the abode of Hari.''

:''He who has planted [[Phyllanthus emblica|dhatri]] has performed several sacrifices. He has donated the earth. He would be considered a celebate forever.''

:''He who plant a couple of [[banyan]] trees as per the prescribed mode would go to the abode of Siva and many heavenly nymphs will attend upon him.''

:''After planting [[neem]] trees a person well-versed in [[dharma]] attains the abode of Sun. Indeed! He resides there for a long period.''

:''By planting four [[plaksa]] trees a person doubtlessly obtains the fruits of [[Rajasuya]] sacrifice.''

:''He who plants five or six [[mango]] trees attains the abode of [[Garuda]] and lives happily forever like gods.''

:''One should plant seven [[Butea monosperma|palasa]] trees or even one. One attains the abode of [[Brahma]] and enjoys the company of gods by doing so.''

:''He who himself plants eight [[udumbara]] trees or even prompts someone to plant them, rejoices in the lunar world''

:''He who has planted [[Madhuca longifolia|madhuka]] has propitiated [[Parvati]], has become free from diseases, and has worshipped all deities.''

:''If one plants ksirini, dadimi, rambha, priyala, and panasa, one experiences no affliction for seven births.''

:''He who has knowingly or unknowingly planted ambu is respected as a recluse even while staying in the house.''

:''By planting all kinds of other trees, useful for fruits and flowers, a person gets a reward of thousand cows adorned with jewels.''

:''By planting one asvattha, one picumanda, one [[nyagrodha]], ten [[tamarind]] trees, the group of three, viz., kapittha, [[bilva]], and amalaka, and five [[mango]] trees, one never visits hell.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Typically, sacred groves are associated with the concept of a ''presiding deity''. Often these sacred deities are numerous nature spirits and guardians associated with [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Buddhist mythology|Buddhist]] deities, such as nature spirits known as [[Yakshas]] (numerous nature spirits), [[Nāga]]s (serpent guardians) and guardian tutelary deities (like ''ayyanar'' and ''amman'') are also known. There are over 1000 deities associated with sacred groves in the states of [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]] alone. In [[Kodagu]] district in Karnataka from time immemorial the martial community of Kodavas had maintained over a 1000 "Devakadu" dedicated to Aiyappa the forest god.

==Uses==

'''Traditional uses''': One of the most important traditional uses of sacred groves was that it acted as a repository for various [[Ayurvedic]] medicines. Other uses involved a source of replenishable resources like fruits and honey. However, in most  sacred  groves it was taboo to hunt or chop wood. The vegetation cover helps reduce soil erosion and prevents [[desertification]], as in [[Rajasthan]]. The groves are often associated with ponds and streams, and meet water requirements of local communities. They sometimes help in recharging [[aquifer]]s as well.

'''Modern uses''': In modern times, sacred groves have become [[biodiversity hotspot]]s, as various species seek refuge in the areas due to progressive habitat destruction, and hunting. Sacred groves often contain plant and animal species that have become extinct in neighboring areas. They therefore harbor great genetic diversity. Besides this, sacred groves in urban landscapes act as "lungs" to the city as well, providing much needed vegetation cover.

==Locations==
Sacred groves are scattered all over the country, and are referred to by different names in different parts of India. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|scrub forest]]s in the [[Thar Desert]] of [[Rajasthan]] maintained by the [[Bishnoi]]s, to [[rain forest]]s in the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Kerala]]. [[Himachal Pradesh]] in the north and [[Kerala]] in the south are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka alone maintained over 1000 sacred groves in their region.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.cseindia.org/dte-supplement/forest20031231/forest-index.htm series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075638/http://cseindia.org/dte-supplement/forest20031231/forest-index.htm |date=2007-02-03 }} of articles in the journal ''Down to Earth'' on sacred groves&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurjar]] people of Rajasthan have a unique practice of neem (Azadirachta indica) planting and worshipping as abode of God [[Devnarayan]].Thus, a Gurjjar settlement appears like a human-inhabited sacred grove.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_pande_forest.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Mangar Bani, last surviving natural forest of Delhi is protected by Gurjars of nearby area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngtba.org/index.php/news?start=190 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002326/http://www.ngtba.org/index.php/news?start=190 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000.&lt;ref name = "mal"&gt;Malhotra, K. C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S., Cultural and 
Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India, INSA, New Delhi, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandra Guha, The Unquiet Woods, University of California Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|978-0520222359}})&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that around 1000&amp;nbsp;km² of unexploited land is inside sacred groves. Some of the more famous groves are the ''kavu''s of Kerala, which are located in the Western Ghats and have enormous biodiversity; and the ''law kyntang''s of [[Meghalaya]] – sacred groves associated with every village (two large groves being in [[Mawphlang]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://megtourism.gov.in/ecodestination.html Eco Destination . Mawphlang Sacred Forest]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mausmai]]) to appease the forest spirit.

Among the largest sacred groves of India are the ones in [[Hariyali]], near [[Gauchar]] in [[Chamoli District]] of [[Uttarakhand]], and the [[Cedrus deodara|Deodar]] grove in [[Shipin]] near [[Shimla|Simla]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Kodagu, a small region of about 4000&amp;nbsp;km² in Karnataka, had over 1000 sacred groves.

==Sarpa Kavu==
A Sarpakkavu or Snake Grove is a kind of holy grove found in Kerala. 
[[File:Kavu.jpg|thumb|Mannan Purath Kavu, [[Nileshwaram]]]]
[[Kavu]] is the traditional name given for Sacred groves across the [[Malabar Coast]] in [[Kerala]], South [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Jayarajan, [http://krpcds.org/publication/downloads/92.pdf Sacred Groves of North Malabar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326054142/http://krpcds.org/publication/downloads/92.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, Kerala Research Programme on Local Level Development, Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram ({{ISBN|81-87621-95-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Kavus are notable for [[Theyyam]], the centuries-old ritual dance.

==Threats==
Threats to the grove include [[urbanization]], [[over-exploitation]] of resources (like [[overgrazing]] and excessive firewood collection), and environmental destruction due to religious practices. Other threats to the sacred groves include invasion by [[invasive species]], like the [[invasive weed]]s ''[[Chromolaena odorata]]'', ''[[Lantana camara]]'' and ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]''.

==Traditions==
A large number of distinct local art forms and folk traditions are associated with the deities of sacred groves, and are an important cultural aspect closely associated with sacred traditions. Ritualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called ''Theyyam'' in Kerala and ''Nagmandalam'', among other names, in [[Karnataka]]. Often, elaborate rituals and traditions are associated with sacred groves,&lt;ref&gt;Chris A. Gregory, [http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-08-0-000-000-2004-Web/JSS-08-2-085-178-2004-Abst-PDF/JSS-08-2-093-104-2004-Gregory/JSS-08-2-093-104-2004-Gregory.pdf The Oral Epics of the Women of the Dandakaranya Plateau: A Preliminary Mapping], J.

'''Samuel L. Lewis''' also known as '''Murshid Samuel Lewis''' and '''Sufi Ahmed Murad Chisti''' (October 18, 1896 &amp;ndash; January 15, 1971) was an American mystic and horticultural scientist who founded what became the Sufi Ruhaniat International, a branch of the [[Chishti Order|Chishtia Sufi lineage]].&lt;ref name="Samuel L. Lewis 1987"&gt;{{cite book |author=Samuel L. Lewis |title= Sufi Vision and Initiation: Meetings with Remarkable Beings |year= 1987 |publisher= Sufi Islamia|location= San Francisco, California|isbn= 978-0-915424-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a lifetime of spiritual study with teachers East and West, primarily [[Inayat Khan]] and [[Nyogen Senzaki]], Lewis was recognized simultaneously as a Zen master and Sufi murshid (senior teacher) by Eastern representatives of the two traditions. He also co-founded the Christian mystical order called the [[Holy Order of Mans]]. His early interest in international seed exchange and organic agriculture also established him as one of the pioneers of green spirituality.&lt;ref name="Samuel L. Lewis 1987"/&gt; His most enduring legacy may be the creation of the [[Dances of Universal Peace]], an early interspiritual practice that has spread around the world in the 43 years since his passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Samuel L.|title=Spiritual Dance and Walk|date=1990|publisher=PeaceWorks International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace|isbn=978-0915424139|pages=17–24|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
{{Ināyati_Sufis}}
Lewis was born to Jewish parents. Lewis' father Jacob Lewis was a vice president of the [[Levi Strauss]] jeans manufacturing company. His mother was Harriett Rosenthal, the daughter of Lenore [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] of the international banking family. To his parents' dismay Lewis showed a keen interest in religion and spirituality from an early age and later rejected their attempts at as business career for him.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis. Samuel L. (1986). ''Sufi Vision and Initiation: Meetings with Remarkable Beings.'' San Francisco: Sufi Islamia/Prophecy. p.  5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 Lewis entered a Sufi community in [[Fairfax, California]] where he met Murshida Rabia Martin, a student of the Sufi teacher and musician [[Inayat Khan]]. A year later he began [[Zen]] study with [[Nyogen Senzaki]], a disciple of the [[Rinzai]] [[Zen Buddhist]] Abbot [[Soyen Shaku]]. The twin spiritual influences of Sufism and Zen were to remain central to him throughout  his life.

Lewis remained in the Fairfax Sufi community through the early 1920s. In 1923 a vision of [[Inayat Khan]] led Lewis into initiation by the Pir-O-Murshid. In 1926 he collaborated with [[Nyogen Senzaki]], a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk, in opening the first official Zen meditation hall ([[zendo]]) in [[San Francisco]].

Lewis continued to study Sufism and Zen, as well as [[yoga]], the latter with [[Swami Ramdas]] of [[Anandashram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Samuel L.|title=Sufi Vision and Initiation: Meetings with Remarkable Beings|date=1987|publisher=Sufi Islamia/Prophecy|isbn=978-0915424108|pages=156–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed an interest in horticulture and promoted seed exchanges internationally.&lt;ref name="Samuel L. Lewis 1987"/&gt; He was also an adherent and promoter of the [[General Semantics]] approach to psychology, language and translation begun by [[Alfred Korzybski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Douglas-Klotz|first1=Neil|title=Languages of Experience: The Theory and Practice of a General Semantics Sufi|journal=Cosmos: The Journal of the Traditional Cosmology Society of the University of Edinburgh|date=2008|volume=24|pages=89–103|url=http://www.tradcos.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he visited [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]]  and [[Egypt]], seeking the company of  other mystics and teachers. In 1960-62, while visiting Pakistan, he reported that he was publicly recognized as a [[Murshid]] by [[Sufi Barkat Ali|Pir Barkat Ali]], founder of Dar ul Ehsan.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Samuel L. (1986). ''Sufi Vision and Initiation: Meetings with Remarkable Beings''. San Francisco: Sufi Islamia/Prophecy. pp. 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, after further Zen study with, among others, [[Sokei-An]] Sasaki and Sagaku Shaku, Lewis was ordained a "Zen-Shi" (Zen Master) by Korean Zen master Dr. Kyung-Bo Seo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Samuel L.|title=Sufi Vision and Initiation: Meetings with Remarkable Beings|date=1987|publisher=Sufi Islamia/Prophecy|isbn=978-0915424108|pages=68–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, whilst recovering from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in a hospital Lewis reported that he heard the voice of God say, "I make you spiritual leader of the [[hippy|hippies]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer. Wali Ali. (2001). "A Sunrise in the West: Hazrat Inayat Khan's Legacy in California" in Khan, Zia Inayat, ed., ''A Pearl in Wine: Essays on the Life, Music and Sufism of Hazrat Inayat Khan.'' New Lebanon, NY: Omega. p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the remainder of his life Lewis traveled around [[California]] developing and teaching new forms of walking meditation as well as the [[Dances of Universal Peace]], which draw on all the spiritual traditions he had encountered. Lewis' work in the Dances of Universal Peace was also inspired by his time with American dance pioneer [[Ruth St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;Douglas-Klotz, Neil. (1990).

In 1982, the organization now known as the International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace was founded by Saadi Neil Douglas-Klotz and Tasnim Hermila Fernandez for the purpose of promoting Lewis' vision of the Dances as a form of "peace through the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Samuel L.|title=Spiritual Dance and Walk|date=1990|publisher=PeaceWorks International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace|isbn=978-0915424139|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization subsequently published many of St Denis' previously unpublished writings on spiritual dance and the mysticism of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. Kamae A., ed. (1997). ''Wisdom Comes Dancing: Selected Writings of Ruth St. Denis on Dance, Spirituality and the Body''. Seattle: PeaceWorks.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Lewis began initiating and training students first under the banner of Zen and then of Sufism. Just before his passing in 1971, Lewis formed an esoteric organization now known as the [[Sufi Ruhaniat International]] to help carry on his Sufi initiatic lineage in the [[Chishti]] Sufi tradition. Lewis died in January 1971 as a result of a fall one month earlier.&lt;ref name="remember"/&gt; Before his passing, he appointed his as his successor his Khalif Moineddin Jablonski, who directed the organization from 1971 until his own passing in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer.

New Lebanon, NY: Omega. p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Jablonski was succeeded by [[Shabda Kahn]] as Pir of the lineage.

==Dargah==
When Samuel Lewis died, he asked that his body be buried at the interspiritual community of Lama Foundation, near Taos, New Mexico&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.lamafoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;. The grave (called a "maqbara" in the Sufi tradition) became a pilgrimage site and was rebuilt several times in the intervening years. In August 2017, work was completed on a new building, called a "dargah," surrounding the gravesite. It is designed to facilitate visits by pilgrims in the same way that Sufi dargahs in other parts of the world do&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/index.php/work/dargah-project&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Quotations==
:''"No mechanical means, no rules, no rituals, nothing controlled by man alone can liberate man"''&lt;ref name="remember"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ram Dass |title= Be Here Now |year= 1971 |publisher= Lama Foundation |location= San Cristobal, New Mexico |isbn= 978-0-517-54305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"The Sufi dervishes, using their feet...rid their minds of useless luggage. The ridding of luggage is more important than the method. What is needed is a method that works, not a philosophy about method which can be very confusing."''&lt;ref name="remember"/&gt;

:''"Words are not peace. Thoughts are not peace. Plans are not peace. Programs are not peace. Peace is fundamental to all faiths. Peace is fullness, all inclusive...and must be experienced."

:''"One of the reasons I am teaching this music and dancing is to increase Joy, not awe towards another person, but bliss in our own self. This is finding God within, through experience."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">'''Saskia Weishut-Snapper''' (born 5 August 1938 in [[Amsterdam]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[fiber artist]]. 

== Early life and family==
Saskia grew up in [[Bergen, North Holland]], a town with an art colony in which both her parents were active. Her mother was {{ill|Mies Bloch|nl}}, a painter and illustrator, mostly known for her [[cross-stitch]] designs. Her father was {{ill|Rein Snapper|nl||WD=}}, a painter, illustrator, and wood printer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bottercourant.nl/nieuws/algemeen/5393-peintisseries-van-saskia-weishut-snapper|title=Peintisseries van Saskia Weishut-Snapper|date=2015-07-15|work=Bottercourant|access-date=2018-08-07|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saskia is married, has five sons, and lives in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Weishut-Snapper turned to textile arts in 1970. Creating mixed media scenes somewhere between painting and quilting, she  refers to her works as 'peintisseries'. The subjects of her art are often textile landscapes, fantasy buildings, abstract compositions and themes based on Jewish tradition. She mostly exhibits in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rheden.nieuws.nl/nieuws/100557/opening-expositie-peintisseries-saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Opening expositie Peintisseries van Saskia Weishut-Snapper|date=2017-05-28|work=Rheden|access-date=2018-08-07|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crescas.nl/nieuws/2013-03-22/wlooz/Peintisseries-van-Saskia-Weishut-Snapper/|title=Crescas nieuws: 'Peintisseries' van Saskia Weishut-Snapper - Crescas|website=www.crescas.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wevershuis.nl/tag/saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Saskia Weishut-Snapper {{!}} Museum Het Leids Wevershuis|website=www.wevershuis.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vezel.org/agenda/tentoonstelling-kunst-met-nesjomme-peintisseries-van-saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Van Textiel tot Tyvek, werk van Saskia Weishut-Snapper - Vezel|website=www.vezel.org|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pkcastricum.nl/foto-album/kunstwerken-saskia-weishut-snapper-pk-castricum/item1390|title=Kunstwerken Saskia Weishut - Snapper {{!}} PK Castricum|last=Castricum|first=Protestantse Kerk|website=www.pkcastricum.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destentor.nl/deventer/wandkleden-van-saskia-weishut-in-magna-domus~aa180751/|title=Wandkleden van Saskia Weishut in Magna Domus {{!}} destentor.nl|last=|first=|date=|website=www.destentor.nl|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.galeries.nl/expo.asp?exponr=11241|title=Saskia Weishut-Snapper: Tyvek Sandwiches - Museum Jan van der Togt : Expositie / Exhibition at GALERIES.NL|website=www.galeries.nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also showed her paintings in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Japan, Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.viralagenda.com/pt/events/418928/exposicao-saskia-weishut-snapper|title=Exposição - Saskia Weishut Snapper - Viral Agenda|website=www.viralagenda.com|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityguideny.com/article/Gallery-Shows-in-New-York-City-This-Week-Jun-4-Jun-11#.W2lPT4kzbIU|title=Gallery Shows in New York City This Week - Jun 4-Jun 11|website=www.cityguideny.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityguideny.com/event/Agora-Gallery-2017-12-07-2017-12-07|title=Tripping the Light Fantastic - Agora Gallery 12/07/17  through 01/18/18|website=www.cityguideny.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">'''Shahriyar II''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شهریار) was the eleventh ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 930 to 964. He was the son and successor of [[Sharwin II]]. 

After the fall of the [[Zaydids]] of [[Tabaristan]], Shahriyar II became involved in a power struggle between the [[Buyids]] and [[Ziyarids]] for the Tabaristan region. The Ziyarid ruler of Tabaristan, [[Vushmgir]], is known to have married the sister of Shahriyar. In 943, Vushmgir was expelled from Ray by the Buyid by [[Rukn al-Dawla]], and took refugee in the court of Shahriyar II. In 948, Rukn al-Dawla conquered Tabaristan, and forced Shahriyar to swear allegiance to the Buyids in person. However, Shahriyar still remained loyal to the Ziyarids and their Samanid overlords. Because of his pro-Ziyarid policies, Shahriyar was deposed in favor of his pro-Buyid brother [[Rustam II]] in 964. Shahriyar later tried to reclaim the Bavand throne by invading Tabaristan with an Samanid army in 968, but with no avail.

The '''Temple of Aphaia''' ({{lang-el|Ναός Αφαίας}}) or '''Afea'''&lt;ref&gt;The name Afea appears on all the local signs, Afea being the name of a Cretan woman of unsurpassed beauty. After escaping an unwelcome marriage on Crete, she was rescued by a fisherman from Aegina. In payment for this he also proposed an unwelcome marriage. So Afea headed out of Aghia Marina towards the mountain top where she vanished at the current site of the temple, where it is said that the fisherman established a shrine believing Afea to have been taken by the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; is located within a sanctuary complex dedicated to the goddess [[Aphaea|Aphaia]] on the Greek island of [[Aigina]], which lies in the [[Saronic Gulf]]. Formerly known as the Temple of [[Jupiter Panhellenius]], the great Doric temple is now recognized as dedicated to the mother-goddess Aphaia. It was a favorite of the neoclassical and romantic artists such as J. M. W. Turner. It stands on a c. 160&amp;nbsp;m peak on the eastern side of the island approximately 13&amp;nbsp;km east by road from the main port.&lt;ref&gt;The main port and the main city are named ''Aigina'', after the island. The Temple of ''Aphaia'' is 9.6&amp;nbsp;km east of this city. The sanctuary is also 29.5&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the [[Acropolis]] of Athens, which is visible across the gulf on a clear day.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Aphaea|Aphaia]]'' (Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀφαία}}) was a [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] who was worshipped exclusively at this sanctuary. The extant temple of c. 500&amp;nbsp;BC was built over the remains of an earlier temple of c. 570&amp;nbsp;BC, which was destroyed by fire c. 510&amp;nbsp;BC. The elements of this destroyed temple were buried in the infill for the larger, flat terrace of the later temple, and are thus well preserved. Abundant traces of paint remain on many of these buried fragments. There may have been another temple in the 7th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC, also located on the same site, but it is thought to have been much smaller and simpler in terms of both plan and execution. Significant quantities of Late Bronze Age figurines have been discovered at the site, including proportionally large numbers of female figurines (''kourotrophoi''), indicating – perhaps – that cult activity at the site was continuous from the 14th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC, suggesting a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] connection for the cult.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;Pilafidis-Williams argues that the character and relative proportions of the finds leads to the conclusion that the deity worshiped was a female fertility/agricultural goddess.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last temple is of an unusual plan and is also significant for its pedimental sculptures, which are thought to illustrate the change from [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] to [[Classical Greece|Early Classical]] technique. These sculptures are on display in the [[Glyptothek]] of Munich, with a number of fragments located in the museums at Aigina and on the site itself.&lt;ref&gt;The important Bronze Age archaeological site of Kolona is northwest of Aigina (the main city) along the coast, and a museum is located at this site. The museum at Aigina was the first institution of its kind in Greece, but most of the collection (other than a collection of bas relief panels from Delos) was transferred to Athens in 1834 (''EB''), where it can be seen in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]. The museum on the site contains a restoration of the Early Archaic temple entablature and pediment, as well as copies of elements of the pedimental sculpture of the Late Archaic temple set into restored sections of the pediment.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration and archaeology ==

[[Image:Plan Aphaia sanctuary-en.svg|thumb|right|220px|Plan of the sanctuary]]

The periegetic writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] briefly mentions the site in his writings of the 2nd century AD, but does not describe the sanctuary in detail as he does for many others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Description of Greece]] 2.30.3
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On ''Aigina'' as one goes toward the mountain of Pan-Greek Zeus, the sanctuary of ''Aphaia'' comes up, for whom [[Pindar]] composed an ode at the behest of the Aeginetans. The Cretans say (the myths about her are native to Crete) that Euboulos was the son of Karmanor, who purified [[Apollo]] of the killing of the Python, and they say that Britomaris was the daughter of Zeus and Karme (the daughter of this Euboulos). She enjoyed races and hunts and was particularly dear to Artemis. While fleeing from Minos, who lusted after her, she cast herself into nets cast for a catch of fish. [[Artemis]] made her a goddess, and not only the Cretans but also the Aeginetans reverence her. The Aeginetans say that Britomaris showed herself to them on their island. Her epithet among the Aeginetans is ''Aphaia'', and it is ''Diktynna'' on Crete.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- This semi-literal translation is my own, done for Wikipedia. User:Nefasdicere --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple was made known in Western Europe by the publication of the ''Antiquities of Ionia'' (London, 1797). In 1811, the young English architect [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], finishing his education on his academic [[Grand Tour]], and Baron [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (archaeologist)|Otto Magnus von Stackelberg]] removed the fallen fragmentary pediment sculptures. On the recommendation of Baron [[Carl Haller von Hallerstein]], who was also an architect and, moreover, a protégé of the art patron Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, the marbles were shipped abroad and sold the following year to the Crown Prince, soon to be King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. Minor excavations of the east ''peribolos'' wall were carried out in 1894 during reconstruction of the last temple.

Systematic excavations at the site were carried out in the 20th century by the German School in Athens, at first under the direction of [[Adolf Furtwängler]]. The area of the sanctuary was defined and studied during these excavations. The area under the last temple could not be excavated, however, because that would have harmed the temple. In addition, significant remains from the Bronze Age were detected in pockets in the rocky surface of the hill. From 1966 to 1979, an extensive second German excavation under [[:de:Dieter Ohly|Dieter Ohly]] was performed, leading to the discovery in 1969 of substantial remains of the older Archaic temple in the fill of the later terrace walls. [[Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner]] and Martha Ohly were also associated with this dig, which continued after the death of Dieter Ohly until 1988. Sufficient remains were recovered to allow a complete architectural reconstruction of the structure to be extrapolated; the remains of the entablature and pediment of one end of the older temple have been reconstructed in the on-site museum.

== Phases of the sanctuary ==

The sanctuary of Aphaia was located on the top of a hill c.&amp;nbsp;160&amp;nbsp;m in elevation at the northeast point of the island. The last form of the sanctuary covered an area of c. 80 by 80&amp;nbsp;m; earlier phases were less extensive and less well defined.

=== Bronze Age phase ===
In its earliest phase of use during the [[Bronze Age]], the eastern area of the hilltop was an unwalled, open-air sanctuary to a female fertility and agricultural deity.&lt;ref name=PW /&gt;  Bronze Age figurines outnumber remains of pottery. Open vessel forms are also at an unusually high proportion versus closed vessels. There are no known settlements or burials in the vicinity, arguing against the remains being due to either usage. Large numbers of small pottery chariots and thrones and miniature vessels have been found. Although there are scattered remains dating to the Early Bronze Age such as two [[Minoan seal-stones|seal stone]]s, remains in significant quantities begin to be deposited in the Middle Bronze Age, and the sanctuary has its peak use in the LHIIIa2 through LHIIIb periods. It is less easy to trace the cult through the Sub-Mycenean period and into the Geometric where cult activity is once more reasonably certain.

=== Late Geometric phase ===
Furtwängler proposes three phases of building at the sanctuary, with the earliest of these demonstrated by an altar at the eastern end dating to c. 700&amp;nbsp;BC. Also securely known are a cistern at the northeast extremity and a structure identified as a treasury east of the propylon (entrance) of the sanctuary. The temple corresponding to these structures is proposed to be under the later temples and thus not able to be excavated. Furtwängler suggests that this temple is the ''oikos'' (house) referenced in a mid-7th-century&amp;nbsp;BC inscription from the site as having been built by a priest for Aphaia; he hypothesizes that this house of the goddess (temple) was built of stone [[Socle (architecture)|socles]] topped with mud brick upper walls and wooden entablature.&lt;ref&gt;Ohly disputes that there is sufficient evidence for this ''oikos'' structure.&lt;/ref&gt;  The top of the hill was slightly modified to make it more level by wedging stones into the crevices of the rock.

=== Archaic phase (Aphaia Temple I) ===
[[Image:Aphaia-temple-4.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Reconstructed entablature and pediment of the Temple of Aphaia I in the on-site museum.]]
Ohly detected a (stone socle and mudbrick upper level) ''peribolos'' wall enclosing an area of c. 40 by 45&amp;nbsp;m dating to this phase. This ''peribolos'' was not aligned to the axis of the temple. A raised and paved platform was built to connect the temple to the altar. There was a ''propylon'' (formal entrance gate) with a wooden superstructure in the southeast side of the ''peribolos''. A 14&amp;nbsp;m tall column topped by a sphinx was at the northeast side of the sanctuary. The full study and reconstruction of the temple was done by Schwandner, who dates it to before 570&amp;nbsp;BC. In his reconstruction, the temple is [[prostyle]]-[[tetrastyle]] in plan, and has a pronaos and – significantly – an adyton at the back of the cella. As is the case at the temples of Artemis at [[Brauron]] and Aulis (among others), many temples of Artemis have such back rooms, which may indicate a similarity of cult practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hollinshead disputes that there is sufficient evidence for the presence of an adyton in this temple, and she questions whether similarity of form among temples of Artemis must indicate similarity of cult practice. This feature was not retained in the late Archaic temple, so its centrality to the cult practice is open to question.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cella of the temple of Aphaia had the unusual feature of having two rows of two columns supporting another level of columns that reached the roof. The [[architrave]] of this temple was constructed in two courses, giving it a height of 1.19&amp;nbsp;m versus the frieze height of 0.815&amp;nbsp;m; this proportion is unusual among temples of the region, but is known from temples in Sicily. A [[triglyph]] and [[metope (architecture)|metope]] frieze is also placed along the inside of the pronaos.&lt;ref&gt;Schwandner wants this placement to refute the idea that triglyphs are meant to represent the ends of wooden beams.&lt;/ref&gt;  These metopes were apparently undecorated with sculpture, and there is no evidence of pedimental sculptural groups. This temple and much of the sanctuary was destroyed by fire around 510&amp;nbsp;BC.

=== Late Archaic Phase (Aphaia Temple II) ===
[[Image:Aphaia-temple-1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|View east from the opisthodomos of the Temple of Aphaia II showing the colonnades of the cella.]]
Construction of a new temple commenced soon after the destruction of the older temple. The remains of the destroyed temple were removed from the site of the new temple and used to fill a c. 40 by 80&amp;nbsp;m terrace within the overall sanctuary of c. 80 by 80&amp;nbsp;m. This new temple terrace was aligned on north, west, and south with the plan of the new temple. The temple was a [[hexastyle]] peripteral [[Doric order]] structure on a 6&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;12 column plan resting on a 15.5 by 30.5&amp;nbsp;m platform; it had a [[distyle in antis]] [[cella]] with an [[opisthodomos]] and a [[pronaos]].&lt;ref&gt;The use of the 6&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;12 plan of the Late Archaic period soon gave way to the Classical period preference for the proportions of the 6&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;13 plan and similar.&lt;/ref&gt;  All but three of the outer columns were monolithic. There was a small, off-axis doorway between the cella and the opisthodomos. In similar design but more monumental execution than the earlier temple, the cella of the new temple had two rows of five columns, supporting another level of columns that reached to roof. The corners of the roof were decorated with sphinx ''acroteria'', and the central, vegetal ''acroterion'' of each side had a pair of ''[[Kore (sculpture)|kore]]'' statues standing one on either side, an unusual feature. The [[antefix]]es were of marble, as were the roof tiles.

[[Image:Aphaia-temple-3.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Doric frieze and horizontal [[geison|geisa]] of the Temple of Aphaia II showing slotted triglyphs.]]
Dates ranging from 510 to 470&amp;nbsp;BC have been proposed for this temple. Bankel, who published the complete study of the remains, compares the design features of the structure with three structures that were near contemporaries:

*The [[Athenian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]]
*The Doric Temple in the Marmaria area of Delphi
*The temple of Artemis at Delion on Paros

Bankel says the temple of Aphaia is more developed than the earlier phase of this structure, giving it a date of around 500&amp;nbsp;BC. The metopes of this temple, which were not found, were slotted into the triglyph blocks and attached to backer blocks with swallowtail clamps. If they were wooden, their lack of preservation is to be expected. If they were stone, then they may have been removed for the ancient antiquities market while the structure was still standing.&lt;ref&gt;Bankel notes that c.&amp;nbsp;80% of the triglyph blocks were damaged in a manner consistent with intentional breakage to remove the metopes.&lt;/ref&gt;  The altar was redone for this phase as well.

If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]].

== Pedimental sculptures ==
[[Image:Aphaia pediment Laomedon E-XI Glyptothek Munich 85.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Sculpture of a warrior from the east pediment of the Temple of Aphaia II.]]
The marbles from the Late Archaic temple of ''Aphaia'', comprising the sculptural groups of the east and west pediments of the temple, are on display in the [[Glyptothek]] of Munich, where they were restored by the Danish neoclassic sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. These works exerted a formative influence on the local character of [[Neoclassicism]] in Munich, as exhibited in the architecture of [[Leo von Klenze]]. Each pediment centered on the figure of Athena, with groups of combatants, fallen warriors, and arms filling the decreasing angles of the pediments. The theme shared by the pediments was the greatness of ''Aigina'' as shown by the exploits of its local heroes in the two [[Trojan war]]s, one led by [[Heracles#Heracles' Trojan War|Heracles]] against [[Laomedon]] and a second led by [[Agamemnon]] against [[Priam]]. According to the standard myths, Zeus raped the nymph ''Aigina'', who bore the first king of the island, [[Aiakos]]. This king had the sons [[Telamon]] (father of the Homeric hero [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]) and [[Peleus]] (father of the Homeric hero [[Achilles]]). The Greek idolize heroes who fallen at war, to die on the battleground was a great honor it depicted courage and strength. When a hero died it was though that they become immortal because they prove themselves to the Gods&lt;ref name="Spivey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spivey|first1=Nigel|title=Greek sculpture|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521756983}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The sculptures preserve extensive traces of a complex paint scheme, and are crucial for the study of painting on ancient sculpture. The marbles are finished even on the back surfaces of the figures, despite the fact that these faced the pediment and were thus not visible.

[[Image:Aphaia pediment warrior W-VII Glyptothek Munich 79.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Sculpture of a warrior from the west pediment of the Temple of Aphaia II.]]
Ohly had contended that there were four total pedimental groups (two complete sets of pediments for the east and west sides of the temple); Bankel uses the architectural remains of the temple to argue that there were only three pedimental groups; later in his life, Ohly came to believe that there were only two, which was shown persuasively by Eschbach.&lt;ref&gt;N. Eschbach, Die archaische Form in nacharchaischer Zeit: Untersuchungen zu Phänomenen der archaistischen Plastik des 5. und 4. Jhs. v. Chr.” Unpublished Habilitationschrift, University of Giessen.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were shallow cuttings and many dowels used to secure the plinths of the sculptures of the west pediment (the back of the temple). The east pediment used deep cuttings and fewer dowels to secure the plinths of the statues. There were also a number of ''[[geison]]'' blocks that had shallow cuttings and many dowels like the west pediment, but that did not fit there. Bankel argues that sculptures were set on both the east and the west pediments with these shallow cuttings, but that the sculptures of the east pediment were removed (along with the ''geison'' blocks cut to receive them) and replaced with a different sculptural group. This replacement appears to have been carried out before the raking ''geisa'' were installed on the east pediment, since the corner geisa were not cut down to join to the raking ''geisa'': i.e. the 1st phase of the east pediment was replaced with the 2nd phase before that end of the temple was completed. As the eastern facade of the temple (the front) was the most important visually, it is not surprising that the builders would choose to focus additional efforts on it.

=== Eastern pediment ===
[[File:Aphaia Eastern Pediment.jpg|thumb|right|370px|Colourful Reconstruction of the Eastern pediment]]
The first [[Trojan war]], not the one described by [[Homer]] but the war of [[Heracles#Heracles' Trojan War|Heracles]] against the king of [[Troy]] [[Laomedon]] is the theme, with [[Telamon]] figuring prominently as he fights alongside Heracles against king Laomedon. This pediment is thought to be later than the west pediment and to show a number of features appropriate to the Classical period: the statues show a dynamic posture especially in the case of Athena, chiastic composition, and intricate filling of the space using the legs of fallen combatants to fill the difficult decreasing angles of the pediment. Part of the eastern pediment was destroyed during the [[Persian Wars]], possibly by a thunderbolt. The statues that survived were set up in the sanctuary enclosure, and those that were destroyed, were buried according to the ancient custom. The old composition was replaced by a new one with a scene of a battle, again with [[Athena]] at the center.&lt;ref&gt;Leaflet "The Sanctuary of Aphaia on Aegina", Greek Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Receipts Fund, Athens 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western pediment ===
[[File:Aphaia Western Pediment.jpg|thumb|right|370px|Colourful Reconstruction of the Western pediment]]
The second [[Trojan war]] – the one described by [[Homer]] – is the theme, with [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] (son of [[Telamon]]) figuring prominently. The style of these sculptures is that of the Archaic period. The composition deals with the decreasing angles of the pediment by filling the space using a shield and a helmet.

'''The Order of Christian Mystics''' was a 20th-century spiritual order that was promulgated to give to the Western world advanced [[Christian mysticism]] based on the Western mystery school tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', JG Melton, McGrath Pub, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Leaders of America'', Gale Cengage, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The order was founded in Philadelphia in 1908 by Harriette Augusta and Frank Homer Curtiss. Its original name was '''The Order of the Fifteen''', but it was later changed to '''The Order of Christian Mystics'''. Their intent was to combine [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] with traditional Christian doctrine. Their teachings were transmitted through Harriette by the Founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], otherwise simply referred to as '''The Teacher of the Order'''.

The teachings of the order were promulgated mainly through a system of correspondence, extensive publishing of books and delivering of lectures at many centres. Their pupils numbered many thousands in over 70 countries.  Mainly their works were aimed at the American esoteric fraternity, for it was believed that America would remain the spiritually dominant nation regarding Western mysticism for many years to come.

The spiritual philosophy as espoused by this Order was based on a system of personal regeneration, otherwise called [[spiritual alchemy]], by transmuting the base creative energy, through Divine purity, prayer, devotion, study and meditation. This was put forth in the Western mystical tradition, a system of [[mysticism]] suitable for the Western culture and mindset, encompassing a new interpretation on all former teachings given under the names of [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Gnosticism]] and the Western mystery school teachings.

The published works of their Teacher, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, was mainly aimed at making available to the Western world the ancient Teachings of the East.  This new effort had as its aim the promulgation of Christian mysticism based on the life and teachings of the Master Jesus and a mystical interpretation of the Bible, especially the works of the New Testament.

Together through Hierarchy, Teacher, Order and inner circle they published 27 bound volumes of mystical teachings running over many editions, answered thousands of letters, delivered thousands of lectures, demonstrations and services across the USA over a 40-year period.  It has only been in recent years (2009)  that the combined works of the Order have once more seen the light of day and have been made available to all in the public domain.

Harriette Augusta Curtiss, co-founder of The Order of Christian Mystics and later the Universal Religious Foundation, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1856.&lt;ref&gt; ''Encyclopedia of American Women and Religion'',  June Melby Benowitz, 1998, 1st Edition. &lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were John Horace Brown, organizer of the Pennsylvania State Teachers' Association and Emma Brightly Brown. Curtiss received a cultured education and developed into a talented musician and actress. After starring in a number of amateur theatrical productions she had the opportunity to become a professional, but her mother dissuaded her from doing so. She therefore put her writing talents to use for many years, authoring a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer under the pen name "The Bachelor Girl."  As the years passed, Curtiss found herself to be a gifted clairvoyant, developing a direct contact with that ascended teacher known as Madame Blavatsky and eventually launched a career in the realm of mysticism. 

In 1907 she married Dr Frank Homer Curtiss,  and together they began working as occult teachers and writers. In the year of their marriage they founded The Order of the 15, which in 1908 became known as The Order of Christian Mystics.  Harriette, who became known within the order as Rahmea, assumed the role of teacher, and her husband took the position of secretary (and was known by his order name of Pyrahmos). They worked together to prepare material for publication, though Harriette was the primary author. Throughout the rest of her life, she issued monthly lessons for students. 

The Curtisses produced more than 27 books and publications. The first was compiled from Harriette's written responses to questions from students and was titled Letters from the Teacher (1909). Her early lessons were combined in The Voice of Isis (1912), which became the order's basic introductory text. Later a more advanced text was published under the title The Message of Aquaria (1921). The Curtisses wrote several books during World War I, including The War Crisis (1914) or The Philosophy of War, being a philosophical treatise on the mystical causes of war, and The Key to the Universe (1915). In the latter volume they contended that all personal experiences are expressions of one great law based on mathematical principles and that the "unfoldment of the godlike possibilities inherent in each Soul follows, step by step, the same order of events that is followed in the evolution of the Cosmos, and that such steps are symbolized by the first 22 numbers". Realms of the Living Dead: A Brief Description of Life after Death appeared in 1917. In 1919 they published a sequel to The Key to the Universe titled The Key of Destiny. Many more books followed in later years.  

During the war the Curtisses founded the Church of the Wisdom Religion, a less exclusive group than their earlier order. In 1929 after the Curtisses moved to Washington, D.C., the church was incorporated as the Universal Religious Foundation.  

After suffering from a long mystical illness towards the end of her life, Harriette Augusta Curtiss entered transition on the 22nd of September 1932 in Washington, D.C., and followed her Teacher, Madame Blavatsky, into the Higher Realms. She had reached the age of 76.
Dr. Frank Homer Curtiss maintained a successful healing practice until his passing in 1946 and implemented a constructive and truly holistic healing practice, side by side with the highest mystical Teachings of the Order. This encompassed specialized dieting, in vogue to this day and radionics, then still in its infancy. Frank Homer Curtiss, many years younger than Harriette, re-married in 1937 to Eleanor Chapman Stevens who helped him to continue his work until his passing.  She became the sole heir and executor of his estate and it is assumed the keeper of the archives of the Order at Homers passing. Homer entered transition in 1946 at the age of 71. &lt;ref&gt;''Priestess of The Flame'', Mount Linden Publishing, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Three of Swords''' is the third [[playing card|card]] of the [[suit (cards)|suit]] of [[suit of swords|swords]]. The suit is present in Italian, Spanish and [[tarot]] decks. 

==Card reading==
This card depicts a fundamentally sorrowful experience— tarot readers suggest this may be in the form of a lost relationship, an accidental death, or some other form of not just depression or malaise but deeply emotional sorrow.  When the card appears "reversed" in a spread, this is not usually read as meaning the "opposite" of sorrow, but rather a sorrow that is somehow mitigated but its circumstances or that is not as bad as it could have been.  It is among the most negative cards within the tarot deck.&lt;ref name="Willowmagic2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raven Willowmagic|title=Tarot: Tips of the Trade: Tying It All Together|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_AGWOcHgrcC&amp;pg=PA39|date=15 July 2010|publisher=Raven Willowmagic|isbn=978-1-4536-4855-1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between '''[[transgender]] people and [[religion]]''' varies widely around the world. Religions range from condemning any [[gender variance]] to honoring transgender people as religious leaders. Views within a single religion can vary considerably.

==Abrahamic religions==
[[Abrahamic religions]] have creation stories in which [[God]] creates people, "male and female".&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{bibleref|Genesis|1:27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|75|39|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is sometimes interpreted as a divine mandate against gender variance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  The [[Torah]] contains specific prohibitions on cross-dressing&lt;ref name="Deuteronomy"&gt;{{bibleref|Deuteronomy|22:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and damaged genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Deuteronomy|23:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The term ''saris'', generally translated to English as "[[eunuch]]" or "[[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]",&lt;ref name="Strong's"&gt;Strong's Concordance, #5631&lt;/ref&gt; appears 45 times in the Tanakh. It frequently refers to a trusted but gender variant person who was delegated authority by a powerful person.&lt;ref name="bibleeunuchs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/bibleeunuchs.htm|title=The forty-five occurrences of ''saris'' in the Old Testament |work=Born Eunuchs Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether most were in fact castrated.&lt;ref name="bibleeunuchs"/&gt;  In Isaiah 56 God promises eunuchs who keep the Sabbath and hold fast to his covenant that he will build an especially good monument in heaven for them, to make up for their childlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Isaiah|56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] (טומטום in Hebrew, meaning "hidden") is a term that appears in Jewish Rabbinic literature and usually refers to a person whose sex is unknown, because their genitalia are covered or "hidden". A tumtum is not defined as a separate gender, but rather a state of doubt.

[[Androgynos]] (אנדרוגינוס in Hebrew, translation "intersex") refers to someone who possesses both male and female sexual characteristics. The nature of the individual's gender is ambiguous.

====Orthodox Judaism====
[[Orthodox Judaism]] asserts that sex/gender is an innate and eternal category based on verses in the [[Book of Genesis]] about [[Adam and Eve]] and the creation of maleness and femaleness.&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt; Sex-change operations involving the removal of genital organs are forbidden on the basis of the prohibition against “anything which is mauled, crushed, torn or cut” (Lev. 22:24). A further prohibition in Deut. 22:5, proscribes not only cross-dressing but any action uniquely identified with the opposite sex, and this would also apply to an operation to transform sexual characteristics.&lt;ref name=apple&gt;{{cite web|last=Apple|first=Raymond|title=Transsexuality - Ask the Rabbi|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/07/transsexuality-ask-the-rabbi/|work=OzTorah|accessdate=16 June 2014}} See also {{cite book|last1=Bleich|first1=J. David|last2=Rosner|first2=Fred|title=Jewish Bioethics|publisher=KTAV Publishing House|isbn=9780881256628}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, nevertheless, Orthodox authorities who recognize the efficacy of [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS) in changing halachic sex designation.&lt;ref name=orens&gt;{{cite web|last=Orens|first=Beth|title=About the responsa of Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Waldenberg, author of the Tzitz Eliezer, which are relevant to the status of transexuals|url=http://www.starways.net/beth/tzitz.html|work=Beth Orens' Gender Pages|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Joy Ladin]] became the first openly transgender professor at an Orthodox institution ([[Stern College for Women]] in [[Manhattan]]).&lt;ref name=ladin&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladin|first=Joy|title=Through the door of life : a Jewish journey between genders|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wis.|isbn=9780299287306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Topics Guest Speakers|url=http://www.sjjcc.org/arts/performance-guest-speakers/|work=Edward &amp; Bernice Wenger Center for the Arts|publisher=Sid Jacobson Jewish Community Center|accessdate=2 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314060544/http://www.sjjcc.org/arts/performance-guest-speakers/|archivedate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hasidic Judaism====
[[Hasidic Judaism]] as of now, has no place for trans people as everything in the community is determined by gender roles.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Brigit|title=Amid a shifting tide of tolerance, transgender Jews search for faith and community|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/02/23/finding-faith-and-community-as-a-transgender-jew/|work=New York Times|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Hasidic Jews are barely aware of trans people, and the topic is never discussed altogether.&lt;ref name=nyp&gt;{{cite web|last=Fears|first=Donika|title=I left Hasidism to become a woman|url=https://nypost.com/2015/11/18/i-left-hasidism-to-become-a-woman/|work=New York Post|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to come out as trans in a Hasidic community was trans activist and writer [[Abby Stein]], who is also a direct descendant of Hasidic Judaism's founder the [[Baal Shem Tov]]. When Stein came out she was shunned by her family, and received much scorn from the Hasidic community.&lt;ref name=pinknews&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormick|first=Joseph Patrick|title=This trans woman got some serious hate when she left Hasidism behind|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/11/19/this-trans-woman-got-some-serious-hate-when-she-left-hasidism-behind/|work=Pink News|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conservative Judaism====
[[Conservative Judaism]] has mixed views on transgender people. In 2003 the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] approved a rabbinic ruling that concluded that sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is permissible as a treatment of [[gender dysphoria]], and that a transgender person's sex status under Jewish law is changed by SRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keshetonline.org/resource/status-of-transsexuals/ |title=Status of Transsexuals |date=3 December 2003 |first=Mayer |last=Rabinowitz |authorlink=Mayer Rabinowitz |publisher=[[Keshet (organization)|Keshet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have not yet been any openly transgender rabbis or rabbinical students affiliated with Conservative Judaism. But the Jewish Theological Seminary, one of three Conservative movement schools, openly admits students of all sexual orientations and gender identities for rabbinical training and ordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JTS :: The Rabbinical School|url=http://www.newjts.jtsa.edu/rabbinical-school.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115120036/http://newjts.jtsa.edu/rabbinical-school.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 January 2015|website=The Jewish Theological Seminary|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Emily Aviva Kapor]], who had been ordained privately by a "[[Conservadox]]" rabbi in 2005, began living as a woman in 2012, thus becoming the first openly transgender female rabbi in all of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Naomi |last=Zeveloff |url=http://forward.com/articles/180230/emily-aviva-kapor-creating-a-jewish-community-for/ |title=Emily Aviva Kapor: Creating a Jewish Community for Trans Women |work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]] |date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], which is the international association of Conservative rabbis, passed a "Resolution Affirming the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/resolution-affirming-rights-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-people |title=Resolution Affirming the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People |publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly |date= |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zauzmer |first=Julie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/01/the-rabbis-of-conservative-judaism-pass-a-resolution-supporting-transgender-rights/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-local:homepage/card |title=The rabbis of Conservative Judaism pass a resolution supporting transgender rights |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/about-us-0 |title=About Us |publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly |date= |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reform Judaism====
[[Reform Judaism]] has expressed positive views on transgender people. Reform Judaism's [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] first addressed the issue of transgender Jews in 1978, when they deemed it permissible for a person who has undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) to be married according to Jewish tradition.&lt;ref name=reform-devises&gt;{{cite news|title=Reform Devises Sex-Change Blessings|url=http://forward.com/articles/11403/reform-devises-sex-change-blessings-/#ixzz2FRMb98N7|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=137.

Calls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrj.org/Advocacy/ResolutionsStatements/Resolutions2003/2003TransgenderandBisexualRights.aspx |title=Transgender and Bisexual Rights - 2003 |publisher=[[Women of Reform Judaism]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516091332/http://www.wrj.org/Advocacy/ResolutionsStatements/Resolutions2003/2003TransgenderandBisexualRights.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Elliot Kukla]], who had come out as transgender six months before his ordination, became the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.&lt;ref name=now-out /&gt; In 2007 the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] issued a new edition of ''Kulanu'', their resource manual for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender inclusion, which for the first time included a blessing sanctifying the sex-change process.

====Reconstructionist Judaism====
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] has expressed positive views on transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sex and the Seminary: Preparing Ministers for Sexual Health and Justice |first=Kate M. |last=Ott |isbn=978-1-893270-49-7 |publisher=Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing, [[Union Theological Seminary (Manhattan)|Union Theological Seminary]] |accessdate=2013-10-06 |url=http://www.rrc.edu/sites/default/files/legacy/Pages%20from%20SexandtheSeminary_ReligiousInstitute-Criteria.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the Reform rabbi [[Margaret Wenig]] organized the first school-wide seminar at the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] which addressed the psychological, legal and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or [[intersex]].&lt;ref name=wenig-faculty /&gt; In 2013 the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] issued a resolution stating in part, "Therefore be it resolved that the RRA [Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association] directs its executive director and board to move forward, in cooperation with the RRC [Reconstructionist Rabbinical College] and all relevant associated entities, in educating RRA members about issues of gender identity, to urge the Reconstructionist movement to similarly educate its constituency and to adopt policies that will do all that is possible to provide full employment opportunities for transgender and gender nonconforming rabbis, and to explore how the Reconstructionist movement can best influence the wider Jewish and non-Jewish world to [be] welcoming and inclusive of all people, regardless of gender identity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therra.org/resolutions/RRA_Transgender%20Resolution%20RRA%20Adopted%203.12.2013.pdf |title=RRA Resolution on Gender Identity |publisher=[[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] |date=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222235012/http://www.therra.org/resolutions/RRA_Transgender%20Resolution%20RRA%20Adopted%203.12.2013.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association approved a resolution committing themselves to work for "full inclusion, acceptance, appreciation, celebration and welcome of people of all gender identities in Jewish life and in society at large"; the resolution also "strongly advocates for the full equality of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people and for equal protections for people of all gender identities under the law, at all levels of government, in North America and Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/03/29/news-opinion/united-states/reconstructionist-rabbis-affirm-full-inclusion-of-transgender-gender-fluid-jews |title=Reconstructionist rabbis affirm full inclusion of transgender, gender-fluid Jews &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====
In 1998, after she won the Eurovision song competition, a serious religious debate was held as to whether, and how, [[Dana International]] (a transgender woman) should pray in a synagogue. One rabbinical authority concluded that Dana should be counted in a [[minyan]] as a man, but could not sing in front of the community since she was also a woman, according to the rabbi, and that would violate the Orthodox rule of [[kol isha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/72653/the-space-between-stanford-prof-talmudic-rabbis-were-into-analyzing-sexuali/ |title=the space between &amp;#124; Stanford prof: Talmudic rabbis were into analyzing sexuality &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2014-09-18 |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 a transgender Jewish woman, Kay Long, was denied access to the [[Western Wall]], first by the women's section and then by the men's section.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4612205,00.html Transgender woman denied entry to Western Wall] YNET News, January 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.635838 Transgender woman prevented from accessing Western Wall] Haaretz, January 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Long's presence was prevented by "modesty police" at women’s section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration. They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women’s section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem’s Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long’s experience was not unique. "Gender separation at the Western Wall is harmful for transgender people. This is not the first story that we know of with transgender religious people that wanted to go to the Western Wall and pray and couldn’t," said Elinor Sidi, who expected that the battle for access to the Western Wall for the LGBTQ community would be a long and difficult one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/transgendered-woman-barred-from-western-wall-prayer/ Transgendered woman barred from Western Wall prayer] Times of Israel, January 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It was later asserted that Kay Long would have been permitted in the women's section except for her clothing. "It was not an issue of her gender, but the way she was dressed."&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt;

Several non-denominational Jewish groups provide resources for transgender people.

The [[New Testament]] presents eunuchs (Greek ''eunochos'', similar to Hebrew ''saris'') as acceptable candidates for evangelism and baptism, as demonstrated in the account of the conversion of an [[Ethiopian eunuch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref| Acts|8|27–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While answering questions about marriage and divorce, Jesus says that "there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Matthew|19|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussion has occurred about the significance of the selection of the Ethiopian eunuch as being an early gentile convert to Christianity: the inclusion of a eunuch, representing a sexual minority, in the context of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack Bartlett |last= Rogers |year=2009 |authorlink= Jack Rogers (clergy) |title= Jesus, the Bible, and Homosexuality: Explode the Myths, Heal the Church |pages= 132–135 |publisher= Westminster John Knox |isbn= 978-0-664-23269-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MUAL7iZHVN4C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=homosexuality+and+the+Ethiopian+Eunuch&amp;ei=lspXSqu9O5KAzgTYzPwi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a 2000 document from the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] concludes that the sex-change procedures do not change a person's gender in the eyes of the Church. "The key point", that document states, "is that the transsexual surgical operation is so superficial and external that it does not change the personality. If the person was a male, he remains male. If she was female, she remains female."&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite news |first= John|last= Norton|title=Vatican says 'sex-change' operation does not change person's gender|work= Catholic News Service|date= 14 January 2003|accessdate= 19 July 2009|url= http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/CatholicTSDecision.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document also concludes that a "sex-change" operation could be morally acceptable in certain extreme cases, but that in any case transgender people cannot validly marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= John|last= Norton|title= Vatican says 'sex-change' operation does not change person's gender|work= Catholic News Service|date= 14 Jan 2003|accessdate= 19 July 2009|url= http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/CatholicTSDecision.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced [[gender studies]], warning that it blurs the distinction between male and female and could thus lead to the "self-destruction" of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24836472-5005962,00.html|title=The Advertiser - Latest Adelaide and South Australia News - The Advertiser|website=www.news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned against the manipulation that takes place in national and international forums when the term "gender" is altered. "What is often expressed and understood by the term 'gender,' is definitively resolved in the self-emancipation of the human being from creation and the Creator", he warned. "Man wants to create himself, and to decide always and exclusively on his own about what concerns him."  The Pontiff said this is humanity living "against truth, against the creating Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-24652?l=english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224112659/http://www.zenit.org/article-24652?l=english |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-24 |title=Pontiff Calls for "Ecology of Man" &amp;#124; ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome |publisher=ZENIT |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2015-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in 2015, the Vatican declared that transgender Catholics cannot become godparents, stating in response to a transgender man's query that transgender status "reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality" and that, "[t]herefore it is evident that this person does not possess the requirement of leading a life according to the faith and in the position of godfather and is therefore unable to be admitted to the position of godfather or godmother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wofford |first=Taylor |title=Transgender Catholics Can't Be Godparents, Vatican Says|url=http://www.newsweek.com/vatican-transgender-godparents-368142|publisher=Newsweek.com|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics, nevertheless, have held a range of positions regarding transgender issues. Theologian James Whitehead, for instance, has said, “The kind of transition that trans people are talking about is very similar to the journey of faith through darkness and desert that people have been making for thousands of years.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Nathan|last= Schneider|title=A nun's secret ministry brings hope to the transgender community|work=Al Jazeera America|date= 2 March 2014|accessdate= 17 March 2015|url= http://america.aljazeera.com/features/2014/3/transgender-and-catholic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Patrick - St. Anthony Church (Hartford, Connecticut)|The Roman Catholic Church]] has been involved in the outreach to LBGT community for several years and continues doing so through Franciscan urban outreach centers, namely, the "Open Hearts" outreach in [[Hartford, CT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spsact.org/main-menu/community-life/open-hearts-lgbt-ministry/|title=Open Hearts LGBT Ministry :: Community Life :: St. Patrick - St. Anthony Church and The Franciscan Center for Urban Ministry :: Hartford, CT Roman Catholic Church|website=www.spsact.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Albert Mohler]], then president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], said "Only God has the right to determine gender", adding, "any attempt to alter that creation is an act of rebellion against God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transgriot.blogspot.com/search?q=%22albert+mohler%22|title=TransGriot|website=transgriot.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transgriot.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Monica |url=http://transgriot.blogspot.com/2006/10/being-true-to-themselves.html |title=TransGriot: Being True To Themselves |publisher=Transgriot.blogspot.com |date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "Christians are obligated to find our definitions … in the Bible. What the activists want to call 'sex-reassignment surgery' must be seen as a form of bodily mutilation rather than gender correction. The chromosomes will continue to tell the story...Gender is not under our control after all. When a nation's moral rebellion comes down to this level of confusion, we are already in big trouble. A society that can't distinguish between men and women is not likely to find moral clarity in any other area of life."&lt;ref name="transgriot.blogspot.com"/&gt; In 2014, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] approved a resolution at its annual meeting stating that "God's design was the creation of two distinct and complementary sexes, male and female" and that "gender identity is determined by biological sex, not by one's self-perception".&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/southern-baptist-convention-approves-anti-transgender-resolution |title=Southern Baptist Convention Approves Anti-Transgender Resolution &amp;#124; Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Hrc.org |date=2014-06-10 |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the resolution opposes hormone therapy, transition-related care, and anything else that would "alter one's bodily identity", as well as opposing government efforts to "validate transgender identity as morally praiseworthy".&lt;ref name="hrc.org"/&gt; Instead, the resolution asks transgender people to "trust in Christ and to experience renewal in the Gospel".&lt;ref name="hrc.org"/&gt;

===Islam===
In Islamic literature, the word ''[[mukhannathun]]'' is used to describe "effeminate men". The term has sometimes been equated to transgender women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People|last1=Roughgarden|first1=Joan|page=362|year=2013|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520957978}}&lt;/ref&gt; gay men, members of a third gender, or intersex individuals,&lt;ref name="Alipour" &gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alipour|first=M|date=2016|title=Islamic shari'a law, neotraditionalist Muslim scholars and transgender sex-reassignment surgery: A case study of Ayatollah Khomeini's and Sheikh al-Tantawi's fatwas|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15532739.2016.1250239|journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|volume=17:1|pages=91-103|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not neatly fit into any of those categories.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowson|first=Everett K.|date=October 1991|title=The Effeminates of Early Medina|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/The_effeminates_of_early_medina.pdf|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|location=|publisher=American Oriental Society|volume=111|issue=4|pages=671–693|doi=10.2307/603399|jstor=603399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Muhsin |last=Hendricks |title=Islam and Homosexuality |publisher=ILGA |date=July 2006 |location=ILGA's preconference on religions |url=http://doc.ilga.org/content/download/4522/27322/version/1/file/ILGA-July06-Religions.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-22 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222247/http://doc.ilga.org/content/download/4522/27322/version/1/file/ILGA-July06-Religions.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of ''mukhannathun'' varied throughout early Islamic history, and the meaning of the term took on new dimensions over time. In some eras, men deemed ''mukhannathun'' were persecuted and castrated, while in others they were celebrated as musicians and entertainers.&lt;ref name="TEOEM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Music of the Arabs|last1=Touma|first1=Habib|year=1975|page=135-136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the term came to be associated with the receptive partner in [[gay sexual practices]], as homosexuality was seen as an extension of effeminacy. In the late medieval era, several Islamic scholars held that ''mukhannathun'' who had innate feminine mannerisms were not blameworthy as long as they did not violate religious laws concerning sexual morality.&lt;ref name="TEOEM" /&gt;

Due to [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] issuing a [[fatwa]] allowing [[sex reassignment surgery]] for intersex and transgender individuals,&lt;ref name="Alipour" /&gt; Iran carries out more sex change operations than any other nation in the world except for [[Thailand]]. It is sanctioned as a supposed "cure" for homosexuality, which is punishable by death under Iranian law. The government even provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance and a sex change is recognised on the birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7259057.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Iran's 'diagnosed transsexuals' |first=Vanessa |last=Barford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baha'i Faith===
In the [[Baha'i Faith]], transgender people can gain recognition in their gender if they have medically transitioned under the direction of medical professionals, and if they have [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS). After SRS, they are considered transitioned, they may have a Baha'i marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_transsexuality |title=Transsexuality |publisher=[[Universal House of Justice]] |date=26 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Hinduism and LGBT topics}}

[[Hindu]] philosophy has the concept of a [[Third gender|third sex]] or [[third gender]] (''tritiya-prakriti'' – literally, "third nature"). The people in this category of sex/gender are called Hijras in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neither Man Nor Woman: The Hijras of India|last=Nanda|first=Serena|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=978-0534509033|location=|page=137|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as homosexuals, transsexuals, bisexuals, the intersexed, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pattanaik |first=Devdutt |title=The Man Who Was a Woman and Other Queer Tales from Hindu Lore |page=10 |location=Binghamton, NY |publisher=Harrington Park Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1560231806}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such persons were not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others=Translated by George Bühler |title=The Laws of Manu |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu.htm |chapter=Chapter 3:49 |chapterurl=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. Hijras identify themselves as incomplete men, that they do not have the desires (for women) that other men do. This lack of desire they attribute to  a "defective organ." If a Hijra is not born with a "defective" organ (and most are not), he must make it so by emasculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neither Man Nor Woman: The Hijras of India|last=Nanda|first=Serena|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=978-0534509033|location=|page=143|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often kept their own societies or town quarters, performed specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and were generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. However, these beliefs are not upheld in all divisions of Hinduism. In Hinduism, the universal creation is honored as unlimitedly diverse and the recognition of a third sex is simply one more aspect of this understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Amara Das |year=2003 |title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex |page=110 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Xlibris |isbn=978-1-4535-0317-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people in ancient Hindu society ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

Within the Hindu context, Hijras have always been considered a part of the third gender diaspora, and hence the term Hijra, Transgender, Third gender will be used interchangeably.

Due to their classification as third gender and being sexually neutral, Transgender people, especially the devotees of Lord Krishna, have been historically shown to bestow blessings. And, being sexually neutral was considered especially auspicious in Vedic culture because, the attraction between a man and woman was thought to create further attachments such as children due to procreation, and a home in terms of property, which would result in the living entities being entangled in ''samsara'', the cycle of repeated birth and death.

The people of the third sex have had a prominent role in the arts and entertainment.Historically referred to as Nartaka At the birth of a baby, N''artaka'' dancers would arrive, and dance and sing the name of the God Krishna, and bless the baby. As per custom, they were given precious jewellery and silks by the family of the baby for their contribution.

One more example of Transgender people being portrayed in Hindu history is that of Lord Arjuna being depicted as Brihannala in the Mahabharata, who was a person of third gender. Brihanalla was shown to be an instructor singing and dancing in King Virata’s court. But, Lord Arjuna/ Brihanalla was first tested for his third-sex nature by assuring he had no lust for females, and would have been examined for testicles if he had been a eunuch. This is not the first example of the presence of a person of third gender in Hindu texts, but this example most pertains to the topic of third gender people and their auspiciousness.

=== Transgender people in contemporary Indian society ===
In October 2013, "India's Supreme court stated that transgenders have remained untouchable in society with restricted access to education, health care and jobs. The justices criticized the government for such discrimination during a hearing of public interest litigation filed by the National Legal Services Authority".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agoramoorthy|first1=Govindasamy|last2=Hsu|first2=Minna J.|title=Living on the Societal Edge: India's Transgender Realities|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|date=2014|volume=54|issue=4|pages=1451–1459|doi=10.1007/s10943-014-9987-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem for Hijras first began during the British rule (1757-1947) with the introduction of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 1860 which declared homosexuality as a crime, and had an extended listing which has declared "Transgenders as criminal elements in society" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transgender people have been treated as outcasts within Indian society and thus have been "deprived of social and cultural participation for nearly two centuries." Many biologically male Hijras undergo a ritualized castration called nirva (sex reassignments).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have limited access to education, health care and public facilities and are treated as nonentities legally, which is in violation of the Constitution of India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite being recognized as legal citizens, only an estimated 25% of transgender people have obtained the national identification (Aadhar card). Transgender people are unable to "exercise their democratic rights in marriage, adopting/raising children and utilizing financial support system such as free and subsidized health care, surgeries and medical treatments" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been some support for transgender people as "The Supreme Court has directed the central government to place transgendered people in the other backward classes (OBCs) to classify their castes denoting their socially and economically disadvantaged status in society" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as they fall within the classification of people as defined in Article 15 (4) of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court of India has directed all Indian states to build separate restrooms for transgender people, and "to establish welfare agencies to enhance their health and medical needs." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scripture]] does not distinguish same-sex sexual activity from heterosexual activity, both being seen as non-conducive to spiritual growth.&lt;ref name=Greenberg303&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Greenberg |editor-first=Yudit Kornberg |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions |volume=2 |page=303 |chapter=Homosexuality in Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoag6b3JvYC&amp;pg=PA303 |publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-981-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thai Buddhism]], being [[kathoey]] (an umbrella term that roughly maps to a range of things from MtF transsexualism to male homosexuality) is seen as being part of one's [[karma]] if it should be the case for a person. The response is one of "pity" rather than "blame". Kathoey are generally seen as not likely to form lasting relationships with men, and the lay explanation of their karma is that they are working out debts from adulterous behavior in past lives. In the past they disrupted marriages, and now they are doomed to never marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenscene.com/ironladies/reviews/questions.html|title=14 Questions |first=Andrew |last=Matzner |year=2000 |work=Golden Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, kathoey are still not allowed to legally become female or marry a man. Same-sex marriage is not possible in Thailand. Transgender women however can marry their European partners, if that is legislatively possible in their partner's country, and leave Thailand.

In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] monks take vows of celibacy, and self-control over sexual impulses is idealized as part of the path to [[nirvana]]. In the 1980s, in response to growing awareness of the AIDS crisis, some Buddhist writers drew on Buddhist teachings to argue that homosexual behavior was unnatural and unethical and demonstrated a lack of self-control. However, other Buddhist scholars have argued that karmic debt only accumulates around heterosexual immorality when patriarchal notions of male ownership of female sexuality are disrupted (for example, pre-marital sex is "theft of virginity" by a man from the woman's father). According to this view, the difficulties and pain of gender variant lives are part of how this debt is ''paid off'' in subsequent lives and as such it incurs no ''additional'' karmic debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enabling.org/ia/vipassana/Archive/J/Jackson/homoBuddhaJackson.html|title=Male Homosexuality and Transgenderism in the Thai Buddhist Tradition |first=Peter A. |last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shinto==
Shinto kami associated with same-sex love or gender variance include: [[shirabyōshi]], female or transgender kami represented as half-human, half-snake. They are linked to Shinto priests of the same name, who are usually female (or occasionally transgender) and perform [[ceremonial dance]]s in traditional men's clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conner |first1=Randy P. |last2=Sparks |first2=David Hatfield |last3=Sparks |first3=Mariya |year=1998 |title=Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol and Spirit |isbn=0-304-70423-7 |page=305 |chapter=Shirabyoshi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ōyamakui no kami]], a transgender [[Yama-no-Kami|mountain spirit]] that protects industry and childbearing (notably enshrined in [[Hie Shrine]]);&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 259, "Oyamakui"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Inari Ōkami]], the kami of agriculture and rice, who is depicted as various genders, the most common representations being a young female food goddess, an old man carrying rice, and an androgynous [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref name=smyers8&gt;{{cite book|last=Smyers|first=Karen Ann|title=The fox and the jewel : shared and private meanings in contemporary Japanese inari worship|year=1999|publisher=Univ. of Hawaií Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824820589|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inari is further associated with foxes and [[Kitsune]], shapeshifting fox trickster spirits. Kitsune sometimes disguise themselves as women, independent of their true gender, in order to trick human men into sexual relations with them.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 203, "Kitsune"&lt;/ref&gt; Common belief in [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|medieval Japan]] was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox.&lt;ref name="Tyler xlix"&gt;Tyler (1987), xlix.{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confucianism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
One issue that Confucianism is quite clear on is the importance of [[filial piety]] with an accompanying tradition of [[veneration of the dead]]. People are supposed to respect and obey their parents, get married, and then have children to extend their family lines. Gender variant people who are physically capable of living up to this standard would be generally encouraged to enter a marital relationship, have children, and be discreet about any additional relationships (for example homosexual partners) on the side, if absolutely necessary.

==Chinese religions==
[[Eunuchs]], male-bodied people castrated for royal services, existed in China from 1700 BC until 1924 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Jennifer W.|title=Another side of Chinese eunuch history: Castration, marriage, adoption, and burial|journal=Canadian Journal of History|date=December 1993|volume=28|issue=3|page=459|url=http://ijll.synergiesprairies.ca/index.php/jss/article/view/108/79|doi=10.3138/cjh.28.3.459|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502214830/http://ijll.synergiesprairies.ca/index.php/jss/article/view/108/79|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This social role had a long history, with a continuous community, and a highly public role. Before being castrated a Chinese eunuch would be asked if he "would ever regret being castrated" and if the answer was "no" then surgery would take place. It's an open question as to who would answer this way and why. The historical status of Chinese eunuchs was a curious mixture of extreme weakness and great power. The allure of power and influence were sometimes offered as excuses for the decision to become a eunuch. It has been speculated that Chinese monarchs trusted their eunuchs because the inability to have children left them with no motivation to seek power or riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/eunuchs1.html|title=Hidden Power: The Palace Eunuchs of Imperial China|first=Mary M.|last=Anderson|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727020848/http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/%7Ephalsall/texts/eunuchs1.html|archivedate=27 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear to what extent eunuchs were transgender or otherwise gender-variant, but the history of eunuchs in Chinese culture is important to its views on transgender people.

==African religious beliefs==
The [[Akan people]] of [[Ghana]] have a pantheon of gods that includes personifications of [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. These personification manifest as androgynous and transgender deities, and include Abrao (Jupiter),&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 40, "Abrao"&lt;/ref&gt; Aku (Mercury),&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 47, "Aku"&lt;/ref&gt; and Awo (Moon).&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 79, "Awo"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the creation myth of the [[Dogon people]] the first 8 people on the earth, 4 men and 4 women, started the 8 Dogon families through a special arrangement with Amman where they could fertilize themselves, being dual and bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;Griaule, Marcel. Conversations with Ogotemmeli. London: Oxford, 1934. p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythology of the [[Shona people]] of [[Zimbabwe]] is ruled over by an androgynous creator god called [[Mwari]], who occasionally splits into separate male and female aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 243, "Mwari"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian Aboriginal==
The [[Rainbow Serpent]] [[Ungud]] has been described as androgynous. Shaman identify their erect penises with Ungud, and his androgyny inspires some to undergo ceremonial [[penile subincision]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 329, "Ungud"&lt;/ref&gt; Angamunggi is another Rainbow Serpent, worshipped as a "giver of life".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 58, "Angamunggi"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Australian mythological beings include [[Labarindja]], blue-skinned wild women or "demon women" with hair the colour of smoke.&lt;ref&gt;Róheim (2008), p. 388 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Stories about them show them to be completely uninterested in romance or sex with men, and any man forcing his attention upon them could die, due the "evil magic in their vaginas". They are sometimes depicted as gynandrous or intersex, having both a penis and a vagina. Ths is represented in ritual by having their part played by men in women's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 211, "Labarindja"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Islands==
Third gender, or gender variant, spiritual intermediaries are found in many pacific island cultures, including the [[bajasa]] of the eastern [[Toradja]] people of [[Sulawesi]], the [[bantut]] of the [[Tausūg people]] of the south [[Philippines]], and the [[bayoguin]] of the pre-Christian Philippines. These shamans are typically biologically male but display feminine behaviours and appearance, and are often homoerotically inclined.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 81, "Bajasa"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 82, "Bantut"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 85, "Bayoguin"&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian Philippines had a [[Polytheism|polytheistic religion]], which included the hermaphroditic gods [[Bathala]] and [[Malyari]], whose names means "Man and Woman in One" and "Powerful One" respectively; these gods are worshipped by the Bayagoin.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 84, "Bathala"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 225, "Malyari"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Nambas language|Big Nambas]] speakers of [[Vanuatu]] have the concept of divinely approved-of homoerotic relationships between men, with the older partner called the "dubut". This name is derived from the word for shark, referring to the patronage of the shark-human hybrid creator god [[Qat (deity)|Qat]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 90, "Big Nambas"&lt;/ref&gt;

Among their pantheon of deities, the [[Ngaju people]] of [[Borneo]] worship [[Mahatala-Jata]], an androgynous god. The male part of this god is [[Mahatala]], who rules the Upper World, and is depicted as a [[hornbill]] living above the clouds on a mountain-top; the female part is Jata, who rules the Underworld from under the sea in the form of a water-snake. These two manifestations are linked via a jewel-encrusted bridge that is seen in the physical world as a rainbow. Mahatala-Jata is served by "[[balian (mythology)|balian]]", female hierodules, and ''[[basir]]''", transgender shamans metaphorically described as "water snakes which are at the same time [[hornbill]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 224, "Mahatala-Jata"&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar transgender shamans, the ''manang bali'' (which literally means a transformed shaman from a male into a woman), are found in the [[Iban people]] in Borneo such as in Sarawak. ''Manang bali'' is the third and highest degree of shamanism after accomplishing the second degree of ''manang mansau'' "cooked shaman" and the first degree of ''manang mataq'' "uncooked shaman". The initiation ceremony for becoming a manang bali is called "Manang bangun manang enjun" which can be literally translated as the Awakened shaman, shaken shaman.&lt;ref&gt;"Manangism" By the Venerable Archdeacon J. Perham&lt;/ref&gt; After this ceremony, a manang bali dresses and acts like women and have homoerotic relationships. This makes them both the target of ridicule and respected as a spiritual intermediary. Boys fated to become manang bali may first dream of becoming a woman and also of being summoned by the god of medicine [[Menjaya Raja Manang]] or the goddess Ini Inee or Ini Andan, who is regarded the natural-born healer and the god of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 225, "Manang bali"&lt;/ref&gt; Menjaya Raja Manang began existence as a malegod, until their brother Sengalang Burong's wife became extremely sick. This prompted Menjaya into becoming the world's first healer, allowing him to cure his [[sister-in-law]], but this treatment also resulted in Menjaya changing into a woman or androgynous being.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 230, "Menjaya Raja Manang"&lt;/ref&gt; Menjaya was consecrated as the first manang bali by his own sister, Ini Inee Ini Andan in the first ever awakening-shaking ceremony and the first healing by a name-changing "belian" curing rite.

==Neopagan religion==
{{See also|Wicca and LGBT people}}
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
In most branches of [[Wicca]], a person's status as trans- or cisgender is not considered an issue. Transgender people are generally magickal people, according to Karla McLaren in her ''Energetic Boundaries'' study guide. Transgender people are almost always welcomed in individual communities, covens, study groups, and circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/gay-wicca.html |title=The Scoop on Gay Wicca |work=Wicca Spirituality: A New Wicca for a New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transgender people were initially attracted to [[Modern Paganism]] because of this inclusion.

However, there are some Neopagan groups that do not welcome transgender people. In some cases, this is because of the emphasis on the union of male and female, and the exclusion of transgender individuals from such practices.&lt;ref name="EncWitch"/&gt; Also, some [[separatism#Gender|gender separatist]] groups exclude transgender people, often on the basis that non-transgender individuals share certain spiritual qualities derived from genetic or biological sex.&lt;ref name="EncWitch"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first=Shelley|last=Rabinovitch|author2=James Lewis|publisher=Citadel Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0806524061
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dianic Wicca]] is an example of such a separatist group.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Margaret |title=[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing down the moon: witches, Druids, goddess-worshippers, and other pagans in America]] |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=126 |isbn=0-14-303819-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical myth==
{{Main|LGBT themes in mythology}}

The patron god is [[Dionysus]], a god gestated in the thigh of his father Zeus, after his mother died from being overwhelmed by Zeus's true form.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_dionysus.html |title=Dionysus |work=Subjects in the Visual Arts |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |date=19 September 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712090224/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_dionysus.html |archivedate=12 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aphroditus]] was an [[androgyny|androgynous]] Aphrodite from [[Cyprus]] with a religious cult in which worshipers [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]],&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' iii.8&lt;/ref&gt; in later mythology became known as [[Hermaphroditus]], the son of Hermes and Aphrodite who merged bodies with the water nymph [[Salmacis]], transforming him into an androgynous being. In [[Phrygia]] there was [[Agdistis]], a hermaphroditic being created when Zeus unwittingly impregnated [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. The gods feared Agdistis and Dionysus castrated her; she then became the goddess [[Cybele]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' vii.17.§ 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Norse gods were capable of changing gender at will, for example [[Loki]], frequently disguised himself as a woman and gave birth to a foal while in the form of a white mare, after a sexual encounter with the stallion [[Svaðilfari]]. Comparison of a man to a child-bearing woman was a common insult in Scandinavia, and the implication that Loki may be bisexual was considered an insult.&lt;ref name=viklady&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.shtml |title=Homosexuality in Viking Scandinavia |work=The Viking Answer Lady}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human fertility was a major aspect of Egyptian mythology, and was often entwined with the crop fertility provided by annual flooding of the river Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Bonnie |last2=Haggerty |first2=George E. |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-1920-7 |page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection was shown in iconography of Nile-gods, such as [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]], god of the [[Nile]], and [[Wadj-wer]], god of the [[Nile Delta]], who although male were depicted with female attributes such as pendulous breasts, symbolizing the fertility the river provides.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p.170, "Hapy"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Zoroastrianism in India''' has significant history within the country. Zoroastrians have lived in India since the [[Sasanian dynasty|Sasanian period]].&lt;ref name=Continuity/&gt; The Zoroastrians also moved to India in successive migrations during the Islamic period. The initial migration following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] has been canonized as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. Zoroastrianism meanwhile suffered a decline in Iran after the conquests. Subsequent migrations also took place after the attempts by [[Safavids]] to convert their subjects to [[Shia Islam|Shiism]].&lt;ref name=Ringer/&gt;

Due to persecution of Zoroastrians in other countries and the liberal atmosphere and patronisation of India, today the largest population of Zoroastrians resides in India, where Zoroastrians have been allowed to play a notable role in the [[Economy of India|Indian economy]], [[Bollywood|entertainment]], the [[Indian Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the [[Indian freedom movement]] during [[British Raj]]. The Zoroastrian groups are regarded as either [[Parsi]] or [[Irani (India)|Irani]] depending on the time of migration to India.

== History ==
By 632 A.D., [[Yazdgird III]] came to power in Iran but the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab/Muslim army]] had already begun [[Muslim conquest of Persia|invading Iran]]. The Muslims [[Battle of Nahāvand|defeated]] them at [[Nahavand]] and Yazdgird was slain by a miller in [[Merv]] in 652, bringing an end to the Sasanian dynasty and thus of the official history of Zoroastrian Iran. While losing their religion and script along with some Sasanian historiographical literature, the language and culture essentially survived. Between the seventh and thirteenth century, political and social pressures resulted in ascendancy of Iranian Muslim over the Zoroastrians. With the conquests, Iranians gradually lost their predominant religion.&lt;ref name=Continuity&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuity in Iranian Identity: Resilience of a Cultural Heritage|pages=54-55, 136-137|publisher=Routledge|author=Fereshteh Davaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Zoroastrians moved to India in successive migrations in the Islamic period. The initial migration following the conquest has been characterized as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. According to the account, the Zoroastrians suffered at their hands and in order to protect themselves and safeguard their religion, fled first to northern Iran, then to the [[Hormuz Island|island of Hormuz]] and finally to India. This generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises Muslim persecution while identifying Parsis as religious refugees. Recently, scholars have questioned this explanation of Iranian origins. There is a scarcity of sources about the migration. Historians are forced to rely exclusively on ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'' written in 1599 by a Parsi Priest and ''Qissah-ye Zartushtian-e Hindustan'' written more than 200 years later. This is complicated by the fact that there were already Zoroastrians in India in the Sasanian period.&lt;ref name=Ringer&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oyiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|title=Pious Citizens: Reforming Zoroastrianism in India and Iran|pages=25, 26|publisher=Syracuse University Press|author= Monica M. Ringer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iranian Zoroastrians are known to have been trading with India for centuries before the dates calculated for arrival of Parsis per [[Qissa-i Sanjan]]. Ruksana Nanji and Homi Dhalla while discussing archaeological evidence for 'The Landing of Zoroastrians at Sanjan', conclude that the most likely date for the migration at the start of the middle phase of their chronology, namely the early-to-mid-eighth century. Nevertheless, they express their general skepticism about the Qissa-i Sanjan account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i2wCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205|title=The Zoroastrian Myth of Migration from Iran and Settlement in the Indian Diaspora: Text, Translation and Analysis of the 16th Century Qesse-ye Sanjān 'The Story of Sanjan|pages=205, 206|publisher=Brill Publishers|author= Alan Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar Andre Wink has theorized that Zoroastrian immigrants to India, both before and after the Muslim conquest of Iran, were primarily merchants, since evidence suggests it was only some time after their arrival that religious experts and priests were sent for to join them. He argues that the competition over trade routes with Muslims may also have contributed to their immigration.&lt;ref name=Ringer/&gt;

Although historically unsubstantiated, the story of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of [[Gujarat]] continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the [[Rajah]] of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a [[dastur]] added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to proselytise, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cb_U56WcdHMC&amp;pg=PA75|title=Topographies of Faith: Religion in Urban Spaces|page=75|publisher=Brill Publishers|chapter=Excarnation and the City: The Tower of Silence in Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Zoroastrian traders faced execution outside India, including in [[China]] where many were killed during the [[Guangzhou massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Other Middle Kingdom: A Brief History Of Muslims In China" by Chiara Betta, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The immigration of Zoroastrians to India continued, and by 1477 they had lost all contact with Persia. Not until three hundred years had passed would they come into contact. Zoroastrians also played a notable role during the [[Indian independence movement|freedom movements]] of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parsis of India: Preservation of Identity in Bombay City|pages=26-35|publisher=BRILL|author=Jesse S. Palsetia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6oNt3M_yLgC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also subsequent migrations, especially resulting from attempts of [[Safavids]]' to convert their subjects to [[Shia Islam]] in the sixteenth century. This added to the Parsi population and cemented their close association with Iran.&lt;ref name=Ringer/&gt;

During the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, there were attacks by Muslims on Zoroastrians at [[1857 Bharuch riot| Bharuch]].

The Zoroastrian community in India remains one of the most recognized groups, playing a part in various commercial sectors such as industry, movies, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-jains-become-sixth-minority-community-1954568|title=Jains become sixth minority community - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|author=|date=21 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMzSdy9is9fL2R9QBwWA3I/Govt-grants-minority-status-to-Jain-community.html

== Communities ==
There are two major Zoroastrian communities in India.

=== Parsi ===
{{main|Parsi}}
The word ''Parsi'' in the [[Persian language]] literally means "Persian". Persian is the official language of modern [[Iran]], which is also known as [[Persia]]. The language (''Parsi'') is commonly referred to as ''Farsi'', because, after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia| Arab invasion of Persia]], because of the absence of the "P / G / Zh / Ch" sounds in the [[Arabic language]], ''Parsi'' became ''Farsi''. Similarly, [[Babak Khorramdin]]'s first name, originally ''Papak'' (Papa + Kuchak = Papak), "Young Father", became ''Babak''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The long presence of the Parsis in the Gujarat and Sindh areas of India is supported by a [[Genetic study]] &lt;ref&gt; https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9&lt;/ref&gt; and it also distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of [[Irani (India)|Irani]]s, who are more recent arrivals.

=== Iranis ===

{{main|Irani (India)}}
Although the term 'Irani' is first attested during the [[Mughal era]], most Iranis are immigrants who arrived on the subcontinent during the 19th and early 20th centuries, that is, when Iran was ruled by the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] and when religious persecution of non-Muslims was rampant. The descendants of the immigrants of those times remain culturally and linguistically closer to the [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians of Iran]], in particular to the Zoroastrians of [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]]. Consequently, the [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] dialect of the Zoroastrians of those provinces may be heard among the Iranis.
