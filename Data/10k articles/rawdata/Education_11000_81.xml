Note that the numbers above do not correspond to a percentile, but are notionally a percentage of the maximum raw marks available. Various tertiary institutions in Australia have policies on the allocations for each grade and [[Norm-referenced assessment|scaling]] may occur to meet these policies. These policies may vary also according to the degree year (higher percentages for later years), but generally, only 2–5% of students who pass (that is, who achieve raw marks of 50 or more) may be awarded a High Distinction grade, and 50% or more of passing students are awarded a basic Pass grade.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-convert-Australian-university-grading-system-to-GPA-they-use-in-US-colleges&lt;/ref&gt; Raw marks for students who fail are not scaled and do not increase the allocations of higher grades. Some universities also have a Pass Conceded (PC) grade for marks that fall in the range of 45–49 inclusive.

A few universities do not issue numeric grades out of 100 for individual subjects, instead relying on qualitative descriptors. [[Griffith University]] and [[The University of Queensland]]  issue results of High Distinction, Distinction, Credit, Pass, and Fail,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/exams-assessment/grades|title = Grades|date = |access-date = 11 January 2016|website = |publisher = James Cook University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The University of Queensland (2015). "[http://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.10.07-grading-system]". Accessed on 22 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[University of Notre Dame Australia|University of Notre Dame]] uses the scheme A, A–, B+, B, B–, C+, C, C–, D, and F.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://registrar.nd.edu/pdf/gradingsystems.pdf|title = Grading Systems at the University of Notre Dame|date = |access-date = 11 January 2016|website = |publisher = University of Notre Dame|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grade point average ==
Grade point averages are not generally used in Australia below a tertiary level.  At universities, they are calculated according to a more complicated formula than in some other nations:

&lt;math&gt; \text{GPA} = {{\sum {(\text{grade points} \times \text{credit points for unit})}} \over {\sum \text{credit points}}}  &lt;/math&gt;

Where grade points are as follows:

A ''conceded pass'' is a pass for a course that has been awarded only after supplementary assessment has been undertaken by the student.

Where a course result is a Non-Graded Pass, the result will only be included if the GPA is less than 4, and will be assigned the grade point of 4, otherwise NGP results will be disregarded. The term ''course unit values'' is used to distinguish between courses which have different weightings, for example between a full year course and a single semester course.

Some other universities, such as the [[University of New South Wales]], [[University of Sydney]], and [[University of Wollongong]]&lt;ref&gt;University of Wollongong (2008). ''[http://www.uow.edu.au/handbook/generalcourserules/UOW028639.html 2008 Course Handbook: Assessment]''. Accessed on 24 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; use a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) for the same purpose as a GPA. The WAM is based on the raw percentage grades, or marks, achieved by the student, rather than grade points such as High Distinction or Distinction.

The '''Academy of Gondishapur''' ({{lang-fa|فرهنگستان گندی‌شاپور}}, Farhangestân-e Gondišâpur), also known as The '''Gondishapur University''' (دانشگاه گندی‌شاپور Dânešgâh-e Jondišapur), was one of the three Sasanian centers of education ([[Ctesiphon]], [[Resaina]], [[Gundeshapur]]) &lt;ref&gt;Spangler, decline of the west, pp200&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancient center of higher learning|academy of learning]] in the city of [[Gundeshapur]], [[Iran]] during [[late antiquity]], the intellectual center of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. It offered education and training in [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]] and [[science]]. The faculty were versed in [[Persian culture|Persian tradition]]s. According to ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', it was the most important medical center of the ancient world  during the 6th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4, p396. {{ISBN|0-521-20093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], the heritage of Gondeshapur was memorialized by the founding of the ''Jondishapur University'' and its twin institution ''Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences'', near the city of [[Ahvaz]] in 1955. After the [[1979 revolution]] Jondishapur University was renamed to [[Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz]] in 1981 in honor of [[Mostafa Chamran]]. It has been renamed again as [[Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences]] recently.

==History==
In {{sm|a.d.}} 489, the [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] Christian theological and scientific center in [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] was ordered closed by the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], and was transferred and absorbed into the [[School of Nisibis]] in [[Asia Minor]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/main-links/historical.htm University of Tehran Overview/Historical Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203013254/http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/main-links/historical.htm |date=2011-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''[[School of Nisibis|Nisibīn]]'', then under [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] rule. Here, Nestorian scholars, together with [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]] banished from [[Athens]] by [[Justinian]] in 529, carried out important research in medicine, astronomy, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald. ''Islamic Science and Engineering''. 1993. Edinburgh Univ. Press. {{ISBN|0-7486-0455-3}}, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was under the rule of the Sassanid emperor [[Khosrau I]] ({{sm|a.d.}} 531-579), known to the Greeks and Romans as ''Chosroes'', that Gondeshapur became known for medicine and learning. [[Khosrau I]] gave refuge to various Greek [[philosopher]]s and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking Nestorian Christians fleeing religious persecution by the [[Byzantine empire]]. The Sassanids [[Roman–Persian Wars|had long battled]] the Romans and Byzantines for control of present-day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] and were naturally disposed to welcome the refugees.

Emperor Khosrau I commissioned the refugees to translate Greek and Syriac texts into [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]. They translated various works on medicine, astronomy, philosophy, and useful crafts.

Khosrau I also turned towards the east, and sent the physician [[Burzoe|Borzouye]] to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to Gondeshapur. These visitors translated Indian texts on astronomy, astrology, mathematics and medicine and Chinese texts on herbal medicine and religion. Borzouye is said to have himself translated the ''[[Panchatantra|Pañcatantra]]'' from Sanskrit into Persian as ''Kalila u Dimana.''

A [[Church of the East]] monastery was established in the city of Gondishapur sometime before 376/7. By the 6th century the city became famed for its theological school where [[Rabban Hormizd]] once studied.
According to a letter from the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Catholicos of the East]] [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]], the [[Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Metropolitanate of Beth Huzaye]] took charge of both the theological and medical institutions.&lt;ref name=Winkler64&gt;{{Harvnb|Winkler|Baum|2010|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although almost all the physicians of the medical academy were [[Persian people|Persians]], yet they wrote their treatises in [[Classical Syriac|Syriac]], because medicine had a literary tradition in Syriac.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/syriac-language-i&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of Gondeshapur ==
{{quote|[T]o a very large extent, the credit for the whole hospital system must be given to Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Elgood, Cyril. ''A medical history of Persia'', Cambridge University Press, 1951, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;|Cyril Elgood|''A Medical History of Persia''}}

In addition to systemizing medical treatment and knowledge, the scholars of the academy also transformed medical education; rather than apprenticing with just one physician, medical students were required to work in the hospital under the supervision of the whole medical faculty. There is even evidence that graduates had to pass exams in order to practice as accredited Gondeshapur physicians (as recorded in an Arabic text, the ''Tārīkh al-ḥukamā''). Gondeshapur also had a pivotal role in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref name="GGJ"&gt;{{cite book | title=The crest of the peacock : non-European roots of mathematics | publisher=I. B. Tauris | author=Joseph, George Gheverghese | year=1991 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gondeshapur under Muslim rule ==
In 832 AD, [[Caliph]] [[Al-Ma'mun|al-Ma'mūn]] founded the famous [[House of Wisdom]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} There the methods of Gondeshapur were emulated; indeed, the House of Wisdom was staffed with graduates of the older Academy of Gondeshapur. It is believed that the House of Wisdom was disbanded under [[Al-Mutawakkil]], al-Ma'mūn's successor.

However, by that time the intellectual center of the Abbasid Caliphate had definitively shifted to Baghdad, as henceforth there are few references in contemporary literature to universities or hospitals at Gondeshapur. The significance of the center gradually declined. [[Al-Muqaddasi]]'s ''Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions'' (c. 1000 AD) described Gondeshapur as falling into ruins.&lt;ref name="Lestrange"&gt;{{cite book | title=The lands of the eastern caliphate : Mesopotamia, Persia, and Central Asia, from the Moslem conquest to the time of Timur | publisher=University Press | author=Le Strange, Guy | year=1905 | location=Cambridge UK | pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Gondeshapur==
[[Image:Talat basari.jpg|thumb|right|Soon after the founding of the modern school of Jondishapur, Dr. Tal'at Basāri was appointed vice chancellor of the university, the first woman to reach such a post in any university in Iran.]]
Under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], the heritage of Gondeshapur was memorialized by the founding of the ''Jondishapur University'' and its twin institution ''Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences'', near the city of [[Ahvaz]] in 1955.

The latter-day Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences was founded and named after its Sassanid predecessor, by its founder and first Chancellor, Dr. Mohammad Kar, Father of Cambys Kar and [[Cyrus Kar]], in Ahvaz in 1959.

Jondishapur University was renamed to [[Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz]] in 1981 in honor of [[Mostafa Chamran]].
It has been renamed again as [[Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences]] recently.

The first woman to be appointed as vice-chancellor in a university in Iran, Dr. [[Tal'at Basāri]], was appointed at this university in the mid-1960s, and starting 1968, plans for the modern campus were designed by famed architect [[Kamran Diba]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnet.com/library/02/0226/T022648.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Gondeshapur is also slated for an archaeological investigation. Experts from the Archaeological Research Center of [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]] and the Oriental Institute of the [[University of Chicago]] plan to start excavations in early 2006.

'''The Alpheios Project''' is an open source initiative originally focused on developing software to facilitate reading [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]]. Dictionaries, grammars and inflection tables were combined in a set of web-based tools to provide comprehensive reading support for scholars, students and independent readers. The tools were implemented as browser add-ons so that they could be used on any web site or any page that a user might create in Unicoded HTML.
  
In collaboration with the Perseus Digital Library, the goals of the Alpheios Project were subsequently broadened to combine reading support with language learning. Annotation and editing tools were added to help users contribute to the development of new resources, such as enhanced texts that have been syntactically annotated or aligned with translations.
  
The Alpheios tools are designed modularly to encourage the addition of other languages that have the necessary digital resources, such as morphological analyzers and dictionaries. In addition to Latin and ancient Greek, Alpheios tools have been extended to [[Arabic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. 
 
The Alpheios Project is a non-profit ([[501c3]]) initiative. The software is open source, and resides on Sourceforge.com. The Alpheios software is released as [[GNU General Public License#|GPL 3.0]] and texts and data as [[Creative Commons license|CC-by-SA]].

== History ==

The Alpheios Project was established in 2007 by Mark Nelson, the founder of the commercial software company [[Ovid Technologies]], which he started after writing a search engine for medical literature that became widely popular in medical libraries and research facilities (Strauch, 1996). Nelson, who holds an MA in English literature from Columbia University, sold the company to [[Wolters Kluwer]] in 1999 (Quint, 1998). Nelson created Alpheios by recruiting several developers and programmers from his previous company, defining the project's initial goals and funding its first three years of operation. In 2008 he also provided the initial funding for The Perseus Treebank of Ancient Greek, which has subsequently been crowd-sourced.

In 2011, the Perseus Project hired key Alpheios staff and the activities of the projects were extensively integrated, although Alpheios remains an independent organization focused on developing adaptive reading and learning tools that can provide formative assessment customized to the individual user's special abilities and goals, including the study of specific authors or texts.

To date, all Alpheios applications, enhanced texts and code have been provided without any fees or licenses. A separate Alpheios LLC provides commercial consultation on customization and extension of the Alpheios tools.

__NOTOC__
'''Anatol Roshko''' (15 July 1923 – 23 January 2017) was a Canadian-born physicist and engineer. He was the [[Theodore von Kármán]] Professor of [[Aeronautics]], [[Emeritus]], at the [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Pasadena, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-mourns-passing-anatol-roshko-1923-2017-53690 Caltech Mourns the Passing of Anatol Roshko, 1923–2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roshko is known for his contributions to gas dynamics. He along with [[Hans W. Liepmann|H. W. Liepmann]] is the co-author of the widely used textbook "Elements of Gasdynamics". He has made research contributions to problems of separated flow; bluff-body aerodynamics; structure of turbulent shear flow.

He completed his undergraduate education at the [[University of Alberta]] with a [[B.Sc.]] degree in [[Engineering Physics]], in 1945, received the [[M.Sc.]] degree from Caltech in 1947 and the [[Ph.D.]] in 1952. Most of his academic career has been at Caltech, where he was the Theodore von Karman Professor of Aeronautics, Emeritus at the time of his death. He was also a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]]; a Fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], the [[American Physical Society]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Indian Academy of Sciences]]. Roshko received [[Fluid Dynamics Prize (APS)|Fluid Dynamics Prize]] by the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=Anatol%20Roshko&amp;year=1987 1987 Fluid Dynamics Prize Recipient]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also awarded the [[Timoshenko Medal]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://imechanica.org/node/177&lt;/ref&gt;

The Challenge was launched by [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], the Ruler of Dubai, in 2015, with the aim of encouraging children in the Arab world to read 50 million books through a series of prizes and incentives for children, faculties and educational institutions. The prizes and grants offered totalled $3 million. It was intended to address falling levels of readership in the Arabic language, with media citing reports such as that of the [[Arab Thought Foundation]] Arab Report for Cultural Development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/general/9th-annual-arab-report-on-cultural-development-released|title=9th Annual Arab Report on cultural development released|last=Reporter|first=Staff|work=Khaleej Times|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which asserts the average reading time for an Arab child is six minutes a year compared with 12,000 minutes in the West and a study conducted by the Supreme Council of Culture in Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moc.gov.eg/en/affiliates-list/supreme-council-of-culture/|title=Ministry of Culture {{!}} Supreme Council of Culture|website=www.moc.gov.eg|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found the average reading rate of an Arab individual is a quarter of a page a year compared with 11 books in the US and seven books in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.emirates247.com/news/government/mohammed-launches-50-million-book-arab-reading-challenge-2015-09-16-1.603838|title=Mohammed launches 50 million book 'Arab Reading Challenge'|last=Wam|date=2015-09-16|work=Emirates24{{!}}7|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Challenge focuses on students from Years 1 to 12 from schools across the Arab world. The competition runs annually from September to March. In order to enter the challenge, children are encouraged to read books and summarise them in a series of five coloured 'passports', with their teachers checking the summaries. Each passport has ten pages, hence children read fifty books throughout the academic year. They then pass through a number of qualification stages at school, district, national and regional levels.

The winning student was awarded a $100,000 bursary as well as a cash grant of $50,000 made to the student's family. The school with the best reading initiatives was awarded $1 million funding while $300,000 was offered to the faculty member with the greatest commitment to reading. The balance of the funds awarded by the challenge were granted to participating students and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/policy-monitoring-platform/arab-reading-challenge|title=Arab Reading Challenge|date=2017-12-04|work=Diversity of Cultural Expressions|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the challenge is the Dubai-based School of Research Science, with its principal, Najla Al Shamsi as its secretary-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/education/arab-reading-challenge-draws-10m-students-from-44-countries-1.2294084|title=Arab Reading Challenge draws 10m students from 44 countries|last=Report|first=Staff|date=2018-10-26|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016 Challenge ==
The 2016 Arab Reading Challenge ran from September 2015 until March 2016 and was won by a seven year-old Algerian student, Mohammad Farah, with the Talaih Al Amal high school in Palestine winning the $1 million funding award. In all, 3.59 million students from 30,000 schools in 21 countries participated, more than tripling the target of one million students. 18 qualifying finalists travelled to Dubai for the finals,  with the top five taking part in the final ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/education/boy-7-bags-150-000-in-arab-reading-challenge-1.1917736|title=Boy, 7, bags $150,000 in Arab Reading Challenge|last=Reporter|first=Jumana Khamis, Staff|date=2016-10-24|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2017 Challenge ==
The 2017 Challenge was won by Afaf Raed Sherif, a 17 year-old [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] student, selected from the five finalists by a jury and a popular vote among attendees at the finals ceremony. The jury members were Bilal Al Badoor, Badrya Al Bishr, and the winner of the ARC distinguished teacher award in 2016, Hanan Al Hroob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302639673|title=Afaf Sherif from Palestine crowned winner of Arab Reading Challenge|work=wam|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, over 7.4 million students from 41,000 schools in 25 countries around the world, supported by 76,500 faculty, participated in the 2016 Challenge, reading over 200 million books. Al Iman School – Girls sector, in Bahrain, won the best school award, and the $1 million prize.

The Ekhlas School from [[Kuwait]] beat 52,000 participating schools to take the Dhs1 million prize for having the best reading initiatives in the region and Aisha Tuwergy from Saudi Arabia took home Dh300,000 for being the faculty member who had done most to encourage reading in her school. 

The Challenge was formally opened up to a wider international audience for the first time and a new award was introduced for a student from a non-Arab country, won by Tasneem Aidi from France. The entrants from non-Arab countries compete for an award of Dhs100,000 and are only required to summarise 25 books to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/general/sheikh-mohammeds-grand-gesture-as-reading-champ-breaks-down-on-stage-|title=Sheikh Mohammed's grand gesture as reading champ breaks down on stage|last=Zakaria|first=Sherouk|work=Khaleej Times|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, students based in 44 countries took part in the 2018 Challenge, which saw a 25% increase in participation to a total of 10.5 million students and 87,000 faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/education/girl-9-wins-arab-reading-challenge-in-dubai-bags-dh500-000-1.2295669|title=Girl, 9, wins Arab Reading Challenge in Dubai, bags Dh500,000|last=Reporter|first=Mary Achkhanian, Staff|date=2018-10-30|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1999 short stories collection ''Trist som faen'' ("Sad as hell") sold in about 100 000 copies and received several favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolonforlag.no/?type=book&amp;ref=1112 Kolon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His books have been translated into Swedish, Danish, German, Hungarian, and Icelandic as well as French. In the spring of 2011, Ari Behn made his debut as a playwright with ''Treningstimen'', directed by Kim Sørensen and staged at Rogaland Teater.

He is the eldest child of Olav Bjørshol (b. 1952) and Marianne Rafaela Solberg (b. 1953). Both his parents are [[Waldorf education|Waldorf teachers]] who have worked at the Waldorf School in Moss; his father has a degree in [[special education]] while his mother was trained as a Waldorf teacher. His parents married in 1973 but divorced after nine years; both since remarried, Olav Bjørshol to a daughter of [[André Bjerke]]. However, in 2007 Behn's parents remarried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=2704691 Ari forsonet med far - VG Nett om Prinsesse Märtha og Ari Behn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Behn's original surname was ''Bjørshol''. In 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ari_Behn/utdypning Ari Behn – Norsk biografisk leksikon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; he changed his name to Ari Behn when he took his maternal grandmother's [[Married and maiden names|maiden name]]. The name Behn has German origin. He has two younger siblings, Anja Sabrina and Espen, neither of whom use the name Behn. In 2009, it was made public that Behn's ''de jure'' paternal grandfather Bjarne Nikolai Bjørshol was not his biological grandfather. Behn's father met his biological father, Terje Erling Ingebrigtsen (1933-2009), a retired car mechanic from [[Tromsø]], for the first time, but Ingebrigtsen died before Behn had a chance to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kjendis.no/2009/09/11/kjendis/ari_behn/kongefamilien/kongehuset/dna/8057575/ Han visste ikke at han var prinsessebarnas oldefar - kjendis - Dagbladet.no&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seher.no/827841/ari-behns-bestefar-er-dod ari behn: Ari Behns bestefar er død - Se og hør&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ari Bjørshol attended the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf School]] in [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] and is baptized in [[The Christian Community]]. He has a [[bachelor's degree]] in history and religion from [[University of Oslo]].

Behn achieved some literary success in Norway with his first collection of short stories, titled ''Trist som faen'' ("Sad as hell"), which received several good reviews and has sold more than 100,000 copies. He subsequently published two novels; however, the reviews of these works were less positive.

Together with his wife, Princess Märtha, he has written a book about their wedding in 2002. He has also participated in various creative projects, for example, the design of china for [[Magnor Glassverk]], and has been a model for a clothing chain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10018295 Ari Behn bør stramme seg opp - VG Nett om Kongehuset&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press coverage==
Behn made the headlines of Norwegian newspapers in the autumn of 2006, when he revealed that he voted for the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/innenriks/article767817.ece Ari Behn stemmer Arbeiderpartiet (Adresseavisen)]&lt;/ref&gt; His friendship with the former Minister of Culture and Labour leader [[Trond Giske]] has attracted criticism from newspapers and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/innenriks/politikk/article830800.ece Karrieretrøbbel for Giske (Nettavisen)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2009, Behn received massive media coverage in the Norwegian press after going on a "personal vendetta" against former palace official [[Carl-Erik Grimstad]], accusing him of spreading tabloid nonsense regarding Behn and his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=550043 Ari Behn raser mt tidligere soussjef (Dagbladet) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Alexandro "Ben" Agosto''' (born January 15, 1982) is an American [[ice dancing|ice dancer]]. With  partner [[Tanith Belbin]], Agosto is the [[Figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympic silver medalist]], a four-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World medalist]], the 2004–2006 [[Four Continents Championships|Four Continents champion]], and 2004–2008 [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. champion]].

==Personal life==
Benjamin Agosto was born January 15, 1982, in Chicago, [[Illinois]], and raised in [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]], [[Illinois]]. He is the son of a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] father and a Jewish mother whose family has roots in [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania]] and [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russia]].&lt;ref name=jewishstars/&gt;&lt;ref name=gsinter2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbloom/&gt; Agosto attended grade school at the Chicago [[Waldorf School]], then spent two years at [[Glenbrook North High School]], and graduated with honors from Michigan's [[Groves High School (Michigan)|Groves High School]] in June 2000. He played in a high school jazz band.

Agosto lived in [[Detroit, Michigan]], from June 1998 and then [[Canton, Michigan]], before moving to [[Aston, Pennsylvania]], in the summer of 2008. He relocated to [[Lacey, Washington]], in September 2010&lt;ref name=tie120523/&gt; and then to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in 2014.&lt;ref name=IN140602/&gt;

==Career==

=== Early years ===
Agosto started skating at age six, after receiving a pair of ice skates for his birthday, and started ice dancing at about age 12.&lt;ref name=gsinter2003/&gt; Early in his career, he was coached by [[Susie Wynne]].&lt;ref name=gsinter2003/&gt; He skated with Katie Hill from 1995 to 1998,&lt;ref name=bio0001/&gt; competing with her on the novice and junior levels, including internationally. They skated out of Midwestern Section. When that partnership ended, Agosto moved from Chicago to Michigan in 1998 in order to train under [[Igor Shpilband]].

=== Partnership with Belbin ===
In 1998, Agosto's coach partnered him with Canadian [[Tanith Belbin]]. In the 1999–2000 season, they won a pair of medals on the [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] series and finished 4th at the JGP Final. They went on to win the U.S. junior national title and then took the bronze medal at the [[2000 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2000 World Junior Championships]].&lt;ref name=isuwj/&gt; In 2000–2001, Belbin/Agosto competed again on the JGP series, taking gold in all three of their events including the Final. They appeared on the senior level at the [[2001 United States Figure Skating Championships|2001 U.S. Championships]] and won the silver medal, qualifying them for their first senior World Championships, where they finished 17th.

In 2001–2002, Belbin/Agosto made their senior [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] debut and won another silver medal at the [[2002 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], which would have qualified them for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] if Belbin had been an American citizen. Instead, Belbin/Agosto were sent to all the other ISU Championships for which they were eligible: Four Continents, Junior Worlds, and Worlds. They won the [[2002 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2002 World Junior Championships]],&lt;ref name=isuwj/&gt; completing their set of medals from that event. Following that season, Agosto aged out of juniors.

Belbin/Agosto won the [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|2004 U.S. national title]] and would go on to repeat four times. At [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|Nationals in 2005]], the last year of the 6.0 system, they received straight perfect sixes for presentation in their free dance. Of the 30 6.0s given out in ice dance at U.S. Nationals, Belbin/Agosto have 14 of them. Their total 6.0 count at the U.S. Championships is second only to Michelle Kwan (38).

In February 2005, Belbin/Agosto organized and performed in their own figure skating benefit show, Skate Aid for Tsunami Relief, which raised more than $37,000 for Red Cross relief efforts.

Belbin/Agosto won the silver medal at the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships|2005 World Championships]]. Their silver medal combined with the placement of the other American team earned the United States three spots to the Olympics in ice dance, the first time this had happened since 1984. By a special act of Congress that passed on December 28, 2005, which [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] signed on [[New Year's Eve]], 2005, Belbin became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the USA, making her able to compete for the United States at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. Belbin/Agosto went on to win the Olympic silver medal in ice dance on February 20, 2006. They were the first American ice dance team since 1976, the first year ice dancing was contested at the Olympics, to win an Olympic medal.

Belbin/Agosto began the 2006–2007 season with a free dance called That's Entertainment but arrived at Nationals with a new program to the music of Amelie. They won gold at Nationals, the silver medal at Four Continents, and the bronze at Worlds.

In 2007–2008, they won gold medals at both Skate America and Cup of China which qualified them for the Grand Prix Final, where they took the silver medal. They won their 5th national title and then placed 4th at the 2008 Worlds after a fall by Belbin in the compulsory dance. Belbin/Agosto were regular cast members of the [[Champions on Ice]] tour from 2004 until COI went out of business following the 2007 season.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} They were guest stars on part of the 2008 Stars on Ice tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In April 2008,&lt;ref name=skatetoday/&gt; Belbin/Agosto left [[Igor Shpilband]] and began working with the married coaching team of [[Natalia Linichuk]] and [[Gennadi Karponosov]] at the [[Ice Works]] Skating Complex in [[Aston, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=muscles/&gt; In addition to teaching different technique,&lt;ref name=skatetoday/&gt; Linichuk advised Belbin to gain 10 pounds and develop some muscles in order to skate faster and more fluidly.&lt;ref name=muscles/&gt; This also gave Belbin more core strength to hold her positions better, thus making lifts easier for Agosto.&lt;ref name=muscles/&gt;

Belbin/Agosto began the 2008–2009 season at the [[2008 Skate America]] and [[2008 Cup of China]], winning silver at both competitions. They withdrew from the [[2008&amp;ndash;2009 ISU Grand Prix Final]] after the original dance due to a back injury to Agosto. They withdrew from the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]] before the event began to due Agosto's injury.&lt;ref name=usfsa090108/&gt; They were named to the team to the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]]. At Worlds, they won the original dance and placed second in the compulsory and free dances to win the silver medal overall.

Belbin/Agosto won both their Grand Prix events in the 2009-10 season: the [[2009 Cup of China]] and the [[2009 Skate America]]. They withdrew from the Grand Prix Final for medical reasons.&lt;ref name=wisdom/&gt; At the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Championships]], they were unable to reclaim their national title, finishing second behind [[Meryl Davis]] and [[Charlie White (figure skater)|Charlie White]]. Belbin/Agosto were nominated to represent the [[United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=2010olyteam/&gt; They finished 4th in the Olympic [[Ice Dancing at the 2010 Winter Olympics|ice dancing event]]. They did not compete at the [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships|2010 World Championships]].

On June 10, 2010, Belbin and Agosto announced their retirement from eligible skating.&lt;ref name=belagoret/&gt; Since then they have toured professionally in ice shows.&lt;ref name=lifeskate/&gt;

On December 15, 2015, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] announced Belbin and Agosto would be members of the [[U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] Class of 2016.&lt;ref name=in151215/&gt; The induction ceremony was held on January 22, 2016 at the [[2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref name=in160123/&gt;

=== Later career ===
Agosto works as a coach and choreographer.&lt;ref name=tie120523/&gt; He has choreographed for three ''Disney on Ice'' shows and in 2014, he became the director of ice dance at the Ice Den in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=IN140602/&gt;

Also Agosto worked as a [[voice actor]] for a [[video game]] in 2006, and expressed an interest in continuing in the field.&lt;ref name=TeamUSA101203/&gt; He has performed on television as a spokesperson for the [[United States Census]].&lt;ref name=census/&gt;

[[Image:Subtitling-ear.png|thumb|The "Slashed ear" symbol is the [[International Symbol for Deafness]] used by [[TVNZ]] and other New Zealand broadcasters, as well as on [[VHS]] tapes released by [[Alliance Atlantis]]. The symbol was used on road signs to identify [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TTY]] access.]]
'''Closed captioning''' ('''CC''')   and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] are both processes of displaying [[Written language|text]] on a [[television]], [[video]] [[Display device|screen]], or other visual display to provide additional or interpretive information. Both are typically used as a [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of the [[Sound|audio]] portion of a [[Television program|program]] as it occurs (either [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] or in edited form), sometimes including descriptions of non-speech elements. Other uses have been to provide a textual alternative language translation of a presentation's primary audio language that is usually burned-in (or "open") to the video and unselectable. [[HTML5]] defines subtitles as a "transcription or translation of the dialogue ... when sound is available but not understood" by the viewer (for example, dialogue in a foreign language) and captions as a "transcription or translation of the dialogue, sound effects, relevant musical cues, and other relevant audio information ... when sound is unavailable or not clearly audible" (for example, when audio is muted or the viewer is deaf or [[hard of hearing]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-track-element {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606104953/http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html |date=2013-06-06 }} 4.7.9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term "closed" (versus "open") indicates that the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer, usually via the [[remote control]] or menu option. On the other hand, "open", "burned-in", "baked on", or "hard-coded" captions are visible to all viewers.

Most of the world does not distinguish captions from subtitles.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In the United States and Canada, these terms do have different meanings. "Subtitles" assume the viewer can hear but cannot understand the language or accent, or the speech is not entirely clear, so they transcribe only dialogue and some on-screen text. "Captions" aim to describe to the deaf and hard of hearing all significant audio content - spoken dialogue and non-speech information such as the identity of speakers and, occasionally, their manner of speaking - along with any significant [[music]] or [[sound effect]]s using words or symbols. Also, the term ''closed caption'' has come to be used to also refer to the North American [[EIA-608]] encoding that is used with NTSC-compatible video.

The [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and most other countries do not distinguish between subtitles and closed captions and use "subtitles" as the general term. The equivalent of "captioning" is usually referred to as "subtitles for the hard of hearing". Their presence is referenced on screen by notation which says "Subtitles", or previously "Subtitles 888" or just "888" (the latter two are in reference to the conventional [[teletext]] channel for captions), which is why the term ''subtitle'' is also used to refer to the [[Ceefax]]-based Teletext encoding that is used with PAL-compatible video. The term ''subtitle'' has been replaced with ''caption'' in a number of PAL markets that still use Teletext - such as Australia and New Zealand - that purchase large amounts of imported US material, with much of that video having had the US CC logo already superimposed over the start of it. In New Zealand, broadcasters superimpose an ear logo with a line through it that represents subtitles for the hard of hearing, even though they are currently referred to as captions. In the UK, modern digital television services have subtitles for the majority of programs, so it is no longer necessary to highlight which have captioning and which do not.

[[Remote control]] handsets for TVs, DVDs, and similar devices in most European markets often use "SUB" or "SUBTITLE" on the button used to control the display of subtitles/captions.

== History  {{anchor|Open captioning}} ==

=== Open captioning ===
Regular open-captioned broadcasts began on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[The French Chef]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref name="caphist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |title=A Brief History of Captioned Television |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060406/http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] began open captioning of the programs ''[[Zoom (1972 TV series)|Zoom]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'', and ''[[Once Upon a Classic]]'' shortly thereafter.

=== Technical development of closed captioning ===
Closed captioning was first demonstrated at the First National Conference on Television for the Hearing Impaired in Nashville, Tennessee in
1971.&lt;ref name="caphist" /&gt; A second demonstration of closed captioning was held at Gallaudet College (now [[Gallaudet University]]) on February 15, 1972, where [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the [[National Bureau of Standards]] demonstrated closed captions embedded within a normal broadcast of ''[[The Mod Squad]]''.

The closed captioning system was successfully encoded and broadcast in 1973 with the cooperation of PBS station [[WETA-TV|WETA]].&lt;ref name="caphist" /&gt; As a result of these tests, the FCC in 1976 set aside line 21 for the transmission of closed captions. PBS engineers then developed the caption editing consoles that would be used to caption prerecorded programs.

Real-time captioning, a process for captioning live broadcasts, was developed by the [[National Captioning Institute]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="caphist" /&gt; In real-time captioning, [[court reporter]]s trained to write at speeds of over 225 words per minute give viewers instantaneous access to live news, sports, and entertainment. As a result, the viewer sees the captions within two to three seconds of the words being spoken.

Major US producers of captions are [[WGBH-TV]], [[VITAC]], [[CaptionMax]] and the [[National Captioning Institute]]. In the UK and [[Australasia]], [[Red Bee Media]], itfc, and Independent Media Support are the major vendors.

Improvements in [[speech recognition]] technology means that live captioning may be fully or partially automated which eventually results in increase in applications of real-time captioning in various sectors such as [[Sport]] Events, Video [[Conferences]], [[Seminars]] or various other live public events where there is need of real-time captioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Real-Time Captioning Solutions |url=https://www.govivace.com/solutions/captionai/ |publisher=GoVivace Inc. |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the audience can listen in the language of their choice.  [[BBC Sport]] broadcasts use a "respeaker": a trained human who repeats the running commentary (with careful enunciation and some simplification and [[markup language|markup]]) for input to the automated text generation system.

=== Full-scale closed captioning ===
The National Captioning Institute was created in 1979 in order to get the cooperation of the commercial television networks.&lt;ref name="ncicap1"&gt;[http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp National Captioning Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060406/http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of regularly scheduled closed captioning on American television occurred on March 16, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Jack. 1981. ''Deaf Heritage-A Narrative History of Deaf America''. Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 384-387&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sears]] had developed and sold the Telecaption adapter, a decoding unit that could be connected to a standard television set. The first programs seen with captioning were a ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disney's Wonderful World]]'' presentation of the film ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' on [[NBC]], an ''[[The ABC Sunday Night Movie|ABC Sunday Night Movie]]'' airing of ''[[Semi-Tough]]'', and ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;"Today on TV", ''Chicago Daily Herald'', March 11, 1980, Section 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative development in the U.S. ===
Until the passage of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990, television captioning was performed by a set-top box manufactured by Sanyo Electric and marketed by the National Captioning Institute (NCI). (At that time a set-top decoder cost about as much as a TV set itself, approximately $200.) Through discussions with the manufacturer it was established that the appropriate circuitry integrated into the television set would be less expensive than the stand-alone box, and Ronald May, then a Sanyo employee, provided the expert witness testimony on behalf of Sanyo and Gallaudet University in support of the passage of the bill. On January 23, 1991, the [[Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990]] was passed by Congress.&lt;ref name="caphist" /&gt;  This Act gave the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) power to enact rules on the implementation of Closed Captioning. This Act required all analog television receivers with screens of at least 13&amp;nbsp;inches or greater, either sold or manufactured, to have the ability to display closed captioning by July 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990|url=http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.24-decoderact.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) was passed to ensure equal opportunity for persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ncicap1" /&gt; The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in public accommodations or commercial facilities. Title III of the ADA requires that public facilities—such as hospitals, bars, shopping centers and museums (but not movie theaters)—provide access to verbal information on televisions, films or slide shows.

The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] expanded on the Decoder Circuity Act to place the same requirements on [[digital television]] receivers by July 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Consumer Facts on Closed Captioning|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/closedcaption.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; All TV programming distributors in the U.S. are required to provide closed captions for Spanish-language video programming as of January 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 79 - Closed Captioning of Video Programming|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/dro/captioning_regs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill, H.R. 3101, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, was passed by the United States House of Representatives in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010|year=2010|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3101|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar bill, S. 3304, with the same name, was passed by the United States Senate on August 5, 2010, by the House of Representatives on September 28, 2010, and was signed by President [[Barack Obama]] on October 8, 2010. The Act requires, in part, for [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]]-decoding set-top box remotes to have a button to turn on or off the closed captioning in the output signal. It also requires broadcasters to provide captioning for television programs redistributed on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010|year=2010|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s3304|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2014, the FCC unanimously approved the implementation of quality standards for closed captioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Moves to Upgrade TV Closed Captioning Quality|year=2014|url=http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-moves-upgrade-tv-closed-captioning-quality}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing accuracy, timing, completeness, and placement. This is the first time the FCC has addressed quality issues in captions.

===Philippines===
As amended by RA 10905, all TV networks in the Philippines are required to give CC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kbp.org.ph/philippine-tv-to-provide-closed-captioning&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the three major TV networks in the country are currently testing the closed captioning system on their transmissions. [[ABS-CBN]] added CC in their daily [[Chaplet of the Divine Mercy|3 o'clock prayer]] in the afternoon. [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] started implementing CCs on their  live noon and nightly news programs. [[GMA Network|GMA]] was once started broadcasting nightly and late night news programs, but then they stopped adding CCs lately. Only select [[Korean drama]] and local or foreign movies, ''Biyahe ni Drew'' (English: ''Drew's Explorations'') and ''Idol sa Kusina'' (English: ''Kitchen Idol'') are the programs and shows that they air with proper closed captioning. {{Citation Needed|reason=This is only my own observations. You can help me give more information about and how the closed captioning here in the Philippines works|date=June 2018}}

=== Legislative development in Australia ===
The government of Australia provided [[seed funding]] in 1981 for the establishment of the Australian Caption Centre (ACC) and the purchase of equipment. Captioning by the ACC commenced in 1982 and a further grant from the Australian government enabled the ACC to achieve and maintain financial self-sufficiency. The ACC, now known as [[Media Access Australia]], sold its commercial captioning division to [[Red Bee Media]] in December 2005. Red Bee Media continues to provide captioning services in Australia today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Funding development in New Zealand ===
In 1981, [[TVNZ]] held a [[telethon]] to raise funds for Teletext-encoding equipment used for the creation and editing of text-based broadcast services for the deaf. The service came into use in 1984 with caption creation and importing paid for as part of the public broadcasting fee until the creation of the [[NZ on Air]] taxpayer fund, which is used to provide captioning for [[NZ On Air]] content, TVNZ news shows and conversion of [[EIA-608]] US captions to the preferred [[EBU]] STL format for only [[TVNZ 1]], [[TV 2 (New Zealand)|TV 2]] and [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV 3]] with archived captions available to [[Four (New Zealand)|FOUR]] and select [[SKY Network Television|Sky]] programming. During the second half of 2012, [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] and [[Four (New Zealand)|FOUR]] began providing non-Teletext DVB image-based captions on their HD service and used the same format on the satellite service, which has since caused major timing issues in relation to server load and the loss of captions from most SD DVB-S receivers, such as the ones Sky Television provides their customers. As of April 2, 2013, only the Teletext page 801 caption service will remain in use with the informational Teletext non-caption content being discontinued.

== Application ==
Closed captions were created for [[deaf]] or [[Hearing impairment|hard of hearing]] individuals to assist in comprehension. They can also be used as a tool by those learning to read, learning to speak a non-native language, or in an environment where the audio is difficult to hear or is intentionally muted. Captions can also be used by viewers who simply wish to read a transcript along with the program audio.

In the United States, the [[National Captioning Institute]] noted that [[English as a foreign or second language]] (ESL) learners were the largest group buying decoders in the late 1980s and early 1990s before built-in decoders became a standard feature of US television sets. This suggested that the largest audience of closed captioning was people whose native language was not English. In the United Kingdom, of 7.5 million people using TV subtitles (closed captioning), 6 million have no hearing impairment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/accessservs/summary/] Ofcom, UK: Television access services {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601080942/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/accessservs/summary/|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closed captions are also used in public environments, such as bars and restaurants, where patrons may not be able to hear over the background noise, or where multiple televisions are displaying different programs. In addition, online videos may be treated through digital processing of their audio content by various robotic algorithms (robots). Multiple chains of errors are the result. When a video is truly and accurately transcribed, then the closed-captioning publication serves a useful purpose, and the content is available for search engines to index and make available to users on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some television sets can be set to automatically turn captioning on when the volume is muted.

== Television and video ==
For ''live'' programs, spoken words comprising the television program's [[soundtrack]] are transcribed by a human operator (a [[speech-to-text reporter]]) using [[stenotype]] or [[stenomask]] type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text by a computer and displayed on the screen. This technique was developed in the 1970s as an initiative of the [[BBC]]'s [[Ceefax]] [[teletext]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/timeline/early-ceefax-subtitling.shtml|title=mb21 - ether.net - The Teletext Museum - Timeline|work=mb21.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP065.pdf|title=Publications|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic computer speech recognition works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of [[real-time text]]. Meanwhile, sport events on ESPN are using [[court reporter]]s, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed "dictionaries."

In some cases, the transcript is available beforehand, and captions are simply displayed during the program after being edited. For programs that have a mix of pre-prepared and live content, such as [[news bulletin]]s, a combination of techniques is used.

For prerecorded programs, commercials, and home videos, audio is transcribed and captions are prepared, positioned, and timed in advance.

For all types of [[NTSC]] programming, captions are "encoded" into [[EIA-608|line 21]] of the [[vertical blanking interval]] - a part of the TV picture that sits just above the visible portion and is usually unseen. For [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] ([[digital television]]) programming, three streams are encoded in the video: two are backward compatible "line 21" captions, and the third is a set of up to 63 additional caption streams encoded in [[EIA-708]] format.&lt;ref name="atsc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsc.org/faq/faq_closed.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901221032/http://www.atsc.org/faq/faq_closed.html |archivedate=2008-09-01 |df= }} - ATSC Closed Captioning FAQ ([http://www.evertz.com/resources/cc-imp-paper.pdf cached copy]) &lt;/ref&gt;

Captioning is modulated and stored differently in [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] 625 line 25 frame countries, where [[teletext]] is used rather than in [[EIA-608]], but the methods of preparation and the line 21 field used are similar. For home [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] videotapes, a shift down of this line 21 field must be done due to the greater number of VBI lines used in 625 line PAL countries, though only a small minority of European PAL VHS machines support this (or any) format for closed caption recording. Like all teletext fields, teletext captions can't be stored by a standard 625 line VHS recorder (due to the lack of field shifting support); they are available on all professional [[S-VHS]] recordings due to all fields being recorded. Recorded Teletext caption fields also suffer from a higher number of caption errors due to increased number of bits and a low [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]], especially on low-bandwidth VHS. This is why Teletext captions used to be stored separately on floppy disk to the analogue master tape. DVDs have their own system for subtitles and captions, which are digitally inserted in the data stream and decoded on playback into video.

For older televisions, a set-top box or other decoder is usually required. In the US, since the passage of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act, manufacturers of most television receivers sold have been required to include closed captioning display capability. High-definition TV sets, receivers, and [[TV tuner card|tuner cards]] are also covered, though the technical specifications are different (high-definition display screens, as opposed to high-definition TVs, may lack captioning). Canada has no similar law but receives the same sets as the US in most cases.

During transmission, single byte errors can be replaced by a white space which can appear at the beginning of the program. More byte errors during EIA-608 transmission can affect the screen momentarily, by defaulting to a real-time mode such as the "roll up" style, type random letters on screen, and then revert to normal. Uncorrectable byte errors within the teletext page header will cause whole captions to be dropped. EIA-608, due to using only two characters per video frame, sends these captions ahead of time storing them in a second buffer awaiting a command to display them; Teletext sends these in real-time.

The use of capitalization varies among caption providers. Most caption providers capitalize all words while others such as WGBH and non-US providers prefer to use mixed-case letters.

There are two main styles of line 21 closed captioning:
* '''Roll-up''' or '''scroll-up''' or '''paint-on''' or '''scrolling''': Real-time words sent in paint-on or scrolling mode appear from left to right, up to one line at a time; when a line is filled in roll-up mode, the whole line scrolls up to make way for a new line, and the line on top is erased. The lines usually appear at the bottom of the screen, but can actually be placed on any of the 14 screen rows to avoid covering graphics or action. This method is used when captioning video in real-time such as for live events, where a sequential word-by-word captioning process is needed or a pre-made intermediary file isn't available. This method is signaled on [[EIA-608]] by a two-byte caption command or in Teletext by replacing rows for a roll-up effect and duplicating rows for a paint-on effect. This allows for real-time caption line editing.

[[File:Closed Caption Demonstration Still-Felix.png|thumb|225px|A still frame showing simulated closed captioning in the pop-on style]]
* '''Pop-on''' or '''pop-up''' or '''block''': A caption appears on any of the 14 screen rows as a complete sentence, which can be followed by additional captions. This method is used when captions come from an intermediary file (such as the Scenarist or EBU STL file formats) for pre-taped television and film programming, commonly produced at captioning facilities. This method of captioning can be aided by digital scripts or voice recognition software, and if used for live events, would require a video delay to avoid a large delay in the captions' appearance on-screen, which occurs with Teletext-encoded live subtitles.

==== Syntax ====
For real-time captioning done outside of captioning facilities, the following syntax is used:
* '&gt;&gt;' (two prefixed [[greater-than sign]]s) indicates a change in single speaker.
** Sometimes appended with the speaker's name in alternate case, followed by a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]].
* '&gt;&gt;&gt;' (three prefixed greater-than signs) indicates a change in news story or multiple speakers.

Styles of syntax that are used by various captioning producers:
* Capitals indicate main on-screen dialogue and the name of the speaker.
** Legacy [[EIA-608]] home caption decoder fonts had no [[descender]]s on lowercase letters.
** Outside North America, capitals with background coloration indicate a song title or sound effect description.
** Outside North America, capitals with black or no background coloration indicates when a word is stressed or emphasized.
* Descenders indicate background sound description and off-screen dialogue.
** Most modern caption producers, such as [[WGBH-TV]], use [[mixed case]] for both on-screen and off-screen dialogue.
* '-' (a prefixed dash) indicates a change in single speaker (used by [[CaptionMax]]).
* Words in [[italic type|italics]] indicate when a word is stressed or emphasized and when real world names are quoted.
** Italics and [[bold type]] are only supported by [[EIA-608]].
** Some North American providers use this for narrated dialogue.
* Text coloration indicates captioning credits and sponsorship.
** Occasionally, it is for a [[karaoke]] effect for music videos on [[MTV]] or [[VH-1]].
** In Ceefax/Teletext countries, it indicates a change in single speaker in place of '&gt;&gt;'.
** Some Teletext countries use coloration to indicate when a word is stressed or emphasized.
** Coloration is limited to white, green, blue, cyan, red, yellow and magenta.
** UK order of use for text is white, green, cyan, yellow; and backgrounds is black, red, blue, magenta, white.
** US order of use for text is white, yellow, cyan, green; and backgrounds is black, blue, red, magenta, white.
* [[Square brackets]] or [[parentheses]] indicate a song title or sound effect description.
* [[Parentheses]] indicate speaker's vocal pitch e.g., (man), (woman), (boy) or (girl).
** Outside North America, [[parentheses]] indicate a silent on-screen action.
* A pair of [[eighth note]]s is used to bracket a line of [[lyrics]] to indicate singing.
** A pair of eighth notes on a line of no text are used during a section of instrumental music.
** Outside North America, a single [[number sign]] is used on a line of [[lyrics]] to indicate singing.
** An additional musical notation character is appended to the end of the last line of lyrics to indicate the song's end.
** As the symbol is unsupported by [[Ceefax]]/[[Teletext]], a [[number sign]] - which resembles a musical [[sharp (music)|sharp]] - is substituted.

==== Technical aspects ====
There were many shortcomings in the original Line 21 specification from a [[typography|typographic]] standpoint, since, for example, it lacked many of the characters required for captioning in languages other than English. Since that time, the core Line 21 character set has been expanded to include quite a few more characters, handling most requirements for languages common in North and South America such as [[French language|French]], [[spanish language|Spanish]], and [[portuguese language|Portuguese]], though those extended characters are not required in all decoders and are thus unreliable in everyday use. The problem has been almost eliminated with a market specific full set of Western European characters and a private adopted Norpak extension for South Korean and Japanese markets. The full [[EIA-708]] standard for digital television has worldwide character set support, but there has been little use of it due to [[EBU]] Teletext dominating [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] countries, which has its own extended character sets.

Captions are often edited to make them easier to read and to reduce the amount of text displayed onscreen. This editing can be very minor, with only a few occasional unimportant missed lines, to severe, where virtually every line spoken by the actors is condensed. The measure used to guide this editing is words per minute, commonly varying from 180 to 300, depending on the type of program. Offensive words are also captioned, but if the program is censored for TV broadcast, the broadcaster might not have arranged for the captioning to be edited or censored also. The "TV Guardian", a television [[set-top box]], is available to parents who wish to censor offensive language of programs-the video signal is fed into the box and if it detects an offensive word in the captioning, the audio signal is bleeped or muted for that period of time.

=== Caption channels ===
[[File:Cc3tout.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A [[bug (television)|bug]] touting CC1 and CC3 captions (on [[Telemundo]])]]
The Line 21 data stream can consist of data from several data channels [[multiplexed]] together. Odd field 1 can have four data channels: two separate synchronized captions (CC1, CC2) with caption-related text, such as website [[URL]]s (T1, T2). Even field 2 can have five additional data channels: two separate synchronized captions (CC3, CC4) with caption related text (T3, T4), and [[Extended Data Services]] (XDS) for Now/Next [[EPG]] details. XDS data structure is defined in CEA-608.

As CC1 and CC2 share bandwidth, if there is a lot of data in CC1, there will be little room for CC2 data and is generally only used for the primary audio captions. Similarly, CC3 and CC4 share the second even field of line 21. Since some early caption decoders supported only single field decoding of CC1 and CC2, captions for [[Second audio program|SAP]] in a second language were often placed in CC2. This led to bandwidth problems, and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) recommendation is that bilingual programming should have the second caption language in CC3. Many Spanish television networks such as [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]], for example, provides [[Telemundo#English subtitles|English subtitles]] for many of its Spanish programs in CC3. Canadian broadcasters use CC3 for French translated SAPs, which is also a similar practice in South Korea and Japan.

Ceefax and Teletext can have a larger number of captions for other languages due to the use of multiple VBI lines. However, only European countries used a second subtitle page for second language audio tracks where either the [[NICAM]] dual mono or [[Zweikanalton]] were used.

The US [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] [[digital television]] system originally specified two different kinds of closed captioning datastream standards: the original analog-compatible (available by [[EIA-608|Line 21]]) and the more modern digital-only [[CEA-708]] formats are delivered within the video stream.&lt;ref name="atsc.org" /&gt; The US FCC mandates that broadcasters deliver (and generate, if necessary) both datastream formats with the CEA-708 format merely a conversion of the Line 21 format.&lt;ref name="atsc.org" /&gt; The Canadian [[CRTC]] has not mandated that broadcasters either broadcast both datastream formats or exclusively in one format. Most broadcasters and networks to avoid large conversion cost outlays just provide [[EIA-608]] captions along with a transcoded [[CEA-708]] version encapsulated within [[CEA-708]] packets.

==== Incompatibility issues with digital TV ====
Many viewers find that when they acquire a digital television or set-top box they are unable to view closed caption (CC) information, even though the broadcaster is sending it and the TV is able to display it.

Originally, CC information was included in the picture ("line 21") via a composite video input, but there is no equivalent capability in digital video interconnects (such as DVI and HDMI) between the display and a "source". A "source", in this case, can be a DVD player or a terrestrial or cable digital television receiver. When CC information is encoded in the MPEG-2 data stream, only the device that decodes the MPEG-2 data (a source) has access to the closed caption information; there is no standard for transmitting the CC information to a display monitor separately. Thus, if there is CC information, the source device needs to overlay the CC information on the picture prior to transmitting to the display over the interconnect's video output.

Many source devices do not have the ability to overlay CC information, for controlling the CC overlay can be complicated. For example, the Motorola DCT-5xxx and -6xxx cable set-top receivers have the ability to decode CC information located on the MPEG-2 stream and overlay it on the picture, but turning CC on and off requires turning off the unit and going into a [//en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_to_use_a_Motorola_DVR/Setup#Closed_Caption special setup menu] (it is not on the standard configuration menu and it cannot be controlled using the remote). Historically, DVD players, VCRs and set-top tuners did not need to do this overlaying, since they simply passed this information on to the TV, and they are not mandated to perform this overlaying.

Many modern digital television receivers can be directly connected to cables, but often cannot receive scrambled channels that the user is paying for. Thus, the lack of a standard way of sending CC information between components, along with the lack of a mandate to add this information to a picture, results in CC being unavailable to many hard-of-hearing and deaf users.

=== UK/Australia ===
The [[EBU]] [[Ceefax]]-based teletext systems are the source for closed captioning signals, thus when teletext is embedded into [[DVB-T]] or [[DVB-S]] the closed captioning signal is included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300700_300799/300743/01.03.01_60/en_300743v010301p.pdf "ETSI EN 300 743: Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Subtitling systems"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, for DVB-T and DVB-S, it is not necessary for a teletext page signal to also be present ([[ITV1]], for example, does not carry analogue teletext signals on Sky Digital, but does carry the embedded version, accessible from the "Services" menu of the receiver, or more recently by turning them off/on from a mini menu accessible from the "help" button).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, captions use an [[EBU]] [[Ceefax]]-based teletext system on [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] broadcasts via satellite and [[cable television]] with the exception of [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] channels who completely switched to DVB [[Run-length encoding|RLE]] subtitles in 2012 on both Freeview satellite and [[UHF]] broadcasts, this decision was made based on the [[TVNZ]] practice of using this format on only [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] [[UHF]] broadcasts (aka Freeview HD). This made composite video connected TVs incapable of decoding the captions on their own. Also, these pre-rendered subtitles use classic caption style opaque backgrounds with an overly large font size and obscure the picture more than the more modern, partially transparent backgrounds.

=== Digital television standard captioning improvements ===
The CEA-708 specification provides for dramatically improved captioning
* An enhanced character set with more accented letters and non-Latin letters, and more special symbols
* Viewer-adjustable text size (called the "caption volume control" in the specification), allowing individuals to adjust their TVs to display small, normal, or large captions
* More text and background colors, including both transparent and translucent backgrounds to optionally replace the big black block
* More text styles, including edged or [[drop shadow]]ed text rather than the letters on a solid background
* More text fonts, including [[monospaced]] and proportional spaced, serif and sans-serif, and some playful cursive fonts
* Higher bandwidth, to allow more data per minute of video
* More language channels, to allow the encoding of more independent caption streams
As of 2009, most closed captioning for digital television environments is done using tools designed for analog captioning (working to the CEA-608 NTSC specification rather than the CEA-708 ATSC specification). The captions are then run through transcoders made by companies like EEG Enterprises or Evertz, which convert the analog Line 21 caption format to the digital format. This means that none of the CEA-708 features are used unless they were also contained in CEA-608.

== Uses of captioning in other media ==

=== DVDs &amp; Blu-ray Discs ===
NTSC DVDs may carry closed captions in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams inside of the Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top DVD player, the caption data is converted to the Line 21 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.4|title=DVD FAQ|author=Jim Taylor|work=dvddemystified.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822172353/http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.4|archivedate=2009-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are output by the player to the [[composite video]] (or an available [[RF connector]]) for a connected TV's built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. They can not be output on [[S-Video]] or [[component video]] outputs due to the lack of a [[colorburst]] signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the DVD player is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning ''will'' be displayed on the TV over component video input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. [[Windows Media Player]] (before [[Windows 7]]) in Vista supported only closed caption channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). [[Apple Computer Inc.|Apple's]] [[DVD Player (Mac OS)|DVD Player]] does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.

In addition to Line 21 closed captions, video DVDs may also carry subtitles, which generally rendered from the [[EIA-608]] captions as a bitmap overlay that can be turned on and off via a set top DVD player or DVD player software, just like the textual captions. This type of captioning is usually carried in a subtitle track labeled either "English for the hearing impaired" or, more recently, "SDH" (subtitled for the deaf and Hard of hearing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#1.45|title=DVD FAQ|author=Jim Taylor|work=dvddemystified.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822172353/http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#1.45|archivedate=2009-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular Hollywood DVD-Videos can carry both subtitles and closed captions (e.g. ''[[Stepmom (film)|Stepmom]]'' DVD by Columbia Pictures). On some DVDs, the Line 21 captions may contain the same text as the subtitles; on others, only the Line 21 captions include the additional non-speech information (even sometimes song lyrics) needed for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. European Region 2 DVDs do not carry Line 21 captions, and instead list the subtitle languages available-English is often listed twice, one as the representation of the dialogue alone, and a second subtitle set which carries additional information for the deaf and hard-of-hearing audience. (Many deaf/{{abbr|HOH|hard-of-hearing}} subtitle files on DVDs are reworkings of original teletext subtitle files.)

[[Blu-ray disc]] media cannot carry any [[VBI]] data such as Line 21 closed captioning due to the design of [[DVI]]-based [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface]] (HDMI) specifications that was only extended for synchronized digital audio replacing older analog standards, such as [[VGA]], S-Video, component video, and [[SCART]]. Both Blu-ray disc and DVD can use either PNG bitmap subtitles or 'advanced subtitles' to carry SDH type subtitling, the latter being an XML-based textual format which includes font, styling and positioning information as well as a unicode representation of the text. Advanced subtitling can also include additional media accessibility features such as "descriptive audio".

=== Movies ===
There are several competing technologies used to provide captioning for movies in theaters. Cinema captioning falls into the categories of 'open' and 'closed.' The definition of "closed" captioning in this context is different from television, as it refers to any technology that allows as few as one member of the audience to view the captions.

Open captioning in a film theater can be accomplished through burned-in captions, projected text or [[bitmap]]s, or (rarely) a display located above or below the movie screen. Typically, this display is a large LED sign. In a digital theater, open caption display capability is built into the digital projector. Closed caption capability is also available, with the ability for 3rd-party closed caption devices to plug into the digital cinema server.

Probably the best known closed captioning option for film theaters is the [[Rear Window Captioning System]] from the [[WGBH-TV|National Center for Accessible Media]]. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat translucent glass or plastic on a gooseneck stalk, which can be mounted in front of the viewer's seat. In the back of the theater is an [[LED]] display that shows the captions in mirror image. The panel reflects captions for the viewer but is nearly invisible to surrounding patrons. The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.

For film projection systems, [[Digital Theater Systems]], the company behind the DTS [[surround sound]] standard, has created a digital captioning device called the DTS-CSS (Cinema Subtitling System). It is a combination of a laser projector which places the captioning (words, sounds) anywhere on the screen and a thin playback device with a [[CD]] that holds many languages. If the Rear Window Captioning System is used, the DTS-CSS player is also required for sending caption text to the Rear Window sign located in the rear of the theater.

Special effort has been made to build accessibility features into digital projection systems (see [[digital cinema]]). Through [[SMPTE]], standards now exist that dictate how open and closed captions, as well as hearing-impaired and visually impaired narrative audio, are packaged with the rest of the digital movie. This eliminates the proprietary caption distributions required for film, and the associated royalties. SMPTE has also standardized the communication of closed caption content between the digital cinema server and 3rd-party closed caption systems (the CSP/RPL protocol). As a result, new, competitive closed caption systems for digital cinema are now emerging that will work with any standards-compliant digital cinema server. These newer closed caption devices include cupholder-mounted electronic displays and wireless glasses which display caption text in front of the wearer's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkpe.com/publications/d-cinema/misc/enabling_the_disabled.php|title=Enabling the Disabled in Digital Cinema|author=MKPE Consulting LLC|work=mkpe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridge devices are also available to enable the use of Rear Window systems. As of mid-2010, the remaining challenge to the wide introduction of accessibility in digital cinema is the industry-wide transition to SMPTE DCP, the standardized packaging method for very high quality, secure distribution of digital movies.

=== Sports venues ===
Captioning systems have also been adopted by most major league and high-profile college [[stadium]]s and [[arena]]s, typically through dedicated portions of their main [[scoreboard]]s or as part of balcony [[fascia (architecture)|fascia]] LED boards. These screens display captions of the [[public address]] announcer and other spoken content, such as those contained within in-game segments, public service announcements, and lyrics of songs played in-stadium. In some facilities, these systems were added as a result of discrimination lawsuits. Following a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act, [[FedExField]] added caption screens in 2006.&lt;ref name=wp-captionsredskins&gt;{{cite news|title=Redskins Ordered To Continue Captions|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100201989.html|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Washington Post|date=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.proskauer.com/alert/fourth-circuit-holds-ada-requires-expanded-access|title=Fourth Circuit Holds ADA Requires Expanded Access to Aural Content in Stadiums|last=|first=|date=April 4, 2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stadiums utilize on-site captioners while others outsource them to external providers who caption remotely.&lt;ref name="espn-stadiumcaption"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lifeline for hearing-impaired at ballparks|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/110607_stadium_closed_captioning|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arepublic-captioning"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cards provide captioning for deaf at stadium|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/community/glendale/articles/20131014cards-provide-captioning-deaf-stadium.html|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=The Arizona Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video games ===
The infrequent appearance of closed captioning in [[video game]]s became a problem in the 1990s as games began to commonly feature voice tracks, which in some cases contained information which the player needed in order to know how to progress in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Letters |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|page=133|url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed captioning of video games is becoming more common. One of the first video game companies to feature closed captioning was [[Bethesda Softworks]] in their 1990 release of ''Hockey League Simulator'' and ''[[The Terminator 2029]]''.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Infocom also offered ''[[Zork Grand Inquisitor]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://garydrobson.com/2014/09/10/captioning-computer-games/|title=Captioning Computer Games |last=Robson |first=Gary |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many games since then have at least offered subtitles for spoken dialog during [[cutscene]]s, and many include significant in-game dialog and sound effects in the captions as well; for example, with subtitles turned on in the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' series of stealth games, not only are subtitles available during cut scenes, but any dialog spoken during real-time gameplay will be captioned as well, allowing players who can't hear the dialog to know what enemy guards are saying and when the main character has been detected. Also, in many of developer [[Valve Corporation]]'s video games (such as ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' or ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''), when closed captions are activated, dialog and nearly all sound effects either made by the player or from other sources (e.g. gunfire, explosions) will be captioned.

Video games don't offer Line 21 captioning, decoded and displayed by the television itself but rather a built-in subtitle display, more akin to that of a DVD. The game systems themselves have no role in the captioning either; each game must have its subtitle display programmed individually.

Reid Kimball, a game designer who is hearing impaired, is attempting to educate game developers about closed captioning for games. Reid started the [http://gamescc.rbkdesign.com/ Games&lt;nowiki&gt;[CC]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] group to closed caption games and serve as a research and development team to aid the industry. Kimball designed the Dynamic Closed Captioning system,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} writes articles and speaks at developer conferences. Games[CC]'s first closed captioning project called Doom3[CC] was nominated for an award as [http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entries2006.php?entry_id=207 Best Doom3 Mod of the Year] for IGDA's Choice Awards 2006 show.

=== Online video streaming ===
Internet video streaming service [[YouTube]] offers captioning services in videos. The author of the video can upload a [[SubViewer]] (*.SUB), [[SubRip]] (*.SRT) or *.SBV file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=100077|title=Captions|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a beta feature, the site also added the ability to automatically transcribe and generate captioning on videos, with varying degrees of success based upon the content of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/03/future-will-be-captioned-improving.html|title=Official YouTube Blog: The Future Will Be Captioned: Improving Accessibility on YouTube|work=Official YouTube Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic captioning is often inaccurate on videos with background music or exaggerated emotion in speaking. Variations in volume can also result in nonsensical machine-generated captions. Additional problems arise with strong accents, sarcasm, differing contexts, or [[homonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nam, Tammy H. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/why-tv-captions-are-so-terrible/373283/ The Sorry State of Closed Captioning]". ''[[The Atlantic]]'', June 24, 2014. Retrieved December 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2010, YouTube announced a new "YouTube Ready" designation for professional caption vendors in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/06/professional-caption-services-get.html|title=Official YouTube Blog: Professional caption services get "YouTube Ready"|work=Official YouTube Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial list included twelve companies who passed a caption quality evaluation administered by the Described and Captioned Media Project, have a website and a YouTube channel where customers can learn more about their services and have agreed to post rates for the range of services that they offer for YouTube content.

[[Flash video]] also supports captions using the Distribution Exchange profile (DFXP) of W3C [[timed text]] format. The latest Flash authoring software adds free player skins and caption components that enable viewers to turn captions on/off during playback from a web page. Previous versions of Flash relied on the Captionate 3rd party component and skin to caption Flash video. Custom Flash players designed in Flex can be tailored to support the timed-text exchange profile, Captionate .XML, or [[SAMI]] file (e.g. [[Hulu]] captioning). This is the preferred method for most US broadcast and cable networks that are mandated by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] to provide captioned on-demand content. The media encoding firms generally use software such as [http://www.ccaption.com/ MacCaption] to convert [[EIA-608]] captions to this format.
The [[Silverlight]] Media Framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smf.codeplex.com/|title=Microsoft Media Platform: Player Framework|work=CodePlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; also includes support for the timed-text exchange profile for both download and adaptive streaming media.

Windows Media Video can support closed captions for both video on demand streaming or live streaming scenarios. Typically Windows Media captions support the SAMI file format but can also carry embedded closed caption data.

QuickTime video supports raw 608 caption data via proprietary closed caption track, which are just [[EIA-608]] byte pairs wrapped in a QuickTime packet container with different IDs for both line 21 fields. These captions can be turned on and off and appear in the same style as TV closed captions, with all the standard formatting (pop-on, roll-up, paint-on), and can be positioned and split anywhere on the video screen. QuickTime closed caption tracks can be viewed in [[Macintosh]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions of [[QuickTime]] Player, [[iTunes]] (via QuickTime), [[iPod Nano]], [[iPod Classic]], [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPad]].

=== Theatre ===
Live plays can be open captioned by a captioner who displays lines from the [[Script (recorded media)|script]] and including non-speech elements on a large [[Projection screen|display screen]] near the stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagetext.org/content.asp?content.id=1035 Stagetext.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814080843/http://www.stagetext.org/content.asp?content.id=1035 |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Software is also now available that automatically generates the captioning and streams the captioning to individuals sitting in the theater, with that captioning being viewed using heads-up glasses or on a smartphone or computer tablet.  &lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.auditorysciences.com/ Auditory Sciences'] [http://www.speechgear.info/products/interact-as Interact-AS].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephones ===
{{Main article|Telecommunications Relay Service#Captioned telephone}}

A captioned telephone is a [[telephone]] that displays real-time captions of the current conversation. The captions are typically displayed on a screen embedded into the telephone base.

=== Media monitoring services ===
In the United States especially, most [[media monitoring service]]s capture and index closed captioning text from news and public affairs programs, allowing them to search the text for client references. The use of closed captioning for television news monitoring was pioneered by Universal Press Clipping Bureau (Universal Information Services) in 1992,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and later in 1993 by Tulsa-based NewsTrak of Oklahoma (later known as Broadcast News of Mid-America, acquired by [[video news release]] pioneer Medialink Worldwide Incorporated in 1997).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} US patent 7,009,657 describes a "method and system for the automatic collection and conditioning of closed caption text originating from multiple geographic locations" as used by news monitoring services.

=== Conversations ===
Software programs are available that automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations. Examples of such conversations include discussions in conference rooms, classroom lectures, or religious services.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.auditorysciences.com/ Auditory Sciences'] [http://www.speechgear.info/products/interact-as Interact-AS].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-linear video editing systems and closed captioning ===
In 2010, [[Sony Vegas Pro|Vegas Pro]], the professional non-linear editor, was updated to support importing, editing, and delivering [[CEA-608]] closed captions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sony Creative Software]] (April 2010): the Vegas Pro 9.0d update.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegas Pro 10, released on October 11, 2010, added several enhancements to the closed captioning support. TV-like CEA-608 closed captioning can now be displayed as an overlay when played back in the Preview and Trimmer windows, making it easy to check placement, edits, and timing of CC information. CEA708 style Closed Captioning is automatically created when the CEA-608 data is created. Line 21 closed captioning is now supported, as well as HD-SDI closed captioning capture and print from AJA and [[Blackmagic Design]] cards. Line 21 support provides a workflow for existing legacy media. Other improvements include increased support for multiple closed captioning file types, as well as the ability to export closed caption data for DVD Architect, YouTube, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player.

In mid-2009, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released [[Final Cut Pro]] version 7 and began support for inserting closed caption data into SD and HD tape masters via [[firewire]] and compatible video capture cards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/whats-new.html Apple - Final Cut Studio - Whats New&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608124345/http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/whats-new.html |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until this time, it was not possible for video editors to insert caption data with both [[EIA-608|CEA-608]] and [[CEA-708]] to their tape masters. The typical workflow included first printing the SD or HD video to a tape and sending it to a professional closed caption service company that had a stand-alone closed caption hardware encoder.

This new closed captioning workflow known as [[Ecaptioning|e-Captioning]] involves making a proxy video from the non-linear system to import into a third-party non-linear closed captioning software. Once the closed captioning software project is completed, it must export a closed caption file compatible with the [[non-linear editing system]]. In the case of Final Cut Pro 7, three different file formats can be accepted: a .SCC file (Scenarist Closed Caption file) for Standard Definition video, a [[QuickTime]] 608 closed caption track (a special 608 coded track in the .mov file wrapper) for standard-definition video, and finally a QuickTime 708 closed caption track (a special 708 coded track in the .mov file wrapper) for high-definition video output.

Alternatively, [[Matrox]] video systems devised another mechanism for inserting closed caption data by allowing the video editor to include CEA-608 and CEA-708 in a discrete audio channel on the video editing timeline. This allows real-time preview of the captions while editing and is compatible with Final Cut Pro 6 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpcweb.com/mxo2/ CPC Closed Captioning &amp; Subtitling Software for Matrox MXO2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416034901/http://cpcweb.com/mxo2/ |date=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-linear editing systems indirectly support closed captioning only in Standard Definition line-21. Video files on the editing timeline must be composited with a line-21 VBI graphic layer known in the industry as a "blackmovie" with closed caption data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpcweb.com/nle/ CPC Closed Captioning &amp; Subtitling Software for Non-linear Editors (NLEs)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316161102/http://www.cpcweb.com/nle/ |date=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternately, video editors working with the DV25 and DV50 firewire workflows must encode their DV .avi or .mov file with VAUX data which includes CEA-608 closed caption data.

== Logo ==

The current and most familiar logo for closed captioning consists of two [[C]]s (for "closed captioned") inside a television screen. It was created by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]. The other logo, [[trademark]]ed by the [[National Captioning Institute]], is that of a simple geometric rendering of a [[television set]] merged with the tail of a [[speech balloon]]; two such versions exist &amp;ndash; one with a tail on the left, the other with a tail on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncicap.org/ncilogo.asp National Captioning Institute Logos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215152222/http://www.ncicap.org/ncilogo.asp |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''College admissions in the United States''' refers to the process of applying for entrance to institutions of [[higher education in the United States|higher education]] for [[undergraduate]] study at one of the nation's colleges or universities.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=109}}&lt;ref name=twsMamletVanDeVelde&gt;Robin Mamlet and Christine VanDeVelde, College Admission: From Application to Acceptance, Step by Step, Three Rivers Press, 2011, Retrieved January 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; For people intended to go immediately into college after high school, the college search usually begins in the [[eleventh grade]] of [[Secondary education in the United States#High schools|high school]]{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=20}} with most activity taking place during the [[twelfth grade]], although students at top high schools often begin the process during their [[tenth grade]] or earlier. In addition, there are considerable numbers of students who [[Transfer admissions in the United States|transfer from one college to another]], as well as adults older than high school age who apply to college.

==Overview==
Millions of high school students apply to college each year. While the number of graduates from high school peaked temporarily at 3.3 million in 2008, then to 3.4 million in 2014,&lt;ref name=tws2P315/&gt; numbers have been forecast to decline through 2015 and then rebound thereafter.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211/&gt; Still, the number of students enrolled in college is expected to increase through 2020 when there will be approximately 23 million students in college.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211&gt;{{cite news

The application process takes considerable time and planning since it involves multiple steps, with choices to be made and deadlines to be met. Students file separate applications to each school, although the [[Common Application]] expedites the process in many instances. Most undergraduate institutions admit students to the entire college and not to a particular [[Academic department|department]] or [[major]], unlike many European universities and American graduate schools, although some undergraduate programs such as [[architecture]] or [[engineering]] may require a separate application at some universities. As a general rule, applying to two-year county and community colleges is much easier than to a four-year school, often requiring only a high school transcript or minimum test score.

New developments in college admissions include increased numbers of applications, increased interest by students in foreign countries in applying to American universities,&lt;ref name=tws3JanN111&gt;{{cite news

===High school counselors===
[[File:Summit High School Presentation.jpg|thumb|alt=Woman pointing to a Power Point presentation.|High school advisors can help parents understand aspects of the college admissions process.]]

Some high schools have one or more teachers experienced in offering counseling to college-bound eleventh and twelfth graders.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=27}} They usually work in conjunction with the guidance department who assist students in planning their high school academic path. Counselors handle many students and schools and generally do not have a role of overseeing or managing a student's college applications.&lt;ref name=twsL44&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advisors recommend that students get to know their school counselor.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=28}} Counselors do not complete interviews, write essays, or arrange college visits.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=30}} Parents often meet with the school counselor during the eleventh grade.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=32}} Most counselors have responsibility for helping many students and, as a result, it is difficult for them to provide individual help to a particular student; one estimate was that the average ratio for all high schools of students to counselors was 460 to 1.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211/&gt; Only about a quarter of public high schools have a counselor devoted to college counseling issues full-time, while almost three quarters of private schools have a dedicated college counselor.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211/&gt; A report suggested that private school counselors have substantially more contact with university admissions staff than public school counselors.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt;

===Consultants===
Fee-based consultants, some available entirely online,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=45}} can be hired to help a student gain admission to the so-called ''right'' schools,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=27}} although there are some free programs to help underprivileged youth learn how to fill out applications, write essays, get ready for tests, and work on interviews.&lt;ref name=twsL36&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=157–158}} Consultants can help a student select schools to apply to, counsel them on test taking strategies, review scores, help with essay preparation (but not writing), review applications, conduct mock interviews, provide logistical planning, and collaborate with others such as athletic coaches.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=34–35}} Consultants try to keep a low profile; however, one admissions dean explained that she can "sniff out when there has been some adult involved in the process".{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;quoting Jennifer Delahunty, dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Kenyon College&lt;/ref&gt; Assistance by consultants or other adults can go to extremes, particularly with hard-to-check variables such as the college essays; according to one view, [[plagiarism]] on [[admissions essay]]s has been a "serious problem", particularly on applications to private universities and colleges.&lt;ref name=twsL22/&gt; There is the possibility that hiring a professional admissions consultant can make an application appear artificial; for example, admissions personnel may suspect adult coaching when one part of an application is polished, while other parts aren't, such as varying quality regarding writing samples.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=42}} Another risk in hiring a consultant, which can happen if parents become too involved in the process, is what Mamlet and VanDeVelde term ''overpackaging'': the applicant appears so smooth and perfect that admissions officers suspect the person is not real but a marketing creation.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=40}} Generally, when hiring a college admissions counselor, parents and students try to understand the counselor's philosophy, learn what services are provided, and whether any help will be offered regarding advice about financial aid or scholarships.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=38–39}} Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that it is improper for an admissions counselor to tamper with a student's "authentic self".{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=35}} According to their view, ideal counselors have experience with college admissions, meet regularly with college admissions officers, visit campuses regularly, and belong to professional affiliations.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=38–39}}

===College admissions staff===
[[File:Table and banner at college admissions presentation.jpg|thumb|Elite and other universities send admissions officers to high schools and college fairs to encourage high school students to apply. While the chance of admission to highly selective colleges is typically under 10%, increased numbers of applications helps maintain and improve colleges' rankings.]]

A typical admission staff at a college includes a dean or vice president for admission or enrollment management, middle-level managers or assistant directors, admission officers, and administrative support staff.&lt;ref name=tws3JanN113/&gt; The chief enrollment management officer is sometimes the highest-paid position in the department, earning $121,000 on average in 2010, while admissions officers average only $35,000, according to one estimate.&lt;ref name=tws3JanN113/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws3JanN214/&gt; Admissions officers tend to be in the 30-to-40 age demographic.&lt;ref name=tws3JanN212&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are evaluated on how well they "represent their college, manage their office, recruit staff members, and work with other administrators".&lt;ref name=tws3JanN214/&gt; Michele Hernandez suggested there were basically two types of officers: a first group of personable, sharp, people-oriented go-getter types who were often recent college grads; a second group was somewhat out-of-touch "lifers" who often did not graduate from a highly selective college.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=1–3}} Officers are generally paid an annual salary, although there have been reports of some recruiters paid on the basis of how many students they bring to a college, such as recruiters working abroad to recruit foreign students to U.S. universities.&lt;ref name=tws3JanN214/&gt;

Many colleges and universities work hard to market themselves, trying to attract the best students and maintain a reputation for academic quality. Colleges spent an average of $585 to recruit each applicant during the 2010 year.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws3JanN113/&gt; There are efforts to make increased use of [[social media]] sites such as [[Facebook]] to promote their colleges.&lt;ref name=tws3JanN213&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing brochures and other promotional mailings often arrive daily in the hope of persuading high school students to apply to a college. According to Joanne Levy-Prewitt, colleges send "view books" not because they intend to admit them, but "because they want multitudes of students to apply" to improve the college's selectivity ranking and to make sure that they have as many well-qualified applicants as possible from whom to choose the strongest class.&lt;ref name=tws2T22&gt;{{cite news |author= Joanne Levy-Prewitt |title= Juniors should be wary of slick college admission come-ons |work= The Record (Bergen County, NJ) via Highbeam Research |quote= ...

===Information sources===
''US News'' compiles a directory of colleges and universities and has made a ranking of them, although the rankings are controversial, some colleges refuse to cooperate, and high school guidance counselors sometimes have major problems with the rankings.&lt;ref name=twsL18&gt;{{cite news |author= Jacques Steinberg |title= 'Best Colleges'?

===Test preparation firms===
Companies such as the [[College Board]] have offered services to help students prepare for their tests and provide other services, usually web-based, to help students compare schools. Some firms work with schools to provide test preparation advisors who teach students how to take the SAT and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] entrance exams.

For those intending to enter college immediately after high school, the admissions process usually begins during a student's eleventh grade when a student meets with a guidance counselor, selects some colleges, and perhaps visits a few campuses. The summer before twelfth grade is a time when many applicants finalize application plans and perhaps begin writing essays. Further, they decide whether to apply by early or regular decision. International students may need to take tests showing English-language proficiency such as the [[TOEFL]], [[IELTS]], or [[Pearson Test of English Academic|PTE Academic]].&lt;ref name=twsMayO214/&gt; The twelfth grade is when applications are submitted. The [[CSS Profile|CSS]] can be submitted by October first of the student's twelfth grade, while the FAFSA becomes available on the web after January first.&lt;ref name=tws2V2449&gt;{{cite web

Rankings have been the subject of much [[Criticism of college and university rankings (North America)|criticism]]. Since much of the data is provided by colleges themselves, there are opportunities for schools to manipulate the rankings to enhance prestige. There have been instances in which school officials deliberately misreported statistics, such as an admissions dean at [[Claremont McKenna College|Claremont McKenna]] who falsified average SAT statistics,&lt;ref name=twsMayO213&gt;{{cite news

===Choosing schools by selectivity===
[[File:Scattergram by Naviance which estimates likelihood of admission.png|thumb|A Naviance scattergram for a hypothetical student, John Doe, applying to a particular hypothetical university. Grades and test scores can be compared with those of past applicants to that university from that high school. The method helps students see whether a school is a ''reach, possible, probable'' or ''solid'' school.]]

Advisors typically ask students to begin to see potential colleges in terms of four types:
* '''Reach''' schools provide a slim chance of acceptance, such as a 5% or slimmer chance.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=133–134}}
* '''Possibles''' (or high matches) have greater chance of rejection than acceptance.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=133–134}}
* '''Probables''' (or low matches) have greater chance of acceptance than rejection.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=133–134}}
* '''Solid''' or '''safety''' schools seldom reject candidates with similar academic credentials.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=133–134}} High school counselors recommend that a safety school be one that a student would like to attend if rejected everywhere else. Mark Kantrowitz advised having at least one financial aid safety school that is affordable even without financial aid.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG311/&gt; Another classification is "unlikelies" (5% chance of acceptance), "reach schools" (25% chance), "possibles" (50% chance), and "likelies" (80% chance).

Typically counselors will suggest an applicant apply to a mix of the different types of schools, usually having at least one ''safety'' school, but the numbers of the others are up to students and families. [[Phillips Academy|Andover]]'s counseling director recommends that a student apply to a minimum of two "solid" schools and two "probable" schools.&lt;ref name=tws3afa/&gt; Many high schools subscribe to an online service called [[Naviance]], which, among other things, can help a student gauge the likelihood of admission to a particular college.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=160}} It is based on a student's grades and test scores in comparison to the admissions results from students from previous years applying to that particular college (see diagram).{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=160}} Naviance uses a [[scattergram]] to graphically illustrate the chances for a student from a particular high school being admitted into a particular college or university.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=20}} In addition, counselors can help a student consider different types of colleges, such as [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]], research universities, and specialty schools.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|pp=116–117}} A report in ''[[Time magazine]]'' in 2013 suggested that it was almost impossible for poor students to gain admission to elite universities,&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine, Noliwe M.

===Better fit or prestige===
Prestige of colleges correlates with age, such that the oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige by virtue of their longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that "fit should trump prestige every single time," and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige.&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between "price and prestige".&lt;ref name=twsMayO115&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and "do not listen to your friends" since they have different needs and wants. "One of the worst ways to make a decision about where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," wrote one advisor.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; Since "barely half" of students entering college as first-year students ever graduate from college later in their lives,&lt;ref name=twsL28/&gt; getting the right fit is important for parents and students to avoid wasting money.&lt;ref name=twsL28/&gt; What is a good fit:

A private admissions counselor elaborates:

{{Quote|A school has to ''fit'' – academically, socially, and economically ... Ask whether a college feels ''right'' ... rather than is it ''best'' ...|Michael Szarek, 2011&lt;ref name=twsL21aa/&gt;}}

One admissions dean likens "fit" to a [[friendship]]:

{{Quote|I draw the analogy of friends to explain why fit is so important in considering a college. You like your good friends for some reason. It may not be an objective reason. It's often subjective. There's some sense of compatibility, a kind of intuition, a match, a common sense of values, what you like to do, how you think – those are the things that really bind people together. It's similar with college. You don't want to spend four years with a college who isn't really your friend.|Jennifer Rickard, admissions dean at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]]{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=166}}}}

In addition, counselors can help less academically astute students find good colleges to help them pursue careers, and can point out colleges that are "gems" but relatively unknown.&lt;ref name=twsL19&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, choosing a college in a different part of the country can improve chances for admission, particularly if the college is seeking "geographical diversity."&lt;ref name=twsL19/&gt; One study suggests that the overall prestige of a person's college is less important, overall, in predicting how they would fare in later life, and that personal characteristics, such as aptitude, are more important.&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt;

====Types of financial aid====
* '''Need-based aid''' is offered according to the financial need of a student. Generally colleges at the "top of the pecking order" dispense aid solely in terms of need using "fairly predictable formulas", according to one source.&lt;ref name=tws2MayY311/&gt; ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' reported that elite colleges had made little progress in helping poor students get need-based aid, and that less than 15% of undergraduates at the nation's 50 wealthiest colleges received [[Pell Grant]]s in 2008–2009, which are offered on the basis of need to promising yet less affluent students.&lt;ref name=twsSepN2112&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= September 14, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, about 30 elite universities have "coffers deep enough to meet all student need" and consequently only offer need-based aid.&lt;ref name=tws3JanN311/&gt;

* '''Merit-based aid''' is scholarships and grants awarded to top academic performers or others with special talents. One report suggested that academic scholarships tended to be few, and were usually awarded by the admissions office and are "highly competitive".&lt;ref name=tws2ZG311/&gt; Another report suggested that most colleges use merit scholarships, based on high scores or grades or other accomplishments, to lure students away from a competing college.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG314/&gt;

One view is that most colleges award aid using a mix of both.&lt;ref name=tws2MayY311/&gt; Further, [[student loan]]s can lessen the immediate difficulty of large tuition bills but can saddle a student with debt after graduation; in contrast, grants and scholarships do not have to be paid back.&lt;ref name=tws2ZB42/&gt;

According to Lynn O'Shaughnessy, schools trying to climb the prestige ladder use merit-based scholarships to attract top students to boost their rankings in the ''US News'' guidebook.&lt;ref name=tws2Z211&gt;{{cite news

In addition to cost factors, increasingly colleges are being compared on the basis of the average [[student debt]] of their graduates, and ''[[US News#America's Best Colleges|US News]]'' has developed rankings based on average student indebtedness.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in the ''[[Utne Reader]]'' chronicled substantial student indebtedness, and suggested that 37 million Americans in 2009 held student debt, and that nine in ten students used an average of 4.6 credit cards to pay for some educational expenses.&lt;ref name="Utne"&gt;Student Debt, by the numbers, Utne Reader, July–August 2012, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; The report chronicled an increase in average indebtedness from an average of $2,000 in 1980–81 to over $25,000 in 2009, as well as substantial decreases in Federal aid and Pell grants during that time period.&lt;ref name="Utne"/&gt;

''[[US News]]'' and others suggest another factor overlooked in terms of financing college, which is the length of time it takes to earn a degree. Finishing a year early (in three years) lops off a substantial portion of the overall bill,&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; while taking five years compounds the expense and delays entry into the workforce. Jacques Steinberg suggested that many college-bound students calculate how much [[student debt|debt]] they were likely to incur each year, and he suggested that debt for all four years of college should total less than the graduate's expected first year's salary after college, and preferably under $40,000.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Q845&gt;{{cite news

===Selecting colleges by type===
[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology 50.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of buildings, exterior shot|Different types of schools offer different educations: including engineering-oriented colleges such as the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], which emphasizes teaching, internships, and technical education.]]
[[File:Union County College Student Center.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of an interior glass-enclosed space.|Two-year county or community colleges, such as [[Union County College]] in New Jersey, are geared for students who live at home and commute to school, and can be a highly affordable alternative to many private colleges as well as public universities.]]
[[File:Juilliard School - Alice Tully Hall.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a building in a city.|Some colleges focus on one particular area, such as the [[Juilliard School]] in New York City, which is highly selective, and specializes in preparing students for careers in dance, music, theater, and the arts.]]

Most educational institutions in the U.S. are [[non-profit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/das/library/tables_listings/showTable2005.asp?popup=true&amp;tableID=7062&amp;rt=p |title= Table 1.

Many combine some or all of the above. Another consideration is the male-female ratio; overall, 56% of enrolled college students are women, but the male-female ratio varies by college and year and program.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211/&gt; Admissions guidance counselors can offer views about whether a public or private school is best, and give a sense of the tradeoffs.

'''Two-year colleges''' are often county- or community-oriented schools funded by state or local governments, and typically offer the [[Associates degree]] (A.A.). They are generally inexpensive,&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; particularly for in-state residents, and are focused on teaching, and accept most applicants meeting minimum grade and SAT score levels. Students commute to school and rarely live in dorms on campus. These schools often have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] arrangements with four-year state public schools to permit students to transfer. Consultants suggest that community colleges are reasonably priced, and after two years with solid grades and academic performance, many colleges are willing to accept [[Transfer admissions in the United States|transfers]].

'''Four-year colleges''' offer [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.) degrees. These are primarily [[undergraduate]] institutions, although some might have limited programs at the [[Graduate school|graduate]] level. Graduates of the tuition-free [[United States service academies]] receive both a Bachelor of Science degree and a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]].

'''Universities''' have both [[undergraduate]] and [[Graduate school|graduate]] students. [[Graduate school|Graduate programs]] grant a variety of [[Master's degree]]s including [[M.B.A.]]s or [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.s]]. The highest academic degree is the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] or Ph.D. [[Medical school in the United States|Medical schools]] award either the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] degrees while [[Law school in the United States|law schools]] award the [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree. [[Public university|Public]] and [[private university|private universities]] are generally [[research]]-oriented institutions that teach both an [[undergraduate]] and [[Graduate school|graduate]] students.

'''Liberal arts colleges''' are four-year institutions that emphasize interactive instruction, although research is still a component of these institutions. They are usually [[Residential college|residential]] colleges with most students living on campus in dorms. They tend to have smaller enrollments, class sizes, and lower [[student-teacher ratio]]s than universities, and encourage teacher-student interaction with classes taught by full-time faculty members rather than graduate students known as [[teaching assistant]]s. There are further distinctions within the category of [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]: some are [[coeducational]], [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]], or [[Men's colleges in the United States|men's colleges]]. There are [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]]; in addition, while most schools are [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]], some stress a particular religious orientation. Most are [[private school|private]] colleges but there are some [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges|public]] ones.

'''State colleges and universities'''. Since they are usually subsidized with state funds, tuitions tend to be lower than private schools. They tend to be large, sometimes with student bodies numbering in the tens of thousands, and offer a variety of programs. They are generally less selective in terms of admissions than elite competitive private schools, and are usually less expensive, sometimes half or a third as much as a private institution for in-state residents; the affordability may be leading more students in recent years to choose public or state-subsidized or community colleges.&lt;ref name=twsL33/&gt; There are reports that in budget shortfalls in the past few years, many state schools are selectively trying to attract higher-paying out-of-state residents.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R212&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporter Brennan Barnard in ''[[The New York Times]]'' recommended that student visitors should ask ''good'' questions (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper.&lt;ref name=tws2E1114/&gt; He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to try to meet them even briefly.&lt;ref name=tws2E1114/&gt; A follow-up "thank you" note to the host is a good idea (avoid texting abbreviations.)&lt;ref name=tws2E1114/&gt;

Counselor Michael Szarek commented on the importance of campus visits in dispelling false impressions:

{{Quote|Half of all college classes are ''not'' outdoors. Half of all college classes are not gathered around an electron microscope. Sometimes the leaves are brown, or even fall to the ground.

However, one account suggested colleges structured the campus visit with the same boring format, which rarely includes a faculty member:

{{Quote|First there is an "informational session," conducted by an admissions officer. This is followed by an hour-long campus tour, which is led by a student with a talent for walking backwards .... On the campus tour, we are always shown a dorm room and a dining hall. We are always taken to a library and told how many volumes it contains. We are informed how many students study abroad (a lot), how many student clubs there are (ditto), and how small the classes are (very small.)|Carl Elliott in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 2012&lt;ref name=tws3JanN211&gt;{{cite news

==Applications considerations==

===Extracurricular activities===
There are conflicting views about student participation in [[extracurricular activities]]. A predominant position is that colleges are after "well-rounded bodies of individual specialists", suggesting that it is better for a student to be deeply involved in one or two activities rather than nine or ten superficially, such as a "violin-playing quarterback" or a "math-medalist poet,"&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2R211&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that students should not "overdo it,"&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt; and that parents should not become overconcerned about their child's extracurricular activities.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R214/&gt; Applicants who achieve a leadership position in an extracurricular activity are regarded more highly than applicants who merely participate in a bunch of activities.&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt; Advisors recommend that a student should choose which extracurricular activities they genuinely care about, pursue them with "gusto" and "joyful commitment" that demonstrates integrity and commitment.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=67-70}} And, consistent with this view, is that too many extracurricular activities may look suspect to admissions officers, particularly if it seems unreasonable that any person could be as active and succeed scholastically at the same time.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt; Jobs are generally viewed favorably by admissions committees, including even part-time service jobs such as flipping hamburgers, since it suggests that a student has learned to handle [[time management]], to accept responsibility, and develop [[people skills]].{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=74}} A less dominant position was that it is helpful to be involved in a "variety of activities", including jobs, internships, and community service.&lt;ref name=twsL27&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities, such as the [[University of California]], have formal programs for spot-checking applications for accuracy, such as sending a follow-up letter to the student asking for proof about an extracurricular activity or summer job.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=76}} Advisors recommend that extracurricular activities should never interfere with a student's overall academic performance.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=73}} A student with many extracurricular activities in twelfth grade, but few in preceding years, particularly when the essays focus on the extracurricular activities, is suspect; this suggests an applicant is being coached, and may reflect negatively on an application (see the section on [[#Consultants|consultants]]).{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=43}} Advisors warn against "overscheduling" students with too many activities or courses.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=23}}

===Number of applications===
There are differing views on how many schools a student should apply to. Several reports suggest that applying to too many schools caused unnecessary stress and expense&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; and hampers a student from targeting applications to a few select schools.&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; However, other advisors suggest that applying to more schools increases overall chances for acceptance. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest applying to eight to ten schools is best, and that applying to too many schools is counterproductive.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R214/&gt; There are reports that the average number of schools that students are applying to has been increasing, perhaps because of greater use of the [[Common Application]]. In 2008, applications to [[Harvard University]] had increased to a record number at 27,278, a 19% increase from the year before.&lt;ref name=twsL34&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One effect of the increase in application numbers is lower [[Yield (college admissions)|yield]] percentages. Average yield has dropped from 46% to 38% in 2001, according to one account.&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt;

===Online identity===
Some reports revealed that some college admissions departments have scrutinized applicants' personalities online, such as [[Facebook]] or [[MySpace]] profiles. As a result, admissions officers urge students to remove "sarcastic jokes, bad pictures, or political cartoons," and also to become wary about their friends' social media posts.&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt; One concurring report suggested that some offices have employees tasked with "checking out applicants' Facebook pages";&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt; however, a contrasting report from another college recruiter states that their policy is not to examine Facebook profiles, and that "Facebook is reserved for students on a recreational basis."&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt; The same caution applies to email addresses. One advisor cautions against using provocative email addresses such as "Spicychick@gmail.com," instead encouraging applicants to use their real name since it can ease colleges' searches for applicants' records.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt;

====Applying in the fall====
Many schools have implemented a system through which students can apply at a time other than the most common usual deadline of January first of the twelfth grade, to lighten the load on students and admissions officers. Several reports suggest an increase in early admissions.

Many open slots for students at many private universities begin to fill up early in the last year of school. In 2001 it was estimated that a third of slots for next year's first-year class were filled by December, which was an increase from one-fifth a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt; Estimates made around 2011 suggested that 45% of positions were taken by December.&lt;ref name=twsM112/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMayO311&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools such as [[Duke University]], [[Haverford College]], and the [[University of Chicago]] reported increases in early applications in 2011.&lt;ref name=twsM112/&gt; While early applications had been used by many students in elite prep schools and top high schools primarily in the northeastern United States, they are being used by a more diverse group of students including foreigners and minority applicants to apply to more colleges.&lt;ref name=twsM112/&gt; A downside of applying early is an inability to compare competing aid packages from different schools, but to an extent this can be mitigated if parents and students ask the college for a fairly firm estimate of expected costs before applying by an early method.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; Several sources suggested that early admissions programs favor students from wealthier families since there was no need to compare financial aid offers.&lt;ref name=tws3JanK11/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMay2R113/&gt; Adviser Michele Hernandez suggested that the early decision and early action candidate pools were "much more homogeneous" with most applicants being affluent white students.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=36}} High-end academic applicants tended to want to have a choice, while minority applicants needed to compare scholarship offers from different colleges; accordingly, these latter two groups tended to avoid early applications.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=36}} According to Hernandez, Ivy League financial aid packages were similar whether one applied early admission or regular admission, since the Ivies are 100% [[Need-blind admission|need blind]] meaning that they do not take into account an applicant's ability to pay.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=39}} Early applicants are urged to submit applications in September and October, and not wait until November, so staff more time to consider the application.&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt; There has been controversy surrounding early admissions programs, since there have been reports that most of those accepted in early admissions tended to be white, from good high schools and having upscale family incomes.&lt;ref name=twsL16/&gt; A report in ''[[US News]]'' suggested that early admissions approaches were not advised for students who were obviously under or over qualified, dependent on financial aid, undecided, behind in their college search plans, or late bloomers.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG313&gt;{{cite news

* '''November application'''. It is made early in the academic year, typically the first week in November,{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=33}} although deadlines vary somewhat, so a student who applies for early decision and is accepted, typically by mid-December, must attend that college.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; One report maintains that some colleges defer decisions on some early applicants until the next year, past their own deadlines for notifying early applicants.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG114/&gt;
* '''Benefits for universities'''. Admitting early decision applicants benefits schools because there is an almost certain probability that the admitted applicants will attend and, as a result, colleges can increase their [[yield (college admissions)|yield]] by admitting them, and this can help a college improve its ranking.&lt;ref name=tws3JanK11/&gt; In addition, it helps admissions departments spread the work of sifting through applications throughout more of the school year.&lt;ref name=tws3JanK11/&gt; Generally counselors suggest this option is only for students who know with certainty that one particular college is their first choice.

=====Early action=====
[[File:College admissions consultant at workshop for high school juniors.jpg|thumb|College admissions consultant Michael Szarek advises against applying early decision unless a student is totally certain of the choice and parents have sufficient resources to pay the bill; he often recommends the non-binding alternative, early action, as an alternative.]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time frame is similar: apply by early November, get a decision by mid-December,{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=33}} although specific deadlines vary by school. It allows a student to compare competing offers.&lt;ref name=tws2ZB43/&gt; The exception is that there are four colleges – [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]—which have a single-choice early action program, meaning that an applicant can only apply early action to one school. Early action can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school and have done everything possible to secure admission since a student will know the result of the application sooner,&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; One report suggested that non-binding early action programs continued to be highly popular, and noticed that three schools––[[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and the [[University of Virginia]]—which had abandoned early admissions programs in 2006, reestablished them in 2011 after other colleges failed to follow their lead.&lt;ref name=twsL16&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally fewer schools offer the early action program but ones that do include [[Georgetown University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[Boston College]].&lt;ref name=tws2ZB43/&gt; One account suggested that early action did not give as much of an "admissions edge" as early decision because it was non-binding.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG312/&gt;

====Regular admission====
Regular admission is a good choice for students who are unsure where they would like to go.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; One advantage is that it can help students who have improved their grades substantially in the fall of twelfth grade, since decisions are not made until March of that year.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; In addition, it offers students more time to make their decision about a college under somewhat less pressure than an early method. The fairly dominant view is that regular admission is more likely to result in higher offers of financial aid, particularly if students are admitted to several institutions that present different aid offers. Accordingly, one offer can be used as leverage to try to get a better offer at another institution,&lt;ref name=tws2ZG313/&gt; particularly if there are competing multiple acceptances.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG314/&gt; Several reports suggested that a "growing number of colleges" including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie-Mellon]] have stated publicly that they will consider matching offers from competing colleges.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG314&gt;{{cite news

{{Quote|If you want to go to Cornell ... and you don't think your family can afford the full sticker prices ... you are likely to get bigger scholarships if you also apply—and get in—to wealthy and more competitive schools. ... Cornell will now adopt Harvard's definition of "need," which, in many cases, will mean bigger scholarships.|report in ''[[US News]]'', 2010&lt;ref name=tws2ZG314/&gt;}}

However, a dissenting view in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that only one to two percent of colleges adjust aid packages based on offers from competing colleges, and that most colleges do not get into bidding wars over specific students.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG311/&gt;

====Rolling admissions====
Some colleges offer this type of admission, typically used by schools with large numbers of applicants, which means that colleges are continually receiving applications and making decisions, typically within four to six weeks after application.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; It allows prospective students to apply at any time between the fall and spring and to receive their result a few weeks later. One benefit is that if a student is accepted early in the school year, there is less anxiety about acceptance for the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; Rolling admission schools are also beneficial to students who are rejected from all the schools they applied regularly to, yet still wish to enroll without taking a [[gap year]]. Guidance counselors suggest that rolling admissions should not be used late in [[twelfth grade]] since financial aid money may have already been distributed, and few slots may be left for September.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; One advisor suggests that if a college offers rolling admissions and is on a student's list, then it should be applied to as soon as rolling admissions becomes available for that year.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; Another report suggested that rolling admissions was more characteristic of noncompetitive colleges.&lt;ref name=twsL16/&gt;

===Testing options===

====Test preparation courses====
There are conflicting reports about the usefulness of test preparation courses. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that "most students don't need a coach or a class" and that the single largest factor was "familiarity with the test".&lt;ref name=twsMay2R214/&gt; Another report agreed that SAT/ACT prep courses were a waste of money and that taking a few practice exams, and understanding how each test works, was all that was needed.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R211/&gt; According to ''[[NBC News]]'', the multibillion-dollar private test prep industry, including coaching and tutoring as well as software and clinics, is a source of "inequality and injustice" in higher education since it enables the offspring of well-to-do families to improve their test scores by means of learning "tips and tricks"; there is a report in March 2014 that the ''College Board'' is planning to redesign the SAT to make it less susceptible to gaming.&lt;ref name=NBCNews17&gt;Nona Willis Aronowitz, March 6, 2014, NBC News, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/does-new-sat-spell-doom-test-prep-industry-n45936 Does the New SAT Spell Doom for the Test Prep Industry?], Accessed March 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Test prep courses can cost $1,000 per course; tutors can cost $15,000 per year, according to one estimate.&lt;ref name=NBCNews17/&gt;

====Standardized admissions tests====

In 2003, according to one estimate, 1.4 million students took the SAT and 1.4 million also took the ACT test,&lt;ref name=twsMay2S213/&gt; paying about $50 per test.&lt;ref name=tws2V2449/&gt; Generally counselors suggest that students should plan on taking the SAT or ACT test twice, so that a low score can possibly be improved.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=98}} One advisor suggested that students with weak [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]] scores could consider applying to colleges where these measures were optional.&lt;ref name=twsL19/&gt; One suggested retaking the tests if there are "subpar test scores" in September and October (if applying early admission) or November and December (if applying regular admission.)&lt;ref name=twsL27/&gt; Generally over half of eleventh graders retaking the SAT or ACT tests during the twelfth grade saw improvements in their scores.&lt;ref name=tws2V2449/&gt; Colleges vary in terms of how much emphasis they place on these scores.&lt;ref name=tws2T21&gt;{{cite news

A consensus view is that most colleges accept either the [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]], and have formulas for converting scores into admissions criteria, and can convert SAT scores into ACT scores and vice versa relatively easily.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=57}} The ACT is reportedly more popular in the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] and [[Southern United States|south]] while the SAT is more popular on the [[Eastern United States|east]] and [[Western United States|west]] coasts.&lt;ref name=tws2V211/&gt; Apparently there have been instances of persons taking admissions tests in place of the real student as paid ''SAT test-takers,'' which is illegal, but the existence of such services has been called "an open secret in competitive circles"; for example, in 2011, an [[Emory University]] second-year student was arrested for taking the test for another person on a fee basis.&lt;ref name=twsL35&gt;{{cite news

Regarding whether to choose the SAT or ACT, the consensus view is that both tests are roughly equivalent and tend to bring similar results, and that each test is equally accepted by colleges. Reporter Jacques Steinberg in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that admissions deans repeatedly inform him that colleges view the ACT and SAT tests equally and do not have a preference.&lt;ref name=twsMayO312&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, small differences between the tests may translate into a slight benefit for the test-taker. One report suggested that the SAT favors "white male students" from upper income backgrounds.&lt;ref name=twsMayO313&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to this view, some SAT questions can be trickier and harder to decipher while some ACT questions may be longer;&lt;ref name=tws2V211/&gt; question difficulty progresses within each SAT section while difficult questions are randomly interspersed in the ACT;&lt;ref name=tws2V211/&gt; the SAT has a separate vocabulary section while the ACT has a separate science reasoning section.&lt;ref name=tws2V211/&gt; In 2016 the SAT was updated to remove the penalty for random guessing; the College Board advises that test-takers will benefit by guessing.&lt;ref name=twsReuters143/&gt;

====SAT subject tests====
Several sources suggested that the [[SAT subject tests]] were becoming more important in evaluating applicants. One described them as "true equalizers" in admissions, suggesting how strong a high school is, and elaborated that some admissions officers considered them to be a better indicator of academic ability than high school grades.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=59–65}} Another suggested that selective colleges like to get results from [[SAT subject tests]] in addition to other ones, while public universities placed less emphasis on them.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=94}}

====Advanced placement tests====
There was a report that scores on [[Advanced Placement exams]] could be helpful in the evaluations process.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=97}} One report suggested there was a limit on the number of AP tests that should be taken, such that taking 12 AP tests was not as helpful as taking five and doing well on those five.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R211/&gt;

===Common vs. college's application===
[[File:Sign saying Common Application Membership.jpg|thumb|The [[Common Application]].]]
The advantage of the [[Common Application]] is that it is the same for numerous colleges, and can save time and trouble for a student. It is accepted at 488 colleges out of several thousand, but only a third of the 488 use it exclusively, meaning that two-thirds allow an applicant to submit either the ''Common Application'' or the school's specific application form.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=115–116}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Members|url=https://www.commonapp.org/CommonApp/Members.aspx|publisher=The Common Application|accessdate=November 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031075325/https://www.commonapp.org/CommonApp/Members.aspx|archivedate=October 31, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hernandez, many admissions officers complain that the ''Common Application'' stifles creativity and encourages "dull responses", and she recommends that students use the college's particular application when there is a choice.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=115–116}}

===Interviews===
{{Main|College interview}}

[[File:Lieber College, University of South Carolina.jpg|thumb|Admissions office of the [[University of South Carolina]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].]]
There are differing recommendations about the importance of interviews, with the consensus view that interviews were overall less important than college admissions essays, but should be done if they were offered.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S213/&gt; One advisor suggested that visits by college admissions personnel to the high schools were a waste of time for colleges, since there was not enough time to get to know specific applicants.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=107}} In addition, she felt that personal interviews were generally overrated, though she noted that many Ivies have alumni interviews, which can help in borderline situations.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=153–156}} One counselor suggested that if an interview was offered by a college admissions program, then it was not really optional but it should be seen as a requirement, that is, not going to such an interview could be detrimental to a student's chances for admission.&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt; Another suggested that a student should try to get an interview, even if it was not required, since it might help "exhibit character strengths" that might not show up via grades on high school transcripts.&lt;ref name=twsL19/&gt; Several reports noted that most [[Ivy League]] schools have abandoned the interview requirement, but that if there is an opportunity for an interview, even with an alumnus of the college, then it is a good idea to do it since not doing it signals a lack of interest in the school.&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt;{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=153–156}} Knowing a college can be helpful during an interview, so that an applicant can say something specific about the school, or a professor who teaches there, or a subject or internship opportunities, since it shows sincere interest.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt;{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=153–156}} Interviews (if offered) may be more of a factor at small liberal arts colleges:

{{Quote|Our advice is that if offered an interview, a student should take it ... And they should dress as if they are going to dinner with their grandparents. The biggest faux pax comes in inappropriate dress for both sexes. Spaghetti straps, buttons that pop open. For boys a rumpled T-shirt&amp;nbsp;... If you look in the mirror and you think you look good, change your clothes. This is not a date.|Mamlet and VanDeVelde&lt;ref name=twsMay2R214/&gt;}}

One suggested that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" and be able to talk about interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested it was important to show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show "social maturity" with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=29, 36, 38, 83–96}} An applicant should have an attitude that was not be what can the college offer but what can the student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=62, 66, 67}} Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=93}} Another advisor suggested that students must be prepared to answer the question ''What is your biggest failure'' in an interview.&lt;ref name=twsBostonGlobe4&gt;Sanjay Solomon, January 30, 2015, The Boston Globe, [http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/2015/01/30/can-failure-resume-help-you-succeed/uTBdq9A7LfXXF7vVOlG9oM/story.html Can a Failure Resume Help You Succeed?], Retrieved January 30, 2016, "... "Asking 'what is your biggest failure?' is an opportunity [for an interviewer] to get a reality check and to put a little pressure on this person"...."&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated,{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=110–122}} and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=110–122}} Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=tws2T28&gt;{{cite news

===Essays===
There are differing opinions about the importance of the [[admissions essay|college essay]]. The consensus view is that the essay is less important than grades and test scores, but that an essay can make a difference in some instances,&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt; often at highly selective colleges where they can "make or break your application."&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt; There was one report that essays were becoming more important as a way to judge a student's potential,&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt; and that essays have supplanted personal interviews as a primary way to evaluate a student's character.

The [[Common Application]] requires that personal statements be 250 to 650 words in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/freshman/apply.html|title=How to Apply : Stanford University|last=University|first=Undergraduate Admission at Stanford|website=admission.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although applicants may strive to reach the word limit, college admissions officers emphasize that the most important part is honing and rewriting:

{{Quote|Writing is easy; rewriting is hard. And essays deserve to be rewritten several times. Lots of kids think the objective is to write about something that will ''impress'' the admission office. In part that is true, but what impresses an admission officer is an essay that conveys something positive about the applicant; that allows the committee to get to know the kid just a bit from those few pieces of paper. The essay is an opportunity to provide a different perspective about the applicant, a reason to accept a kid. It is an opportunity not to be wasted.&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt;}}

Advisors suggest that the essay should be concise, honest (with no embellishments), coherent, not boring,&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt; accurate, and visually evocative. The essay should reveal a likeable&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt; and smart individual. It should approach humor and controversial topics with caution and balance.&lt;ref name="twsL26"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/professors-guide/2010/09/15/10-tips-for-writing-the-college-application-essay|title=10 Tips for Writing the College Application Essay|author1=Jeremy S. Hyman|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011|publisher=''US News''|author2=Lynn F. Jacobs|author3=Jonathan Reider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tips include avoiding [[jargon]] or abbreviations, overly emotional appeals, profanity or texttalk (example: Schools H8 2 C texttalk), or artiness (e.g. poetry in an application)&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt; or cockiness.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt;

Former guidance counselor for students at [[Phillips Academy|Andover]] and college admissions authority Donald Dunbar suggested that essays must emphasize personal character and demonstrate intellectual curiosity, maturity, social conscience, concern for the community, tolerance, and inclusiveness.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=ix}} He advises to not merely "be yourself," but show your "best self."{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=11–21}} Dunbar furthermore claims that demonstrating class participation suggests a "willingness to go beyond selfishness" and shows enthusiasm for learning.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=25}} Alan Gelb suggests that the only "no-no" is "shameless self-promotion".&lt;ref name=twsMayO212&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics to avoid{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} include babysitting experiences, pets, encounters with illegal drugs or alcohol or criminal activity,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} excuses to explain a low grade,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} stories about a former home or big brother or sister,{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=34}} a simple listing of achievements,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} expressing thanks for being chosen as a leader, talking about a "wilderness leadership course",{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=67–68}} general complaining or whining,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} [[racism]] or [[sexism]] or disrespect for groups of people,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} bad taste or profanity or vulgarity or bathroom humor,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} early love or sex experiences,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} criticism or disrespect for parents,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} telling only jokes,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} excessive bragging or too many instances of the "I" pronoun,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}}&lt;ref&gt;For example: "I did this, I did that, then I did this" and on and on&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/ref&gt; personal health information about yourself or a friend or a family member,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}}  and copy-and-pasting a term paper in the essay form{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} such as about global warming or the European debt crisis. Applicants should refrain from express opinions too strongly as if no counterviews were possible.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=207}} The topic should be something the applicant cares about,{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=50}} and should show ''leadership'' in the sense of "asserting yourself to help others have more success." According to Dunbar, leadership is not necessarily about being in charge such as being the team captain or school president.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=54}} Applicants should present a broad perspective and avoid simplistic words such as ''never'', ''always'', ''only'', or ''nobody'', which suggest narrow thinking.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=136+}} Dunbar advised against the standard "tell 'em what you've told 'em" essay formula but doing something different, interesting, and exciting.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=147}}

Former admissions director Michele Hernandez agreed, and suggested that the best essay topics were a slice-of-life story with poignant details, in which the writer ''shows'' and does not ''tell''.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–136}} She suggested that a student show their essay to a literate friend and ask if would they admit this person to the college.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–136}} She recommended that applicants not try to come across as a "preppy well-off kid" but downplay parental status.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=6–9}} Advisors Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that students proactively try to explain an unusual grade, such as a low grade in a core course.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=58}} There are online databases available to help students write cogent essays.&lt;ref name=Anders2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anders|first1=George|title=What Essays Thrill Elite Schools?

===Teacher recommendations===
Some colleges ask for teacher recommendation letters, typically from 11th or 12th grade teachers of core courses, and preferably who know the student well. One report suggested that having more than four recommendations was a mistake, and that a "thick file" indicated a "thick student" to admissions personnel.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt; One report, however, was that teacher recommendations were becoming less important as a rating measure, according to one report.&lt;ref name=twsMayO112&gt;{{cite news

===Other considerations===
[[File:Dickinson College 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Archway outdoors shot says Dickinson College.|[[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]].]]

Advisors counsel that applicants should meet deadlines,&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=153}}&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; spend time researching colleges,&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; be open-minded,&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; have fun,&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; communicate what "resonates" to the applicant about a particular school,&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt; not fall in love with one or two colleges,&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; follow directions precisely&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; and make sure to click the "submit" button.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt; Rudeness towards staff members, feigning enthusiasm, and being pretentious are other turnoffs reported by admissions officers.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt; There is strong consensus among counselors and advisors that starting the college search early is vital. One recommends starting early in the twelfth grade;&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; another suggests that even this is too late, and that the process should begin during the eleventh grade and summer before twelfth grade.&lt;ref name=twsL23&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; And sources suggest that students who begin the process earlier tend to earn more acceptance letters.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; Another advantage of beginning early is so that applications can be proofread for mistakes.&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt; Advisors suggest that emails should be sent to specific persons in the admissions office, not to a generalized inbox.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt; Advisors suggest that applicants sending in paper applications should take care that handwriting is legible, particularly email addresses.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt; Advisors counsel that mistakes or changes should be explained somewhere in the application; for example, an adviser at [[Grinnell College]] suggested that a record need not be perfect but there must be an "explanation for any significant blip."&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; Advisors suggest that applicants should "own up to any bad behavior" such as suspensions since schools are "dutybound to report them", and suggest that a person should "accept responsibility and show contrition for "lessons learned," according to one view.&lt;ref name=twsL44/&gt;{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=137}} Disciplinary actions are usually reported to the colleges by the high school as a matter of course. Advisors suggest that the application should help a student position themselves to create a unique picture.&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; It helps, according to one advisor, if a person knows himself or herself, because that enables an applicant to communicate effectively with a prospective school.&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt; A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2016 suggested that some universities were considering changing their admissions guidelines to be more inclusive of less affluent applicants, to put less emphasis on standardized test and AP scores, and to put more emphasis on determining "which students' community-service projects are heartfelt and which are merely window dressing"; the report suggested that college admissions policies were often "cited as a culprit in sleep deprivation, anxiety and depression among students."&lt;ref name=twsNYT7&gt;Frank Bruni, January 19, 2016, The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/opinion/rethinking-college-admissions.html?_r=0 Rethinking College Admissions], Accessed January 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsWashPost5&gt;Lisa Heffernan and Jennifer Wallace, January 20, 2016, The Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2016/01/20/to-get-into-college-harvard-report-advocates-for-kindness-instead-of-overachieving/?tid=sm_fb To get into college, Harvard report advocates for kindness instead of overachieving], Retrieved January 20, 2016, "...Parents, educators and college administrators have long wrestled with the unintended negative side effects ... intense focus on personal achievement and the unfair advantages of more affluent students...."&lt;/ref&gt;

===International applications===

===Overview===
Colleges use a variety of methods to evaluate applicants. One source noted that four of every five colleges accept more than half of all applicants, and three-fourths of students who apply to colleges are accepted by their first choice college.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=3}} Depending on the size and values of the school, admissions criteria can vary from being almost entirely formulaic to involving significant subjective judgment regarding the student's "fit" for the institution.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Q84567/&gt; Criteria vary considerably by school, and one view is that the "great deal of inconsistency across institutions" sometimes gave an incorrect impression that "student selection is arbitrary."&lt;ref name=twsMay2Q84567/&gt; Criteria include standardized test scores (generally [[ACT (test)|ACT]] and/or [[SAT]]), class rank, grades (as shown in the high school [[Transcript (education)|transcript]]), degree of extracurricular involvement, and leadership potential. One report suggested that the most important criteria, in order of importance, were
# Grades in college preparatory courses
# Strength of curriculum
# Grades in all courses
# Class rank&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt;
Many colleges also rely on personal essay(s) written by the applicant and letters of recommendation written by the applicant's teachers and [[guidance counselor]]. One principal benefit of the essay lies in its ability to further differentiate students who have perfect or near-perfect grades and test scores. Institutions place different weight on these criteria: for example, [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|some schools]] do not require or even accept the [[SAT]]s for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unigo.com/get-to-college/college-search/test-optional-colleges-10-colleges-that-dont-require-sat-or-act-scores|title=10 colleges that don't require SAT or ACT scores|last=Unigo.com|first=Author:|date=2018-07-13|work=Unigo.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that some factors are beyond a student's control, such as a college's need in a given year for [[Affirmative action|diversity]], [[Legacy preferences|legacy applicants]], or [[Recruiting (college athletics)|athletic recruiting]].&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt;

It is a complicated task for admissions staff at selective colleges to analyze and process thousands of applications with a "huge mail deluge" since there are often six pieces of mail for each applicant, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the application itself.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=104}} However, electronic transmission of documents has eased this burden at most colleges. Regardless, high volumes of applications mean that college admissions personnel spend less time on average reading each particular application; in 2009, the average admissions officer was responsible for analyzing 514 applications, and officers have experienced an upward trend in the number of applications they must read over time.&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt; A typical college application receives only about 25 minutes of reading time, including three to five minutes for the personal essay if it is read.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=6}} Advisors suggest that an understanding of the criteria can help an applicant apply to colleges with greater success. Some colleges extract information from the federal [[FAFSA]] financial aid form, including names of other schools the applicant is applying to.&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt; Counselors urge students and parents to understand what types of things colleges tend to look for in applications, and plan accordingly. A key attribute admissions evaluators look for, according to Mamlet and Vandevelde, is ''authenticity''—a real person who comes through the application, not a packaged artificial entity{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=15}} or distortion crafted to impress an admissions officer.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R214/&gt; An admissions officer at [[Vanderbilt University]] wrote about how their office evaluates applicants: "It's really about, 'What did I take advantage of in the environment I was given.'"&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; Several reports suggested that colleges were not looking for the "well-rounded kid"&lt;ref name=twsL42&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather a "well-rounded class":{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=71}}{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=42}}

{{Quote|Colleges are looking for ... the well-rounded class. Colleges put together their entering class as a mosaic: a few great scholars for each academic department; a handful of athletes; some musicians, dancers, and theater stars; a few for racial and economic diversity; some potential club leaders, etc. Colleges want a kid who is devoted to – and excels at – something. The word they most often use is passion.|Steve Cohen in ''The Washington Post'', 2011&lt;ref name=twsL24/&gt;}}

{{Quote|Colleges want students who have demonstrated through their actions an ability to see and connect with a world that is larger than they are.|Robin Mamlet and Christine Vandevelde, 2011{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=69}}}}

Results for admissions decisions for selected colleges are posted in the adjacent table.

====Statistical analysis====
There are numerous reports that colleges use proprietary mathematical algorithms as part of their process for evaluating applications. Some colleges hire statistical experts known as "enrollment consultants" to help them predict enrollment by developing [[computer model]]s to select applicants in such a way as to maximize [[Yield (college admissions)|yield]] and acceptance rates.&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt; Some of these models take into account factors such as an applicant's "zip code, religion, first-choice major and extracurricular interests, as well as academic performance".&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt; Colleges have been reported to have mathematical algorithms that recalculate an applicant's high school [[grade point average]] by weighing different course grades by factors such as perceived course difficulty and strength of high school curriculum. This helps the college come up with a revised GPA number for a student to compare against applicants from other schools. Furthermore, many colleges track how well other students from the same high school have done—that is, applicants from the same high school who attended or are attending the college—by comparing their high school grades against their college grades, and admissions officers use this data to try to estimate the likely college grade performance of a given applicant. Generally admissions departments do not reveal the particulars of such mathematical analyses. According to Michele Hernandez, Ivy League admissions departments compile an ''academic index'' based on three main factors:
* Highest SAT Reasoning Math/Critical Reading score
* Average of three highest SAT Subject tests
* Converted rank score based on grades, class rank, and high school difficulty{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=66–71}}
In her view, two-thirds of this evaluation is based on tests, while only one third is based on grades, leading her to conclude at one point that grades were less important overall as a factor than test scores,{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=66–71}} while in a different chapter she also suggested that the high school transcript information described roughly 60% of the college's perception of a student's academic performance.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=146}} Next, the composite ''academic index'' score was combined with an analysis of personal factors such as extracurricular activity or the essay, such that the academic factor was weighted 70% to 85% while the personal evaluation was weighted only 30% to 15%.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=66–71}} Generally the particulars of the mathematical formulas are not revealed to the public,{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=66–71}} and different colleges have different formulas. Part of the purpose of algorithms is to expedite the handling of thousands of applications in a short amount of time. For example, at [[Dartmouth College]], data goes into a ''master card'' for each application, which leads to a ''ready sheet'', where readers summarize applications; then, an initial screening is done: top applications go directly to the director of admissions for approval while lackluster ones go to another director.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=110–111}} Dartmouth uses "A" for accept, "R" for reject, "P" for possible, with "P+" and "P-" being variants.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=110–111}} A committee might spend a week with the "P" ones, of which they only accept about a sixth, according to Hernandez.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=110–111}}

====Analysis of grades====
The consensus view is that high school grades are probably the single most important factor in winning admission.&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; Maintaining high grades is particularly important for the fall semester of twelfth grade, as well as winter grades if applying by regular admission,&lt;ref name=twsL27/&gt; and there is a report that colleges are paying greater attention to a student's grades throughout twelfth grade.&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt; Particularly important is academic performance in core courses,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=57}} and having a high grade point average based on good grades in AP-level or honors courses.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R211/&gt; Colleges evaluate applicants often by examining how a student has successfully exploited what a high school has had to offer.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=41}}&lt;ref&gt;Note: quoting William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; High school guidance counselor Erin Day of [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]] in [[New Jersey]] suggested that of the top five criteria for getting into college, having good grades were first, second, and third most important overall (test scores were fourth, extracurricular activities and essay were fifth).&lt;ref&gt;Note: from a speech given in October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal academic record is one of increasingly better grades in courses of progressive difficulty.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=53}} Hernandez wrote that colleges looked for patterns with both grades and test scores; high grades with low test scores suggested a hard-working student, but high test scores with low grades suggested a picture of a lazy student.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=146}} Ninth grade grades generally do not count much,&lt;ref name=twsMay2R211/&gt; but trends are important—an upward trend in grades was a positive factor, a decline a negative one.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=146}} Public universities are more likely to evaluate applicants based on grades and test scores alone, while private universities tend to be more "holistic" and consider other measures, according to one view.{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=13}}

==== ACT and SAT scores ====
The consensus view is that these are important, although Mamlet and VanDeVelde feel the scores "don't count as much as people think they do."&lt;ref name=twsMay2R214/&gt; There are many reports that admissions departments consider only the highest test results in different test subsections, sometimes called ''superscore'' results or ''superscoring'',&lt;ref name=twsOctO2012uiuy&gt;{{cite news

===Personal evaluation===

====Athletic ability====
[[File:BenhabernHS.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Athletes in popular sports such as [[American football|football]] are recruited by colleges hoping to improve their athletic programs.]]

A survey of admissions officers revealed that 28% agreed that their school had accepted athletes despite having lower grades and test scores than others.&lt;ref name=twsL22/&gt; A survey by the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' found that schools with strong athletics departments tended to have athletes with lower [[SAT]] scores than non-athletic students.&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt; Athletes get better treatment even at elite colleges, according to one academic study.&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt; A report suggested that some applications by athletes go first to a special committee for review by coaches, who may then, in turn, advocate for particular players.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt; Recruited athletes who play in-demand or "revenue" sports (i.e. generate ticket sales) such as [[American football|football]]&lt;ref name=tws2T19&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[basketball]] can have a "significantly greater advantage in admissions" than others.&lt;ref name=twsL37/&gt;{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=155}} Some Ivy League coaches, seeking to improve the average academic performance of their teams, would admit mediocre athletes with top academic skills as a means to balance out the stellar athletes with below-average academic ability. To fix this "average score" arrangement in which there had been a temptation to admit an extremely poor student with great athletic ability, many schools went to a ''banding'' arrangement. For example, coaches would consider all wrestling applicants within a specified range or ''band'' of academic performance, and coaches could admit more wrestler-applicants who showed greater scholastic promise.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Chuuy&gt;{{cite news

{{Quote|We often talk with highly involved athletes who have little time for other activities outside of their sports. In many cases their grades suffer. Most student-athletes are not "recruited" to colleges, but colleges will respect their commitment and drive.|Howard and Matthew Greene, 2003&lt;ref name=twsMay2S213/&gt;}}

====Particular skills====
Some colleges are more likely to admit students with in-demand skills, such as writing, debating, theater management, science competitions, organizational skills, musical skills, and so forth.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=155}}

====Personal initiative====
[[File:David Hogg at the Rally to Support Firearm Safety Legislation in Fort Lauderdale.jpg|thumb|right|Parkland student activist [[David Hogg (activist)|David Hogg]] demonstrated initiative in helping to organize and lead the [[Never Again MSD]] student-led campaign against [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] yet his applications were still rejected by four California schools: [[UCLA]], [[UCSD]], [[UCSB]] and [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]].&lt;ref name=twsMercury444&gt;Mercury News, Pueng Vongs, March 27, 2018, [https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/27/uc-schools-reject-march-for-our-lives-leader-david-hogg/ UC schools reject March For Our Lives leader David Hogg], Retrieved March 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Admissions personnel look favorably on applications where it is clear that the student, himself or herself, appears to be firmly in control over the whole application process; the appearance of pushy parents or coaching can have a dampening effect. Ideally it is best if the student, himself or herself, is in charge of organizing the college search and decision-making process; the "student must be in the driver's seat".{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=9}} One admissions dean explained:{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=42}} And admissions officers are turned off by "micromanaging parents".&lt;ref name=twsMay2Pfjk/&gt;

Accordingly, it has been advised to become knowledgeable about schools being applied to, and "tailor each application accordingly."&lt;ref name=twsL27/&gt; College visits (including overnight ones),{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=121}} interviews, attending College Fair days,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=121}} comments in the essay, contacting college faculty members, answering and opening emails,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=121}}&lt;ref&gt;Note: colleges can tell whether emails are opened or not by a prospective student.&lt;/ref&gt; place position of the college on the FAFSA form or its [[FAFSA position]],&lt;ref name=Rivard/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSNews1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyFinance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: admissions officers can see all colleges applied to that are listed on the FAFSA form, and there are reports that some colleges interpret being first or second on the FAFSA list as a sign of demonstrated interest&lt;/ref&gt; and other indications of interest can be a factor for many colleges concerned about their [[Yield (college admissions)|yield]]—the percent of students who accept an offer of enrollment.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt; According to Andover's college counseling director Sean Logan, it is important to have numerous contact points with colleges to show demonstrated interest: visiting, phone contact, emailing, visits to websites (including number of clicks as well as length of time on the website), whether a college visit included a tour and interview, and whether a college-recommended off-campus personal interview was done.&lt;ref name=tws3afa/&gt; Schools such as [[Connecticut College]] and [[Emory University]] have been credited as "popularizing the yield game" by refusing well-qualified students who failed to show much real interest in attending, as a way to boost their yield scores.&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt; One top high school student was waitlisted at a "likely" college&lt;ref&gt;Note: "likely" meant there was an estimated 80% chance of acceptance by the college&lt;/ref&gt; for showing lack of interest:

{{Quote|We assumed they weren't coming, because we didn't have much contact from them. We know they're probably using us as a back-up and they haven't done much to show any sincere interest, so we decided to waitlist them.|Andover college counseling director Sean Logan, remembering a comment from a college admissions director.&lt;ref name=tws3afa/&gt;}}

====Active participation====
[[File:Students wrestling 05.jpg|thumb|alt=Two wrestlers.|Students with special skills such as [[wrestling]] may be given preferential treatment.]]

One report suggested that colleges seek students who will be actively involved on campus and not spend every day studying alone.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=55}} As a result, they look for high school teacher recommendations that suggest active classroom participation, students who speak up in class, who ask questions.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=56, 57}}

====Weeding out problem people====
Admissions tries to screen out difficult people.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=69–82}} According to Dunbar, many colleges are "afraid of aggression." He recommends avoiding "harsh humor" or signs of severe emotion, anger, or aggression.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=69–82}} Admissions evaluators look for signals that might indicate a difficult person, such as nonconstructive or disrespectful criticisms of others, or evidence of [[substance abuse]].{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=69–82}} Colleges try to weed out dependent people who either follow their parents too closely, or do only what the "cool kids" do. Dunbar advised that "parental control of any kind, if detected, can be very damaging," and advised that students should not appear to be controlled by parental whims.{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|pp=97–109}}

====Analysis of essays====
[[File:BakerLibrary.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a college building with steeple.|[[Dartmouth College]] admissions, according to Michele Hernandez, spends a week examining the ''possibles'' or Ps, and after much deliberation, accepts perhaps a sixth of them.]]

Michele Hernandez suggested that almost all admissions essays were weak, cliche-ridden, and "not worth reading".{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–136}}&lt;ref&gt;An admissions staffer at Gettysburg College (who requested to remain anonymous) agreed most application essays were boring.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff gets thousands of essays and have to wade through most of them.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–131}} When she worked as an admissions director at Dartmouth, she noticed that most essays were only read for three minutes.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–136}} Some too-common essay types were the "outward bound" essay about how a person discovered their inner grit while hiking tough mountains, or the "community service" essay about how a student discovered, while working among disadvantaged peoples, that "all persons were the same".{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–136}} Admissions officers seek to learn how a person thinks, what kind of person they are, and their level of intellectual promise.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–136}} Essays are generally important only in borderline cases.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=130–131}}

===Other factors===
One report was that at [[Ivy League]] universities, 40% of students were so-called "special cases" including student-athletes, minorities, low-income, legacies, and development cases, and that admissions standards were typically lowered for these groups.&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt;

====Ability to pay====
While there is general agreement that chances for admission are higher for students who are prepared to pay the full price, there are indications that this has been even more prevalent in the past few years given economic uncertainty and rising college costs,&lt;ref name=twsL32&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington University]], despite claiming to have [[need blind admissions]], was more likely to waitlist financially needy applicants, according to one report.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Diamond (journalist)|Jeremy Diamond]], Sarah Ferris, October 21, 2013, The GW Hatchet, [http://www.gwhatchet.com/2013/10/21/gw-misrepresented-admissions-and-financial-aid-policy-for-years/ GW misrepresented admissions and financial aid policy for years], Accessed December 13, 2013, "...&amp;nbsp;Administrators now say the admissions process has always factored in financial need. But that contradicts messaging from the admissions and financial aid offices that, as recently as Saturday, have regularly attested that the University remained need-blind&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; One view was that financial aid depends on how a specific student compares with other students:

{{Quote|What this means is that your financial aid package from a reach college may not be as attractive as the package from one of your target, or well matched, colleges. If you are looking for generous scholarship aid, you need to look at colleges and universities where your academic profile is strong compared to that of the average admitted student.|Hannah Serota, college counselor&lt;ref name=twsMay2R115/&gt;}}

By contrast, other schools practice [[need-blind admission]], such as Ivy League Universities, but there are exceptions. A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that [[Donald Trump|Trump]] advisor and son-in-law [[Jared Kushner]] gained admission to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] after his father promised a $2.5 million gift.&lt;ref name=twsNYT484848&gt;The New York Times, November 20, 2016, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/us/politics/jared-kushner-donald-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news The In-law in the Trump Inner Circle: Jared Kushner's steadying hand], Retrieved November 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographic diversity====
One view was that state schools strive to admit students from "all parts of a state,"&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt; which suggests that applicants who live farther away from a given school had a better chance of admission. But a contrary view was that geographic location of the applicant matters perhaps only slightly, if at all; Hernandez looked at acceptance ratios to Dartmouth for different geographic locations, and found that geographic distance was not a factor influencing admittances.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=209–210}}

====Legacy applicants====
{{main|Legacy preferences}}
There are differing views about how important it is to have a family member or relative who also attended a college. It is clear that it is a factor; one report suggested that having a family member who is an alumnus gives "a leg up" for applicants.&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt;{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=121–122}} One report suggested that siblings do not count as legacies.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=121–122}} In some cases, a parent's attendance at a related graduate school counts as a legacy, but most colleges do not count this.{{sfn|Hernandez|2009|pp=121–122}} Many selective private colleges have a higher admit rate for alumni children as a way to "keep the larger set of alumni happy and giving", and being a legacy applicant can mean as much as "100 or 200 points on the SAT".&lt;ref name=tws2T25&gt;{{cite news

Legacy admissions have had a history of controversy; [[economist]] Peter Sacks criticized the practice of legacy admissions as a "social reproduction process" in which "elite institutions have an implicit bargain with their alumni ... 'You give us money, and we will move your kid to the front of the line.'"&lt;ref name=twsL37&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= December 12, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another agreed that legacies perpetuated a "hereditary aristocracy".&lt;ref name=tws2T25/&gt; But an opposing view is that all colleges, to varying extents, make choices as part of the admissions process, including state schools that charge in-state residents (with taxpaying parents) a lower rate than out-of-state residents, and it was argued that there was not really much difference between taxpaying parents contributing to a state school as well as generous alumni contributing to a private school—both with the possibility that it will help their offspring get into college.&lt;ref name=twsL37/&gt; Consultant Donald Dunbar suggested that admitting legacies encourages future donations, and in turn these incoming money flows help the school subsidize the education of more minority students;{{sfn|Dunbar|2007|p=166}} another source suggested that alumni gifts was important in helping a college pay for need-blind programs.&lt;ref name=tws2T25/&gt; Legacy admissions was criticized by Daniel Golden in his book ''The Price of Admission'' in which elite schools gave "heavy preferences to the wealthy", according to essayist Neal Gabler in the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref name=twsMay2R113/&gt;

====Family wealth====
{{main|Development case}}
In certain cases, family wealth of applicants is considered, based on potential to make a substantial donation&lt;ref name=tws2ZG315/&gt; to the school (above and beyond paying tuition, and separate from considerations such as ability or fame). Such candidates are known as [[development case]]s, and are intended to bolster the finances of the university, especially to its further mission. The practice is not widely discussed by universities that use it, but is reported to be used by a number of top-ranked schools, Ivy League and otherwise, and has been associated with [[Duke University]] (which acknowledges its use) and [[Brown University]] (which does not comment), especially since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal connections====
Counselors and admissions directors tend to agree that in a few selected cases, connections were important. A report based on a survey of admissions directors suggested that "whom you know does matter", since higher-level administrators and prominent alumni and trustees can exert pressure on the admissions departments to admit certain applicants.&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt;

===Other considerations===
There was a report that more colleges are resorting to computerized fact-checking software, as well as anti-plagiarism tools such as [[Turnitin]], which checks documents for unoriginal content on the web,&lt;ref name=twsMayO112/&gt; possibly as a response to well-publicized scandals in which a student won admission to Harvard University by fraudulent means.&lt;ref name=twsMayO113&gt;{{cite news

==Acceptances and rejections==
[[File:Lafayette College admissions department waitlist letter.jpg|thumb|Colleges use waitlists to hedge their bets, uncertain about how many accepted students will say yes, and to draw applicants from the waitlist when vacancies open. In addition, waitlists allow colleges to target acceptance letters to students likely to attend to maintain the college's selectivity ranking and [[Yield (college admissions)|yield]].]]

===Notifications===
Students are usually notified of a college's decision in April, sometimes in the last two weeks of March, unless they had applied using an early approach, and are usually notified by email,{{sfn|Mamlet|2011|p=9}} although some colleges still send "fat" envelopes (usually an acceptance) or "thin" envelopes (usually a rejection).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications that the percentage of students who say "yes" to an offer of admission (the [[Yield (college admissions)|yield]]) has been declining, from 49 percent in 2001 to 43 percent in 2009.&lt;ref name=tws2P315/&gt; Admitted students may also be awarded financial aid. There are two kinds of financial aid: need-based aid, awarded entirely on the financial specifics of the student's family, and merit-based aid, given to students judged to show exceptional academic promise. Several reports confirm that accepted students who are dissatisfied with an aid offer should contact the college to see if the offer can be improved.&lt;ref name=twsMay2Q848/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws3L111/&gt; International students who have been accepted should complete an [[I-20 (form)|I-20]] form.&lt;ref name=twsMayO214&gt;{{cite news

===Wait list considerations===
About half of colleges use a wait list, particularly those that accept fewer than half of all applications.&lt;ref name=twsMayO211/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws3JanN113/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: figure for Fall 2010 admission cycle was 48% of colleges using wait lists.&lt;/ref&gt; Since students on average tend to be sending out more applications, colleges have been having a tougher time knowing for certain whether the students to whom they have offered admission will, in fact, attend in the fall. Some of the uncertainty is related to the phenomenon of students applying to more and more schools, sometimes 15 or more, to increase their chances in a statistical sense, but this adds a new layer of guesswork for colleges trying to predict how many accepted students will say yes,&lt;ref name=twsL31/&gt; and puts waitlisted students in "limbo"&lt;ref name=twsZe21&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that some students, even ones who have sent in a deposit, will not show up in the fall, and melt away, and this "melt percentage" can be as high as 5% to 10% of persons who have paid a deposit.

{{Quote|The admission process is a complicated dance of supply and demand for colleges. And this spring, many institutions have accepted fewer applicants, and placed more on waiting lists, until it becomes clear over the next few weeks how many spots remain.|Jacques Steinberg in ''The New York Times'', April 2010&lt;ref name=twsL31/&gt;}}

As a result, colleges use wait lists as a hedge to make sure they have enough students in the fall. Some schools "under-invite" applicants in the regular admissions season to appear highly selective and then about-face and accept them from their wait lists later.&lt;ref name=twsMayO111/&gt; One report is that [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] gets a tenth of their first-year class from the wait list.&lt;ref name=twsMayO111/&gt; But it varies from college to college and from year to year. For example, in 2010 [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] wait-listed 1,000 students while [[Duke University|Duke]] wait-listed 3,000 students.&lt;ref name=twsZe21/&gt; Overall, one survey suggested that 30% of wait-listed students are eventually accepted,&lt;ref name=twsZe21/&gt; but this is an average figure for all wait-listed students, and the percentage is dramatically lower at elite or prestigious schools. There is a report suggesting that in recent years, the lists are more fluid than in previous years, in the sense that there is more wait list activity—which have become more of a safety net for colleges rather than students.&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt; Estimates vary about how many college applicants find themselves on a wait list; one report was that 10% of applicants were wait-listed.&lt;ref name="twsZe19"/&gt;

One adviser suggested that students who are wait-listed "work the wait list" by staying in touch with the admissions office to make sure they know the student will attend if accepted,&lt;ref name=twsL25/&gt; and possibly take steps such as forwarding new grades and making a subsequent college visit,&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; or send a one-page letter or 60-second video describing a strong desire to attend and the reasons.&lt;ref name=twsL31/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsZe22"/&gt; A former dean of admissions at [[Franklin and Marshall College]] suggests that students not view the wait list letter as a "polite denial" but rather as a possible opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; A second report in 2011 confirmed this, and it suggested that private colleges without "billion-dollar endowments or 40,000 applicants" were finding that the period from May to the start of classes in fall was a time of uncertainty, with many institutions seeking new applicants, and unsure how many of the applicants that had promised to attend would, in fact, show up in the fall.&lt;ref name=twsL15&gt;{{cite news

Companies who employ the student after his education, the company gets a well-trained employee. The student develops both hard and soft skills. The student develops under real conditions, getting an earlier look at what the work entails, earning money in the process.

'''Credential evaluation''' is the way in which academic and professional degrees earned in one country are compared to those earned in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Credential Evaluation?|url=http://www.wes.org/licensing/whatiscredential.asp|website=World Education Services|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities, colleges and employers around the world use [[credential]] evaluations to understand foreign education and to judge applicants for admission or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining a Credential Evaluation|url=http://www.globaltalentbridge.org/evaluation/howitworks.asp|website=Global Talent Bridge|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigrants]] can use credential evaluations to gain recognition for study completed outside the country they are immigrating to and in doing so join the workforce as skilled immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credential Evaluation|url=http://www.globaltalentbridge.org/evaluation/|website=Global Talent Bridge|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International student]]s use credential evaluations to present their previous coursework and grades to universities anywhere for admission.

'''Credential Evaluation in the United States'''

Universities and colleges in the [[United States]] saw a marked increase in the number of international students applying for admission after [[World War II]] when many European countries were recovering from the war.The need for an accurate and fair understanding of students’ educational past emerged and became even more important as the number of international students studying in the United States jumped from 25,000 in the years after the war, according to [[NAFSA: Association of International Educators|NAFSA]]. There were over 866,000 international students studying in the United States in 2013 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Atlas|url=http://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/United-States|website=Institute of International Education|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As universities face declining public financial support and the pressure to keep tuition affordable, academic institutions have relied on international students to offset the rising cost of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Miriam|title=International Students Stream Into U.S. Colleges|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/international-students-stream-into-u-s-colleges-1427248801|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of international students in the United States are from [[China]], [[India]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choudaha|first1=Rahul|title=Beyond More of the Same: The Top Four Emerging Markets for International Student Recruitment|url=http://wenr.wes.org/2012/10/wenr-october-2012-beyond-more-of-the-same-top-four-emerging-markets-for-international-student-recruitment/|website=WENR: World Education News and Reviews|publisher=World Education Services|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a large and steady growth in the number of international students from [[Brazil]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fang|first1=Yuanyuan|last2=Roy|first2=Megha|last3=Ortiz|first3=Alejandro A.|title=Top Emerging Markets for International Student Recruitment|url=http://wenr.wes.org/2015/05/top-emerging-markets-international-student-recruitment/|website=WENR: World Education News and Reviews|publisher=World Education Services|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no federal (national) government agency that oversees credential evaluations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognition of Foreign Qualifications|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-visitus-forrecog.html|website=U.S. Department of Education|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are professional associations such as [http://aice-eval.org/ Association of International Credential Evaluators, Inc.] (AICE) and [http://www.naces.org/ National Association of Credential Evaluation Services] (NACES) that create and maintain ethical standards in the field though they are not governing agencies and membership by credential evaluators is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluating Credentials|url=https://www.state.gov/m/dghr/flo/125147.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, credential evaluators must meet certain criteria to belong to AICE and NACES. Universities and colleges also evaluate credentials themselves.

'''Credential Evaluation in Canada'''

Educational credential assessment (ECA) also known as credential evaluation can be used for immigration, education and licensing.&lt;ref name="CIC.GC.CA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Have Your Education Assessed - Skilled Immigrants (Express Entry)|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assessment.asp|website=Citizenship and Immigration Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ECA is necessary for immigrants seeking entry into [[Canada]] under various [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] (CIC) programs, including the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FWSP) through Express Entry, which requires immigrants to have completed a minimum equivalent of a Canadian [[secondary school]] diploma.&lt;ref name="CIC.GC.CA"/&gt; The Canadian government does not assess foreign credentials. Instead as of April 2013, the CIC has designated seven [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assessment.asp credential evaluation agencies] to provide assessments for those immigrating to Canada. These designated agencies are members of the Alliance of Credential Evaluation Services of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliance of Credential Evaluation Services Canada|url=http://canalliance.org/index.en.stm|website=ACESC: Alliance of Credential Evaluation Services of Canada|accessdate=24 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811213058/http://canalliance.org/index.en.stm|archivedate=11 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Canadian licensing boards or professional licensing bodies require academic credential evaluations from internationally educated professionals. The evaluations are assessed in-house or by Alliance members.

'''Credential Evaluation in Europe'''

The Convention on the Recognition of the Qualifications Concerning Higher Education in the European Region, commonly called the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]], is the main legal agreement which governs the recognition of qualifications between the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], excluding [[Greece]] and [[Monaco]].&lt;ref name="The Lisbon Recognition Convention"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lisbon Recognition Convention|url=http://www.enic-naric.net/the-lisbon-recognition-convention.aspx|website=Enic-Naric|publisher=European Network of Information Centres in the European Region and National Academic Recognition Information Centres in the European Union|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Network of Information Centres]] and the National Academic Recognition Information Centres (known as ENIC-NARIC) can evaluate credentials and issue a “statement of comparability” for a university degree earned in one member country for use in another.&lt;ref name="Recognition of Academic Diplomas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognition of Academic Diplomas|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/education/university/recognition/index_en.htm|website=Europa.eu|publisher=European Union|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention states that degree holders must have access to “adequate assessments” of their credentials and degrees must be recognized among member countries unless there are proven “substantial differences” between the degrees awarded in that country and the degree being assessed.&lt;ref name="The Lisbon Recognition Convention"/&gt;

'''Credential Evaluation in Australia'''

The [[Australian government]] evaluates foreign credentials depending on the reason for the evaluation.&lt;ref name="Qualifications Recognition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualifications Recognition|url=https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Services-And-Resources/Pages/Qualifications-Recognition.aspx|website=Department of Education and Training|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an evaluation is needed only for immigration purposes the [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] will assess qualifications.&lt;ref name="Qualifications Recognition"/&gt; There are designated assessing authorities for specific professions, such as the Australian Institute For Teaching and School Leadership which assesses credentials for school teacher occupations.&lt;ref name="Australian Government"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualification and Skills Recognition|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/education-and-training/qualifications-and-skills-recognition|website=Information and Services|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most other credential assessments, Overseas Qualifications Units were established in most Australian states and territories to evaluate foreign credentials.&lt;ref name="Australian Government"/&gt; The [[Department of Education and Training (Australia)|Department of Education and Training]] can also assess credentials for foreign-born residents of [[New South Wales]] and credentials for occupations that do not require registration, licensing, or professional membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualification Assessment|url=https://internationaleducation.gov.au/services-and-resources/services-for-individuals/qualifications-assessments/pages/qualification-assessment.aspx|website=Department of Education and Training|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Credential Evaluation in the Middle East'''

The Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab States was held in 1978 to “adopt terminology and evaluation criteria as similar as possible… in order to simplify the application of a system which will ensure the comparability of credits, subjects of study and diplomas” and to encourage student mobility across borders.&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab States 1978|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13517&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen states signed the convention including [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], [[Qatar]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

'''Types of Credential Evaluations'''

Generally the types of credential evaluations vary depending on the country and purpose of the evaluation. The ENIC-NARIC offers full equivalency or comparable reports.&lt;ref name="Recognition of Academic Diplomas"/&gt; In the United States and Canada credential evaluations range from detailed course-by-course analysis to document-by-document analysis depending on the admissions requirements of a particular school or the requirements for employment and immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why should I get my international educational credentials evaluated?|url=http://settlement.org/ontario/education/evaluate-my-credentials/credential-evaluation/why-should-i-get-my-international-educational-credentials-evaluated/#tips|website=Settlement.Org: Information Newcomers Can Trust|publisher=Settlement.org|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While academic and professional institutions may use credential evaluations to assess candidates’ qualifications, the institution decides whether a candidates credentials meet their requirements for admission.

A {{nihongo|'''dialect card'''|lead=yes|方言札|hōgen fuda}} was a system of punishment used in Japanese regional schools in the post-[[Meiji period]] to promote standard speech. It was modelled after similar policies in Europe, {{citation needed span|text=particularly the French ''[[Vergonha]]''.|date=September 2016}}

During the [[Edo period]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] most Japanese people could not travel outside of their home [[Han system|domain]]. As a result, regional [[Japanese dialects]] were relatively isolated and became increasingly distinct. After the [[Meiji Restoration]] the government, in emulation of the European nation states, sought to create a standard Japanese speech. A [[Tokyo dialect]], specifically that of the upper-class [[Yamanote and Shitamachi|Yamanote area]] became the model for [[Standard language|Standard]] Japanese, widely used in schools, publishing, and radio broadcasting. By the early twentieth century, the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] and other authorities instituted various policies to reduce or suppress regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Nanette|title=Language and Society in Japan|year=2005|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Hogen fuda was most prominent in the [[Tōhoku region|Tōhoku]], [[Kyushu]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]] (including [[Okinawa]]) as they are geographically and linguistically most distant from the Tokyo dialect. The issue is most prominent in regard to [[Ryukyuan languages]] as there are groups, such as the [[Kariyushi Club]], which advocate the languages to be officially recognised by the Japanese government as a language (and Ryukyu as a nation). {{citation needed span|text=While many mainland regional "dialects" in Japanese are also unintelligible and at least the [[Tsugaru dialect|Tsugaru "dialect"]] in north is considered just as distinct as Ryukyuan, there is no movement in mainland Japan for regional dialects to be recognised as languages.|date=December 2016}}

In Okinawa, the card was initially voluntarily adopted by Okinawan students at the start of the 20th century, but became mandatory as assimilation policies increased following 1917. A student who spoke [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] would be forced to wear the card, until another student also spoke in Okinawan, and then it would pass to the new transgressor, with the student wearing it at the end of the school day punished by the teachers.&lt;ref name="NoguchiFotos2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Goebel Noguchi|author2=Sandra Fotos|title=Studies in Japanese Bilingualism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDBCqwLfp8UC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=9 June 2012|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-490-8|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tipton1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elise K.

=== Academic and administrative positions ===
Ekundayo is a member of several professional bodies including [[Nigerian Institute of Architects]], [[African Union of Architects]] and [[American Institute of Planners]]. Ekundayo started his lecturing career at [[Ahmadu Bello University]] in 1969, where he rose through the ranks to become the dean of faculty of environmental design in 1976.

=== Publications ===
In a 2008 study titled ''Meaning and Relevance in Nigerian Traditional Architecture: The Dialectics of growth and Change'', Adeyemi attempted to correct the misconception that Africans dwelled in "unstructured, isolated bush communities with little appreciation of the aesthetics in town design" by providing understandings on what shaped the ancient traditional architectures of buildings across the main ethnic groups in Nigeria, while providing insight and an holistic view on African buildings of old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/1367/1/Prof%20Adeyemi's%20Public%20Lecture%2012.pdf |title=Meaning and Relevance in Nigerian Traditional Architecture: The Dialectics of growth and Change |date=April 24, 2008 |website=Covenant University Press |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper titled ''Characteristics of Early Ecclesiastical Architecture in Lagos State in Nigeria'' by Adeyemi in ''Journal for Cultural and Design Studies'' noted that the period between early 1850s till the late 1920s started a major structural era in the kind of buildings designed in Nigeria. The study analyzed the five most important Christian facilities that was built during the period, while taking into consideration their distinctive properties. The findings from the publication was that the buildings were designed with minimal inputs, ideas and comments from nationals and the mechanism employed has changed over the years from what is being used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/2892/#.WiFy01WnHIV |title=Characteristics of Early Ecclesiastical Architecture in Lagos State in Nigeria |last=Patricia |first=Nwokealisi |date=November 3, 2014 |website=[[Covenant University]] |access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gheorghe Moceanu''' (1838&amp;ndash;1909) was a Transylvanian, later Romanian physical education teacher who laid the foundations for the discipline in his adopted country.

Born in [[Iclod|Orman]], [[Cluj County]], in [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Transylvania]], he attended high school in [[Gherla]] and [[Blaj]] prior to studying pedagogics in [[Budapest]] and gymnastics at [[Vienna]]. Unable to make a living in his native province, he crossed the Carpathians into the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] in 1862.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b"&gt;Bocu, Vidu, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated according to the system of [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]], which emphasized collective exercises meant to regenerate the nation's physical vigor. Until he finished training the first students capable of carrying on his work, he was Romania's only gymnastics master, with other classes being taught by junior army officers or firemen. He laid the foundations for physical education in Romania, teaching at [[Bucharest]]'s [[Matei Basarab National College (Bucharest)|Matei Basarab]] and [[Saint Sava National College|Saint Sava]] high schools, as well as at [[Craiova]]'s [[Carol I National College|Carol I High School]].&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; He also introduced gymnastics education to the army,&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; leading classes at the officers' school and, from 1868, at the Romanian Society for Arms, Gymnastics and Target Shooting.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; He designed curricula and organized competitions between schools.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

Moceanu wrote a dozen books, the first appearing in 1869.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; These were intended to popularize and explain gymnastics exercises, received favorable reviews and drew interest from prominent cultural figures such as [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]].&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; Together with [[Carol Davila]], he founded the ''Micii dorobanți'' youth movement, which sought the physical development and military training of youth, as well as the awakening of national consciousness. Other collaborators included [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]] and [[V. A. Urechia]], while King [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] expressed support.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; Moceanu strongly advocated for the introduction of physical education into girls' schools, his chief argument being that a sickly mother could only produce weak children. He is also responsible for the introduction of folk dances into the gymnastics curriculum; these have remained a distinctive aspect thereof. Popular games remained a part of the educational program, although after 1918, the German system was replaced by the Swedish one, which was conceived with the individual's needs in mind. Together with several pupils, he made several trips abroad in order to present Romanian games: to Paris (1878), Rome (1882), Madrid (1884) and Calcutta (1890).&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

[[Nicolae Iorga]], generally not enthralled by athletics, wrote an appreciative obituary, while [[Alexandru I. Șonțu]] wrote a poem in his memory. Nevertheless, his name was soon largely forgotten. His bust, which had stood at the shooting society headquarters on the bank of the [[Dâmbovița River]] in Bucharest, had disappeared by 1930, when [[Gala Galaction]] wrote of his former teacher. A street near the [[Romanian Television]] headquarters bears his name today.&lt;ref name="p"&gt;Popa, p.341-342&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in commemoration of the 170th anniversary of Moceanu's birth, the school in his native village was named in his honor, and a memorial plaque unveiled.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

'''Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.''' ('''HSA''') is the largest student-run company in the world, employing more than 500 Harvard undergraduates annually. Founded in 1957, HSA is a multimillion-dollar non-profit that provides [[Harvard University]] students with meaningful opportunities for employment and hands-on business education. Student managers lead all aspects of the operations and strategy behind HSA's 15 businesses, which range from publishing to tutoring to bartending, including [[Let's Go (book series)|Let's Go]] (the leader in student travel), HSA Cleaners (a laundry and dry-cleaning service), and The Harvard Shop (a storefront and web retail business).

HSA is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit, and was founded to help defray rising tuition costs while providing practical business experience for Harvard undergraduates and supplying services to the campus community.

HSA is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].

==History==

===Founding===
HSA was founded in 1957 on the ideal of financing education through student employment. With Harvard's tuition on the rise, members of the Financial Aid Office were concerned that the increased cost of higher education would adversely affect the social and economic make-up of those applying to Harvard. At the same time, some ambitious students were running small-scale businesses out of their dorm rooms.  John Munro, Dean of Financial Aid, assigned Dustin M. Burke, Director of Student Employment, to investigate student businesses as a possible source of financial aid and to begin developing the idea that would become Harvard Student Agencies.

Later that spring, a meeting with student managers revealed considerable interest in the idea of a corporation, and more concrete plans began to emerge. With an initial capital investment of $7,000 and the acquisition of the rights to provide the weekly linen service traditionally offered by the university, HSA was equipped to carry its corporate overhead. The remaining pieces quickly fell into place. In August 1957, the papers authorizing a new company were filed. On September 10, the new corporation's first meeting was held. On December 13, 1957, the charter was signed recognizing the six original incorporators: John Munro, Dustin Burke, Greg Stone, John Giannetti, Theodore Elliot, and [[Harold Rosenwald]].&lt;ref name="hsa.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa.net/history/|title=History|website=Harvard Student Agencies|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the company has grown significantly over the past 6 decades. Let's Go publishing was the leading agency for much of 1980s and 1990s, at one point publishing over 50 titles annually. With the recent decline in publishing travel, however, The Harvard Shop has become the largest operation for the Harvard Student Agencies. With a robust E-commerce presence as well as three physical locations in the square, it aims to serve tourists, locals, and students alike.&lt;ref name="hsa.net"/&gt; The company has expanded organically and through acquiring startups that align with the company's mission. Recent examples include Mount Auburn Productions, created to meet the demand for live event filming and photography on campus, as well as College Copywriters, a startup that was acquired by Harvard Student Agencies in 2015 that connected students to companies needing high quality copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/22/hsa-scrutiny-silber/|title=There's an Agency for That - Magazine - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HSA Headquarters: Burke-McCoy Hall==
HSA Headquarters is located at 67 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge MA, in the former [[Manter Hall School]] building which was built in 1927. Established in 1884, Manter Hall School helped students prepare for Harvard's entrance exams during the 1930s and offered four- and eight-hour review sessions before every major Harvard mid-term and final examination. Although enrollment reached a peak of 250 in the late 1940s, by 1994 only 19 students were registered. At this time, Robert Hall, the owner of the building and manager of the school for 57 years, turned 83 and began talking to Harvard Student Agencies. Mr. Hall came to understand the unique educational opportunities HSA afforded to students and decided to sell the property to HSA in the spring of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1995/2/10/hsa-finds-permanent-location-in-square/|title=HSA Finds Permanent Location In Square - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1995, Robert W. McCoy (Harvard College ‘62, [[Harvard Business School]] ‘65) pledged a substantial lead gift to HSA’s capital campaign. The building was dedicated as Burke-McCoy Hall on February 5, 1997, and the dream of a permanent home for HSA was a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1996/12/11/hsa-lets-go-move-to-67/|title=HSA, Let's Go Move To 67 Mt. Auburn St. - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was named in honor of Dustin M. Burke, the first General Manager of HSA (1957-1970); Hester Bell McCoy, who joined HSA in 1961 as the company’s secretary; and Robert McCoy, Manager of Europe-by-Car, Assistant General Manager to Dusty Burke, and Let’s Go business manager upon his graduation from business school.

HSA currently occupies the top three floors and basement of Burke-McCoy Hall. Bank of America, Boloco (formerly The Wrap) and HSA Cleaners occupy the retail level of Burke-McCoy Hall. Behind the building, enough space exists to accommodate construction of a substantial annex for future expansion. A recent partnership with CS50, the introductory computer science course with one of the largest enrollments at Harvard, has opened the third floor to hosting office hours for students and teaching fellows to meet and congregate. This additional option was created in response to increasing demand for office hours as a result of the size of the course, as well the offer more flexible office hours to fit the wide range of schedules from students taking the class. The partnership also seeks to give students the option to pursue projects related services for students, with room for collaboration with Harvard Student Agencies beyond the one semester course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/14/CS50-expands-to-HSA/|title=CS50 Expands Office Hour Locations to HSA - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HSA also has three locations of The Harvard Shop in Harvard Square at 52 JFK Street, 65 Mt. Auburn Street and 34 JFK Street.

Mixing and matching is the unavoidable process in the making of inner connections and the presentations of interculturalities. The majority of the works in intercultural theatre deal basically with thinking and doing around the themes, stories, pre-performative or performative concepts of Asian classical theatre or traditional performing arts forms and practices, mixing and matching the concepts or the ideas of the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415092167 "Theatre world performance politics culture"]&lt;/ref&gt; After the well-known success of Peter Brook's production of the Mahabharata,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/metamorphoses/issues/links/hellwegpeter.html "Metamorphoses"]&lt;/ref&gt; the trend has been evolving tremendously around the globe and many the cultural institutions of many governments have become directly interested in pushing the boundaries of intercultural senses and sensitivities by financially investing on new theatrical productions, university research, conferences and fellowships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive "SUSI Grants"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three major groups of intercultural theatre ==

===Imitational theatre===
The intended audience is from the same culture, or a foreign audience from a different culture and the theater group, or the actors or performers, come from the same cultural background or from very diverse foreign cultural backgrounds. The production may imitate foreign styles, the production procedures may introduce new techniques, a new style of acting or a new style of presentation for a group of actors from various cultures or the same culture, the production may include foreign languages, costumes, scenic themes and other aspects. There are many examples of intercultural theatre groups, people, and institutions who are experimenting with various levels of mixing and matching of traditional or contemporary aspects of theatre training and presentations in this type of Imitational Theatre. 

After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems, in order to develop and portray their own theatre presentations using, or somehow capitalizing on the actor training systems and scenic representations belonging to those particular Asian theatres, such as the Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etcetera. While Peter Brook was successful in his approach to a universally accepted vision of theatre-making through the Asian theatre systems --beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics-- many other younger institutions or directorial approaches are kept within the parameters of imitations or comparisons, or only exchanges of physical exercises.

===Adaptive theatre===
There are two types of intercultural theatre within adapted theatre. One can consider "the norm" to represent what the audience of a certain culture expects/has typically been exposed to:

* '''Adapts to the norm''' - traditional style productions that have been consciously adapted to fit with the cultural expectations of the intended audience of another culture.
* '''Adapts away from the norm''' - the original culture dominates but it borrows foreign elements to enlarge the range of expression (e.g. [[TheatreWorks (Singapore)]] and [[Ong Keng Sen]]; [[International Centre for Theatre Research]] and [[Peter Brook]]; and [[The Bridge - Stage of the Arts#Betty Comden's article about the festival|The Bridge - Stage of the Arts]])

===Universal theatre===
The aim of universal theatre is to be recognized and accepted by audience members from a wide range of cultural backgrounds (e.g. [[Peter Brook#The Mahabharata|The Mahabharata, Peter Brook]], [http://www.performingarts.jp/e/data_art/other/p-10481.html Hiroshi Koike] [http://kikh.com/ Bridge Project- The Mahabharata],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pappa-tara.com "Performing Arts Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://barihochwald.com/ Bari Hochwald] [http://theglobaltheatreproject.org/ The Global Theatre Project],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobaltheatreproject.org "The Global Theatre Project"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tfana.org/education/programs/world-theatre The World Theatre Project], [http://www.peoplestheatreproject.org/ People's Theatre Project] etc.)

==The sub-divisions of intercultural theatre==
Globalization supported in the developments of intercultural theatre in various directions and evolutions of point of views by the theatre practitioners, scholars, funders and producers(British Council, Fulbright, Ford foundation, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Rockefeller-Foundation-Awards-1128 The Rockefeller foundation]) particularly using English language as the main medium of communication for knowing, acknowledging, debating, reasoning, considering, teaching, learning, writing, speaking, adapting, translating or transforming the one culture to the other culture in large contexts and in detailed micro contexts. Primarily the discourses of intercultural theatre practice developed out of the re-source influences of western theatre arts, western theoreticians and western theatre practitioners. (e.g. [http://www.odinteatret.dk/about-us/eugenio-barba.aspx%20 Eugenio Barba], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [http://www.theworkcenter.org/ Thomas Richards], [[Peter Brook]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]],[http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli])

===American intercultural theatre===
*For many theatre cultures, American intercultural theatre has given the possibilities of new exchanges, experiments, researches and pioneer introductions of model attempts in theatre making. There are many directors, teachers or theatre artists began working with the sources of American point of views in the intercultural attempts and some of them are [http://rasaboxes.org/about/eca-biographies/ Richard Schechner], [http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli], Robert Wilson,Christian DuComb Phd, Prof.Esther Kim Lee, Ellen Stewart-La MaMa, Lee Breuer-Mabou Mines, Hugh Gittens, Anne Bogart, Phillip Glass etc.

===Australian intercultural theatre===

===British intercultural theatre===

===Canadian intercultural theatre===

==Non-Native English language speaking countries intercultural theatre==
*English is the primary medium of communication in the intercultural theatre scene worldwide and American English or British English used as the mother source language to make all transactions related with theatre training, teaching and performing. Many non English countries have welcomed the English language as the official medium for the citizens and thus opened possibilities of any business. The culture is also part of business in the sense of in-coming and out-going, travelling or transforming stories, experiences, music, histories and philosophies. The dramatic theories and the acting coaching is mainly developed by the American or European masters of contemporary theatre. The non native English language speaking cultures supported the new experiences, exchanges, experiments to present the new shows.

{{Life in OIC}}
The '''Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization''' (ISESCO) was founded by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) in May 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isesco.org.ma/history/|title=History {{!}} Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – ISESCO –|website=www.isesco.org.ma|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 52 member states, ISESCO is one of the largest international [[Islamic]] organizations and specializes in the fields of education, science and culture. Its headquarters are in [[Rabat]], [[Morocco]]. The Director General is Dr. Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri, also Secretary General of the [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]] (FUIW).

== Overview ==
According to the OIC, ISESCO's objectives are "to strengthen and promote cooperation among the Member States in the fields of education, science culture and communication; consolidate understanding among peoples inside and outside Member State; contribute to world peace and security through various means; publicize the true image of Islam and Islamic culture; promote dialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions; encourage cultural interaction and foster cultural diversity in the Member States, while preserving cultural identity and intellectual integrity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isesco.org.ma/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/OIC-Organs-Institutions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

ISESCO appoints an Islamic cultural capital of Asia, the Arab region and Africa, for each year. During the appointments for 2017, Deputy Director General Dr. Amina Al-Hajri explained that an Islamic cultural capital "must primarily be of documented historical authenticity, have an outstanding contribution to knowledge and learning that singles it out in the country and the region, a significant input in Islamic culture and human culture in general." The three cities that are bearing the capital for 2017 are [[Mashhad, Iran]] for Asia, [[Amman, Jordan]] for the Arab region and [[Kampala, Uganda]] for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isesco.org.ma/blog/2017/01/24/isesco-deputy-director-general-participates-in-launch-ceremony-of-mashahds-celebration-as-asian-regions-islamic-culture-capital-for-2017/|title=ISESCO Deputy Director General participates in launch ceremony of Mashahd’s celebration as Asian Region’s Islamic Culture Capital for 2017 {{!}} Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – ISESCO –|website=www.isesco.org.ma|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2017/01/24/507521/Iran-Mashhad-cultural-capital-Muslim-world|title=PressTV-Mashhad named cultural capital of Muslim world|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed 2008-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Schickler was born in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]. His family later moved to [[Forest Row]], [[East Sussex]], and he attended Michael Hall, the [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner school]] located there. At the age of sixteen he attended [[Sevenoaks School]].

In 1994, he traveled to India and Nepal and on his return, matriculated at [[Sidney Sussex College]], Cambridge, where he read Social and Political Science. Soon, however, Schickler decided to change to Philosophy. He graduated with a First and, after a year as a [[Cello|cellist]] with a Berlin orchestra, Schickler returned to Cambridge ([[Queens' College, Cambridge]]) to read for a Doctorate in the Faculty of Divinity, under the supervision of [[George Pattison]]. Schickler began supervising undergraduates early in his doctoral career and he was appointed Director of Studies in Philosophy at [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]] in 2001. On 10 May 2002, Schickler was killed in the [[Potters Bar rail crash]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;University of Cambridge, ''News and events'', 13 May 2002. {{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2002051301 |title=University suffers tragic losses in train crash |accessdate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192221/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2002051301 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df= }}.

Accessed 2012-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
At the time of his death, Schickler left behind the completed manuscript of his doctorate as well as the article ''Death and Life in Modern Thinking'',&lt;ref&gt;Jonael Schickler, "Death and Life in Modern Thinking", in William Forward and Simon Blaxland-de Lange (eds.), ''Trumpet to the Morn: The Golden Blade'', '''53''', 2001. {{ISBN|0-9531600-3-3}}. [http://www.wynstonespress.com/Website/pages/Books/TGB_2001.html Wynstones Press]. Accessed 2008-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and a large quantity of unpublished material. In November 2004, his thesis was published in German under the title ''Metaphysik als Christologie'', edited by Peter von Ruckteschell and published by Koenigshausen and Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;Jonael Schickler, ''Metaphysik als Christologie: eine Odyssee des Ich von Kant und Hegel zu Steiner'', Koenigshausen + Neumann, 2004 (German). {{ISBN|3-8260-2957-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis appeared in English in December 2005, edited by Nick Green and Fraser Watts and published by Ashgate Publishing, under the title ''Metaphysics as Christology: An Odyssey of the Self from Kant and Hegel to Steiner''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonael Schickler, ''Metaphysics as Christology. An Odyssey of the Self from Kant and Hegel to Steiner'', Ashgate, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7546-5400-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Metaphysics]] as [[Christology]]'' is part of a larger project in which Schickler was engaged when he died to demonstrate an organic continuity and development between [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[ontology]], the '[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian turn' and [[Hegel]]ian dialectic, reaching its fulfillment in the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Two other parts of the project exist in complete, albeit unpublished form, ''From Dialectic to Phenomenology'' and ''Aristotle: Man and Metaphysics'', and may be published in the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Other planned parts of the project for which only notes exist are: ''Phenomenology and Depth Psychology'' (which was to discuss [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]] and [[Jung]]), ''Structural Phenomenology'' (an idea taken from [[Herbert Witzenmann]]), and ''The Recovery of Nature'' (which included an assessment of the prospects for a rebirth of alchemy).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In ''Metaphysics as Christology'', Schickler examines the key philosophical problems with which Kant and Hegel grappled, and finds in the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]] the essence of a solution to them; he claims that Steiner returned to Hegel's philosophical problems but was better able to solve them. Schickler uses these philosophical debates about knowledge and truth to understand the significance of Christ.&lt;ref name=Wendte&gt;Martin Wendte (2007). [http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000268/article.pdf Review of Metaphysics as Christology. An Odyssey of the Self from Kant and Hegel to Steiner], ''[[Ars Disputandi]]'', '''7'''&lt;/ref&gt; As theologian Martin Wendte describes, Schickler's "general ontology, according to his philosophical thesis, implies a theological [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]], [[resurrection]]. In effect, Schickler presents an onto-theo-logy, or, as his title has it: ''Metaphysics as Christology''."&lt;ref name=Wendte/&gt;

Building on the work of [[Hegel]], Schickler argues that [[Christ]] has made possible the developments in human [[consciousness]] that restore [[human race|humanity]]'s relationship to the surrounding world. Fraser Watts contributed the Foreword and George Pattison an extensive Preface.

Watts commented at the time of Schickler's death, {{cquote|Jonael was an intellectually brilliant student with a passionate commitment to his philosophical work. He had strong spiritual beliefs, stemming from his family background and his education at a Rudolph Steiner school. He had hoped that his work would contribute to a new understanding of the potential of philosophy, and was half-way through an ambitious five-part academic project. Though passionately serious, he also had a physical energy, a sense of fun, a warm heart, and many friends. His death is a great tragedy. It robs the world of an enormously promising young man who could have had a great impact for good.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;}}

==History==
The Museum of New Mexico was established on February 19, 1909 by the New Mexico Territorial legislature. This pre-statehood legislation mandated that the Museum of New Mexico be housed in the historic [[Palace of the Governors]]. An unusual arrangement existed with the privately-funded [[School of American Archaeology]] in which the School was allowed to occupy the Palace of the Governors free of rent and the Director of the School would serve as the Director of the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Malinda|title=The School of American Research : A History|date=1987|publisher=School of American Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement lasted until Governor [[John Burroughs (governor)|John Burroughs]] signed a bill on April 2, 1959 forcing the School of American Research to leave state property and the Board of Regents. Over the years, the Museum of New Mexico grew to include the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], [[Laboratory of Anthropology]], [[Museum of International Folk Art]] and the historic sites of [[Coronado Historic Site|Coronado]], [[Fort Selden]], [[Bosque Redondo Memorial|Bosque Redondo Memorial at Fort Sumner]], [[Jemez Historic Site|Jémez]], [[Lincoln Historic Site|Lincoln]], and [[El Camino Real Historic Trail Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museums and Historic Sites|url=http://www.museumofnewmexico.org/index.php|website=Museum of New Mexico|publisher=New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum of New Mexico has been reorganized several times, most recently in 2004 when Governor [[Bill Richardson]] created the [[New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs|Department of Cultural Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=Cody|title=Art in an Arid Climate : The Museum of New Mexico and the Cultivation of the Arts in Santa Fe|date=2005|publisher=University of California|location=Santa Barbara|pages=208-209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patricia Ocampo''' (born 1979) is an Argentine activist involved in community development and creation of libraries in [[Misiones Province]]. By 2014, she had worked with community organizers and celebrities to found 20 libraries. The organization she co-founded provides basic assistance to those in poverty and with disabilities and attempts to empower people through education and access to books and libraries. She is also involved in trying to stop child labor in Argentina, specifically in the [[yerba mate]] regions.

==Biography==
Patricia Liliana Ocampo was born 26 December 1979 in [[Oberá]], [[Misiones Province]], Argentina.

The '''Public Knowledge Project''' is a non-profit research initiative that is focused on the importance of making the results of publicly funded research freely available through [[open access]] policies, and on developing strategies for making this possible including software solutions. It is a partnership between the Faculty of Education at the [[University of British Columbia]], the Canadian Centre for Studies in Publishing at [[Simon Fraser University]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Ontario Council of University Libraries]], the [[California Digital Library]] and the School of Education at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="PKP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/about|work=Public Knowledge Project|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of academic research through the development of innovative online environments.

==History==
The PKP was founded in 1998 by [[John Willinsky]] in the Department of Language and Literacy Education at the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], based on his research in education and publishing.&lt;ref name="PKP" /&gt; Willinsky is a leading advocate of [[open access]] publishing, and has written extensively on the value of public research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/biblio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208193100/http://pkp.sfu.ca/biblio |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }} PKP Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

The PKP’s initial focus was on increasing access to scholarly research and output beyond the traditional academic environments. This soon led to a related interest in scholarly communication and publishing, and especially on ways to make it more cost effective and less reliant on commercial enterprises and their generally restricted access models. PKP has developed free, open source software for the management, publishing, and indexing of journals, conferences, and monographs.

The PKP has collaborated with a wide range of partners interested in making research publicly available, including the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC), the [[Brazilian Institute for Information Science and Technology]] (IBICT), and the [[International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications]] (INASP).

Together with INASP, the PKP is working with publishers, librarians, and academics in the development of [[:Category:Academic journal online publishing platforms|scholarly research portals]] in the developing world, including [[African Journals OnLine]] (AJOL) and Asia Journals Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://asiajol.info/index.php/about|work=Asia Journals Online|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, the PKP has joined the [[Synergies Canada]] initiative, contributing their technical expertise to integrating work being done within a five-party consortium to create a decentralized national platform for social sciences and humanities research communication in Canada.

==Growth 2005 to 2009==
The Public Knowledge Project grew between 2005 and 2009. In 2006, there were approximately 400 journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS), 50 conferences using Open Conference Systems (OCS), 4 organizations using the Harvester, and 350 members registered on the online support forum. In 2009, over 5000 journals were using OJS, more than 500 conferences were using OCS, at least 10 organizations are using the Harvester, and there were over 2400 members on the support forum.

Since 2005, there were major releases (version 2) of three software modules (OJS, OCS, Harvester), as well as the addition of [[Lemon8-XML]], with a growing number of downloads being recorded every month for all of the software. From June 12, 2009 to December 21, 2009, there were 28451 downloads of OJS, 6329 of OCS, 1255 of the Harvester, and 1096 of Lemon8-XML. A new module, Open Monograph Press (a publication management system for monographs) has also been released.

The PKP also witnessed increased community programming contributions, including new plugins and features, such as the subscription module, allowing OJS to support full open access, delayed open access, or full subscription-only access.  A growing number of translations have been contributed by community members, with Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese versions of OJS completed, and several others in production.

==Growth from 2010==

A German platform, based on OJS, is being developed by the Center for Digital Systems (CeDiS), [[Free University of Berlin]] and two other institutions.&lt;ref name="ojs-de"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Funding by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG) initially runs from 2014 to 2016.

==PKP conferences==
The PKP holds a biannual conference. The First PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was held in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada on July 11–13, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference 2007|url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/pkp/index.php/pkp2007/pkp2007|work=Public Knowledge Project|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Second PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was also held in Vancouver on July 8–10, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference 2009|url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/pkp/index.php/pkp2009/pkp2009|work=Public Knowledge Project|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Third PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was held in [[Berlin]], Germany between 26–28 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference 2011|url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/pkp/index.php/pkp2011/pkp2011|work=Public Knowledge Project|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] in August 19–21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference 2013|url=http://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp2013|work=Public Knowledge Project|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes on the presentations were recorded on a scholarly publishing blog for both the 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarlypublishing.blogspot.com/] PKP 2007 Conference Blog&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ubc.ca/pkp2009/] PKP 2009 Conference Blog&lt;/ref&gt; conferences, and selected papers from the 2007 conference were published in a special issue of the online journal ''[[First Monday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Public Knowledge Project: Selected papers from the Scholarly Publishing Conference, 11-13 July 2007|journal=First Monday|date=October 2007|volume=12|issue=10|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/250|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Papers from the 2009 conference are available in the inaugural issue of the journal ''Scholarly and Research Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volume 4, Issue 1|url=http://src-online.ca/index.php/src/announcement/view/27|work=Scholarly and Research Communication|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
{{cat see also|Abstract management software|Publication management software}}
The PKP's suite of software includes four separate, but inter-related applications to demonstrate the feasibility of open access: the [[Open Journal Systems]], the [[Open Conference Systems]], the [[PKP Open Archives Harvester]], and Open Monograph Press. PKP briefly experimented with a fifth application, Lemon8-XML, but has since opted to incorporate the XML functionality into the existing applications. All of the products are [[open source]] and freely available to anyone interested in using them. They share similar technical requirements (PHP, MySQL, Apache or Microsoft IIS 6, and a Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, or Windows operating system) and need only a minimal level of technical expertise to get up and running. In addition, the software is well supported with a free, online support forum and a growing body of publications and documentation is available on the project web site.

Increasingly, institutions are combining the PKP software, using OJS to publish their research results, OCS to organize their conferences and publish the proceedings, and the OAI Harvester to organize and make the metadata from these publications searchable. Together with other open source software applications such as [[DSpace]] (for creating institutional research repositories), institutions are creating their own infrastructure for sharing their research output.

'''Qualified Weapons Instructor''' (QWI) (''queue-why'') is a qualification given to graduates of the [[Royal Air Force]] or [[Royal Navy]] Qualified Weapons Instructor courses. It is the equivalent to the [[United States Air Force Weapons School]] Course or [[US Navy]]'s [[Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center]] warfare schools (including [[TOPGUN]]).
Graduates of a QWI course are entitled to wear a QWI 'patch' on their flying suit or combat uniform, which denotes their status as an expert practitioner in their warfare specialty or platform.  While QWI, [[TOPGUN]] and the [[United States Air Force Weapons School]] were traditionally associated with the employment of kinetic weapons and with historical origins in the combat aircraft community, modern warfare experts recognize that kinetic and non-kinetic weapons systems are critical in current and future combat engagements. This is reflected in the expansion of the respective warfare schools over the past two decades&lt;ref name="af.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nellis.af.mil/About/FactSheets/Display/tabid/6485/Article/284156/united-states-air-force-weapons-school.aspx |title=United States Air Force Weapons School &gt; Nellis Air Force Base &gt; Display |website=Nellis.af.mil |date=2016-05-10 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="navy.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/AIRFOR/nawdc/Pages/About.aspx |title=Commander, Naval Air Forces &amp;gt; NAWDC &amp;gt; About |website=Public.navy.mil |date=1996-07-11 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing this, the RAF has recently expanded the QWI qualification to included several non-kinetic fields and now strives to achieve Full Spectrum Warfare through effects based warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/role/airpoweruncertainworld.cfm |title=Air Power in an Uncertain World |publisher=RAF |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; QWI is not to be confused with QFI [[Qualified Flying Instructor]] which is a non-tactical qualification.

==Overview==
Recognizing that modern warfare requires [[Effects-based operations]] and [[Full-spectrum dominance]], the RAF has expanded its QWI programme beyond pure weapons kinetic effects and fighter aircraft tactics. Much like the equivalent weapons and warfare schools in the US, the RAF now qualifies expert level instructors in many fields. 

As of January 2017 the RAF delivers the following courses. 
* QWI - Typhoon/Reaper weapons system tactics and employment 
* QWI (ISR) - non-kinetic and [[Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance]] employment and delivery of full spectrum warfare.  

As requirements continue to evolve for the RAF, future courses may be created as requirements dictate.

Applicants to the QWI program are usually at the end of the first or second tour of duty and have operationally demonstrated above average qualities and capabilities in their field and are usually the top performing aircrew or operators in their squadron. 

The course lasts between 7 and 9 months. Selected applicants start their course of study with a Combined Ground School where Student Instructors receive awareness level capabilities briefs on pan-defence subjects, such as platform capabilities and limitations, UK MoD programmes and initiatives, and basic Combined Air Operations (COMAO) tactics. This is followed by 6–8 months of training back at their respective squadrons in the use of the weapons systems specific to their trade. The course culminates in the operational phase, Exercise COBRA WARRIOR (Formerly known as the Combined QWI (CQWI)), where all that they learnt is put into practice and student instructors from each branch must integrate and deliver full spectrum capabilities.  Exercise COBRA WARRIOR is the practical application of the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, Assess (F2T2EA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/pages/2000/july%202000/0700find.aspx |title=Air Force Magazine |website=Airforcemag.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate (F3EAD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a547092.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202024913/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a547092.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; killchains requires coordinated efforts among all participants to successfully achieve the commander's objectives. Fast jet QWI plan for kinetic weapons effects (both air-air and air-ground) and once handed a target complete Target, Engage and Assess. QWI (ISR) provides the Find, Fix, Track and Assess portion of the kill chain.  Each morning the QWI students are given an [[Air Tasking Order]] (ATO). They then need to plan the appropriate missions required to fulfil the commander's objectives laid out by the ATO and promulgated in higher level tasking documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsightonline.co.uk/features/54r-sqn-qwi-isr-course-3/ |title=54(R) Sqn QWI ISR Course 3 |publisher=The Insight Online |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With different types of aircraft and effects and a robust simulated adversary, planning is complex and typically requires an entire day to plan while mission execute only takes 1–2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/cqwi-exercise-23072013 |title=CQWI Exercise |website=Raf.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalaviationresource.com/reports/2009/cqwi2009.php |title=CQWI Course 2009 |publisher=Global Aviation Resource |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All graduates are awarded 'QWI' annotation in the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Air Force List]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and are recognized as experts for their respective platforms and fields through continued merit, professionalism and achievement. At international training events, such as Operation RED FLAG, QWIs are held in the same regard and to the same standard as USAF and USN patch wearers and are often employed in the tactical mentor role both in exercises and in real world operations.

Recognizing a lack of experts in employing ISR weapons systems, in Feb 2010 the RAF introduced an additional QWI course for aircrew of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms (such as Reaper, Rivet Joint, E-3 Sentry and Sentinel) and Intelligence Officers. This course is equivalent to the Maritime ISR Weapons and Tactics Instructor run through the [[Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center]] [[US Navy]]&lt;ref name="navy.mil" /&gt; and represents a blend of the Command and Control Operations course (8th Weapons Squadron) and Intelligence Sensor Weapons Instructor Course (19th Weapons Squadron) run by the USAF Weapons School.&lt;ref name="af.mil" /&gt; While traditional QWI focuses on becoming a platform expert and advanced kinetic weapons effects, the QWI (ISR) provides experts in pan-defence non-kinetic and ISR weapons systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafwaddington/aboutus/54rsquadron.cfm |title=RAF Waddington - 54 (R) Sqn |website=Raf.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilots of other air forces can attend the school through the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s International Defence Training Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071018051055/http://idtraf.mod.uk/325_807.html RAF MOD]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse speech''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific topic]]&lt;ref name="demon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="darkecho"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.darkecho.com/skepticalbeliever/reverse.html | accessdate=6 February 2009 | last=Shirley | first=John | title=Reverse Speech | work=The Skeptical Believer | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129080431/http://darkecho.com/skepticalbeliever/reverse.html | archivedate=29 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; first advocated by David John Oates which gained publicity when it was mentioned on [[Art Bell]]'s nightly [[Coast to Coast AM]] radio talk show.&lt;ref&gt;May 23rd 1997 Coast to Coast AM broadcast with [[Sean David Morton]] and "Victor".&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that during [[spoken language]] [[Language production|production]], human speakers [[subconscious]]ly produce [[hidden message]]s that give insights into their innermost thoughts. Oates claims that it has applications in [[psychotherapy]], [[criminology]] and business [[negotiation]].  Its claims have been rejected, however, by mainstream science and [[academia]].

==Claims==
{{Listen|filename=Neil Armstrong, small step for man (reversed).ogg|title="small step for [a] man", followed by the same phrase reversed|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Oates' claim is that, on average, once in every 15–20 seconds of casual [[conversation]] a person produces two related sentences—a "forward-spoken" message that is heard consciously, and a "backwards" message unconsciously embedded in the person's speech. These two modes of speech, forward and backward, are supposedly dependent upon each other and form an integral part of human communication. In the dynamics of interpersonal communication both modes of speech combine to communicate the total psyche of the person, conscious as well as unconscious. Oates claims that backward speech is always honest and reveals the truth about the speaker's intentions and motivations.&lt;ref name="oates"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.reversespeech.com/article0903.htm | last=Oates | first=David | accessdate=6 February 2009 | title=Reverse Speech – Voices From The Unconscious | publisher=reversespeech.com | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224145854/http://www.reversespeech.com/article0903.htm | archivedate=24 February 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous recording that allegedly demonstrates this is the speech given by [[Neil Armstrong]] at the time of the first manned [[lunar landing]] on 20 July 1969. If played backwards, the words "small step for man" sound somewhat like "Man will space walk."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm Reverse Speech Technologies · Examples]&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for this phenomenon is [[pareidolia]], the tendency of the human brain to perceive meaningful patterns in random noise. Pareidolia is even more likely to occur when a person consciously tries to detect a pattern, as is the case for someone listening for intelligible phrases in backwards speech. The power of [[suggestion]] is then used to nudge the listener to hear what the presenter wants him to hear. David John Oates, for example, almost always tells the listener in advance what he should expect to hear, thereby planting a suggestion that would make the listener more likely to actually "hear" that phrase. A study has shown that when listening to the same clips without being told in advance what to expect, the results have a higher variation.&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;

==Rejection by the scientific community==
Most academics in the field of [[linguistics]] have not paid attention to Oates' work,&lt;ref name="advertiser"&gt;{{Cite web| work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] | url=http://www.reversespeech.com/imgs/advertiser2.jpg | title=Play that back | last=Duffy | first=Michael | accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been called a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="demon"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/demon-haunted_sentence_a_skeptical_analysis_of_reverse_speech1/ | title=The Demon-Haunted Sentence: A Skeptical Analysis of Reverse Speech | first=Tom | last=Byrne |author2=Matthew Normand  | accessdate=2010-09-27 | year=2000 | work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;  For the most part, universities and research institutes have refused to test Oates' theories because of a lack of theoretical basis to make his predictions even worth testing, and the fact that many of his claims are untestable,&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="darkecho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;{{Cite web| work=[[Skeptic's Dictionary]] | url=http://skepdic.com/reversespeech.html | title=reverse speech | accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one of the few scientific experiments to evaluate Oates' claims did not support his findings.&lt;ref name="advertiser"/&gt;  Others have criticized "reverse speech" as lacking a rigorous [[methodology]] and not being informed by an understanding of issues in linguistics,&lt;ref name="newbrook"&gt;Newbrook, Mark, and Jane Curtain (1997). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980207000019/http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/revspeech1.htm |date=7 February 1998 |title="Oates' Theory of Reverse Speech." }} ''[[Australian Skeptics]]'' '''17'''(3).

Oates' own claims about the applications of reverse speech have also been challenged.  One report has questioned whether reverse speech was ever really used in police work, as Oates claimed.&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;  Likewise, his claim that reverse speech has applications in [[psychology]] and psychotherapy is not supported by mainstream research in those fields.&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt; Oates' work has been described as "dangerous" because of its potential for misuse and the likelihood of leading to [[false accusations]] of people in criminal courts, similarly to the controversial practice of [[facilitated communication]].&lt;ref name="demon"/&gt;

The CIA recently declassified documents&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00792r000500380002-0&lt;/ref&gt; on reverse speech.

'''''On the Right to Philosophy''''' ({{lang-fr|Du droit à la philosophie}}) is a 1990 book by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. It collects all of Derrida's writings, from 1975 till 1990, on the issue of the teaching of philosophy, the academic institution and the politics of philosophy in school and in the university. It has been translated in English in two volumes: '''''Who's Afraid of Philosophy?: Right to Philosophy 1''''' (2002), and '''''Eyes of the University: Right to Philosophy 2''''' (2004).

==Contents==
Volume 1 contains the essay ''Where a Teaching Body Begins and How It Ends'', (pp.&amp;nbsp;67–91) first published separately in 1976 in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/view/183/164]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080504145724/http://sun3.lib.uci.edu/~scctr/Wellek/jacques.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1977 essay ''The Age of Hegel'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;117–157).

'''Roma Pryma-Bohachevsky''' ({{lang-uk|Рома Прийма-Богачевська}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Roma Pryima-Bohachevs'ka'') (1927 – May 23, 2004) was a [[dance]]r and [[choreographer]], who instructed thousands of students in the art of [[ballet]] and [[Ukrainian dance]].

==Education==
Roma Pryma was born into a musical family in [[Przemyśl]], a city in present-day [[Poland]], but spent her formative years in [[Lviv]], a city in present-day western [[Ukraine]] (at the time, part of a newly established [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet republic]]). At the age of 5, her mother, Ivanna Pryma, sensing her daughter's talent for movement, enrolled her in [[eurhythmics]] classes, as well as in the study of [[modern dance]], under M. Bronevska, a disciple of [[Mary Wigman]].
Between the years 1939–44, Roma began performing at the [[Lviv Opera and Ballet Theater]], and after a year and a half, she moved up from serving in the [[corps de ballet]], to small [[solo (dance)|solo]] roles of a [[character dance|character]] nature.
Leaving her homeland after [[World War II]], Roma and her mother resettled in Austria in 1944, where after 3 years she graduated with honors from the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts]] in [[Vienna]] and later became a soloist in the ballet group of the National Theater in [[Innsbruck]].

At this point, Roma turned away from pursuing a career dedicated to classical ballet and followed her roots in alternative expression. After a meeting with [[Harald Kreutzberg]] at his villa in the [[Alps]], she began to focus on creating [[Expressionist dance|expressionistic choreographies]].

==Career==
Ms. Bohachevsky's stage appearances included solo performances and concert tours of Europe, North America and Central America. Eventually, she turned to teaching and choreography, influenced by the methods of Agrippina Vaganova and Martha Graham, with whom she studied.

Among Mrs. Bohachevsky's many choreographic creations are "Peer Gynt," "Kvit Paporoti" (Blossoming Fern), and "Cinderella," which have been danced over the years by hundreds of her students. At each summer camp, Mrs. Bohachevsky brought to life a Fairy Tale, weaving traditional and classical themes with imaginative staging, choreography, and costumes. The summer camps continue as of June, July, and August 2014 under her namesake at [[Soyuzivka]] Ukrainian Heritage Center in the [[Shawangunk Mountains]] of Kerhonkson, New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://soyuzivka.com/camps.html&lt;/ref&gt;

More impressive choreographies are the ones she created specifically for the Syzokryli Ukrainian Dance Ensemble, composed of her most talented students. Each choreography brings out the beauty of the Ukrainian theme developed in the dance, interwoven with elements of ballet, modern and stylized folk dance. Among her creations are "Battle for Freedom," a dramatic ballet commemorating the tragedy of Chernobyl, and "Icona," a historical recreation celebrating the millennium of Christianity in Ukraine. Shortly, after her death, a concert performed in Lincoln Center showcased much of the work she had taught her students.

'''Ronald James "Ron" Herron''' (1930 in [[London]], [[England]] &amp;ndash; 1994) was a notable English [[architect]] and teacher. He was perhaps best known for his work with the seminal English experimental architecture collective [[Archigram]], which was formed in London in the early 1960s. Herron is the creator of one of the group's best known and celebrated projects, the [[walking city]].

==Early life and education==
Ron Herron was born in London on 12 August 1930, to a leather-working family. He studied draughtsmanship at the Brixton School of Building&lt;ref name="Indy obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sutherland Lyall |title=Obituary: Professor Ron Herron |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-ron-herron-1440981.html |date=5 October 1994 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=26 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] in [[London]].

==Academic career==
Taught at the Architectural Association in London from 1965 until 1993, when he was appointed as professor and Head of the School of Architecture at the University of East London.

==Professional career==
In 1981 he formed Herron Associates, along with his sons Andrew and Simon. The firm built the acclaimed Imagination Headquarters in London and were involved in the design for Canada Water station.

==Archigram==
Shortly after finishing his architectural studies, Herron went to work for the [[London County Council]], alongside fellow future Archigram members Warren Chalk and Dennis Crompton. They were joined by Peter Cook, [[Michael Webb (architect)|Mike Webb]], and David Greene, who had been meeting regularly as a group at a cafe called Swiss Cottage, and had already published a homemade pamphlet under the moniker "Archigram" (ARCHitecture + teleGRAM). After the publication of the second issue, Cook, Webb and Greene sought out Herron, Chalk and Crompton, whom they knew by reputation. Those six formed the core of Archigram. In 1963 the group was invited by [[Theo Crosby]] to do an exhibition on "The Living City" at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, which became a manifesto of sorts.

==The Walking City==
Herron is remembered for his "Walking City", later described as "the international icon of radical architecture of the Sixties".&lt;ref name="Indy obit" /&gt; Between 1964 and 1966, the concepts for the Walking City were published in Archigram.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008911381|title=Phantom Architecture|last=Wilkinson|first=Philip|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=1471166422|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Walking City|oclc=1008911381}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of multi-story buildings mounted on giant, telescopic steel legs, with an ovoid and insect-like form, and while highly detailed, show little about how the ideas are meant to work in practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Resembling the [[Maunsell Forts]], they appeared warlike to some, leading Herron to be heckled at a conference in [[Folkestone]] in 1966 when he spoke about the Walking City.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, they were intended to be more like "survival pods" than weapons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Herron married Pat Ginn in 1954 and they remained together until his death. They had two sons.&lt;ref name="Indy obit" /&gt;

Herron died at [[Woodford Green]], Essex on 1 October 1994.&lt;ref name="Indy obit" /&gt;

'''Rosa Louise McCauley Parks''' (February 4, 1913&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 2005) was an [[activism|activist]] in the [[civil rights movement]] best known for her pivotal role in the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. The [[United States Congress]] has called her "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|106|26}}. Retrieved November 13, 2011. The quoted passages can be seen by clicking through to the text or PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 1955, in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]], Parks rejected bus driver [[James F. Blake]]'s order to relinquish her seat in the "colored section" to a white passenger, after the whites-only section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]] believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for [[civil disobedience]] in violating Alabama segregation laws. Parks' prominence in the community and her willingness to become a controversial figure inspired the black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year, the first major direct action campaign of the post-war civil rights movement. Her case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' succeeded in November 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

Parks' act of defiance and the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] became important symbols of the movement. She became an international icon of resistance to [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]]. She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including [[Edgar Nixon]], president of the local chapter of the NAACP; and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a new minister in Montgomery who gained national prominence in the civil rights movement and went on to win a [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

At the time, Parks was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. She had recently attended the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]], a [[Tennessee]] center for training activists for workers' rights and racial equality. She acted as a private citizen "tired of giving in". Although widely honored in later years, she also suffered for her act; she was fired from her job as a seamstress in a local department store, and received death threats for years afterwards.

Shortly after the boycott, she moved to [[Detroit]], where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988 she served as secretary and receptionist to [[John Conyers]], an African-American [[United States House of Representatives|US Representative]]. She was also active in the [[Black Power]] movement and the support of [[political prisoners]] in the US.

After retirement, Parks wrote her autobiography and continued to insist that the struggle for justice was not over and there was more work to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/12/01/how-history-got-the-rosa-parks-story-wrong/|title=How History Got Rosa Parks Wrong|last=Theoharis|first=Jeanne|date=December 1, 2015|work=|access-date=|via=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her final years, she suffered from [[dementia]]. Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 [[Spingarn Medal]], the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's [[National Statuary Hall]]. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman and third non-US government official to [[State funerals in the United States#List of lying in state and honor recipients|lie in honor]] in the [[Capitol Rotunda]]. [[California]] and [[Missouri]] commemorate [[Rosa Parks Day]] on her birthday February 4, while [[Ohio]] and [[Oregon]] commemorate the occasion on the anniversary of the day she was arrested, December 1.

==Early years==
Rosa Parks was born '''Rosa Louise McCauley''' in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], on February 4, 1913, to Leona (née Edwards), a teacher, and James McCauley, a [[carpenter]]. She was of [[Cherokee]]-[[Muscogee|Creek]] descent &lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brinkley, ''Rosa Parks'', Chapter 1, excerpted from the book published by Lipper/Viking (2000), {{ISBN|0-670-89160-6}}.

Retrieved July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  with one of her great-grandmothers having been a documented [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Native American slave]]. Additionally, she had a [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] great-grandfather.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Brinkley| work=Rosa Parks| title= Chapter 1 (excerpt): 'Up From Pine Level'| publisher= Lipper/Viking; excerpt published in ''The New York Times'' |year= 2000| isbn= 0-670-89160-6| url= http://partners.nytimes.com/books/first/b/brinkley-parks.html | access-date= July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;Webb, James. {{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_10-03-2004/featured_0 |title="Why You Need to Know the Scots-Irish" |accessdate=September 2, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704152512/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_10-03-2004/featured_0 |archivedate=July 4, 2009 |df= }}, ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'', October 3, 2004. Retrieved July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She was small as a child and suffered poor health with chronic [[tonsillitis]]. When her parents separated, she moved with her mother to [[Pine Level, Montgomery County, Alabama|Pine Level]], just outside the state capital, [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. She grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester. They all were members of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME), a century-old independent [[Black church|black denomination]] founded by free blacks in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the early nineteenth century.

McCauley attended rural schools&lt;ref name=NYT2 /&gt; until the age of eleven. As a student at the [[Industrial School for Girls]] in Montgomery, she took academic and vocational courses. Parks went on to a laboratory school set up by the [[Alabama State University|Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes]] for secondary education, but dropped out in order to care for her grandmother and later her mother, after they became ill.&lt;ref name="shraff"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rosa Parks: Tired of Giving In | publisher=Enslow | last= Shraff| first= Anne | year=2005 | pages=23–27 | isbn=978-0-7660-2463-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J37vgZvCI78C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Industrial+School+for+Girls+in+Montgomery+Rosa+Parks#v=onepage&amp;q=Industrial%20School%20for%20Girls%20in%20Montgomery%20Rosa%20Parks&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the 20th century, the former Confederate states had adopted new constitutions and electoral laws that effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] black voters and, in Alabama, many poor white voters as well. Under the white-established [[Jim Crow laws]], passed after Democrats regained control of southern legislatures, racial segregation was imposed in public facilities and retail stores in the [[Southern United States|South]], including public transportation. Bus and train companies enforced seating policies with separate sections for blacks and whites. School bus transportation was unavailable in any form for black schoolchildren in the South, and black education was always underfunded.

Parks recalled going to elementary school in Pine Level, where school buses took white students to their new school and black students had to walk to theirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'd see the bus pass every day... But to me, that was a way of life; we had no choice but to accept what was the custom. The bus was among the first ways I realized there was a black world and a white world.&lt;ref name=thehenryford&gt;

Although Parks' autobiography recounts early memories of the kindness of white strangers, she could not ignore the [[Racism in the United States|racism]] of her society. When the [[Ku Klux Klan]] marched down the street in front of their house, Parks recalls her grandfather guarding the front door with a shotgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1995-11-08/html/CREC-1995-11-08-pt1-PgE2135-2.htm |publisher= republished in Congressional Record Volume 141, Number 176; November 8, 1995| first= Walt |last= Harrington| title= A Person Who Wanted To Be Free| work=[[The Washington Post Magazine]] |date= 8 October 1995| accessdate= July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Montgomery Industrial School]], founded and staffed by white northerners for black children, was burned twice by arsonists. Its faculty was ostracized by the white community.

Repeatedly bullied by white children in her neighborhood, Parks often fought back physically.

At her husband's urging, she finished her high school studies in 1933, at a time when less than 7% of African Americans had a high-school diploma.

In December 1943, Parks became active in the [[civil rights movement]], joined the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, and was elected secretary at a time when this was considered a woman's job. She later said, "I was the only woman there, and they needed a secretary, and I was too timid to say no."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rosa Parks, civil rights icon, dead at 92 |work=Boston Globe |date= October 25, 2005 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2005/10/25/rosa_parks_civil_rights_icon_whose_single_act_sparked_a_movement_at_92/|accessdate=July 31, 2009 |first=Mark |last=Feeney}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued as secretary until 1957.

In 1944, in her capacity as secretary, she investigated the gang-rape of [[Recy Taylor]], a black woman from [[Abbeville, Alabama]]. Parks and other civil rights activists organized "[[The Committee for Equal Justice]] for Mrs. Recy Taylor", launching what the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' called "the strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/01/opinion-its-time-to-free-rosa-parks-from-the-bus/ |title=Opinion: It's time to free Rosa Parks from the bus |accessdate=December 22, 2012 |first= Danielle |last=McGuire |work=CNN |date=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, Parks and her husband were members of the [[Voters' League]]. Sometime soon after 1944, she held a brief job at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], which, despite its location in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], did not permit racial segregation because it was [[federal government of the United States|federal]] property. She rode on its integrated trolley. Speaking to her biographer, Parks noted, "You might just say Maxwell opened my eyes up." Parks worked as a housekeeper and seamstress for [[Clifford Durr|Clifford]] and [[Virginia Foster Durr|Virginia Durr]], a white couple. Politically [[American liberalism|liberal]], the Durrs became her friends. They encouraged—and eventually helped sponsor—Parks in the summer of 1955 to attend the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]], an education center for activism in workers' rights and racial equality in [[Monteagle, Tennessee]]. There Parks was mentored by the veteran organizer [[Septima Clark]].&lt;ref name="rebellious mrs." /&gt; In 1945, despite the Jim Crow laws and discrimination by registrars, she succeeded in registering to vote on her third try.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|690}}

==Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott==
{{Main|Montgomery bus boycott}}
[[File:Rosaparks busdiagram.jpg|thumb|Seat layout on the bus where Parks sat, December 1, 1955]]

===Montgomery buses: law and prevailing customs===
In 1900, Montgomery had passed a city ordinance to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats to achieve that goal. According to the law, no passenger would be required to move or give up their seat and stand if the bus was crowded and no other seats were available. Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers adopted the practice of requiring black riders to move when there were no white-only seats left.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'', 142 F. Supp. 707 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four rows of seats on each Montgomery bus were reserved for whites. Buses had "colored" sections for black people generally in the rear of the bus, although blacks composed more than 75% of the ridership. The sections were not fixed but were determined by placement of a movable sign. Black people could sit in the middle rows until the white section filled; if more whites needed seats, blacks were to move to seats in the rear, stand, or, if there was no room, leave the bus. Black people could not sit across the aisle in the same row as white people. The driver could move the "colored" section sign, or remove it altogether. If white people were already sitting in the front, black people had to board at the front to pay the fare, then disembark and reenter through the rear door.&lt;ref&gt;Garrow, David J. ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-394-75623-1}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, the black community had complained that the situation was unfair. Parks said, "My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. I did a lot of walking in Montgomery."&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

One day in 1943, Parks boarded a bus and paid the fare. She then moved to her seat but driver [[James F. Blake]] told her to follow city rules and enter the bus again from the back door. When Parks exited the vehicle, Blake drove off without her.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Parks waited for the next bus, determined never to ride with Blake again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/25/nation/na-parks25 | title = She Set Wheels of Justice in Motion | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Elaine|last= Woo|date=October 25, 2005| accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She paid her fare and sat in an empty seat in the first row of back seats reserved for blacks in the "colored" section. Near the middle of the bus, her row was directly behind the ten seats reserved for white passengers. Initially, she did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded.
Blake noted that two or three white passengers were standing, as the front of the bus had filled to capacity. He moved the "colored" section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of the day, Parks said, "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination cover my body like a quilt on a winter night."&lt;ref name="Donnie Williams"&gt;{{Cite book|page=48|last1=Williams|first1=Donnie|first2= Wayne |last2= Greenhaw |publisher=Chicago Review Press| year= 2005| isbn=1-55652-590-7|title=The Thunder of Angels: The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the People who Broke the Back of Jim Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When recalling the incident for ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]'', a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, "When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.'

When Parks refused to give up her seat, a police officer arrested her. As the officer took her away, she recalled that she asked, "Why do you push us around?"

===The boycott===
Nixon conferred with [[Jo Ann Robinson]], an [[Alabama State College]] professor and member of the [[Women's Political Council]] (WPC), about the Parks case. Robinson believed it important to seize the opportunity and stayed up all night [[mimeograph machine|mimeographing]] over 35,000 handbills announcing a bus boycott. The Women's Political Council was the first group to officially endorse the boycott.

On Sunday, December 4, 1955, plans for the Montgomery Bus Boycott were announced at black churches in the area, and a front-page article in the ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' helped spread the word. At a church rally that night, those attending agreed unanimously to continue the boycott until they were treated with the level of courtesy they expected, until black drivers were hired, and until seating in the middle of the bus was handled on a first-come basis.

The next day, Parks was tried on charges of [[disorderly conduct]] and violating a local ordinance. The trial lasted 30 minutes. After being found guilty and fined $10, plus $4 in court costs,&lt;ref name=cnn-obit /&gt; Parks appealed her conviction and formally challenged the legality of racial segregation. In a 1992 interview with [[National Public Radio]]'s Lynn Neary, Parks recalled:

It rained that day, but the black community persevered in their boycott. Some rode in carpools, while others traveled in black-operated cabs that charged the same fare as the bus, 10 cents. Most of the remainder of the 40,000 black commuters walked, some as far as {{convert|20|mi|sigfig=1}}.

That evening after the success of the one-day boycott, a group of 16 to 18 people gathered at the Mt. Zion [[AME Zion]] Church to discuss boycott strategies. At that time Parks was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; when she asked if she should say something, the reply was, "Why, you've said enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwVbfvfYEZkC&amp;pg=PA408&amp;lpg=PA408&amp;dq=rosa+parks+%22You've+said+enough%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rOsSH_BAPw&amp;sig=boOoZWgenR2iHSw50Ots6duyqcc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aK2kUojKF6_gsATI5IH4Aw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rosa%20parks%20%22You've%20said%20enough%22&amp;f=false|title=Civil Rights History from the Ground Up|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group agreed that a new organization was needed to lead the boycott effort if it were to continue. Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]] suggested the name "[[Montgomery Improvement Association]]" (MIA).&lt;ref name=Testament&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr.| last= Washington| first= James M.|year=1991|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-064691-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|432}} The name was adopted, and the MIA was formed. Its members elected as their president [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a relative newcomer to Montgomery, who was a young and mostly unknown minister of the [[Dexter Avenue Baptist Church]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/national/25parks.html | title=Rosa Parks, 92, Founding Symbol of Civil Rights Movement, Dies | date=October 25, 2005 | accessdate=July 4, 2008 | last= Shipp| first= E. R. | authorlink=E. R. Shipp | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Monday night, 50 leaders of the African-American community gathered to discuss actions to respond to Parks' arrest. [[Edgar Nixon]], the president of the NAACP, said, "My God, look what segregation has put in my hands!"&lt;ref name=autobiography-125&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosa Parks: My Story|page=125|last=Parks|first=Rosa|first2= James |last2= Haskins |publisher=Dial Books|year=1992|isbn=0-8037-0673-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks was considered the ideal plaintiff for a test case against city and state segregation laws, as she was seen as a responsible, mature woman with a good reputation. She was securely married and employed, was regarded as possessing a quiet and dignified demeanor, and was politically savvy. King said that Parks was regarded as "one of the finest citizens of Montgomery—not one of the finest Negro citizens, but one of the finest citizens of Montgomery."&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

Parks' court case was being slowed down in appeals through the Alabama courts on their way to a Federal appeal and the process could have taken years.&lt;ref name="NCCEC"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://civics.sites.unc.edu/files/2012/05/FreedomRides1.pdf| title= The Freedom Rides of 1961|work=NC Civic Education Consortium|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding together a boycott for that length of time would have been a great strain. In the end, black residents of Montgomery continued the boycott for 381 days. Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company's finances, until the city repealed its law requiring segregation on public buses following the US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that it was unconstitutional. Parks was not included as a plaintiff in the Browder decision because the attorney [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]] concluded the courts would perceive they were attempting to circumvent her prosecution on her charges working their way through the Alabama state court system.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Browder v.

Parks played an important part in raising international awareness of the plight of African Americans and the civil rights struggle. King wrote in his 1958 book ''Stride Toward Freedom'' that Parks' arrest was the catalyst rather than the cause of the protest: "The cause lay deep in the record of similar injustices."&lt;ref name=Testament /&gt;{{rp|437}} He wrote, "Actually, no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, 'I can take it no longer.'"&lt;ref name=Testament /&gt;{{rp|424}}

==Detroit years==

===1960s===
[[File:Rosaparks bus.jpg|thumb|left|Parks on a Montgomery bus on December 21, 1956, the day Montgomery's public transportation system was legally integrated. Behind Parks is Nicholas C. Chriss, a [[United Press International|UPI]] reporter covering the event.]]

After her arrest, Parks became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement but suffered hardships as a result. Due to economic sanctions used against activists, she lost her job at the department store. Her husband quit his job after his boss forbade him to talk about his wife or the legal case. Parks traveled and spoke extensively about the issues.

In 1957, Raymond and Rosa Parks left Montgomery for [[Hampton, Virginia]]; mostly because she was unable to find work. She also disagreed with King and other leaders of Montgomery's struggling civil rights movement about how to proceed, and was constantly receiving death threats.&lt;ref name="rebellious mrs." /&gt; In Hampton, she found a job as a hostess in an inn at [[Hampton Institute]], a [[historically black college]].

Later that year, at the urging of her brother and sister-in-law in [[Detroit]], Sylvester and Daisy McCauley, Rosa and Raymond Parks and her mother moved north to join them. The City of Detroit attempted to cultivate a progressive reputation, but Parks encountered numerous signs of discrimination against African-Americans. Schools were effectively segregated, and services in black neighborhoods substandard. In 1964, Parks told an interviewer that, "I don't feel a great deal of difference here... [[Housing segregation]] is just as bad, and it seems more noticeable in the larger cities." She regularly participated in the movement for open and [[fair housing]].&lt;ref name="wasn't"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jeanne |last=Theoharis |title='The northern promised land that wasn’t': Rosa Parks and the Black Freedom Struggle in Detroit |url=http://www.virginia.edu/lifetimelearning/civilrights/articles/Rosa%20Parks%20and%20the%20Black%20Freedom%20Struggle%20in%20Detroit.pdf |journal=OAH Magazine of History |volume=26 |number=1 |pages=23–27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207061017/http://www.virginia.edu/lifetimelearning/civilrights/articles/Rosa%20Parks%20and%20the%20Black%20Freedom%20Struggle%20in%20Detroit.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks rendered crucial assistance in the first campaign for Congress by [[John Conyers]]. She persuaded Martin Luther King (who was generally reluctant to endorse local candidates) to appear with Conyers, thereby boosting the novice candidate's profile.&lt;ref name= "wasn't"/&gt; When Conyers was elected, he hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit. She held this position until she retired in 1988.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rosa Parks, 92, Founding Symbol of Civil Rights Movement, Dies|work= The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/us/25parks.html?pagewanted=2|date=October 25, 2005|last=Shipp|first=E. R.| authorlink= E. R. Shipp|accessdate=January 1, 2010|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a telephone interview with [[CNN]] on October 24, 2005, Conyers recalled, "You treated her with deference because she was so quiet, so serene&amp;nbsp;— just a very special person&amp;nbsp;... There was only one Rosa Parks."&lt;ref name=CNN-10-30&gt;{{Cite news|title=Parks remembered for her courage, humility|date=October 30, 2005|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 1, 2008| url= http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/10/25/parks.reax/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing much of the daily constituent work for Conyers, Parks often focused on socio-economic issues including welfare, education, job discrimination, and affordable housing. She visited schools, hospitals, senior citizen facilities, and other community meetings and kept Conyers grounded in community concerns and activism.&lt;ref name="wasn't"/&gt;

Parks participated in activism nationally during the mid-1960s, traveling to support the [[Selma-to-Montgomery March]]es, the Freedom Now Party,&lt;ref name="rebellious mrs." /&gt; and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee#Lowndes County Freedom Organization|Lowndes County Freedom Organization]]. She also befriended [[Malcolm X]], who she regarded as a personal hero.&lt;ref name=10Things&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeanne-theoharis/rosa-parks-100th-birthday_b_2614678.html |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Rosa Parks| first= Jeanne |last= Theoharis |date= March 2, 2013 |work= Huffington Post |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many Detroit blacks, Parks remained particularly concerned about housing issues. She herself lived in a neighborhood, Virginia Park, which had been compromised by highway construction and [[urban renewal]]. By 1962, these policies had destroyed 10,000 structures in Detroit, displacing 43,096 people, 70 percent of them African-American. Parks lived just a mile from the epicenter of [[1967 Detroit riot|the riot]] that took place in Detroit in 1967, and she considered housing discrimination a major factor that provoked the disorder.&lt;ref name="wasn't" /&gt;

In the aftermath Parks collaborated with members of the [[League of Revolutionary Black Workers]] and the [[Republic of New Afrika]] in raising awareness of police abuse during the conflict. She served on a "people's tribunal" on August 30, 1967, investigating the killing of three young men by police during the 1967 Detroit uprising, in what came to be known as the [[Algiers Motel incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rosaparksbiography.org/bio/the-peoples-tribunal-on-the-algiers-motel-killings/|title=The People’s Tribunal on the Algiers Motel Killings {{!}} The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks|website=rosaparksbiography.org|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also helped form the Virginia Park district council to help rebuild the area. The council facilitated the building of the only black-owned shopping center in the country.&lt;ref name="wasn't" /&gt; Parks took part in the [[black power]] movement, attending the Philadelphia Black Power conference, and the Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana. She also supported and visited the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] school in Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psc-cuny.org/clarion/march-2013/alabama-detroit-rosa-parks-rebellious-life|title=From Alabama to Detroit: Rosa Parks' Rebellious Life|work=psc-cuny.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/5/2/2/1/9/p522193_index.html?phpsessid=52461e5fbc3ff8d78be0c47d44ef4d26|title= 'I Don't Believe in Gradualism': Rosa Parks and the Black Power Movement in Detroit| work= allacademic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/02/rosa-parks-stamp/1885129/|title=Stamp ceremony kicks off day in Parks' honor|date=February 3, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Rosa Parks (13270402093) (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Rosa Parks c.1978]]
In the 1970s, Parks organized for the freedom of [[political prisoners]] in the United States, particularly cases involving issues of self-defense. She helped found the Detroit chapter of the [[Joanne Little|Joann Little]] Defense Committee, and also worked in support of the [[Wilmington 10]], the [[RNA 11]], and [[Gary Tyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rosaparksbiography.org/bio/prisoner-defense-committees/|title=Prisoner Defense Committees {{!}} The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks|website=rosaparksbiography.org|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following national outcry around her case, Little succeeded in her defense that she used deadly force to resist sexual assault and was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X3MbIyzDsfcC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=jeanne+theoharis,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C-GJVJbVKdOIsQTT2oKoAw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=rosa%20parks&amp;f=false |chapter= A Life History of Being Rebellious: The Radicalism of Rosa Parks| first1= Jeanne |last1= Theoharis| title= Want to Start a Revolution?

The 1970s were a decade of loss for Parks in her personal life. Her family was plagued with illness; she and her husband had suffered stomach ulcers for years and both required hospitalization. In spite of her fame and constant speaking engagements, Parks was not a wealthy woman. She donated most of the money from speaking to civil rights causes, and lived on her staff salary and her husband's pension. Medical bills and time missed from work caused financial strain that required her to accept assistance from church groups and admirers.

Her husband died of throat cancer on August 19, 1977, and her brother, her only sibling, died of cancer that November. Her personal ordeals caused her to become removed from the civil rights movement. She learned from a newspaper of the death of [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], once a close friend. Parks suffered two broken bones in a fall on an icy sidewalk, an injury which caused considerable and recurring pain. She decided to move with her mother into an apartment for senior citizens. There she nursed her mother Leona through the final stages of cancer and geriatric dementia until she died in 1979 at the age of 92.

===1980s===
In 1980, Parks—widowed and without immediate family—rededicated herself to civil rights and educational organizations. She co-founded the [[Rosa L. Parks Scholarship Foundation]] for college-bound high school seniors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madisonet.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=15486990&amp;BRD=1302&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=181987&amp;rfi=8 "Editorial: Rosa Parks' legacy: non-violent power"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715141805/http://www.madisonet.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=15486990&amp;BRD=1302&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=181987&amp;rfi=8 |date=July 15, 2009 }}, ''[[Madison Daily Leader]]'', October 31, 2005.

In February 1987 she co-founded, with Elaine Eason Steele, the [[Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development]], an institute that runs the "Pathways to Freedom" bus tours which introduce young people to important civil rights and [[Underground Railroad]] sites throughout the country.

===1990s===
In 1992, Parks published ''Rosa Parks: My Story'', an autobiography aimed at younger readers, which recounts her life leading to her decision to keep her seat on the bus. A few years later, she published ''Quiet Strength'' (1995), her memoir, which focuses on her faith.

At age 81 Parks was robbed and assaulted in her home in central Detroit on August 30, 1994. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down the door but claimed he had chased away an intruder. He requested a reward and when Parks paid him, he demanded more. Parks refused and he attacked her. Hurt and badly shaken, Parks called a friend, who called the police. A neighborhood manhunt led to Skipper's capture and reported beating. Parks was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital for facial injuries and swelling on the right side of her face. Parks said about the attack on her by the African-American man, "Many gains have been made ... But as you can see, at this time we still have a long way to go." Skipper was sentenced to 8 to 15 years and was transferred to prison in another state for his own safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nytimes.com/1994/08/31/us/rosa-parks-robbed-and-beaten.html "Rosa Parks Robbed and Beaten"] ''New York Times'', August 31, 1994.

Suffering anxiety upon returning to her small central Detroit house following the ordeal, Parks moved into [[Riverfront Towers]], a secure high-rise apartment building. Learning of Parks' move, [[Little Caesars]] owner [[Mike Ilitch]] offered to pay for her housing expenses for as long as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/02/24/Champions/Ilitch-Rosa-Parks.aspx |title=Ilitch aids civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, others |last=Botta |first=Christopher |date=24 February 2014 |website=Sports Business Daily |access-date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the [[Ku Klux Klan]] applied to sponsor a portion of United States [[Interstate 55]] in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and [[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson County]], Missouri, near [[St. Louis]], for cleanup (which allowed them to have signs stating that this section of highway was maintained by the organization). Since the state could not refuse the KKK's sponsorship, the Missouri legislature voted to name the highway section the "Rosa Parks Highway". When asked how she felt about this honor, she is reported to have commented, "It is always nice to be thought of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1210/context/ourdailylives |title=Happy Birthday, Rosa Parks! |first=Ilena |last=Rosenthal |website=WomenseNews.org |date=February 4, 2003 |access-date=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817233310/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1210/context/ourdailylives |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/rosapark.htm |title= The Name Game| website= Snopes.com| date={{date|2007-12-03}}| access-date= {{date|2001-11-13}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Parks filmed a cameo appearance for the television series ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Black Like Monica |series=Touched By An Angel |series-link=Touched By An Angel |first=John |last=Masius |network=CBS |station=CBS |date=2 May 1999 |season=5 |number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was her last appearance on film; Parks began to suffer from health problems due to old age.

===2000s===
In 2002 Parks received an eviction notice from her $1,800 per month apartment for non-payment of rent. Parks was incapable of managing her own financial affairs by this time due to age-related physical and mental decline. Her rent was paid from a collection taken by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. When her rent became delinquent and her impending eviction was highly publicized in 2004, executives of the ownership company announced they had forgiven the back rent and would allow Parks, by then 91 and in extremely poor health, to live rent-free in the building for the remainder of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| agency= Associated Press |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6659487/ | title= Landlord won't ask Rosa Parks to pay rent| website= [[MSNBC]].com| date=December 6, 2004| access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Steele, manager of the nonprofit Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, told the newspaper that Parks got proper care, and that eviction notices were sent in error in 2002. Her heirs and various interest organizations alleged at the time that her financial affairs had been mismanaged.

In 2016 Rosa's Detroit house was disassembled, moved to [[Berlin]], and partly restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Death and funeral==
Parks died of [[natural causes]] on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92, in her apartment on the east side of [[Detroit]]. She and her husband never had children and she outlived her only sibling. She was survived by her sister-in-law (Raymond's sister), 13 nieces and nephews and their families, and several cousins, most of them residents of [[Michigan]] or [[Alabama]].

City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral. Parks' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul [[African Methodist Episcopal]] (AME) church, where she [[lying in repose|lay in repose]] at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess. A memorial service was held there the following morning. One of the speakers, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], said that if it had not been for Parks, she would probably have never become the Secretary of State. In the evening the casket was transported to [[Washington, D.C.]] and transported by a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest, to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.

[[UNESCO]] leads the '''United Nations Literacy Decade (UNLD)''' under the slogan of “Literacy as Freedom”. Launched at UN Headquarters in 2003, the Decade aims to increase literacy levels and to empower all people everywhere. In declaring this Decade, the international community recognised that the promotion of literacy is in the interest of all, as part of efforts towards peace, respect and exchange in a globalizing world. 

==History==
At the request of the UN General Assembly, UNESCO is coordinating the Decade and its international activities. UNESCO launched the '''Literacy Initiative for Empowerment (LIFE)''' in 2005 as a framework for achieving the Decade’s goals.&lt;ref name="resolution1"&gt;http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/un_decade_literacy/un_resolution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UN Literacy Decade expresses the collective will of the international community to promote a literate environment for all, girls and boys, women and men in both developing and developed countries. The Decade was established for three reasons:

# On a global scale, one in five adults cannot read nor write. According to the latest estimates, 776 million people are illiterate and two-thirds of these are women.&lt;ref name="education1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=53553&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization &amp;#124; UNESCO.ORG |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Literacy is a human right. Basic education, within which literacy is the key learning tool, was recognised as a human right over 50 years ago, in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. This right continues to be violated for a large proportion of humanity.
# Literacy efforts up to now have proved inadequate, at national and international levels. The Decade is an opportunity to make a sustained collective effort which will go beyond one-shot programmes or campaigns.

In response to these factors, efforts undertaken during the Decade are to target the poorest and most marginal social groups (including women) and to accompany initiatives to reduce poverty. According to the draft proposal and plan for the UNLD, “Literacy policies and programmes today require going beyond the limited view of literacy that has dominated in the past. Literacy for all requires a renewed vision of literacy….” In order to survive in today‘s globalized world, it has become necessary for everyone to learn new forms of literacy and to develop the ability to locate, evaluate and effectively use information in a variety of ways.

Resolution 56/116 adopted by the General Assembly entitled United Nations Literacy Decade: education for all &lt;ref name="resolution1"/&gt; evokes that [[literacy]] is crucial to the acquisition, by every child, youth and adult, of essential life skills that enable them to address the challenges they can face in life, and represents an essential step in [[basic education]], which is an indispensable means for effective participation in the societies and economies of the twenty-first century. It also affirms that the realization of the right to education, especially for girls, contributes to the eradication of poverty.

The [[Education for All]] goal of increasing literacy rates by 50% by 2015 provides the overall target for the Decade, and the Millennium Development Goals set the Decade in the context of poverty reduction.

== United Nations Literacy Decade - International Plan of Action ==

As part of its lead coordination role in the Decade, UNESCO prepared the International Plan of Action for the Literacy Decade. The International Plan of Action outlines the strategy and expected outcomes for the Decade. It proposes six key areas of action to implement literacy for all: 

# Policy change to provide a framework for local participation in literacy;
# Development of flexible programmes;
# Capacity building for literacy workers;
# Research;
# Community participation; and
# Monitoring and evaluation to measure progress in the respective regions.

The Plan was submitted to the UN General Assembly at its 57th session in 2002.&lt;ref name="education2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=53900&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization &amp;#124; UNESCO.ORG |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912064453/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D53900%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate=September 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO’s Literacy Initiative for Empowerment (LIFE) ==
 
UNESCO’s Literacy Initiative for Empowerment (LIFE) is a global strategic framework for the implementation of United Nations Literacy Decade (2003–2012), in order to meet the '''[[Education for All]]''' (EFA) goals, with particular focus on adult literacy and out-of-school children. It was created when it became apparent that existing literacy efforts would not be sufficient to achieve a 50 per cent improvement in levels of adult literacy by 2015. LIFE targets the 35 countries that have a literacy rate of less than 50 percent or a population of more than 10 million people who cannot read nor write. Eighty-five percent of the world’s non-literate population resides in these countries, and two-thirds are women and girls. The UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (UIL) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UIL-prog |url=http://www.unesco.org/uil/en/about/about.htm |title=UIL - About UIL |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is coordinating LIFE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UIL-prog |url=http://www.unesco.org/uil/en/about/about.htm |title=UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="education3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=53813&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization &amp;#124; UNESCO.ORG |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226223458/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D53813%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNLD Mid-Decade Review ==

Halfway through the United Nations Literacy Decade (UNLD) 2003-2012, UNESCO has conducted a review of progress. The review has been a key opportunity to take stock and set a clear direction for the promotion of literacy between 2007 and 2012 in all key areas of the UNLD Plan of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=53898&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization &amp;#124; UNESCO.ORG |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking place during 2007 and 2008, the review has used the 2006 Education for All '''Global Monitoring Report''' &lt;ref name="unesdoc1"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001442/144270e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as a benchmark. It also used the momentum generated from the Regional Conferences to promote stronger policies and greater investment in literacy. The review aimed to identify concrete actions for the second half of the Decade. UNESCO has set up a UNLD Experts’ Group which advised on the further development of the UN Literacy Decade as well as on other literacy related matters. The results of the mid-decade review have been submitted to the UN General Assembly in October 2008.

{{Students rights sidebar}}
'''Unschooling''' is an educational method and philosophy that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning. Unschooling students [[learn]] through their natural life experiences including [[play (activity)|play]], [[household]] responsibilities, personal interests and curiosity, internships and work experience, travel, books, elective classes, family, mentors, and [[social interaction]]. Unschooling encourages exploration of activities initiated by the children themselves, believing that the more personal learning is the more meaningful, well-understood and therefore useful it is to the child. While courses may occasionally be taken, unschooling questions the usefulness of standard [[curricula]], conventional [[Grade (education)|grading]] methods, and other features of traditional schooling in the education of each unique child.

The term "unschooling" was coined in the 1970s and used by educator [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]], widely regarded as the father of unschooling.&lt;ref name=fun12&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greer|first1=Billy|title=Unschooling or homeschooling?|url=http://www.unschooling.org/fun12_unschooling.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115060121/http://unschooling.org/fun12_unschooling.htm|archivedate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While often considered a subset of [[homeschooling]], unschoolers may be as philosophically separate from other homeschoolers as they are from advocates of conventional schooling.  While homeschooling has been subject to widespread public debate, little media attention has been given to unschooling in particular. Critics of unschooling see it as an extreme educational philosophy, with concerns that unschooled children will lack the social skills, structure, and motivation of their schooled peers, while proponents of unschooling say exactly the opposite is true: self-directed education in a natural environment better equips a child to handle the "real world."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers share heated opinions on "unschooling"|date=2006-10-31|accessdate=2008-09-04|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15148804/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==


===Children are natural learners===
A fundamental premise of unschooling is that curiosity is innate and that children want to learn. From this an argument can be made that institutionalizing children in a so-called "one size fits all" or "factory model" [[school]] is an inefficient use of the children's time, because it requires each child to learn specific subject matter in a particular manner, at a particular pace, and at a specific time regardless of that individual's present or future needs, interests, goals, or any pre-existing knowledge he or she might have about the topic.

Many unschoolers believe that opportunities for valuable hands-on, community-based, spontaneous, and real-world experiences may be missed when educational opportunities are limited to, or dominated by, those inside a school building.

===Learning styles===
Unschoolers note that [[psychologists]] have documented many differences between children in the way they learn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vosniadou|first= S.|title=How Children Learn?|work=The International Academy of Education|year= 2001|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001254/125456e.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assert that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to these differences.&lt;ref name=Evaluation/&gt;

People vary in their "[[learning styles]]", that is, the preference in how they acquire new information. However, research has demonstrated that this preference is not related to increased learning or improved performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pashler | first1 = H. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = M. | last3 = Rohrer | first3 = D. | last4 = Bjork | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Learning styles: Concepts and evidence | url = | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 105–119 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students have different learning needs. In a traditional school setting, teachers seldom evaluate an individual student differently from other students, and while teachers often use different methods, this is sometimes haphazard and not always with regard to an individual student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parentconcept.com/learning-through-home-education Learning through home education Retrieved 2011-02-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developmental differences====
Developmental psychologists note that just as children reach growth milestones at different ages from each other, children are also prepared to learn different things at different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vosniadou|first= S.|title=How Children Learn?|work=The International Academy of Education|year= 2001|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001254/125456e.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as some children learn to walk during a normal range of eight to fifteen months, and begin to talk across an even larger range, unschoolers assert that they are also ready and able to read, for example, at different ages, girls usually earlier, boys later. In fact, experts have discovered that natural learning produces far greater changes in behavior than do traditional learning methods, though not necessarily an increase in the amount of information learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Teacher-vs-Learner-Responsibility.pdf | title = Teacher vs. Learner Responsibility in Management Education | author = J. Scott Armstrong }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional education requires all children to begin reading at the same time and do multiplication at the same time; unschoolers believe that some children cannot help but be bored because this was something that they had been ready to learn earlier, and even worse, some children cannot help but fail, because they are not yet ready for this new information being taught.&lt;ref name=Fail&gt;{{cite book|last=Holt|first=John C.|title=How Children Fail|origyear=1964|year=1982|publisher=Classics in Child Development|isbn=978-0201484021|url=https://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Development/dp/0201484021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essential body of knowledge===
Unschoolers sometimes state that learning any specific subject is less important than learning ''how'' to learn.&lt;ref name="childledhomeschool.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=ChildLedHomeschool |url=http://childledhomeschool.com/2010/08/14/planning-for-child-led-learning/ |title=Planning for Child-Led Learning &amp;#124; CLH |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-08-14 |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708144224/http://childledhomeschool.com/2010/08/14/planning-for-child-led-learning/ |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert, in the words of Holt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since we can't know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever must be learned.&lt;ref name="childledhomeschool.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is asserted that this ability to learn on their own makes it more likely that later, when these children are adults, they can continue to learn what they need to know to meet newly emerging needs, interests, and goals;&lt;ref name="childledhomeschool.com"/&gt; and that they can return to any subject that they feel was not sufficiently covered or learn a completely new subject.&lt;ref name="childledhomeschool.com"/&gt;

Many unschoolers disagree that there is a particular body of knowledge that every person, regardless of the life they lead, needs to possess.&lt;ref name=Curriculum&gt;{{cite book|last=Noll|first=James Wm.|title=Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Educational Issues 15th ed.|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0073515205|pages=25–26|url=https://www.amazon.com/Educational-Issues-Taking-Sides-Clashing/dp/0073515205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unschoolers argue that, in the words of John Holt,  "If children are given access to enough of the world, they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others, and they will make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else could make for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Gurteen |url=http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00046822/ |title=On children and learning by John Holt (Gurteen Knowledge) |publisher=Gurteen.com |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of parents===
Parents of unschoolers provide resources, support, guidance, information, and advice to facilitate experiences that aid their children in accessing, navigating, and making sense of the world.&lt;ref name=Evaluation/&gt;  Common parental activities include sharing interesting books, articles, and activities with their children, helping them find knowledgeable people to explore an interest with (anyone from physics professors to automotive mechanics), and helping them set goals and figure out what they need to do to meet their goals. Unschooling's interest-based nature does not mean that it is a "hands off" approach to education. Parents tend to involve themselves, especially with younger children (older children, unless new to unschooling, often need less help finding resources and making and carrying out plans).&lt;ref name=Evaluation /&gt;

===The required paradigm shift===
Unschooling opposes many aspects of what the dominant culture insists are true. In fact, it may be impossible to fully understand the unschooling philosophy without active participation paired with a major paradigm shift. The cognitive dissonance that frequently accompanies this paradigm shift is uncomfortable. New unschoolers are advised that they should not expect to understand the unschooling philosophy at first.&lt;ref name="Unschooling: An Introduction and Beginner's Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unschooling: An Introduction and Beginner's Guide|url=https://homeschoolbase.com/unschooling/|publisher=Homeschool Base|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are there many commonplace assumptions about education, there are many unspoken and unwritten expectations. One step towards overcoming the necessary paradigm shift is accepting that, "what we do is nowhere near as important as why we do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradigm Shifts|first=Cathy|last=Koetsier| url=http://www.christian-unschooling.com/paradigm-shifts.html|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of traditional school methods and environments===
Unschoolers question schools for lessening the parent/child bond and reducing family time and creating atmospheres of fear, or atmospheres that are not conducive for learning and may not even correspond with later success.

Often those in school have a community consisting mainly of a peer group, of which the parent has little influence and even knowledge. Unschoolers may have time to share a role in their greater community, therefore relating more to older and younger individuals and finding their place within more diverse groups of people. Parents of school children also have little say regarding who their instructors and teachers are, whereas parents of unschoolers may be more involved in the selection of the coaches or mentors their children work with and with whom they build lasting and ongoing relationships.

According to unschooling pioneer John Holt, "...the anxiety children feel at constantly being tested, their fear of failure, punishment, and disgrace, severely reduces their ability both to perceive and to remember, and drives them away from the material being studied into strategies for fooling teachers into thinking they know what they really don't know." Proponents of unschooling assert that individualized, child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children's time, takes advantage of their interests, and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education.

Unschoolers may question the school environment as one that is optimal for daily learning. According to ''[[Brain Rules]]'' by [[John Medina]], "If you wanted to create an education environment that was directly opposed to what the brain was good at doing, you probably would create something like a classroom...."
According to the Victorian Institute of Teaching here: [15]
:"Studies about student academic achievement and building condition conclude that the quality of the physical environment significantly affects student achievement. 'There is sufficient research to state without equivocation that the building in which students spends a good deal of their time learning does in fact influence how well they learn' (Earthman, G 2004:18)...research has acknowledged that 'student achievement lags in shabby school buildings...":

Others point out that some schools can be non-coercive and cooperative, in a manner consistent with the philosophies behind unschooling.&lt;ref name="J. Scott Armstrong 1979 5–12"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Warmaudit31%205.pdf | title = The Natural Learning Project | author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Journal of Experiential Learning and Simulation | volume = 1 | pages = 5–12 | year = 1979 | publisher = Elseiver North-Holland, Inc. 1979 | access-date = 2011-12-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100620221122/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Warmaudit31%205.pdf | archive-date = 2010-06-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudbury model]] schools are non-coercive, non-indoctrinative, cooperative, democratically run partnerships between children and adults, including full parents' partnership, where learning is individualized and child-led, and complements home education.&lt;ref name="J. Scott Armstrong 1979 5–12"/&gt;

Success and schooling also show little correlation according to some studies, and this is a subject for debate. In the United States, school often takes a well-rounded approach that may attempt to compensate for students' weaknesses rather than building upon individual strengths and skills that they will eventually utilize professionally. Further, many highly successful people, including US presidents, scientists, actors, writers, inventors, and educators were home-schooled or dropped out of school, suggesting that education is a matter of curiosity and desire rather than academic achievement.{{Citation needed|reason=How many?

==History and usage==

The term "unschooling" probably derives from [[Ivan Illich]]'s term "deschooling", and was popularized through John Holt's newsletter ''[[Growing Without Schooling]]''. In an early essay, Holt contrasted the two terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;GWS will say 'unschooling' when we mean taking children out of school, and 'deschooling' when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Holt, J|title=Growing Without Schooling|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this point the term was equivalent with "home schooling" (itself a [[neologism]]). Subsequently, home schoolers began to differentiate between various educational philosophies within home schooling. The term "unschooling" became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically "school-like," using textbooks and exercises at home, the same way they would be used at school. In 2003, in Holt's book ''Teach Your Own'' (originally published in 1981) Pat Farenga, co-author of the new edition, provided a definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When pressed, I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first= J.|title=Teach Your Own|orig-year=First published 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same passage Holt stated that he was not entirely comfortable with this term, and that he would have preferred the term "living".  Holt's use of the term emphasizes learning as a natural process, integrated into the spaces and activities of everyday life, and not benefiting from adult manipulation. It follows closely on the themes of educational philosophies proposed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], and [[A.S. Neill]].

After Holt's death a range of unschooling practitioners and observers defined the term in various ways. For instance, the [[Freechild Project]] defines unschooling as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the process of learning through life, without formalized or institutionalized classrooms or schoolwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unschooling &amp; Self-Education|url=http://www.freechild.org/unschooling.htm|accessdate = 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New Mexico homeschooling parent Sandra Dodd proposed the term "Radical Unschooling" to emphasize the complete rejection of any distinction between educational and non-educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is there a difference between a radical unschooler and just an unschooler?| url=http://sandradodd.com/unschool/radical|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical Unschooling emphasizes that unschooling is a non-coercive, cooperative practice, and seeks to promote those values in all areas of life. These usages share an opposition to traditional schooling techniques and the social construction of schools. Most emphasize the integration of learning into the everyday life of the family and wider community. Points of disagreement include whether unschooling is primarily defined by the initiative of the learner and their control over the curriculum, or by the techniques, methods, and spaces being used.

==Home education==

Unschooling is a form of [[home education]], which is the education of children at home rather than in a school. Home education is often considered synonymous with [[homeschooling]].

Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a [[teacher]] and [[curriculum]].  Unschooling is a real-world implementation of "The Open Classroom" methods promoted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, without the school, classrooms or grades.  Parents who unschool their children act as facilitators, providing a range of resources, helping their children access, navigate, and make sense of the world, and aiding them in making and implementing goals and plans for both the distant and immediate future. Unschooling expands from children's natural [[curiosity]] as an extension of their interests, concerns, needs, goals, and plans.

==Socialization==

Concerns about socialization are often a factor in the decision to unschool. Many unschoolers believe that the conditions common in conventional schools, like age segregation, a low ratio of adults to children, a lack of contact with the community, a lack of people in professions other than teachers or school administration, an emphasis on the smarter children, shaming of the failing children, and an emphasis on sitting, create an unhealthy social environment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Socialization: A Great Reason Not to Go to School|url=http://learninfreedom.org/socialization.html|first=Karl M.|last=Bunday|accessdate=2008-09-04|work=Learn in Freedom!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly, unschooling is said to broaden the diversity of people or places, which an unschooler may access, while simultaneously noting that, compared to many student populations, unschoolers may be more selective in choosing peer groups, mentors, etc. Unschoolers cite studies that report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comparison of Social Adjustment Between Home and Traditionally Schooled Students|first=Larry Edward|last=Shyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationatlas.com/home-schooling-information.html|title=Home Schooling: Back to the Future?|first=Isabel|last=Liman|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people they have the opportunity to interact with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isn't it Natural for Children to be Divided by Age in School?|url=http://learninfreedom.org/age_grading_bad.html|work=Learn in Freedom!|last=Bunday|first=Karl M.|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opportunities for unschoolers to meet and interact with other unschoolers has increased in recent years, allowing unschoolers to have rich relationships with like minded peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peerunschooling.net|title=Peer Unschooling Network (PUN) - Unschooling Teens Unite!|website=Peer Unschooling Network (PUN)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of unschooling, on the other hand, argue that unschooling inhibits social development by removing children from a ready-made peer group of diverse individuals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Objections" /&gt;

==Legality==
{{unsourced section|date=June 2018}}
Like other forms of alternative education, unschooling is subject to legal restrictions in some countries and is illegal in others.

Unschooling, as a form of homeschooling, is legal in all 50 American states. 

In the United States, each state has the right to set its own requirements for homeschooling, so regulations vary by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hslda.org/content/laws/|title=Homeschool Laws in Your State - HSLDA|last=Association|first=Home School Legal Defense|website=Home School Legal Defense Association|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states require that the parents conducting homeschooling have a high school diploma or that they be capable of teaching. States might also require that certain subjects be taught or that participants are assessed on a regular basis. Additionally, some may require vaccinations or may prohibit homeschooling by parents with certain kinds of criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/homeschool|title=Homeschooling Regulations|website=projects.propublica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all fifty states allow homeschooling. 

Internationally, unschooling is also legal in a variety of countries (including Australia and Canada). However, many countries have laws prohibiting home education in general or have strict restrictions.

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Homeschooling#General criticism|Homeschooling international status and statistics{{!}}Legality of homeschooling}}

Questions about the merits of unschooling raise concerns on its absence of the following qualities, compared to established systems:

* Socialization. Schools provide a ready-made group of peers, but unschooled children need other ways to make friends in their age group.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Objections" /&gt;
* Isolation. A child might not encounter people of other cultures, worldviews, and socioeconomic groups if they are not enrolled in a school. Of course, a school is not necessarily a place that is guaranteed to provide such a range of experiences, either.&lt;ref name="Objections" /&gt;
* Qualifications. Some parents may not have the skills required to guide and advise their children in life skills or help them pursue their own interests.&lt;ref name="Unspooling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayton"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15029646/ A new chapter in education: unschooling], by Victoria Clayton. MSNBC, October 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development. Children won't learn what they need to know in their adult lives.&lt;ref name="Objections"&gt;[http://www.naturalchild.org/common_objections/ Common Objections to Homeschooling], by John Holt, originally published as Chapter 2 of ''Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path for Education''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unspooling"&gt;''Unspooling Unschooling'', by [[Bonnie Erbe]], in "To the Contrary" blog on [[US News and World Report]] website, November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Standardization. A child may not learn the same things a regular-schooling peer does unless an educational professional controls what material is covered.&lt;ref name="Clayton"/&gt; In a 2006 study of five- to ten-year-olds, unschooling children scored below traditionally schooled children in 4 of 7 studied categories, and significantly below structured homeschoolers in all 7 studied categories.&lt;ref name=Martin-Chang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin-Chang|first1=Sandra|last2=Gould|first2= O.N. |last3=Meuse|first3= R.E. |title=The impact of schooling on academic achievement: Evidence from home-schooled and traditionally-schooled students|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|year=2011|volume=43|pages=195–202|doi=10.1037/a0022697|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232544669_The_impact_of_schooling_on_academic_achievement_Evidence_from_homeschooled_and_traditionally_schooled_students|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches of Unschooling==
There are a few branches of unschooling, one is Worldschooling, in which families travel around the world and learn through traveling and experiencing other cultures. Another version of unschooling, Project-Based Homeschooling, is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges, problems and projects that they can do in their own time.

==Complementary philosophies==

Some unschooling families may incorporate the following philosophies into their lifestyles. 
*[[Alfie Kohn|''Unconditional Parenting'']] and [[Alfie Kohn|''Punished by Rewards'']], parenting and education books by Alfie Kohn.
*[[Continuum concept|The Continuum Concept]], [[Attachment parenting|Attachment Parenting]], and [[Attachment theory|Attachment Theory]], theories and practices attempting to encourage the child's development.
*[[Voluntaryism]]: the idea that all forms of human association should be voluntary, as far as possible. Consequently, voluntaryism opposes the initiation of aggressive force or coercion.

== Other forms of alternative education ==
Many other forms of [[alternative education]] also place a great deal of importance on student control of learning, albeit not necessarily of the individual learner. This includes free [[democratic school]]s, like the [[Sudbury school]], [[Stonesoup School]] and "[[open learning]]" [[virtual university|virtual universities]].

'''Windycon''' is a [[science fiction convention]] held in [[Lombard, Illinois]], on the weekend closest to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]].

[[ISFiC]], the parent corporation that runs Windycon,&lt;ref name="pavlac"&gt;Pavlac, Ross, [http://www.isfic.org/WhatIs.asp What's an ISFiC], ISFiC Web Site, retrieved, 2015-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1973 in Chicago. The first Windycon was held the following year and has been held annually ever since either in Chicago or a Chicago suburb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfic.org/conspast.asp The Windycon Big List], Windycon Web Site, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is a general interest convention.

ISFiC and Windycon were founded to raise the profile of fandom in Chicago in preparation for a [[Worldcon]] bid.&lt;ref name="pavlac"/&gt;  In 1982, Chicon IV was the result.  From its small beginnings, Windycon has grown to have an annual membership hovering around 1300.  It is the largest of the two fan-run Chicago conventions.

Annually since 1986, ISFiC has hosted a writers contest, open to unpublished authors.  The contest is judged by professional authors and editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfic.org/Winners.asp|title=ISFiC, Inc.:  Writers Contest Winners|website=www.isfic.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, Windycon has hosted a writers' workshop under the coordination of [[Richard Chwedyk]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Foster | first = Adrienne | title = Next Manuscript, Please: Amazing Tales of the Worldcon Writers Workshop | newspaper = SFWA Bulletin | pages = 10  | date = August–September 2009 | accessdate = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional con activities, Windycon has also run a series of on-line chats during the con, hosting by Cybling.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Janice, [http://cybling.hypermart.net/windycon/index.html Windycon 26 Chats], Cybling, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Janice, [http://www.cybling.com/conventions/windyconxxix/chats.html Windycon 29 Chats], Cybling, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is calculated by dividing the number of students who choose to enroll at a school in a given year, which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit, by the total number of offers of acceptance sent. A higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education. The yield rate is usually calculated once per year based on admissions statistics. As a statistical measure, it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity, such that a higher yield rate is a sign of a more selective college. For example, the yield rate for [[Princeton University]] was 69% in 2016, while the yield rate for [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] was 55%, and the yield rate for [[Colorado College]] was 37%.&lt;ref name=twsZe23/&gt; The yield rate has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs; in 2001, a report in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' by reporter Daniel Golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or [[wait list]] well-qualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll, as a way to boost the college's overall yield rate; according to the report, these actions are part of an effort to improve a college's scores on the [[College_rankings#U.S._News_.26_World_Report_College_and_University_rankings|US News college ranking]].&lt;ref name=twsZe25/&gt;
