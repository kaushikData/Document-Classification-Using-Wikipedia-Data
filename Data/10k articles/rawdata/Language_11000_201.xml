The '''Act Respecting the Oath to the Succession''' (26 Hen. 8 c. 2) was passed by the [[Parliament of England]] in November 1534, and required all subjects to take an oath to uphold the [[First Succession Act|Act of Succession]] passed that March. It was later given the formal short title of the '''Succession to the Crown Act 1534'''.

The Act required all those asked to take the oath to recognise [[Anne Boleyn]] as [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s lawful wife and their children legitimate heirs to the throne. Anyone refusing to take the oath was guilty of treason.

The Oath of Succession itself went further than the original Act in several ways. It demanded that persons swearing the oath renounce the power of any "foreign authority or potentate" and repudiate any oath previously made to such an authority. This discrepancy did not go unnoticed by Sir [[Thomas More]] who claimed he had been sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] "for refusing of this oath not agreeable with the statute". He thought that [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] and [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]] "did of their own heads add more words unto it" and therefore they were unable "by their own law ... to justify my imprisonment".

Refusal to take the oath led to the arrests of Sir [[Thomas More]] and Bishop [[John Fisher]] for [[treason]] in 1534. They refused to take the oath because it included the abjuration of the [[pope]] and claimed the marriage between [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]] was annulled and it went against their [[Roman Catholic]] beliefs. More and Fisher were beheaded in 1535.

'''Alyutor''' or '''Alutor''' is a [[language]] of [[Russia]] that belongs to the Chukotkan branch of the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages]].

==Sociolinguistic situation ==
The Alutor are the indigenous inhabitants of the northern part of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. The language is unwritten and moribund; in the 1970s residents of the chief Alutor village of Vyvenka under the age of 25 did not know the language. In recent years the Vyvenka village school has started teaching the language. Until 1958 the language was considered the "village" (settled) dialect of the [[Koryak language]], but it is not intelligible with traditionally nomadic varieties of Koryak. The autonym {{IPA|[ˈnəməlʔən]}} means "villager".

=== Stress ===
Stress is generally on the second syllable of the word. However, it cannot fall on a schwa or the last syllable, so in two-syllable words stress is transferred to the first syllable, as long as that vowel is not a schwa. In cases where it is a schwa, a third syllable is added to the word,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and the second syllable is stressed.

Examples: {{IPA|/ˈmi.məl/}} 'water', {{IPA|/qə.ˈla.vul/}} 'husband', {{IPA|/pə.ˈla.kəl.ŋən/}} 'a [[mukluk]] (boot)', {{IPA|/ˈta.wə.ja.tək/}} 'to feed'.

=== Syllable structure ===
All Alyutor syllables begin with a single consonant. If the vowel is short, including a schwa, they may also close with a single consonant.

Examples are {{IPA|/vi.ˈta.tək/}} 'to work', {{IPA|/ˈtil.mə.til/}} 'eagle', {{IPA|/ˈʔit.ʔən/}} 'parka'.

Alyutor word boundaries always coincide with syllable boundaries.

== Morphology ==
Alyutor has the following parts of speech: nouns, adjectives, numerals, pronouns, verbs, participles, adverbs, postpositions, conjunctions, and "particles".

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are inflected for number, case, definiteness, and grammatical person.

There are three [[grammatical number]]s: singular, dual and plural.

There are eleven cases: [[absolutive]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[locative]], [[dative]] [[lative]], [[prolative]], contactive, [[causative]], equative, [[comitative]], and [[associative]].

Number and case are expressed using a single affix. A suffix is used for all cases except the comitative and associative, which are expressed using [[circumfix]]es. There are two [[declension]]s, taught as three noun classes. The first class are nonhuman nouns of the first declension. Number is only distinguished in the absolutive case, though verbal agreement may distinguish number when these nouns are in the ergative. The second class are proper names and kin terms for elders. They are second declension, and distinguish number in the ergative, locative, and lative cases, as well as the absolutive. The third class are the other human nouns; they may be either first or second declension.

==== Case roles ====
*The absolutive case is the citation form of a noun. It is used for the argument ("subject") of an intransitive clause and the object of a transitive clause, for "syntactic possessives",{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and for the [[vocative]].
*The ergative is used for the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb, as an [[instrumental case]], and as the argument of an [[antipassive]] clause.
*The locative is used for position and direction ([[essive]] and [[lative case]]s), as well as arguments which are "driven away" {{Clarify|date=January 2010}}
*The dative is used for recipients, benefactors, directional objects ([[allative case]]), and subjects of experiential verbs
*Lative is used for motion toward a goal
*Prolative is used for movement along and movement from ([[perlative]] and [[elative case]]s)
* Equative is used with the meanings 'like X', 'as X', usually with verbs like 'to become', 'to turn into', 'to work as,' etc.
* Contactive is used for objects that make contact
* Causative is used for noun phrases that cause or motivate an action
* Comitative is used for ... {{Clarify|date=January 2010}}
* Associative is used for ... {{Clarify|date=January 2010}}. It is only attested in the declension of nouns of the first declension, usually inanimate.

==== Grammatical person ====
Grammatical first and second person suffixes on nouns are used to equate a noun with participants in the discourse. They only appear in the absolutive, with an intervening ''j'' on nouns ending in a vowel and an ''i'' on nouns ending in a consonant.

===Verbs===
There are finite (conjugated) and non-finite verbs. There are several conjugations.

====Polypersonal conjugation====
Finite verbs agree in person and number with their nuclear [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]]; agreement is through both prefixes and suffixes. Transitive verbs agree with both arguments (ergative and absolutive), whereas intransitive verbs agree with their sole (absolutive) argument.

Verbs distinguish two aspects, [[perfective]], the bare stem, and [[imperfective]], using the suffix ''-tkə / -tkən / -tkəni''. There are five moods, [[Realis mood|indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Optative mood|optative]], potential (marked by the circumfix ''ta…(ŋ)''), and conjunctive (prefix ''ʔ-/a-'').

==== Monopersonal conjugation ====
Monopersonal verbs{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} include two declensions, one with the third-person singular in ''ɣa-...-lin,'' and the other in ''n-...-qin.

==== Impersonal conjugation ====
For impersonal forms of conjugation include verbal predicate (formed with the circumfix a…ka) and imperative (formed by circumfix ɣa…a/ta). Non-finite forms Impersonal forms include the verbal predicate{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} with the circumfix ''a…ka,'' and the imperative in ''ɣa…a/ta.''

==== Non-finite forms ====
These include the infinitive, [[supine]], gerunds, and participles.

{{Bahram Beyzai sidebar}}
'''Bahrām Beyzāie''' (also spelt '''Beizai''', '''Beyza'i''', {{lang-fa|بهرام بیضائی}}, born 26 December 1938) is a critically and popularly acclaimed filmmaker, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, and ''[[ostad|ostād]]'' ("master") of Persian letters, arts and [[Iranian studies]].

Bahram Beyzaie is the son of the poet [[Ne'matallah Beyzai]] (best known by his literary pseudonym "Zokā'i").&lt;ref&gt;Two thousand verse lines by ''Zokā'i Beyzāie'', of a total of six thousand, were published in 1978 (1357 [[Iranian calendar|AH]]) in a book entitled ''Yad-e Bayzā'' (The White Hand); ''Bayzā'' in Persian is the literary word for ''White''. See Arash Fanā'iān, ''Gofteman-e Iran'', January 20, 2008. [http://www.goftman-iran.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=922&amp;Itemid=11]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrated poet [[Adib Beyzai]], known as one of the most profound poets of 20th-century [[Iran]], is Bahram's paternal uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Arash Fanā'iān, ''Gofteman-e Iran'', January 20, 2008. [http://www.goftman-iran.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=922&amp;Itemid=11]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. It is noteworthy that Adib Ali Beyzāie's son, Hossein Beyzāie, is also a poet; his literary pseudonym is ''Partow'' (Ray of Light).&lt;/ref&gt; Bahram Beyzaie's paternal grandfather, Mirzā Mohammad-Rezā Ārāni ("Ebn Ruh"), and paternal great-grandfather, the mulla Mohammad-Faqih Ārāni ("Ruh'ol-Amin"), were also notable poets.&lt;ref&gt;Arash Fanā'iān, ''Gofteman-e Iran'', January 20, 2008. [http://www.goftman-iran.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=922&amp;Itemid=11]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of his somewhat belated start in cinema, Beyzai is often considered a pioneer of a generation of filmmakers whose works are sometimes described as the [[Iranian New Wave]]. His ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' (1986) was voted "Best Iranian Film of all time" in November 1999 by a Persian movie magazine ''Picture World'' poll of 150 Iranian critics and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;''Picture World'' (''Donyaye Tassvir''), No. 74, November 1999, {{ISSN|1023-2613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, even before the outset of his cinematic career in 1970, he was a leading playwright (as well as theater historian), so much so that he is often considered the greatest playwright of the [[Persian language]], and holds a reputation as "the Shakespeare of Persia."{{sfn|Hasani|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ca6jwXasY Abbas Milani's speech, Toronto, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Beyzai has lived and taught at [[Stanford University]], [[United States]].

==Early years==
Beyzaie was born in [[Tehran]], to a poet, anthologist and biographer father and a housewife mother. Zokā'i Beyzāie made a living through a legal occupation and was able to attend to his literary interests reasonably.

The young Bahram did not seem very interested in his family legacy, being poetry, which was pursued by his father, uncles and cousins. In high school, the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar'ol-Fonoun]],&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated report on Dar'ol-Fonoun see: Hamid-Reza Hosseini, ''Dar'ol-Fonoun in want of Love'' ("Dar'ol-Fonoun dar hasrat-e eshq"), in Persian, Jadid Online, September 22, 2008, [http://www.jadidonline.com/stry/22092008/frnk/darolfonoon]. The pertinent photographs (15 in total) can be viewed here: [http://www.jadidonline.com/slideshow/695/1]. The following is the photograph of what used to be the [[amphitheatre]] of Dar'ol-Fonoun: [http://www.jadidonline.com/slideshow/695/13].&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote two historical plays which went on to become his preferred method of writing. He started skipping school from around the age of 17 in order to go to movies which were becoming popular in Iran at a rapid pace. This only fed his hunger to learn more about cinema and Iranian visual arts.
[[File:Darolfonun.jpg|thumb|Beyzai attended the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar'ol-Fonoun]] high school as an adolescent, where he did not spend a good time getting along, skipped classes and went to the movies, and in his late teens composed his earliest dramatic pieces.]]
After school, and after a year of waiting before passing the competitive examination for university admission and meanwhile reading the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', he began to study [[Persian literature]] at the [[University of Tehran]]. But it became impossible for him to stay in the university, particularly because his professors would not accept his researching [[Persian theatre]] as a graduate work, arguing that "Persia has had no theatre."
[[File:دانشکده ادبیات دانشگاه تهران.jpg|thumb|'''[[Faculty of Letters and Humanities of the University of Tehran|Faculty of Letters of the University of Tehran]]'''
----
Beyzai dropped out of the undergraduate program in [[Persian literature]] in the Faculty of Letters in 1959, only to return to the adjacent [[Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Tehran|Faculty of Fine Arts]] as a visiting professor about a decade later, where he remained a leading professor for another decade before he was expelled in the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]] (1980).]]
At the age of 21 he did substantial research on the traditional Persian plays, particularly [[Ta'zieh]], and by 1961 he had already spent a great deal of time studying and researching other ancient [[Persian people|Persian]] and pre-[[Islamic]] culture and literature. This in turn led him to studying Eastern theatre and traditional Iranian theatre and arts which would help him formulate a new non-Western identity for Iranian theatre. He also became acquainted with Persian painting.

==Playwriting in the 1960s==
By late 1961 he had already published numerous articles in various arts and literary journals. In 1962 he made his first short film (4 minutes) in 8&amp;nbsp;mm format. In the next two years he wrote several plays and published "Theatre in Japan".

In the next eight or so years of his life throughout the early to late 1960s, Bayzai dedicated himself to writing in various publications about Eastern art and Persian literature enabled through his extensive study and also wrote a number of essays about Iranian cinema which later became the subject of one of his books. It is during this period that he wrote popular plays which are often regarded as masterpieces; ''[[Sindbad's Eighth Voyage]]'', ''Banquet'', ''Serpent King'', ''[[The Marionettes]]'', ''The Story of the Hidden Moon'' and many more.

In 1968, Beyzai was one of the nine founders of the [[Iranian Writers' Guild]], a highly controversial organization in the face of [[censorship]]. In 1969 he was invited to teach at the Theater Department of the College of Fine Arts at University of Tehran. He chaired this department from 1972 to 1979. With his readership many prominent authors and artists started teaching at the department and created the most fruitful period in the history of that department.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TheMarionettes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Marionettes puppet play]] --&gt;
Beyzaie's early study and interest in [[drama]] and the theatre is well known, but less well-known is his early work as a dramatist. As a young man Beyzaie had always been fascinated by the traditions of Iranian [[theatre]], and this included the [[puppet]] theatre. His "Se Nemayeshname-ye 'Arusaki" ("Three Puppet Plays") was published in 1963, and ''[[The Marionettes]]'' was the first one of these three plays. But for all that it is unmistakably based on the model of the traditional [[puppet]] theatre, "The Marionettes" is shaped by other traditions, too. It is the work of someone au fait with the work of [[Pirandello]] and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. In the 1960s, plays by dramatists such as [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]] and [[Ionesco]] were often translated into the [[Persian language]] and performed in Iran soon after their premieres in the West). Drawing on these varied influences, Beyzaie's play is a little-known master-piece of 20th-century drama. 
Beyzaie's groundbreaking ''[[A Study on Iranian Theatre]]'' (Namayesh dar Iran), published in mid-1960s is still considered the most important text on the history of Iranian theater. Beyzaie is also the first scholar in Iran to publish books on [[theatre of Japan]] and [[theatre of China]].

Some of his plays, such as his masterpiece ''[[Death of Yazdgerd]]'', have been translated into numerous languages and have been performed around the world. ''[[Death of Yazdgerd]]'' has been performed in Iran, France, England, India and USA among other countries, and was made into a highly acclaimed [[Death of Yazdgerd (film)|film of the same name]] by Beyzai in 1981. ''Death of Yazdgerd'' and ''[[Kalat Claimed]]'' have been translated into English by [[Manuchehr Anvar]].

==1970s and the outset of a cinematic career==
&lt;!-- This use of this image has no rationale on the image's page. Please read [[Wikipedia:NFCC#10c]] [[File:BashutheLittleStranger.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]] (1989)]] --&gt;
In 1969 he began his film career by directing the short film ''Amu Sibilou'' (Uncle Moustache) followed by "Safar" in 1970. With these films Beyzai is often supposed to be a pioneer of what is called the [[Iranian New Wave]], a [[Persian cinema]] movement that is supposed to have spontaneously started in the late 1960s, i.e. ignoring earlier efforts by filmmakers such as [[Farrokh Ghaffari]] and [[Ebrahim Golestan]], and includes other outstanding directors such as [[Nasser Taghvai]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Amir Naderi]], [[Ali Hatami]], [[Sohrab Shahid Sales]], [[Dariush Mehrjui]], [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Parviz Kimiavi]], [[Masoud Kimiai]] and [[Fereydun Gole]] among others; and soon following [[Khosrow Sinai]], [[Masoud Jafari Jozani]], [[Kianoush Ayari]], [[Varuzh Karim-Masihi]], [[Ebrahim Hatamikia]] and others.

Immediately after, in 1971, he made his first feature film "Ragbar" ("[[Downpour (film)|Downpour]]") which is regarded by critics to this day as one of the most successful Iranian films ever made. The successful film addresses the late [[Parviz Fannizadeh]] as its central character and [[protagonist]].

Since then he has produced and directed 8 films including ''Qaribe va Meh (Stranger and the Fog)'' (1974), ''Cherike-ye Tara (Ballad of Tara)'' (1979), ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' (1986, released in 1989), ''Shāyad Vaghti digar (Maybe another time)'' (1988) and ''Mosaferan (Travellers)'' (1992).

==Filmmaking in the 1980s==
In 1981, the revolutionary leaders started the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]], as a result of which Beyzaie among many others was expelled from the university. He continued writing and making films though. His screenplay ''Ruz-e Vaqe'e'' (''[[The Fateful Day]]'') was adapted into a film in 1995 and another screenplay was adapted into a film named ''Fasl-e Panjom'' (The fifth season) in 1996, whilst he also made four of his finest films. He also edited [[Ebrahim Hatamikia]]'s ''Borj-e Minu (Minoo Tower)''.

==1990s: another trip, a film and some plays==
He married the actress and make-up artist [[Mozhdeh Shamsai]] in 1992. After ''Mosaferan'', he failed to get a permit for the production of a number of screenplays. In 1995 he left Iran for [[Strasbourg]] at the invitation of the [[International Cities of Refuge Network|International Parliament of Writers]]. Soon however he returned and staged ''[[The Lady Aoi (Bahram Beyzai production)|The Lady Aoi]]'' in Tehran.

==After 2000==
In 2001 he made his best-selling film ''[[Killing Mad Dogs]]'', after which he managed to stage three plays as well before he left Iran for the United States.

He left Iran in 2010 at the invitation of [[Stanford University]], and has since been the Daryabari Visiting Professor of Iranian Studies, teaching courses in Persian theatre, cinema and mythology. There he has given workshops on the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the history of Iranian performing arts, Iranian as well as Semitic myths, etc.  He has also staged several of his plays including his nine-hour ''[[Tarabnameh]]''.

==Cinematic style==

He is known as the most intellectual and conspicuous "author" in [[Iranian cinema]] and theater. The main theme of his works is the [[history]] and "crisis of identity" which is related to Iranian cultural and mythical symbols and paradigms. He is considered as Iran's most prominent screenwriter in terms of dramatic integrity of his works, many of which have been made into films.

==Reception and criticism==
Beyzaie has made significant contribution to the development of the [[cinema of Iran]] and theatre and is regarded as an influential director and innovator of the [[Iranian New Wave]] movement of cinema. He is also considered Iran's most prominent screenwriter in terms of dramatic integrity of his works, many of which have been made into films.

However, despite the value of his films and his substantial knowledge of the arts, like many other Iranian film directors such as [[Nasser Taghvai]], [[Varuzh Karim-Masihi]], [[Kianoush Ayari]] and many others, the [[Government of Iran]] has almost never supported his career, before and after the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]]. Before the revolution he was handed in the best prize by the Queen Farah Diba in Tehran Film festival in 1972 as a new young director whose talent was lauded with appreciation and applaud for his Film Ragbar. After revolution now even after some 20 years, his films such as ''Ballad of Tara'' (1980) and ''Death of Yazdgerd'' (1981) have never received a screening permit in Iran. Both films have been shelved because they are not in accordance with the [[Islamic]] code currently in operation in Iranian motion pictures. Even ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' almost saw the same fate in 1986 due to the subject matter of the film, i.e. the story of a little orphaned boy who lost his parents in the Iran-Iraqi war. The film was only legalized after the end of the [[1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War]] and was released in 1989.

Critics have often praised Beyzai above all Persian filmmakers as well as playwrights. He was voted the best Persian filmmaker of all time in 2002, and his ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' was voted the finest Persian film of all time. All the same, his formalism has occasionally raised criticism, even from himself. [[Ebrahim Golestan]], who had previously made objections to Beyzai's style, praised him in a letter in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">[[File:Nikiszowiec 100.JPG|thumb|CHWDP graffiti]]
[[File:HWDP.jpg|thumb|A two-metre-tall inscription on a wall in Poland]]
'''CHWDP''' or '''HWDP''' (read ''ha-voo-de-pe'') is a frequently used acronym of the Polish phrase ''chuj w dupę policji'', literally meaning "(put a) dick in the police's ass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miejski.pl/slowo-HWDP|title=HWDP - Miejski słownik slangu i mowy potocznej|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2012}} It can be seen as a Polish equivalent to the English-language phrase [[A.C.A.B.|ACAB]] ("All Cops Are Bastards"), although is more accurately translated as ''fuck the police''.

This vulgar slogan, often written on a wall, is used as a form of provocation against the police, but also as a "trademark." Writing of the HWDP characters, visible from a great distance, is a ''[[de facto]]'' form of aggressive [[vandalism]], with potential consequenses including lowered value of flats near the marked objects. The acronym was largely popularised by the [[Polish hip hop]] music, where it is often used in lyrics. It is a specific expression of protest against the authorities, and against "the system" in general. 

Correct spelling of the acronym, according to [[Polish orthography]], is CHWDP, with [[Ch (digraph)|Ch]] digraph in the beginning. However, common mistake is a misspelling of ''chuj'' as ''huj'', against orthography rules, but  pronounced the same, hence often seen HWDP acronym.

==Popularity==

The slogan is already very important in Poland, and its popularity is spreading to other countries, most notably [[Slovakia]] and [[Germany]]. Pranksters have used it in England.&lt;ref name="DailyStar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauley|first=Nigel|title=POLICE WARNED ABOUT POLISH PRANKSTERS|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/134985/Police-warned-about-Polish-pranksters/|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Star|date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The popularity of this slogan is rapidly growing.

===Alternate expansions===

One of the ways in which the popularity of the acronym is easily noticed is that it was given many alternative expansions. Still, the basic meaning is generally known. Others are merely jokes that are sometimes used to avoid awkward situations and to relieve the tension, e.g. when people who propagate this abbreviation talk with the police or by the policemen who want to avoid embarrassment when they are asked to expand the abbreviation during interviews.&lt;ref name="nowiny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowiny.rybnik.pl/index.php?me=a&amp;id=4425|title=Litery niewinne|author=Sarapkiewicz, Małgorzata|date=20 października 2004|publisher=Nowiny|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/0,1563131,0,4,policja-wyjasnia--co-znaczy-hwdp,wiadomosc.html|title=Policja wyjaśnia, co znaczy HWDP|date=31 August 2008|publisher=TVN24|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread on the Internet===
However, the popularity of this acronym is not limited to it being spraypainted on the walls in Poland. In fact, the acronym has also spread among the Internet users, both Polish and foreign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.si/#hl=pt-PT&amp;source=hp&amp;q=CHWDP&amp;btnG=Pesquisa+do+Google&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=CHWDP&amp;fp=97dca6c02dbe1e0f|title=Google|website=www.google.si|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times players of a popular online game Spartan wars by Tap4fun that have had run ins with game moderators have changed their character names to HWDP taking a swing at the moderators as they are essentially the games policing unit

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
The slogan is also popular in Czech Republic,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} where it is written as ČDPP, standing for ''Čůrák do prdele policii'',{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} meaning the same as the Polish ''Chuj w dupę policji''; i.e. ''Fuck the police in the ass''. However, its Polish counterparts, CHWDP and HWDP, are just as common in the Czech Republic as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The slogan can be found in Slovakia as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.sk/search?hl=sk&amp;source=hp&amp;fkt=&amp;fsdt=&amp;q=CHWDP&amp;btnG=H%C4%BEada%C5%A5+v+Google&amp;meta=cr=countrySK|title=CHWDP - Hľadať Googlom|website=www.google.sk|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charu Sheel Singh''' ({{lang-hi|चारु शील सिंह}}, born 1955) is an [[India]]n writer and scholar of [[English language|English]] language. A treader of the triple path, like Arnold, Eliot and Sri Aurobindo, Charu Sheel Singh is a poet, critic and literary theorist and is not only well acquainted with current schools of thought but also conversant with philosophical theories of the East and the West and the occult traditions, Buddhism and theosophy being among his special areas of interest. He is well known for writing poems and criticism in [[English language|English]]. He is a professor of [[English literature]] in [[Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth]]. He received the ''Maharashtra Dalit Sahitya Akademy Award'' and The Best Writer Award by Penguin International. He is considered to be one of the best mythifiers of the city of [[Varanasi]] and his ''Kashi'': A Mandala Poem is the only epic in English language on the city of ''Kashi''&lt;ref name=" rajnishmishravns"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rajnishmishravns.wordpress.com/2017/06/24/kashi-a-mandala-poem/|title=Kashi: A Mandala Poem|author=rajnishmishravns |date= 2017|work= |publisher= |accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Charu Sheel Singh was born on 15 May 1955. His father, Pratap Narayan Singh was a ''Sahitya Ratna'' and a Poet. He took his Master’s degree in English from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] in 1976. In 1978, he was awarded Ph.D. degree in English by [[Banaras Hindu University]]. He is married to Maya and they have a son Padmasambhava.

==Legacy==
Kashi: A Mandala Poem, published in 2007, is considered as one of the very few epics in English on a city. It synthesizes puranic myths with modern science and postmodern theory to create a modern-day epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The City of Varanasi in Literature|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_Varanasi_in_Literature#Varanasi_in_English_Literature|website=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in a modern language, with an ancient tradition flowing into the veins of the City Eternal: Varanasi.

Charu Sheel Singh is also known for his unique style of bringing philosophy, yoga and tantra to visit poetry and myths. His poetry is full of instances of this happy confluence of modern with ancient, of traditional with personal and of myths with quantum theory.

Charu Sheel Singh has been reviewed in commonwealth literature, USA. He is also reviewed in a quarterly journal BLAKE from Rochester University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Mary V.|title=Charu Sheel Singh. The Chariot of Fire: A Study of William Blake in the Light of Hindu Thought|url=http://bq.blakearchive.org/18.2.jackson|website=blakearchive.org|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book Contemporary Literary Theory is listed in Reader’s Guide To English Literature published by Routledge publishers, Abingdon, United Kingdom. His originality and strength of mythical imagination has led poetry lovers to work upon his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Srivastava|first1=Preeti Bala|title=THE POETRY OF CHARU SHEEL SINGH: A STUDY IN PHILOSOPHICAL DIMENSIONS|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/111131/3/1%20front%20pages.pdf|website=shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cold ironing''',&lt;ref name="CTPx"&gt;[http://crosstree.info/Documents/ColdIroning.pdf] Article: Cold-Iron the Ships by Capt. Pawanexh Kohli&lt;/ref&gt; or '''shore connection''', '''shore-to-ship power''' (SSP) or '''alternative maritime power''' ('''AMP'''),  is the process of providing shoreside [[electric power|electrical power]] to a [[ship]] at [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] while its main and auxiliary [[engine]]s are turned off. Cold ironing permits emergency equipment, [[refrigeration]], cooling, heating, [[lighting]] and other equipment to receive continuous electrical power while the ship loads or unloads its [[cargo]]. [[Shorepower]] is a general term to describe supply of electric power to ships, small craft, aircraft and road vehicles while stationary.

Cold ironing is a [[shipping|shipping industry]] term that first came into use when all ships had [[coal]]-fired engines. When a ship tied up at port there was no need to continue to feed the fire and the iron engines would literally cool down, eventually going completely cold, hence the term ''cold ironing''.

Shutting down main engines while in [[port]] continues as a majority practice.  However, auxiliary diesel generators that power cargo handling equipment and other ship's services while in port are the primary source of air emissions from ships in ports today, because the auxiliaries run on heavy fuel oil or bunkers. Cold ironing mitigates harmful emissions from [[diesel engine]]s by connecting a ship's load to a more environmentally friendly, shore-based source of electrical power. An alternative is to run auxiliary diesels either on gas (LNG or LPG) or extra low sulphur distillate fuels, however if noise pollution is a problem, then cold ironing becomes the only option.

A ship can cold iron by simply connecting to another ship's power supply. Naval ships  have standardized processes and equipment for this procedure. However, this does not change the power source type nor does it eliminate the source of air pollution.

The source for land-based power may be grid power from an electric utility company, but also possibly an external remote generator. These generators may be powered by diesel or renewable energy sources such as wind, water or solar.

Shore power saves consumption of fuel that would otherwise be used to power vessels while in port, and eliminates the air pollution associated with consumption of that fuel. Use of shore power facilitates maintenance of the ship's engines and generators, and reduces noise.

==Background==
Unlike navies, whose ships can berth for extended periods at their bases, [[merchant ships]] have shorter port stays, during which they sustain electrical loads through on-board fossil fuel powered electrical generators (auxiliary engines).  Oceangoing ships have generally not been subject to emissions controls, so [[merchant vessel]]s throughout the world have been using [[Bunker fuel|Bunker Fuel or HFO]] – which is residual petroleum – as the optimal choice of fuel. This fuel has high [[Particulate|particulate matter]]. Studies show that a single ship can produce particulate emissions equal to the same amount as 50 million cars annually.&lt;ref name="slideshare_net-cold-ironing-ships"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold ironing ships|url=http://www.slideshare.net/pxkohli/cold-ironing-ships}} Article: Cold-Iron the Ships by Capt. Pawanexh Kohli; 090909 slideshare.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es071686z | volume=41 | issue=24 | title=Mortality from Ship Emissions: A Global Assessment | year=2007 | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=8512–8518 | last1 = Corbett | first1 = James J. | last2 = Winebrake | first2 = James J. | last3 = Green | first3 = Erin H. | last4 = Kasibhatla | first4 = Prasad | last5 = Eyring | first5 = Veronika | last6 = Lauer | first6 = Axel| bibcode=2007EnST...41.8512C }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates 60,000 cardio-pulmonary mortalities due to particulate matter from ship emissions. These deaths have been detected far inland, due to prevailing wind conditions. The total world trading fleet stands at 50,000+ [[merchant ships]] (Lloyds data as of January 2008). Each ship spends some 100 days in port in a year.

''For every {{convert|1|kWh|MJ|abbr=on}} of electricity, about 200&amp;nbsp;g of [[bunker fuel]] is consumed. Each 1&amp;nbsp;kg of bunker oil generates 3.1&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon dioxide. It is assessed that globally ships use 411,223,484 tonnes of fuel annually.''

[[image:Marpol6.png|thumb]]
Keeping these reports in mind, new regulatory norms have been mandated by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO). The level of sulphur is one of the benchmarks in measuring quality of fuel and [[MARPOL 73/78|Marpol Annex VI]] requires use of &lt;4.5% sulphur fuel, effective 2010. The target is to reduce world maritime sulphur output to &lt;0.5% by 2020. Some regions (e.g., California) already require ships switch to cleaner fuel when in their local waters.

Cold ironing does away with the need to burn [[fossil fuel]] on board the ships while they are docked. Under this concept as it is promulgated, ships visiting ports are hooked on to local [[grid power]] or other power sources, which are already regulated by local pollution norms.  This externally sourced power serves the ship's internal cargo handling machinery and hotelling requirements. Effectively, all the power generating sources are shut down and ship is hence cold-ironed.
This brings immediate relief from pollution by shipboard emissions and allows a more holistic maintenance schedule to be followed by ship operators, which are typically hard put to maintain planned maintenance schedules due to commercial operating pressures. The immediate result is lowered heat outputs from ships, lowered air emissions, lowered risk of accidents from fuel based machinery, lowered disturbance to the [[ecosystem]], among various others.

==Concerns and problems==
* Incompatibility of electricity parameters: ships, having been built in diverse international yards, have no uniform voltage and frequency requirement.&lt;ref name="CTPx" /&gt; Some ships use 220 volts at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, some at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, some others use 110 volts. Primary distribution voltage can vary from 440 volts to 11 kilovolts.
* Wide variations in load requirements, from a few hundred kW in case of car carriers to a dozen or more MW in case of passenger ships or [[reefer ship]]s.
* Connectors and cables are not internationally standardised, though work has progressed in this direction. 
* There are other legal implications to outsourcing primary power source{{vague|cite doesn't specify either|date=November 2014}}.&lt;ref name="CTPx" /&gt; The legal implications stem from possible impact levels in international trade, commercial responsibilities of stakeholders and other risk as assessed.
* Some ports have glass fiber data communication systems installed. The standard for data communication via glass fiber should be as set in the IEC/IEEE 80005 par 2 standard, published in 2016.

All these problems are addressable and work has already begun in reducing ship emissions by cold ironing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/jul/10/1n10air23265-new-programs-strike-blow-clean-air/ News: San Diego approves funds for cold-ironing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. State of California is requiring a percentage of ships calling there to use shore power by 2014. The [[Port of Oakland]] is implementing a High Voltage Shore Connection (HVSC) at 6,600 volts.  The first [[Hapag-Lloyd]] vessel to use the system, ''Dallas Express,'' docked there in December 2012. The electrical and mechanical equipment to interface the ship's electrical load with the shore power is in a 40-foot container at the vessel's stern. Initially 15 Hapag-Lloyd ships will receive the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hapag-lloyd.com/en/press_and_media/press_release_page_27551.html Hapag-Lloyd connects first ship to shore power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121190507/http://www.hapag-lloyd.com/en/press_and_media/press_release_page_27551.html |date=2013-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] carried out a study of cold ironing and alternatives in 2016 that pointed out a number of problems, including the high peak power demand (13 MW for a cruise  ship, 3 MW for a container ship) and the high cost of providing the necessary equipment and upgraded electrical power infrastructure for Boston Harbor. It also expressed concern about loss of competitiveness without a U.S. East Coast regional agreement to install such systems. The ports of Halifax and Brooklyn have installed cold ironing at one cruise-ship berth each at a cost of $10 and $20 million, respectively, mostly paid by government grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.massport.com/media/403886/Massport-Report-Shore-Power.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220223358/http://www.massport.com/media/403886/Massport-Report-Shore-Power.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3672">A '''conversation opener''' is an introduction used to begin a [[conversation]]. They are frequently the subject of guides and [[seminar]]s on how to make friends and/or meet people. Different situations may call for different openers (e.g. approaching a stranger on the street versus meeting them at a more structured gathering of people with like interests).

An opener often takes the form of an open-ended question, which can lead to further comments or [[conversation]] as well as creating topics for future conversations (e.g. "How's your mandrill doing?").

A closed-ended question (e.g. "Nice weather today, isn't it?") is regarded as potentially less effective because it can be answered with a simple "Mm-hmm," which is essentially a conversational dead end, requiring the initiater of the conversation to start from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/interviews/open-ended-questions.html Media College]: Open-Ended Questions&lt;/ref&gt;

''How to Start a Conversation'' notes that in conversation openers, "There really are only two topics to choose from &amp;ndash; The situation [or] the other person. Secondly, there are only two ways to begin a conversation: State a fact [or] ask a question/opinion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persuasion-skills.co.uk/system/viewarticle.asp?ANUM=4 Persuasion Skills Ltd] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060925005828/http://www.persuasion-skills.co.uk/system/viewarticle.asp?ANUM=4 |date=2006-09-25 }}: How to Start a Conversation&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, openers are often linked to props, e.g. "Do you have a cigarette?" "Wow, you're reading ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', that's one of my favorite books..." "I like your skirt, where did you get it?" etc. Many venues, such as singles tennis events, etc. are geared toward prop-based conversation openers. Some people keep conversation pieces for this purpose.

Judy Ringer's ''We Have to Talk: A Step-By-Step Checklist for Difficult Conversations'' points out that an entirely different set of openers may be used for sensitive conversations, e.g. about employee performance, in which a main goal may be to avoid putting the person on the defensive. These openers often take the form of I statements, e.g. "I have something I’d like to discuss with you that I think will help us work together more effectively".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hodu.com/checklist.shtml We Have to Talk: A Step-By-Step Checklist for Difficult Conversations] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711052446/http://hodu.com/checklist.shtml |date=2012-07-11 }} by Judy Ringer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversation openers in sales settings==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}In sales settings, conversation openers often are used to probe the subject for information. Topic chosen are on 'safe ground' like 'the weather' or 'how was your journey to get here'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallas.net/~scotpeck/saleswebpage/conver.htm Sales Feature Article "Conversation Openers"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/19991105120622/http://www.dallas.net/~scotpeck/saleswebpage/conver.htm |date=1999-11-05 }} by Scott Peck&lt;/ref&gt; This information can then be used in attempts to counter objections.

This type of conversation opener is often referred to as [[small talk]] and is used to make both people in a conversation feel comfortable. The book ''Get Noticed''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wegetnoticed.com Get Noticed] Get Noticed' by Marcus A Taylor and Rob Lawrence&lt;/ref&gt; by Marcus A Taylor and Rob Lawrence explains how mastering the art of small talk involves active listening, being up to date with current affairs as well as identifying common interests to develop the conversation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">In [[medicine]] the term '''course''' generally takes one of two meanings, both reflecting the sense of "[[Wiktionary:course|path that something or someone moves along...process or sequence or steps]]":
* A '''course of [[medication]]''' is a period of continual treatment with drugs, sometimes with variable dosage and in particular combinations. For instance treatment with some drugs should not end abruptly. Instead, their '''course''' should end with a tapering dosage.

:* [[Antibiotics]]: Taking the full course of antibiotics is important to prevent reinfection and/or development of drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/information/generalhealth/antibiotics/ Antibiotics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216000000/http://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/information/generalhealth/antibiotics/ |date=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* [[Steroids]]:  For both short-term and long-term steroid treatment, when stopping treatment, the dosage is tapered rather than abruptly ended.  This permits the [[adrenal gland]]s to resume the body's natural production of [[cortisol]].  Abrupt discontinuation can result in [[adrenal insufficiency]]; and/or steroid withdrawal syndrome (a [[rebound effect]] in which exaggerated symptoms return).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stillsdisease.org/steroids.htm Steroids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425170234/http://www.stillsdisease.org/steroids.htm |date=2006-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* [[fulminant]] or [[Acute (medical)|peracute]]: particularly acute, especially if unusually violent

A patient may be said to be at the beginning, the middle or the end, or at a particular stage of the course of a disease or a treatment. A precursor is a sign or event that precedes the course or a particular stage in the course of a disease, for example chills often are precursors to fevers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/precursor]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cuvée'''''&lt;ref&gt;Or '''Cuvee''' on some English-language labels.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|kyve}}) is a [[French language|French]] [[wine]] term that derives from ''cuve'', meaning vat or tank.&lt;ref name="OCW cuvée"&gt;J. Robinson (ed), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 218, Oxford University Press 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCW-cuvee&gt;winepros.com.au. {{cite web|last= ''The Oxford Companion to Wine''|title= cuvee|url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=904|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080809122906/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=904|archivedate= 2008-08-09|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine makers use the term ''cuvée'' with several different meanings, more or less based on the concept of a tank of wine put to some purpose.

==Wines==
''Cuvée'' on [[wine label]]s generally denotes wine of a specific blend or batch. Since the term ''cuvée'' for this purpose is unregulated, and most wines have been stored in a vat or tank at some stage of production, the presence of the word ''cuvée'' on a label of an arbitrary producer is no guarantee of superior quality. However, discerning producers who market both regular blends and blends they call "''cuvée''..." usually reserve the word for special blends or selected vats of higher quality—at least in comparison to that producer's regular wines. Particularly terms like ''cuvée speciale'', or ''tête de cuvée'' (the latter especially in [[Sauternes AOC]]) are supposed to indicate higher quality. In this context, higher-quality than ordinary cuvées are often referred to as ''[[reserve wine]]s'', while a ''cuvée'' lower in quality than the main one is a ''[[second wine]]''.

In some regions, ''cuvée'' specifically means a blend, i.e., a wine produced from a mixture of several grape varieties, rather than from a single variety. This is especially true outside France.

In [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]], and sometimes other regions, [[sparkling wine production|producing]] [[sparkling wine]]s by the traditional method, ''cuvée'' also refers to the best grape juice from gentle [[pressing (wine)|pressing]] of the grapes. In Champagne, the cuvée is the first 2,050 litres of grape juice from 4,000&amp;nbsp;kg of grapes (a ''marc''), while the following 500 litres are known as the ''taille'' (tail), and are expected to give wines of a coarser character. Many Champagne producers pride themselves on only using the cuvée in their wine.

==Other food and drink==
The term can also apply to [[beer]], or to chocolate to refer to a batch that is blended by the manufacturers to produce a certain taste. Many [[lambics]] and [[gueuze]]s—sour beers with wine-like characteristics—are marketed as ''cuvée''. When referring to beer, ale, or chocolate the term has no defined meaning, but is meant to evoke images of higher quality—similar to the use of "reserve" for wine in areas where the term is not regulated by law.

The term can also apply to [[cognac]]. For instance, 3.140 ''cuvée'', which is not labelled with the standard classifications of VS, VSOP or XO a minimum of six years before bottling.

'''Pudding wines''', sometimes called '''dessert wines''',  are sweet [[wine]]s typically served with [[dessert]].

There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchscout.com/types-of-white-wines|title=The 7 major types of white wines}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fortified wines]] ([[fino]] and [[amontillado]] [[sherry]]) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines ([[port wine|port]] and [[Madeira wine|madeira]]) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as [[Pedro Ximénez]] sherry and [[Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise AOC|Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise]], are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% [[alcohol by volume]], which includes all fortified wines - and is taxed more highly as a result. This dates back to a time when the US wine industry only made dessert wines by fortification, but such a classification is outdated now that modern [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] and [[viticulture]] can produce dry wines over 15% without fortification, yet German dessert wines can contain half that amount of alcohol.

Examples include [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] and [[Tokaji|Tokaji Aszú]].

==Methods of production==
[[Image:Yquem99.jpg|upright|thumb|Château d'Yquem 1999, a noble rot wine]]
Makers of dessert wines want to produce a wine containing high levels of both [[Sugars in wine|sugar]] and alcohol, yet the alcohol is made from sugar. There are many ways to increase [[Sweetness of wine|sugar levels]] in the final wine:
* grow grapes so that they '''naturally''' have sugar to spare for both sweetness and alcohol.
* '''add sugar''', either:
** before fermentation as sugar or honey ('''[[Chaptalization]]''')
** after fermentation as unfermented [[must]] ('''[[Süssreserve]]''').
* '''add alcohol''' (typically brandy) before all the sugar is fermented, this is called '''[[Fortified wine|fortification]]''', or '[[mutage]]'.
* '''remove water''' to concentrate the sugar:
** In warm climates, by air drying the grapes to make '''[[raisin wine]]'''
** In frosty climates, by freezing out some of the water to make '''ice wine'''
** In damp temperate climates, by using a fungal infection, ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'', to desiccate the grapes with '''[[noble rot]]'''

==Natural sweetness==
[[File:Late harvest Semillon.jpg|left|thumb|A late harvest Semillon from Washington State.]]
In the absence of other techniques, makers of dessert wine have to produce their sugar in the vineyard. Some grape varieties, such as [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]], Ortega and [[Huxelrebe]], naturally produce a lot more sugar than others. Environmental conditions have a big effect on ultimate sugar levels; the [[vigneron]] can help by leaving the grapes on the vine until they are [[fully ripe (wine)|fully ripe]], and by green harvesting and pruning to expose the young grapes to the sun. Green harvesting reduces the number of bunches on a vine early in the summer, so that the sugar production of the leaves is divided between fewer bunches. Unfortunately the vigneron cannot control the sun, but a sunny year can help sugar levels a lot. The semi-sweet Auslese wines in the [[German wine classification]] are probably the best example of this approach; most modern winemakers perceive that their customers want either fully dry or 'properly' sweet dessert wines, so 'leave it to nature' is currently out of fashion. But most of the Muscats of ancient times were probably made this way, including the famous [[Constantia (wine)|Constantia]] of South Africa.

==Chaptalization==
{{see also|Chaptalization}}
Honey was added to wine in Roman times, for sweetness and to increase the final strength of the wine. Today sugar is usually added in order to boost the alcohol levels of flabby, unripe wines rather than for sweetness, although a degree of chaptalization is permitted in the wines of many countries. German wines must declare whether they are 'natural' or not; in any case, chaptalization is banned from the top tiers of German wines.

==Süssreserve==
The "reserve of sweetness" is a German technique in which unfermented must (grape juice) is added to the wine after fermentation. This increases the sweetness of the final wine, and dilutes the alcohol somewhat{{emdash}}in Germany the final wine can contain no more than 15% Süssreserve by volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epicurious.com/drinking/wine_dictionary/entry?id=8131 Süssreserve] on Wine Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Süssreserve allows winemakers to fully ferment the wine without having to worry about stopping fermentation before all the sugar has gone. Since sulphites are used to stop fermentation, this technique reduces the usage of sulphites. Süssreserve is used by other makers of German-style wines, particularly in [[New Zealand wine|New Zealand]].

==Fortification==
{{see also|Fortified wine}}

The main fortified wines drunk with dessert are sweet [[sherry]], particularly [[Pedro Ximénez]], and vins doux naturels.  The [[Pedro Ximenez]] dessert wine is unique because it is a raisin wine that is then fortified and aged in a [[solera]] system like other sherries. Other sweet sherries such as [[Bristol Cream]] may also be drunk as dessert wine.

[[Image:Vin paille.jpg|thumb|Vin de Paille, a straw wine from France]]
The production of vins doux naturels was perfected by Arnaud de Villeneuve at the [[University of Montpellier]] in the 13th century and they are now quite common in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] of southwest France.  As the names suggest, [[Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise AOC|Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise]], [[Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC|Muscat de Rivesaltes]], [[Muscat de Frontignan]], [[Muscat de Lunel]], [[Muscat de Mireval]] and [[Muscat de St-Jean Minervois]] are all made from the white [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]] grape, whilst [[Banyuls AOC|Banyuls]] and [[Maury AOC|Maury]] are made from red [[Grenache]]. Regardless of the grape, fermentation is stopped with up to 10% of 95% grape spirit. The Muscats are made in a somewhat oxidised style, the Grenaches less so.

==Raisin wine==
{{see also| Straw wine}}
In ancient Carthage, a sweet wine called ''[[passum]]'' was made from air-dried grapes, and across the Malta Channel from the site of Carthage, similar wines are still made, called Moscato Passito di Pantelleria. Such wines were described by the Romans, and northern Italy is home to a number of 'passito' wines, where the grapes are dried on straw, on racks, or hung from the rafters. These wines include [[Vin Santo]] (into which almond biscuits ('[[cantucci]]') are traditionally dunked), Sciachetrà, Recioto di Soave (drunk with the local version of [[panettone]]) and the sweet red Recioto della Valpolicella (which stands up to chocolate better than most wine). Across the Alps, the French make 'straw wine' (''vin de paille'') in the Jura, Rhone and [[Alsace wine|Alsace]], the Spanish start off making a raisin wine with [[Pedro Ximénez]] before fortifying it, the Cypriots have their ancient [[Commandaria]] and there have been recent experiments with the style in [[South African wine|South Africa]] and the [[American wine|USA]].

==Ice wine==
{{see also|Ice wine}}
[[Image:Ice wine grapes.jpg|thumb|Grapes for ice wine]]
Most wine laws require temperatures below at most −7&amp;nbsp;°C (19&amp;nbsp;°F) before the grapes for ice wine can be picked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Amerine |first1=Maynard |title=Wine |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/wine |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} At such temperatures, some of the water in the grapes freezes out, but the sugars and other solids remain dissolved in the remaining juice. If the grapes are [[pressed (wine)|pressed]] whilst frozen, a very concentrated must can result, which needs special yeast and a long time to ferment. The resulting wines are very sweet, but with lots of balancing acidity. The minuscule yields mean they tend to be very expensive. The most famous ice wines are [[German wine|German]] ''Eiswein'' and [[Canadian wine|Canadian]] Icewine, but apart from these, ice wine is also made in the United States, [[Austrian wine|Austria]], [[Croatian wine|Croatia]], [[Czech wine|Czech Republic]], Slovakia, [[Slovenian wine|Slovenia]], [[Hungarian wine|Hungary]], [[Italian wine|Italy]], [[Australian wine|Australia]], [[French wine|France]] and [[New Zealand wine|New Zealand]] in smaller quantities.

==Noble rot wine==
{{See also|Noble rot}}
[[File:Botrytis riesling.jpg|left|thumb|[[Riesling]] grapes with [[noble rot]]]]
Some of the most famous dessert wines, such as [[Château d'Yquem]] of [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] and [[Tokaji]] Aszú of [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]] in [[Hungary]], or Seewinkel in Austria are made using grapes mouldy with ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'', which sucks water out of the grape whilst imparting flavours of honey and apricot to the future wine.

The fungus requires specific conditions to produce noble rot; if it is too damp, the same fungus causes destructive grey rot. Vignerons must ensure that they maximise the amount of noble rot without losing the whole crop to grey rot. Typically, noble rot forms best in conditions where morning [[mist]] forms from a nearby lake or the sea. The wait for noble rot to form is the reason why noble rot wines are usually [[Late harvest wine|late-harvested]].

The first noble rot wines were likely created by accident—both the Hungarians and the Germans have similar stories of how the harvest was delayed for some reason, but the mouldy grapes were vinified anyway and then found to be delicious. Given that propensity to noble rot was a factor in Hungarian vineyard demarcations some 50 years before a messenger was supposedly mugged on his way to [[Schloss Johannisberg]] in Germany, the Hungarians probably have a better case.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

Noble rot is responsible for many other dessert wines, including [[Beerenauslese]] and [[Trockenbeerenauslese]] of the [[German wine classification]], French [[Monbazillac AOC|Monbazillac]], Austrian Beerenauslese, [[Ausbruch]] and TBA other wines from all over the world.

==Serving==
[[Image:Vin Santo.JPG|thumb|Vin Santo with almond biscuits]]
A general rule is that the wine should be sweeter than the food it is served with - a perfectly ripe peach has been described as the ideal partner for many dessert wines, whereas it makes sense not to drink wine at all with many chocolate- and toffee-based dishes. Red dessert wines like Recioto della Valpolicella and fortified wines like the vin doux naturel Muscats are the best matches for such difficult-to-pair desserts.
Quite often, the wine itself can be a dessert, but bakery sweets can make a good match, particularly with a little bitterness like the almond biscuits that are dunked in Vin Santo. A development of this matching of contrasts is a rich savoury dish like the foie gras that is a traditional partner to Sauternes.
White dessert wines are generally served somewhat chilled, but can be easily served too cold. Red dessert wines are served at room temperature or slightly chilled.

Dnipro is the [[Capital (political)|administrative centre]] of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. Administratively, it is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]], the centre of ''Dnipro municipality'' and extraterritorial administrative centre of [[Dnipro Raion]].  Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2018|1,000,506}}.

The first fortified town in what is now Dnipro was probably built in the mid-16th century according to archeological findings.&lt;ref name=UWSUla/&gt;

Known as ''Ekaterinoslav'' ({{lang-ru|Екатериносла́в|Yekaterinoslav}} {{IPA-ru|jɪkətʲɪrʲɪnɐˈsɫaf|}}; {{lang-uk|Катериносла́в|Katerynoslav}} {{IPA-uk|kɑtɛrɪnɔˈslɑu̯|}}) until 1925, the city was formally inaugurated by the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian Empress]] [[Catherine the Great]] in 1787 as the administrative centre of the newly acquired vast territories of imperial ''[[Novorossiya Governorate|New Russia]]'', including those ceded to Russia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] (1774). The city was originally envisioned as the Russian Empire's third capital city,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wynn.

In particular, it is home to the [[Yuzhmash]], a major space and [[ballistic missile]] design bureau and manufacturer. Because of its military industry, it was a [[closed city]]{{#tag:ref|A [[closed city]] did not allow foreigners inside without official permission.|group=nb}} until the 1990s. On 19 May 2016 the official name of the city was changed from Dnipropetrovsk to ''Dnipro''.&lt;ref name=drbvr/&gt;

Dnipro is a powerhouse of Ukraine's business and politics as the native city for many of the country's most important figures. Ukraine's politics are still defined by the legacies of [[Leonid Kuchma]], [[Pavlo Lazarenko]] and [[Yuliya Tymoshenko]] whose intermingled careers started in Dnipro.

===Toponymy===
Over time, Dnipro has been known by a number of names:
*Ekaterinoslav 1776–1782, reestablished 1783–1797
*Novorossiysk 1797–1802
*Ekaterinoslav 1802–1918

*Dnipropetrovsk / Dnepropetrovsk 1926–1992
*Dnipropetrovsk 1992–2016
*Dnipro 2016–present

The spellings ''Katerynoslav'' and ''Catharinoslav'' are found on some maps from the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arhivtime.ru/karta/karta_arhiv/image_arhiv/01/1820.jpg|format=JPG|title=English map of 1820|publisher=Arhivtime.ru|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[English language|Anglophone]] media the city was also known as the Rocket City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Roll-Rocket-City-Dniepropetrovsk/dp/0801895502|author=Zhuk, S|title=''Rock and Roll in the Rocket City: The West, Identity, and Ideology in Soviet Dniepropetrovsk, 1960–1985''|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press with Johns Hopkins University Press|date=2010|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monastery was founded by [[Byzantine]] monks on [[Monastyrsky Island]], probably in the 9th century (870 AD).  The [[Tatar]]s destroyed the monastery in 1240.&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;{{cite web|author=12 March 2013|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/eng/guide/?pageid=240 |title=Welcome to Dnipropetrovsk! » City Guide – Dnipropetrovsk |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 15th century, [[Tatar]] tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. By the mid-15th century, the [[Nogais|Nogai]] (who lived north of the [[Sea of Azov]]) and the [[Crimean Khanate]] invaded these lands. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the [[Samara River (Dnieper)]], i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. It was in this time that a new force appeared: the free people, the [[Cossacks]]. They later became known as [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (Zaporizhia – the lands south of Prydniprovye, translate as "The Land Beyond the Weirs [Rapids]").  This was a period of raids and fighting causing considerable devastation and [[depopulation]] in that area; the area became known as the [[Wild Fields]].

Following the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], the lands of [[Zaporizhian Sich]] (around Kodak fortress) were under a condominium between the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Rzeczpospolita relinquished its control over the area with signing of the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686)|1686 Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] and, thus, handing over [[Zaporizhia (region)|Zaporizhia]] to Russia.

Dnipro was originally known as ''Ekaterinoslav'', which could be approximately rendered as "the glory of Catherine", presumably with reference to [[Catherine the Great]] (technically, the naming might have been in honour of Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mir-pravoslaviya.org.ua/node/1264 Днепропетровск празднует именины.

It was founded in 1787&lt;ref name=UWSUla&gt;[http://i.tyzhden.ua/content/photoalbum/2017/07_2017/14/uw/Book7.pdf The origins of Dnipro, the city and its name], [[The Ukrainian Week]], July 2017 (page 46)&lt;/ref&gt;
(the official founding year was set to 1776 in 1976 in an effort to please the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]]&lt;ref name=UWSUla/&gt;) as the administrative centre of Russia's newly re-established [[Azov Governorate]], which in 1783 was merged into a much bigger [[Ekaterinoslav Viceroyalty]]; later, from 1796 to 1802, as ''Novorossiysk'', it was the centre of the recreated [[Novorossiya Governorate#Second establishment|Novorossiya Governorate]], and subsequently, till 1925, of the [[Ekaterinoslav Governorate]].

Cossacks and the Russian army had fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] for control of this area in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. The [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] ended this war in July 1774; and in May 1775 the Russian army destroyed the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Sich]], thus eliminating the political autonomy of Cossacks. In 1775, [[Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin|Prince Grigori Potemkin]] was appointed governor of [[Novorossiya]], and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The original town of Yekaterinoslav was founded in 1776, not in the current location, but at the confluence of the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|River Samara]] with the River Kil'chen' at Loshakivka, north of the Dnieper. By 1782, the city population was 2,194. However the site had been badly chosen because spring waters were transforming the city into a bog.&lt;ref name = eugene&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugene.com.ua/dnepr.html|title=www.eugene.com.ua Dnepropetrovsk History|publisher=Eugene.com.ua|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was later renamed Novomoskovsk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;S. S. Montefiore: Prince of Princes – The Life of Potemkin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, Yekaterinoslav was refounded on its current site, on the south bank of the Dnieper, near the Zaporozhian village of Polovytsia. The population of ''Yekaterinoslav-Kil'chen''' were (according to some sources) transferred to the new site. Potemkin's plans for the city were extremely ambitious. It was to be about {{convert|30|by|25|km|0|abbr=on}} in size, and included&lt;ref name = eugene/&gt; [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Dnipro|Transfiguration Cathedral]] (the claim that it was intended as the largest in the world probably results from confusing Potemkin's reference to [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|San Paulo-fuori-le-mura]] in Rome with [[St Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;); The Potemkin palace; university (never built); botanical garden on Monastyrskyi Island and wide straight avenues through the city.

The cathedral's foundation stone was laid by Empress Catherine II and Austrian Emperor [[Emperor Joseph II|Joseph II]], during Catherine's [[Crimean journey of Catherine the Great|Crimean journey]]&lt;ref name="sobor"&gt;[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=124 Gorod.dp.ua]&lt;/ref&gt; on {{OldStyleDate|20 May|1787|9 May}}, which was heralded as the official date of founding the city. Nevertheless, the cathedral as originally designed was never to be built. The site for the Potemkin palace was bought from retired Cossack yesaul (colonel) Lazar' Globa, who owned much of the land near the city. Part of Lazar' Globa's gardens still exist and are now called Globa Park.&lt;ref name = eugene/&gt;

===Modern history===
A combination of yet another [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Russo-Turkish war]] that broke out later in 1787, bureaucratic procrastination, defective workmanship, and theft resulted in what was built being less than originally planned. Construction stopped after the death of Potemkin and his sponsor, Empress Catherine, who was succeeded by her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] known for his open antipathy to his mother's policies and undertakings. Plans were reconsidered and scaled back. The size of the cathedral was reduced, and it was completed in 1835.

Despite the bridging of the Dnieper in 1796 and the growth of trade in the early 19th century, Ekaterinoslav remained small until the 1880s, when the railway was built and industrialization of the city began.&lt;ref name=ukrainetrek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrainetrek.com/Dnepropetrovsk_city.shtml|title=Ukrainetrek Dnepropetrovsk (City)|publisher=Ukrainetrek.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom was caused by two men: [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]], a Welsh businessman who built an iron works at what is now [[Donetsk]] (then Yuzovka) in 1869–72, and developed the Donetsk coal deposits;&lt;ref name = eugene/&gt; and the Russian geologist [[Alexander Pol]], who discovered the [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron ore in 1866, during archaeological research.&lt;ref name = eugene/&gt;

The Donetsk coal was necessary for smelting pig-iron from the Kryvyi Rih ore, producing a need for a railway to connect Yozovka with Kryvyi Rih. Permission to build the railway was given in 1881, and it opened in 1884. The railway crossed the Dnieper at Ekaterinoslav. The city grew quickly; new suburbs appeared: Amur, Nyzhnodniprovsk and the factory areas developed. In 1897, Ekaterinoslav became the third city in the Russian Empire to have electric trams. The Higher Mining School opened in 1899, and by 1913 it had grown into the Mining Institute.&lt;ref name = eugene/&gt;

Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, among other things, resulted in widespread [[Revolution of 1905|revolts against the government]] in many places of Russia, Ekaterinoslav being one of the major hot spots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187691 Ekaterinoslav City in 1905: Workers, Jews, and Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded. There was a wave of anti-Semitic attacks.&lt;ref name = eugene/&gt;

From 1902 to 1933, the historian of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]], was Director of the Dnipro Museum, which was later named after him. Before his death in 1940, Yavornytsky wrote a ''History of the City of Ekaterinoslav'', which lay in manuscript for many years. It was only published in 1989 as a result of the [[perestroika|Gorbachev reforms]].

In November 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s led a [[Ekaterinoslav Bolshevik Uprising|rebellion]] and took power for a short time.

In the time of the Ukrainian [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] government, with its dictator [[Symon Petlura]], the city had periods of uncertain power. At times the [[anarchist]]s of [[Nestor Makhno]] held the city, and at others [[Anton Ivanovich Denikin|Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]]. Military operations of the [[Red Army]], which came in from the North, captured the city in 1919, and despite attempts by Russian General [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Wrangel]] in 1920, he was unable to reach Yekaterinoslav. The War ended the following year.

As early as July 1944, the State Committee of Defense in Moscow decided to build a large military machine-building factory in Dnipropetrovsk on the location of the pre-war aircraft plant. In December 1945, thousands of German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] began construction and built the first sections and shops in the new factory.  This was the foundation of the Dnipropetrovsk Automobile Factory.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Театр им Горького 1.jpg|left|thumb|The city's 'Gorky' Theatre of Russian Drama was constructed during the Stalinist period.]]
[[Joseph Stalin]] suggested special secret training for highly qualified engineers and scientists to become rocket construction specialists.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1954 the administration of this automobile factory opened a secret design office with the name "Southern" (konstruktorskoe biuro Yuzhnoe – in Russian) to construct military [[missile]]s and rocket engines. Hundreds of talented physicists, engineers and machine designers moved from Moscow and other large cities in the Soviet Union to Dnipropetrovsk to join this "Southern" design office. In 1965, the secret Plant #586 was transferred to the Ministry of General Machine-Building of the USSR. The next year this plant officially changed its name to "the Southern Machine-building Factory" (Yuzhnyi mashino-stroitel’nyi zavod) or in abbreviated Russian, simply [[Yuzhmash]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Dnepr rocket lift-off 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[SS-18 Satan]] missile by [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]]]]
The first "General Constructor" and head of the "Southern" design office was [[Mikhail Yangel]], a prominent scientist and outstanding designer of space rockets, who managed not only the design office, but the entire factory from 1954 to 1971. Yangel designed the first powerful rockets and space military equipment for the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Soviet Ministry of Defense]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1951 the Southern Machine-building Factory began manufacturing and testing new military rockets for the battlefield. The range of these first missiles was only {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=off}}. By 1959 Soviet scientists and engineers developed new technology, and as a result, the "Southern" design office (KBYu – as abbreviated in Russian) started a new machine-building project making [[ballistic missile]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Under the leadership of Yangel, KBYu produced such powerful rocket engines that the range of these ballistic missiles was practically without limits. During the 1960s, these powerful rocket engines were used as launch vehicles for the first Soviet space ships. During Makarov’s directorship, Yuzhmash designed and manufactured four generations of missile complexes of different types. These included space launch vehicles [[Kosmos (rocket family)|Kosmos]], [[Tsyklon-2]], [[Tsyklon-3]] and [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]]. Under the leadership of Yangel’s successor, V. Utkin, the KBYu created a unique space-rocket system called Energia-Buran. Yuzhmash engineers manufactured 400 technical devices that were launched in artificial satellites ([[Sputnik]]s). For the first time in the world space industry, the Dnipropetrovsk missile plant organised the serial production of space Sputniks. By the 1980s, this plant manufactured 67 different types of space ships, 12 space research complexes and 4 defense space rocket systems. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

These systems were used not only for purely military purposes by the Ministry of Defense, but also for space research, for global radio and television networks, and for ecological monitoring. Yuzhmash initiated and sponsored the international space program of socialist countries, called [[Interkosmos]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Parus from left bank.JPG|left|thumb|The unfinished 'Parus' hotel on the embankment has become a symbol of poor economic planning in the Soviet era.]]
On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union, KBYu had 9 regular and corresponding members of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], 33 full professors and 290 scientists holding a Ph.D. They awarded scientific degrees and presided over a prestigious graduate school at KBYu, which attracted talented students of physics from all over the USSR. More than 50,000 people worked at Yuzhmash. At the end of the 1950s, Yuzhmash became the main Soviet design and manufacturing centre for different types of missile complexes. The Soviet Ministry of Defense included Yuzhmash in its strategic plans. The military rocket systems manufactured in Dnipropetrovsk became the major component of the newly born Soviet Missile Forces of Strategic Purpose. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to contemporaries, Yuzhmash was a separate entity inside the Soviet state. After a long period of competition with the Moscow centre of rocket construction of V. Chelomei (a successor of Koroliov) Yuzhmash rocket designs won in 1969. Since that time leaders of the Soviet military industrial complex preferred Yuzhmash rocket models. By the end of the 1970s, this plant became the major centre for designing, constructing, manufacturing, testing and deploying strategic and space missile complexes in the Soviet Union. The general designer and director of Yuzhmash supervised the work of numerous research institutes, design centres and factories all over the Soviet Union from Moscow, [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]], to [[Voronezh]] and [[Yerevan]]. The Soviet state provided billions of Soviet [[ruble]]s to finance Yuzhmash projects.

Officially, Yuzhmash manufactured agricultural tractors and special kitchen equipment for everyday needs, such as mincing-machines or juicers for civilian Soviet households. In official reports for the general audience there was no information about the production of rockets or spaceships. However, hundreds of thousands of workers and engineers in the city of Dnipropetrovsk worked in this plant and members of their families (up to 60% of the city population!) knew about the "real production" of Yuzhmash.  This missile plant became a significant factor in the arms race of the Cold War.  This is why the Soviet government approved of the KGB’s secrecy about Yuzhmash and its products. According to the Soviet government’s decision, the city of Dnipropetrovsk was officially closed to foreign visitors in 1959. No citizen of a foreign country (even of the socialist ones) was allowed to visit the city or district of Dnipropetrovsk. After the late 1950s ordinary Soviet people called Dnipropetrovsk "the rocket closed city." Only during [[perestroika]] was Dnipropetrovsk opened to foreigners again in 1987.

===Contemporary===
In June 1990,&lt;ref name=NYT20Jun1990&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DD173EF933A15755C0A966958260 ''New York Times'', 20 June 1990 ''Evolution in Europe; Soviet Troops Kill an Inmate During Riot in Ukrainian Jail'']  This stated that TASS had issued a statement saying that there had been a riot by 2,000 inmates in a prison in Dnipropetrovsk.  The riot broke out on Thursday 14 June 1990, and was quelled by Soviet troops on Friday 15 June 1990, killing one prisoner and wounding another.&lt;/ref&gt; the women’s department of Dnipropetrovsk preliminary prison was destroyed in prison riots. In the ten years that followed, women under investigation (i.e. not convicted) in Dnipropetrovsk oblast were either held in Preliminary Prison 4 in [[Kryvyi Rih]] or in "detention blocks" in Dnipropetrovsk; this contravened Ukrainian Law "On preliminary incarceration".  Journeys from Kryviy Rih took up to six hours in special railway carriages with grated windows.  Some prisoners had to do this 14 or 15 times.  After complaints by the ombudsman (Nina Karpacheva) the head of the State prison department of Ukraine (Vladimir Levochkin) arranged that finances were given for the provision of women's cells in Dnipropetrovsk Preliminary Prison, making the lives of the 15,000 unconvicted women-detainees easier from August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1085176391|title=''Kievskie vedomosti'', 14 August 2000.|publisher=Khpg.org|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the most powerful representative of the "Dnipropetrovsk Faction" in Ukrainian politics was [[Leonid Kuchma]], the former [[President of Ukraine]] and former senior [[Management|manager]] of Yuzhmash.

In June and July 2007, Dnipropetrovsk experienced a wave of random [[serial killer|serial killings]] that were dubbed by the media as the work of the "[[Dnepropetrovsk maniacs|Dnipropetrovsk maniacs]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-92-dnepropetrovsk-maniacs/|title=Case 92: Dnepropetrovsk Maniacs - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|date=2018-08-11|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, three youths were sentenced for their part in 21 murders, and numerous other attacks and robberies.&lt;ref name="sentence"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.new-most.info/news/crime/10500.htm|title=Dnepropetrovsk Maniacs: Court delivers its verdicts|work=|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66UcLrvQ7?url=http://most-dnepr.info/news/crime/10500.htm|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
{{see also|City of regional significance (Ukraine)}}
The City of Dnipro  is governed by the Dnipro  City Council. It is a city municipality that is designated as a separate district within its oblast.

Administratively, the city is divided into "districts in city" ("raiony v misti"). Presently, there are 8 of them. [[Aviatorske]], an urban-type settlement located near the [[Dnipropetrovsk International Airport]], is also a part of Dnipro Municipality.

The City Council Assembly makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 12 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council was elected in 2015. The council has 29 standing commissions which play an important role in the oversight of the city and its merchants.

Dnipro has five single-mandate parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through which members of parliament ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MPs]]) are elected to represent the city in [[Verkhovna Rada|Rada]]. At the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|last (2014) general election]], were won by [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc|PPB]] and independent candidates with. In multimember districts city voted for Opposition Bloc, union of all political forces that did not endorse [[Euromaidan]].

In the last decades the city has generally supported candidates belonging to the [[Party of Regions]] and (in the 1990s) [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] in national and local elections. There was the same situation in presidential elections, with strong support for [[Leonid Kuchma]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. After the 2014 events of Euromaidan, which included mass demonstrations and clashes in the central city, Regions lost its influence, and Dnipropetrovsk supported [[Petro Poroshenko]]. In the [[Ukrainian local elections, 2015#Dnipropetrovsk|2015 Ukrainian local elections]] [[Borys Filatov]] of the patriotic [[UKROP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/10/23/democracy-and-disorientation-ukraine-votes-in-local-elections/ijlw Democracy and Disorientation: Ukraine Votes in Local Elections] by [[Balázs Jarábik]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] (23 October 2015 )&lt;/ref&gt; was elected Mayor of Dnipro.&lt;ref name=PMBFs15&gt;[http://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-politics/1915506-borys-filatov-becomes-dnipropetrovsk-mayor-election-commission.html Borys Filatov becomes Dnipropetrovsk mayor – election commission], [[Ukrinform]] (18 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dnipro is also the seat of the oblast's local administration controlled by the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] Rada. The governor of the oblast is the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.

5 of the 8 city districts were renamed late November 2015 to comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunization laws]].&lt;ref name="radiosvoboda.mobi"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.radiosvoboda.mobi/a/27401886.html Street signs were Dnipropetrovsk nedekomunizovanymy], [[Radio Svoboda]] (2 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Dniepropetrowsk z lotu ptaka.jpg|left|thumb|An aerial view of Dnipro. The [[Dnieper River]], city's left and right banks, and a number of bridges can be seen.]]
The city is built mainly upon both banks of the Dnieper, at its confluence with the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|Samara River]]. In the loop of a major meander, the Dnieper changes its course from the north west to continue southerly and later south-westerly through Ukraine, ultimately passing [[Kherson]], where it finally flows into the [[Black Sea]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Nowadays both the north and south banks play home to a range of industrial enterprises and manufacturing plants. The airport is located about {{convert|15|km|2|abbr=on}} south-east of the city.

The centre of the city is constructed on the right bank which is part of the [[Dnieper Upland]], while the left bank is part of the [[Dnieper Lowland]]. The old town is situated atop a hill that is formed as a result of the river's change of course to the south. The change of river's direction is caused by its proximity to the [[Azov Upland]] located southeast of the city.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

One of the city's streets, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, links the two major architectural ensembles of the city and constitutes an important thoroughfare through the centre, which along with various suburban radial road systems, provides some of the area's most vital transport links for both suburban and inter-urban travel.

===Climate===

Under the [[Köppen–Geiger climate classification system]], Dnipro has a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and belongs to the Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high [[evapotranspiration]], Dnipro is in the transition zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''), with relatively drier summers than the rest of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/maps.htm |title=Bioclimatic &amp; Biogeographic Maps of Europe |last=Rivas-Martínez |first=Salvador |year=2004 |publisher=University of León |access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the summer, Dnipro is very warm (average day temperature in July is {{convert|24|to|28|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, even hot sometimes {{convert|32|to|36|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures as high as {{convert|36|°C|0}} have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is {{convert|-4|to|0|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold.

The best time for visiting the city is in late spring — late April and May, and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow.

===Cityscape===
Dnipro is a primarily industrial city of around one million people; in being such it has developed into a large urban centre over the past few centuries to become, today, Ukraine's fourth-largest city.

[[File:Istorichnii myzei Dnipropetrovs'ka.JPG|thumb|Yavornytsky Historical Museum]]
Immediately after its foundation, Dnipro, or as it was then known Yekaterinoslav, began to develop exclusively on the right bank of the Dnieper River. At first the city developed radially from the central point provided by the Transfiguration Cathedral. Neo-classical structures of brick and stone construction were preferred and the city began to take on the appearance of a typical European city of the era. Of these buildings many have been retained in the city's older [[Sobornyi District, Dnipro|Sobornyi District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=52 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the most important buildings of this era are the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a number of buildings in the area surrounding Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, including the [[Khrennikov House]].
[[File:Lenin statue in Dnipropetrovsk, lateral view.JPG|left|thumb|In the early 1950s, during the ongoing industrialisation of the city, much of Dnipropetrovsk's centre was rebuilt in the Stalinist style of [[Socialist Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=39 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of [[Lenin]] pictured here was removed in March 2014.&lt;ref name="usatoday.comLmDg"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/14/ukraine-crimea-referendum/6319183/ In East Ukraine, fear of Putin, anger at Kiev]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/ukraine-day-after_783577.html Ukraine: the Day After]&lt;br&gt;[http://tsn.ua/ukrayina/sche-odnogo-lenyna-zvalili-v-dnypropetrovsku-363832.html Пам'ятник Леніну у Дніпропетровську остаточно перетворили в купу каміння "Monument to Lenin in Dnipropetrovsk finally turned into a pile of stones"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Over the next few decades, until the October Revolution in 1917 the city did not change much in appearance and the predominant architectural style remained that of neo-classicism. Notable buildings built in the era preceding the Bolsheviks' rise to power and the establishment of communist Ukraine and later its absorption into the [[Soviet Union]], include the main building of the [[National Mining University of Ukraine|National Mining University]], which was built in 1899–1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Вт, 12 марта 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=932 |title=Национальный Горный Университет – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the art-nouveau inspired building of the city's former Duma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dneprotur.ucoz.com/photo/retrophotos/old_dnepropetrovsk/city_council/27-0-46 |title=Городская Дума – Старый Днепропетровск – Ретрофото – Фотоальбомы – Памятники, архитектура, история, туризм |publisher=Dneprotur.ucoz.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum, and the Mechnikov Regional Hospital. Other buildings of the era that did not fit the typical architectural style of the time in Dnipropetrovsk include,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=53 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ukrainian-influenced [http://www.grand-hotel-ukraine.dp.ua/?lang=eng Grand Hotel Ukraine], the Russian revivalist style railway station (since reconstructed),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ef2012.com/index.php/ru/rezervnye-goroda/dnepropetrovsk/jd-vokzal-dnepropetrovsk.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425125011/http://www.ef2012.com/index.php/ru/rezervnye-goroda/dnepropetrovsk/jd-vokzal-dnepropetrovsk.html |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the art-nouveau Astoriya building on Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt.
[[File:Passage, Dnepropetrovsk.jpg|thumb|Stalinist architecture blends with the post-modernism of Dnipropetrovsk's 'Passage' shopping and entertainment centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akselrod-estate.com/project-passag|title=Торговый комплекс "Пассаж"|publisher=Akselrod-estate.com|date=|accessdate=12 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729143203/http://akselrod-estate.com/project-passag|archivedate=29 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Stalinist architecture (monumental soviet classicism) dominates in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnepr.com/main/sport_and_culture_dp/7847-ot-stalinskogo-ampira-do-brezhnevskogo-minimalizma.html |title=От "сталинского ампира" до "брежневского минимализма" " www.DNEPR.com – Главный портал города Днепропетровска |publisher=www.DNEPR.com |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the bolsheviks had taken power in Dnipropetrovsk the city was gradually purged of tsarist-era monuments and monumental architecture was stripped of Imperial coats of arms and other non-socialist symbolism. In 1917, a monument to [[Catherine the Great]] that stood in front of the Mining Institute was replaced with one of Russian academic [[Mikhail Lomonosov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Вт, 12 марта 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=1122 |title=Ломоносову М.В., памятник – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, due to damage from the Second World War, a number of large buildings were reconstructed. The main railway station, for example, was stripped of its Russian-revival ornamentation and redesigned in the style of Stalinist social-realism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] Центральный железнодорожный вокзал был уничтожен во время войны. Потребовалось строительство нового здания&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the Grand Hotel Ukraine survived the war but was later simplified much in design, with its roof being reconstructed in a typical French mansard style as opposed to the ornamental Ukrainian baroque of the pre-war era. Other badly damaged buildings were, more often than not, demolished completely and replaced with new structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main reasons why much of Dnipropetrovsk's central avenue, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, is designed in the style of Stalinist Social Realism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] Центральный проспект почти полностью был разрушен. Практически его нужно было создать заново&lt;/ref&gt; Many pre-revolution buildings were also reconstructed to suit new purposes. For example, the Emperor Nicholas II Commercial Institute in Dnipropetrovsk was reconstructed to serve as the administrative centre for the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a function it fulfils to this day. Other buildings, such as the Potemkin Palace were given over to the proletariat, in this case as the students' union of the [[Oles Honchar Dnipro National University]].

After the death of Stalin and appointment of [[Khrushchev]], who had spent his early working years in Ukraine, as party secretary, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being set up in the city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city.&lt;ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=68 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Dnipropetrovsk became one of the most important manufacturing cities in the Soviet Union, producing many goods from small articles like screws and vacuum cleaners to aircraft engine pieces and ballistic missiles. As a result of all this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, unsightly industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began.&lt;ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68/&gt; The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era ([[Khrushchyovka]]s) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German [[Plattenbau]]s). In 1976 in line with the city's 1926 renaming a large monumental statue of [[Grigoriy Petrovsky]] was placed on the square in front of the city's station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] В 1976 г. архитектурно-художественная композиция привокзальной площади была завершена постановкой памятника Г. И. Петровскому&lt;/ref&gt; This statue was destroyed by an angry mob early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soviet-Era |title=Monument Torn Down In Eastern Ukraine |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-monument/27523767.html |website=www.rferl.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day the city is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, with much of the city's centre consisting of pre-revolutionary buildings in a variety of styles, stalinist buildings and constructivist architecture, whilst residential districts are, more often than not, made up of aesthetically simple, technically outdated mid-rise and high-rise housing stock from the Soviet era. Despite this, the city does have a large number of 'private sectors' were the tradition of building and maintaining individual detached housing has continued to this day. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Since the independence of Ukraine in 1991 and the economic development that followed, a number of large commercial and business centres have been built in the city's outskirts.

Late November 2015 about 300 streets, 5 of the 8 city districts and one metro station were renamed to comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunization laws]].&lt;ref name="radiosvoboda.mobi"/&gt;

The population of the city is about 1 million people. In 2011, the average age of the city’s resident population was 40 years. The number of males declined slightly more than the number of females. The natural population growth in Dnipro is slightly higher than growth in Ukraine in general.

Between 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of Dnipropetrovsk increased from 16% to 48%.

Metallurgical enterprises are based in the city and account for over 47% of its industrial output. These enterprises are important contributors to the city’s budget and, with 80% of their output being exported, to Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserve. Dnipro serves as the main import hub for foreign goods coming into the oblast and, on average, accounted for 58% of the oblast’s imports between 2005 and 2011. With economic conditions improving even further in 2010 and 2011, registered unemployment fell to about 4,100 by the end of 2011.

==Transport==

=== Local transportation ===
[[File:Ул. Карла Маркса, Днепропетровск.jpg|right|thumb|Akademik [[Dmytro Yavornytsky|Yavornitskyi]] Prospekt, Dnipro's central avenue, features a green pedestrian boulevard and a tram line.]]

The main forms of public transport used in Dnipro are trams, buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es and [[marshrutka]]s—private [[minibuses]]. In addition to this there are a large number of taxi firms operating in the city, and many residents have private cars.

The city's municipal roads also suffer from the same funding problems as the trams, with many of them in a very poor technical state. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It is not uncommon to find very large potholes and crumbling surfaces on many of Dnipro's smaller roads. Major roads and highways are of better quality. In recent years the situation has, however, been improving, with a number of new used trams bought from the German cities of Dresden and Magdeburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=вт, 12 марта 201307:52 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/60242 |title=К нам привезли новые старые трамваи – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of roads, including Schmidt Street and Moskovsky Street being reconstructed with modern road-building techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://34.ua/news/economic/transport/roads/85-remont-dorog-v-dnepropetrovske-na-16-avgusta-2011-goda.html |title=Ремонт дорог в Днепропетровске на 16 августа 2011 года |publisher=34.ua |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505093610/http://34.ua/news/economic/transport/roads/85-remont-dorog-v-dnepropetrovske-na-16-avgusta-2011-goda.html |archivedate=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dnipro_Metro.jpg|thumb|225px|A scheme of the [[Dnipro Metro]] system in the city.]]
Dnipro also has a [[Dnipro Metro|metro system]], opened in 1995, which consists of one line and 6 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/metro/eng/|title=Metro|accessdate=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on other stations was abandoned when the city ran out of money for this project; two of these abandoned building works are in the central portion of Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt. Completion of the next two stations is necessary to make the municipal subway system profitable. At the present time the completion date is unknown. {{As of|2011}} the central portion of the city's metro line has seen renewed construction efforts and the metro has been transferred to municipal ownership in the hope that this will help it secure a loan from the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/115437/ |title=Dnipropetrovsk Metropoliten in municipal ownership now |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current plans envision the three station section from Teatralna, through Tsentralna, to Muzeina completed by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mignews.com.ua/ru/articles/90597.html |title=Метро в Днепропетровске достроят в 2015 году – Днепропетровск |publisher=MIGnews.com.ua |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suburban transportation===
[[File:Central bridge Dnipro.jpg|thumb|left|Bridges linking the city's right and left banks are heavily used.]]
Dnipro has some highways crossing through the city. The most popular routes are from [[Kiev]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Zaporizhia]]. Transit through the city is also available. {{As of|2011}} the city is also seeing construction of a southern urban bypass, which will allow automobile traffic to proceed around the city centre. This is expected to both improve air quality and reduce transport issues from heavy freight lorries that pass through the city centre. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The largest bus station in eastern Ukraine is located in Dnipro, from where bus routes are available to all over the country, including some international routes to Russia, Poland, Germany, [[Moldova]] and [[Turkey]]. It is located near the city's central railway station.

In the summertime, there are some routes available by [[hydrofoil]]s on the [[Dnieper River]], whilst various tourist ships on their way down the river, (Kiev–Kherson–Odessa) tend to make a stop in the city. Dnipro's river port is located close to the area surrounding the central railway station, on the banks of the river. It is a good example of constructivist architecture from the late period of the Soviet Union. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Two express passenger services run each day between [[Kiev]] and Dnipro under the name 'Capital Express'. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night to reduce the amount of daytime hours spent travelling by each passenger.

Domestic connections exist between Dnipro and [[Kiev]], [[Lviv]], [[Simferopol]], [[Odessa]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Truskavets]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and many other smaller Ukrainian cities, whilst international destinations include, amongst others, [[Minsk]] in Belarus, Moscow's [[Kursky Rail Terminal|Kursky Station]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Vitebsky Rail Terminal|Vitebsky Station]] in Russia, [[Baku]] – the capital of Azerbaijan, and the Bulgarian seaside resort of [[Varna]].

Currently around 55, 000 students study in Dnipro, a significant number of whom are students from abroad.

==Culture==

=== Attractions ===
[[File:Monument of M. Gorky.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to the [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park]]
The city has a variety of theatres (plus an Opera) and museums of interest to tourists, including the [[Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum of Dnipropetrovsk|Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum]]. There are also several parks, restaurants and beaches.

The major streets of the city were renamed in honour of Marxist heroes during the Soviet era. Following the 2015 [[decommunization in Ukraine|law on decommunization]] these have been renamed.&lt;ref name=decommupbbcU/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiosvoboda.mobi"/&gt;

The central thoroughfare is known as Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, a, wide and long boulevard that stretches east to west through the centre of the city. It was founded in the 18th century and parts of its buildings are the actual decoration of the city. In the heart of the city is Soborna Square, which includes the majestic cathedral founded by order of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1787. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

On the square, there are some remarkable buildings: the Museum of History, [http://eng.museum.dp.ua/diorama.html Diorama "Battle for the Dnieper River] ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]])", and also the park in which one can rest in the hot summer. Walking down the hill to the [[Dnieper River]], one arrives in the large [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park (which is on the right bank of the river) and on [http://discover-ukraine.info/places/eastern-ukraine/dnipropetrovsk/625 Monastyrsky Island]. This island is one of the most interesting places in the city. In the 9th century, the Byzantine monks based a monastery here. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

A few areas retain their historical character: all of Central Avenue, some street-blocks on the main hill (the Nagorna part) between Pushkin Prospekt and Embankment, and sections near Globa (formerly known as [[Chkalov]] park until it was recently renamed) and Shevchenko parks have been untouched for 150 years. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Dnieper River keeps the climate mild. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is visible from many points in Dnipro. From any of the three hills in the city, one can see a view of the river, islands, parks, outskirts, river banks and other hills.

There was no need to build skyscrapers in the city in Soviet times. The major industries preferred to locate their offices close to their factories and away from the centre of town. Most new office buildings are built in the same architectural style as the old buildings. A number, however, display more modern aesthetics, and some blend the two styles.

===Sports===
[[File:УФХМР 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Rink bandy]] in Dnipro]]
[[FC Dnipro]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club, play in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]], and are the only Soviet team to win the USSR Federation Cup twice.

Recently the city built a new soccer stadium; the [[Dnipro-Arena]] has a capacity of 31,003 people and was built as a replacement for Dnipro's old stadium, [[Stadium Meteor]]. The [[Dnipro-Arena]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]] on 10 October 2009. The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/8499613|title=Kiev and Donetsk likely for Euro 2012, others uncertain|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5it8f_MOzCKu2hxVHUUXwOvzetMIw |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630172347/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5it8f_MOzCKu2hxVHUUXwOvzetMIw |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 June 2012  |accessdate=20 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Featureless rifles''' are rifles with modifications made to remove prohibited features from [[assault weapons]] . Guns with a [[Bullet Button]], [[pistol grip]], [[flash suppressor]] and [[folding stock]] have been considered assault weapons requiring formal registration in California since July 1, 2018 and while some gun owners have opted to register their guns, others have chosen to make modifications to keep their unregistered weapons compliant with state regulations. One common change for guns with a flash suppressor is to replace it with a [[muzzle brake]], and some have converted their guns to [[.22 caliber]] which is a smaller and less expensive round than the stock [[AR-15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Different options to avoid registering gun with the California DOJ| work = ABC30 Fresno| accessdate = 2018-07-27| date = 2018-06-29| url = http://abc30.com/3676648/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180727185552/http://abc30.com/3676648/| archive-date = 2018-07-27| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{Cite web| last = McKay| first = Hollie| title = How California gun owners are legally keeping their AR-15 rifles| work = Fox News| accessdate = 2018-07-27| date = 2017-08-23| url = http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/23/how-california-gun-owners-are-legally-keeping-their-ar-15-rifles.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180524222855/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/23/how-california-gun-owners-are-legally-keeping-their-ar-15-rifles.html| archive-date = 2018-05-24| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies sell "featureless grips" made of [[Kydex]] that can convert the pistol grips on assault weapons so they no longer meet the statutory definition of prohibited features.

'''''Forged: Writing in the Name of God – Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are''''' is a book written by the noted biblical scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]]. Although it has long been recognised that numerous Epistles of the [[New Testament]] bear names of authors who are unlikely to have written them, traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] teaching has been that it was an accepted practice in antiquity for a writer to attribute his work to a well-known figure from the past, or a teacher who has greatly influenced him. ''Forged'' demonstrates that this is incorrect and the practice would have been condemned as dishonest by all authorities in antiquity.  Falsely attributed writings are often referred to as "[[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphs]]" but Ehrman maintains that the more honest term is "forgery". The book posits that 11 or more books out of the 27 books of the Christian New Testament canon were written as forgeries.&lt;ref name = "cnn-article"&gt;{{cite news
| year = 2011
| url = http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/13/half-of-new-testament-forged-bible-scholar-says/
| title= Half of New Testament forged, Bible scholar says
| accessdate = 2011-05-17
| work=CNN}} CNN book review article summarizing Ehrman's claim that much of the New Testament was written as a forgery.
&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, Ehrman points out numerous inconsistencies which he finds within the New Testament which appear to support many of his claims, such as the fact that in Acts 4:13 the statement is made that both Peter and John were illiterate, yet in later years entire books of the Bible were then alleged to have been written by them.

==Books of the New Testament identified as forgeries by Ehrman==

* [[First Epistle of Peter]]
* [[Second Epistle of Peter]]
* [[Acts of the Apostles]]
* [[Epistle of James]]
* [[Epistle of Jude]]
* [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]
* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]
* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]
* [[Epistle to Titus]]
* [[Epistle to the Ephesians]]
* [[Epistle to the Colossians]]

== False attributions ==

In addition to the eleven books of the New Testament Ehrman identifies as forgeries, there are eight originally anonymous New Testament texts that had names of apostles ascribed to them later and are falsely attributed. These are not forgeries since the texts are anonymous but have had false authors ascribed to them by others.

* [[Gospel of Matthew]]
* [[Gospel of Mark]]
* [[Gospel of Luke]]
* [[Gospel of John]]
* [[First Epistle of John]]
* [[Second Epistle of John]]
* [[Third Epistle of John]]
* [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]

'''Gopal Nilkanth Dandekar''' (8 July 1916 – 1 June 1998) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

Dandekar was born in [[Paratwada]] in [[Amravati district]].

He grew up in [[Vidarbha]] but ran away from his home in [[Nagpur]] at age thirteen in response to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s call to young people for joining his movement for India's attainment of freedom from the [[British Raj]]. After spending a few years in extreme poverty, he found some stability with a few patrons. Later he joined [[Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh]] and worked as a volunteer in [[Gadge Maharaj]]'s social service movement. He traveled extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980602/15351014.html|title=GoNiDa - the man who loved his land profoundly|publisher=The Indian Express|date=2 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980602/15350944.html|title=G N Dandekar passes away|publisher=The Indian Express|date=2 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980602/15351014.html Eulogy in Indian Express]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] language belongs to the [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupí-Guaraní]] branch of the [[Tupi language|Tupí]] linguistic family.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B0080448542018551|title=Brazil: Language Situation|last=Moore|first=D.|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=117–128|doi=10.1016/b0-08-044854-2/01855-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three distinct groups within the Guaraní subgroup, they are: the [[Kaiwá language|Kaiowá]], the [[Mbyá Guaraní language|Mbyá]] and the [[Ñandeva]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/pt/povo/guarani|title=Introdução &gt; Guarani|website=pib.socioambiental.org|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin America]], the indigenous language that is most widely spoken amongst non-indigenous communities is Guaraní.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monteiro|first=João|date=2008|title=Tupi  In J. Kinsbruner &amp; E. Langer|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|publisher=Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.|volume=2|pages=155–157|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South America]] is home to more than 280,000 Guaraní people, 51,000 of whom reside in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icsoh.unsa.edu.ar/mapa-continental-guarani-reta/|title=Mapa Continental "Guarani Retã|last=Buliubashich|first=Catalina|last2=Cordoba|first2=Ana Victoria Casimiro|date=|website=Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Flores|first3=Maria Eugenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guaraní people inhabit regions in Brazil, [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], as well as [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are more than four million speakers of Guaraní across these regions.&lt;ref name="aboutworldlanguages.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/guarani|title=Guarani {{!}} About World Languages|website=aboutworldlanguages.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) classified Guaraní’s language vitality as “vulnerable”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|last=|first=|date=|website=Unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO’s definition of “vulnerable” is meant to highlight that although the majority of Guaraní children can speak Guaraní, the use of the language is restricted to particular contexts (e.g., familial settings).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the Guaraní language may only be classified as “vulnerable,” there are other languages within the Tupí-Guaraní branch that are classified as “extinct” and “critically endangered” (e.g., [[Amanayé language|Amanayé]] and [[Anambé language|Anambé]] respectively).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Guaraní language has been an object of study since the arrival of the Jesuits in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Guaraní language is a subgroup within the Tupí-Guaraní branch.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are three dialects within the Guaraní subgroup: Mbyá, Kaiowá and Ñandeva.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/Guaraní-Mbyá/1290|title=Guaraní Mbyá|last=|first=|date=|website=Pib.socioambiental.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences among the three dialects of the Guaraní language can be noted primarily in their distinct [[Phonology|phonologies]] and [[syntax]], as these vary depending on the social context that the language is being used.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Of note, the Mbyá prioritize [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Literacy within the Mbyá received an increased level of importance in the late 1990s as a product of new educational institutions in the villages.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lemle (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemle|first=Miriam|date=|title=Internal Classification of the Tupi-Guaraní Linguistic Family|url=|journal=SIL International Publications In Linguistics|volume=|pages=107–129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that in spite of their being almost forty [[dialect]]s within the Tupí-Guaraní family, there exist numerous similarities between the words of these dialects.

[[File:América do Sul - Língua Guarani.PNG|thumb|Countries where Guarani is spoken are colored in red. The country in dark red is Paraguay where Guarani is an official language.]]

== Varieties ==
*[[Western Bolivian Guarani]] (a.k.a. Simba), 7,000 speakers
*[[Eastern Bolivian Guarani language]] (a.k.a. Chiriguano, Chawuncu, Western Argentine Guarani), 55,000 speakers
**dialects: Avá (subdialects Chané, [[Tapieté]] a.k.a. Ñandeva), Izoceño/Izocenio
*[[Guarani language|Paraguayan Guarani]] (Guarani proper), 5 million mostly mestizo speakers
*[[Chiripá Guarani]] (a.k.a. Avá, Nhandéva/Ñandeva, Apytare, Tsiripá/Txiripá), 12,000 speakers
*[[Mbyá Guarani]] (Mbya), 25,000 speakers

These share some degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] and are close to being dialects; however, Chiripá is reported to be intelligible due to [[bilingualism]], not inherently. Also, there is a degree of intelligibility with [[Kaiwá]]–Pai Tavytera, which is not included in the ''Ethnologue''. ''Ethnologue'' considers [[Tapieté]] to be a separate language, intermediate between Eastern Bolivian and Paraguayan, and has shifted from the name Chiripá to Avá, though the latter is ambiguous. Paraguayan Guarani is by far the most widely spoken variety and is what is often meant by the term "Guarani" outside South America.

== Literature on Guarani Language ==
The Tupí-Guaraní branch within the Tupí family that has been the object of most linguistic studies within this family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B0080448542022999|title=Tupian Languages|last=Gabas|first=N.|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=146–150|doi=10.1016/b0-08-044854-2/02299-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the linguistic literature available on Tupí-Guaraní languages is extensive, ranging from [[grammar]]s, [[Bibliographic index|bibliographies]], histories of [[language development]], [[Typological Studies in Language|typological studies]], to dissertations on the phonology of the Guaraní language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=Aryon Dall'Igna|last2=Cabral|first2=Ana Suelly|title=Tupian Languages|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780199772810-0166|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|language=en|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199772810-0166|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Silvetti and Silvestri (2015),&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/first-take-shaping-Guaran%C3%AD-territory|title=First Take: Shaping the Guarani Territory|last=Jorge|first=Silvetti|last2=Silvetti|first2=Graciela|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guaraní only came to be a written language following the arrival of the Jesuits. Silvetti and Silvestri propound that “it was the Jesuits who gave it a grammar and a syntax and made it into one of the ‘''lenguas generales’'' used for the [[Evangelism|evangelization]] of the natives”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In light of this, we will highlight important literary works on Guaraní linguistics of three Jesuits, namely: (i) Jesuit Joseph de Anchieta; (ii) Jesuit [[Antonio Ruiz de Montoya]]; and lastly, (iii) Jesuit Alonson de Aragona. The first Guaraní grammar written was that of Jesuit Joseph de Anchieta (1595).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossong|first=G.|date=|title=The Typology of Tupi-Guarani as Reflected in the Grammars of Four Jesuit Missionaries: Anchieta (1595), Aragona (c.1625), Montoya (1640) and Restivo (1729)|url=https://benjamins.com/catalog/hl.36.2.04bos|journal=Historiographia Linguistica|volume=36|issue=2–3|pages=225–258|doi=10.1075/hl.36.2.04bos|via=|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ringmacher&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringmacher|first=Manfred|date=2014|title=Classical Guarani beyond grammars and dictionaries: on an 18th century Jesuit manuscript|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/stuf.2014.67.issue-2/stuf-2014-0015/stuf-2014-0015.xml|journal=STUF - Language Typology and Universals|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=|doi=10.1515/stuf-2014-0015|issn=2196-7148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends, however, that Jesuit Antonio Ruiz de Montoya’s ''Arte de la lengua Guaraní'' (1640), a documentation of Guaraní grammar, served as a significant point of reference and departure for all proceeding grammatical works concerning the Guaraní language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Montoya’s analysis of the Guaraní [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and syntax stands accurate until this day.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhanduti.com/Nhanduti.EN/Libros.PY.EN/Cepag_Ceaduc.EN/Montoya.Tesoro.ES/Montoya.Tesoro,%20arte,%20vocabulario,%20catecismo.html#Anchor-11481|title=Art, Vocabulary, Treasure and Catechism of the Guarani Language, 1639-1640|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nhanduti.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montoya also produced a Guaraní dictionary known as ''Tesoro de la Lengua Guaraní'' (1639). In this work, he not only created the first dictionary of this kind, but also provided examples of contexts in which to use the various words he documented.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Lastly, Jesuit Alonson de Aragona produced a [[pedagogical grammar]] that was completed in 1629, but only printed in 1979. The intention of Aragona’s work was to help those seeking ways to learn Guaraní.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The extensive research conducted as well as the expansive reach of the Guaraní language across Latin America has granted it an important position in the urban landscape. In other words, Guaraní’s official status in Paraguay combined with research studies that have followed has allowed for recent projects of standardization.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isa.unc.edu/Guaraní-linguistics-in-the-21st-century/|title=Guaraní Linguistics in the 21st Century|last=Pena|first=S.|date=2017|website=Institute for the Study of the Americas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As efforts move forward to standardize Guaraní, the expansion of its use across sectors in Latin America will only increase. This can be seen with the broad expanse of literature being developed on the structure of Guaraní language, as well as its cultural importance. One of the key proponents in this venture, other than the Guaraní themselves, is academic Robert A. Dooley. Dooley has made an extensive collection of works of the language through his career, usually based around the discourse of the Guaraní-Mbyá language structure. Examples being on how different grammatical structures are understood by the speaker, can completely shift the narrative being shared,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooley|first=Robert|date=1989|title=Switch reference in Mbyá Guaraní: a fair-weather phenomenon|url=|journal=Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, University of North Dakota Session|volume=|pages=93–119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the focus on the pragmatic structuring of Guaraní sentences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Options in the pragmatic structuring of Guaraní sentences|last=Dooley|first=Robert|publisher=|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; clause chaining,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/silepubs/abstract.asp?id=52526|title=SIL e-Books: A Mosaic of languages and cultures: studies celebrating the career of Karl J. Franklin|website=www.sil.org|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spatial understandings of Guaraní.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooley|first=Robert|date=1983|title=Spatial deixis in Guaraní|url=|journal=Ciência e Cultura|volume=|pages=1243–1250|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These research projects done by Dooley are crucial to understanding different cultural aspects, like [[Discourse (disambiguation)|discourses]] in relation to translating important religious factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooley|first=Robert|date=2005|title=Source-Language Versus Target-Language Discourse Features in Translating the Word of God|url=|journal=Journal of Translation|volume=1 | issue = 2 |pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn are important for empowering the Guaraní themselves. This standardization is also supported by academics like Guillaume Thomas, who through examining Guaraní can differentiate between temporal suffixes and as such different tenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Guillaume|date=2014-12-01|title=Nominal tense and temporal implicatures: evidence from Mbyá|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11050-014-9108-2|journal=Natural Language Semantics|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=357–412|doi=10.1007/s11050-014-9108-2|issn=0925-854X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who through examining differing degrees of nominalization, is able to compare different variants of Guaraní-Mbyá between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Guilherme|date=2013|title=Reference to degrees and nominalization in Mbyá|url=|journal=The art and craft of semantics: a Festschrift for Irene Heim|volume=2|pages=201–225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn creating a type of database of difference that can be used for reference for the different language styles. Works such as these, and the work of scholars like Estigarribia and Pinta (2017) that compiles recent studies on the Guaraní will become of increasing relevance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Distribution of Guarani ==

=== Paraguay ===
Paraguayan Guarani, is, alongside [[Spanish language|Spanish]], one of the official languages of [[Paraguay]]. Paraguay's constitution is bilingual, and its state-produced textbooks are typically half in Spanish and half in Guarani.

Speakers of Guarani who are not fluent in any other language have markedly limited opportunities for education and employment. There are very few speakers of Guarani outside South America. Those few that exist include emigrants, scholars, missionaries, and former volunteers of the [[Peace Corps]].

A variety of Guarani known as [[Chiripá]] is also spoken in Paraguay. It is closely related to Paraguayan Guarani, a language which speakers are increasingly switching to. There are 7,000 speakers of Chiripá in Paraguay.

Additionally, another variety of Guarani known as [[Mbyá Guarani|Mbyá]] is also spoken in Paraguay by 8,000 speakers. Lexically, it is 75% similar to Paraguayan Guarani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gun|title=Ethnologue report for language code: gun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest Guarani speaking community in Paraguay is that of the [[Aché]], also known as [[Guayakis|Guayaki]], with a population of 850.

Finally, in the [[Paraguay]]an [[Chaco Department]], there are 304 speakers of [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani|Eastern Bolivian]]/[[Western Argentine Guarani]], known locally as Ñandeva&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gui Eastern Bolivian Guarani at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; or Tapiete. (However, outside Paraguay, Ñandeva refers to Chiripá.)

The largest Guarani group in the Chaco is that known locally as Guarayo who settled in Paraguay after the war with Bolivia (1932–35). They are originally from the [[Isoso]] area of Bolivia.

=== Argentina ===
Paraguayan Guarani is an official language in the province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], alongside [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

A different variety of Guarani, [[Western Argentine Guarani]], is spoken further west by about 15,000 speakers, mostly in [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], but also in [[Salta Province]]. It refers essentially to the same variety of Guarani as [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt;

Additionally, another variety of Guarani known as [[Mbyá Guarani|Mbyá]] is spoken in Argentina by 3,000 speakers.

=== Bolivia ===
[[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]] and [[Western Bolivian Guarani]] are widely spoken in the southeastern provinces of the country.

Eastern Bolivian Guarani, also known as '''Chawuncu''' or '''Chiriguano''', is spoken in by 33,670 speakers (or 36,917) in the south-central [[Parapeti River]] area and in the city of [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt; It refers to essentially the same variety of Guarani as [[Western Argentine Guarani]].

Other '''Guarani''' groups that exist are the '''Gwarayú''' or '''Guarayos''' around 30,000, and '''Sirionó''' some 800 in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]]. What remains of the '''Yuki''' population estimated at around 240 live in the Dpt. of [[Cochabamba]].

In August 2009 Bolivia launched a Guarani-language university at Kuruyuki in the southeastern province of Chuquisaca which will bear the name of indigenous hero [[Apiaguaiki Tumpa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boliviaun.org/cms/?p=1158|title=Bolivia Launches Universities for Indigenous People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===

The expansive territory of the Guaraní encompasses a space that traverses the Brazilian, Paraguayan, Argentinian and Uruguayan borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/guaranis-and-jesuits|title=Guaranis and Jesuits|last=Herzog|first=Tamar|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various points of tension in the history of the Guaraní, but this analysis will prioritize three: (i) the arrival of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]; (ii) the exploitative labour practices of the [[Encomienda|''encomiendas'']]; and finally, (iii) the expropriation of Guaraní land by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] [[Colonization|colonizers]].
== History ==
==== The Jesuits ====
The arrival of the Jesuits to Guaraní territory in the seventeenth century resulted in a re-organization of the social, political and economic structures of the Guaraní peoples.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/imagining-guaranis-and-jesuits|title=Imagining Guaranis and Jesuits|last=Wilde|first=Guillermo|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communities (commonly referred to as “missions”) that the Jesuits established amassed a total population that surpassed 100 000 Guaraní peoples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The subjugation of the Guaraní people to one social, economic, political, and spiritual order in the missions contributed to a false construction of the Guaraní as a homogeneous people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wilde articulated it well in his assertion that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The missions constituted an “[[imagined community]]” that over the course of 150 years incorporated very diverse populations that had to adapt to a single pattern of spatial and temporal organization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Initially, the [[Spaniards]] recognized the differences amongst the indigenous people of the Guaraní territory; yet, Spanish documentation failed to adequately recognize this diversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Encomenderos ====
The Guaraní were not only subjected to regimented living conditions by the Europeans, but they were also manipulated through exploitative labour practices. The Guaraní were victims of exploitation by both the ''encomenderos'' of the Spanish territories as well as by the [[Slavery in Latin America|slave traders]] of the south of Brazil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ecomenderos were the recipients of an encomienda. An [[encomienda]] was a grant from the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|crown]] that allowed specific officials the control over certain indigenous populations with the intention of extracting labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/encomienda|title=encomienda {{!}} Spanish policy|last=|first=|date=20 July 1998|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Encomenderos granted Guaraní people work in exchange for “protection,” but for the most part, this work arrangement merely facilitated an institutionalized exploitation of labour of the Guaraní people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/guarani-kaiowa/549|title=History of contact &gt; Guarani Kaiowá|website=pib.socioambiental.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treaty of Madrid ====
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1750, the Guaraní fought for the rights to their territory in a war lasting from 1754 until 1756.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This treaty mandated the displacement of numerous Guaraní people living in areas controlled by the Spanish monarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The treaty granted the Portuguese monarchy the rights to specific areas previously under Spanish control. The Portuguese complied with the treaty with the condition that the Guaraní people would be removed. In other words, in spite of the Guaraní being central to the stipulations of the treaty, they were completely absent from negotiation processes. The treaty was not upheld after 1761. As a result, the only purpose the treaty fulfilled was the displacement and death of numerous Guaraní people and the destruction of their communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Jesuits were expelled from the Guaraní territory in 1767, in part, because of their supposed assistance to the Guaraní in efforts to defend their rights to their territory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Language Documentation Projects ====
In 2014, Brazil’s [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage|Institute of National Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN) officially recognized Guaraní-Mbyá as being of cultural significance in Brazilian history.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trabalhoindigenista.org.br/lingua-guarani-mbya-reconhecida-como-referencia-cultural-brasileira/|title=Língua Guarani Mbya reconhecida como referência cultural brasileira|last=Nakamura|first=Rafael|date=2014|work=Centro de Trabalho Indigenista|access-date=2017-12-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision was the product of a pilot project that researched the number of speakers of the language in conjunction with other important indicators. There project was administered by the Political Linguistics Research and Development Institute (IPOL) who conducted research in more than 60 communities, documenting how the speakers defined, transmitted and used their language in daily life.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; At the end of this project, the findings were published in digital and text format and presented at a conference.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The conference afforded the Guaraní an opportunity to express their endorsement of Guaraní-Mbyá being recognized as a cultural reference point in Brazilian history. Additionally, national recognition of the importance of this language granted the public the possibility of re-considering the important value of the Guaraní people to Brazilian history.  It also provided the Guaraní an opportunity to develop stronger feelings of autonomy and agency with regard to their own cultural identities.

In 2009 ''The Guaraní Project'' began to be developed in the Documentation Project on Indigenous Culture ([http://prodocult.museudoindio.gov.br PRODOCULT]) by the Museu do Indio with funding support from UNESCO and the Banco do Brasil foundation. The purpose of this project is to firstly document Guaraní culture through the words and actions of the Guaraní themselves, as well as aid in indigenous agency and independence through teaching them methodologies for documenting their culture, so they can ultimately tell their own cultural histories. The first phase of this project, and its base purpose, is to train young peoples from five separate Guaraní-Mbyá villages in the southern coasts of Rio de Janeiro in documenting and inventorying both material and non-material culture that they deem to be relevant to themselves in the present day, and their past cultural histories. The other phases of this project aim to introduce those residing in these villages to the process of micro-informatics, and other ways of documenting culture such as through photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prodocult.museudoindio.gov.br/etnias/guarani-mbya/guarani-mbya/projeto|title=Guarani-Mbya Projeto|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guarani interrogative pronouns have the same person and non-person distinction as negative pronouns.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Inflection ===
[[Inflection]] or inflectional affixes, are the changes in a word to mark differentiations in [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense]], person, mood, voice, case, and number of speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mood-grammar|title=Mood|last=|first=|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflectional affixes can be in turn divided into seven different components.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reference Based Inflection ====
Firstly, there are inflections of ''personal reference'', which can connect to the speaker, addressee, or neither.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Secondly, there is ''subject reference'', which is the inflection that relates to the subject of a conversation, which follow the same structures as personal reference.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Third, there is ''object reference'',&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which is the inflection used when connecting a person to an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onestopenglish.com/grammar/grammar-reference/nouns-and-phrases/subjects-and-objects-in-english-article/152836.article|title=Subjects and Objects in English|last=Maxwell|first=Kerry|last2=Clanfield|first2=Lindsay|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reflexive inflection ====
The ''reflexive inflection'' within Guarani holds a specific morpheme, that being ‘ye-’.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; ‘Ye-’ stems together with the morpheme for a subject in a sentence, and is the indicator of whether the subject is the individual undergoing an action, or is the actor themselves.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reciprocal inflection  ====
''Reciprocal inflection'' holds the specific morpheme ‘yo-’, which similar to the morpheme for reflexive inflection combines with the subject of a sentence, specifically in third person or plural morphemes.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Desiderative inflection ====
The morpheme for ''desiderative inflection'', ‘ta-’.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; As in the other examples mentioned prior, this morpheme stems together with the subject in a sentence for indicating someone’s wish, permission, command, etc.

==== Commanding inflection ====
The ''commanding inflection'' represents itself in Guarani with the morpheme ‘e-’, which occurs with verbal stems for the purpose of indicating second person singular command.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Active and Stative Verbs ====
Guarani is an [[Active–stative language|active-stative language]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In other words, Guarani consists of active [[transitive verb]]s as well as both active and stative [[intransitive verb]]s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; To indicate the subject, active verbs use [[prefix]]es. In stative verbs, with the exception of the third person case, the subjects are not marked by prefixes, but by subject pronouns that operate independently and not as [[suffix]]es.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It is also worth noting that in Guarani, first person plural can be both inclusive and exclusive.

== Grammar ==

=== Valency Change ===

=== Valency Increasing ===
In Guarani, [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] increases occur by modifying the predicates in either valency 1 or valency 2 to the consecutive valency (i.e. valency 2 and 3 respectively for valency 1 and valency 2) (as cited in Estigarribia &amp; Pinta, p.&amp;nbsp;50).&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guarani linguistics in the 21st century|last=Estigarribia|first=Bruno|last2=Pinta|first2=Justin|publisher=Brill|year=2017|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=45–55, 72, 171, 184, 241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Causative Voice ====
In Guarani, the ''[[causative voice]]'' is the only voice with the power to increase valency.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; For example, in the case of intransitive verbs, the causative voice can be observed by the prefix ''mbo-/mo-''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
!Example 1 
!Example 2 
|-
|''Ambojere ña’ẽmbe.''

|}
''Note.'' Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The prefixes of the causative voice have the flexibility of functioning as derivational morphemes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

|}
''Note.'' Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In the case of transitive clauses, the causative morpheme ''–uka'' is used.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

|}
''Note''. Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Valency-Decreasing Voices ===
In contrast to valency-increasing mechanisms, valency-decreasing mechanisms modify predicates so as to transform valency 2 and 3 to lower valencies.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; There are three valency-decreasing voices, they are: middle, reciprocal, and anti-passive.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Middle  ====
The prefix je-/ñe- is used in the middle voice.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The middle voice is utilized in contexts expressing passive and reflexive scenarios. 
{| class="wikitable"

''Note''. Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Reciprocal  ====
The prefix jo-/ño- indicates that a reciprocal voice is being used. In reciprocal voice, the participants of the clause are both the agent and the patient of one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-10|title=Reciprocal (grammar)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reciprocal_(grammar)&amp;oldid=738647648|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

|}
''Note''. Data in chart above retrieved from Estigarribia and Pinta.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Anti-passive  ====
The anti-passive voice can be identified through the prefix ''poro-'' and the prefix ''–mba’e''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The prefix ''“poro-”'' is utilized in association with human objects and ''“mba’e-”'' is used in contexts where inanimate as well as non-human subjects are present.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In contrast to the passive middle voice, the anti-passive voice detransivitizes the patient in the transitive clause as opposed to detransitivizing the agent.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Tense ===
In grammar, tense can be defined as a grammatical tool that is used to refer to the time frame in connection to the moment of speaking, with the purpose being to express a specific difference in time in connection to a topic or the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tense|title=Definition of TENSE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominal tense can be defined as an action that is true to an individual in a particular point in time, e.g “Yesterday, a student knitted’ in which the morphological marker for past tense in English, ''-ed'', is attached to the action made by the student individual.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonhauser|first=Judith|date=2007|title=Nominal Tense? The Meaning of Guaraní Nominal Temporal Markers|url=|journal=Language|volume=83 | issue = 4 |pages=831–869|doi=10.1353/lan.2008.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temporal Suffixes ===
In Guarani, however, verbs are often left unmarked for tense. Instead, the present is left without any type of tense marker or morpheme connected to it indicating it is present. As such, verbs falling under present tense can have relative flexibility in connection to [[temporality]]. In other words, verbs in the present tense have the flexibility of also meaning remote past or near future These are known as bare verbs, and refer to events that occur at the time of or shortly before the time of speaking. These sentences can only ever properly be used to answer questions in relation to the past, or in connection to the present, but never about the future.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Guillaume|date=2014|title=Nominal tense and temporal implicatures: evidence from Mbyá|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11050-014-9108-2|journal=Natural Language Semantics|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=357–412|doi=10.1007/s11050-014-9108-2|issn=0925-854X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Va’kue can be found in sentences that directly describe past events, or as a connecting anchor to a time before the past event being referenced by the speaker.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A-mba’eapo '''va’e-kue''' &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1-work REL-PST &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;‘I worked/was working.’&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In order to connect to future events, the morpheme suffix –rã is used. In English, - rã translates to meaning ‘future’, and it signifies the ‘future’ of something, as can be seen in the example below, or as something that only exists within the future.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kuee, a-jogua che-ro-'''rã''' &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yesterday, 1-buy 1-house-FUT &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Yesterday, I bought my (future) house.’ &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Similar to va’ekue, when the relative clause va’e combines with -rã, the morpheme suffix va’erã is formed. Va’erã is used to express a connection to broader future ties, and it can be found in sentences that describe directly future events.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Guarani temporal markers are only productive with [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinites]], [[Possessive affix|possessives]], [[demonstrative]]s, and qualification in [[Noun phrase|nominal phrases]]. Depending on the clarification of the phrase they are in, they may or may not be applicable, as is represented in the chart below. Through analyzing this chart, one can see that ''-kue'' is not applicable to artifacts of a food or natural origin, and that ''-kue'' is also not applicable when combined with nouns that represent permeant relations.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

'''''Il Postino: The Postman''''' ({{lang-it|Il postino|lit|'The Postman'}}; the title used for the original US release&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.oscars.org/awardsdatabase/ official Academy Awards database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707023727/http://www.oscars.org/awardsdatabase/ |date=7 July 2008 }} refers to it as ''The Postman (Il Postino)''&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1994 Italian film directed by [[Michael Radford]] and [[Massimo Troisi]]. The film tells a fictional story in which the real life [[Chile]]an poet [[Pablo Neruda]] forms a relationship with a simple postman who learns to love poetry. It stars [[Philippe Noiret]], [[Massimo Troisi]], and [[Maria Grazia Cucinotta]]. The screenplay was adapted by Anna Pavignano, Michael Radford, [[Furio Scarpelli]], [[Giacomo Scarpelli]], and Massimo Troisi from the novel ''[[Ardiente paciencia]]'' by [[Antonio Skármeta]]. In 1983, Skármeta himself wrote and directed the film ''Ardiente paciencia'' (English translation: "Burning Patience"), which he later adapted to the novel of the same name in 1985.

Writer/star Massimo Troisi postponed heart surgery so that he could complete the film. The day after filming was completed, he suffered a fatal heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laurino|first=Maria|title=FILM; A Postman, a Poet, an Actor's Farewell|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6061FFE3D590C728DDDAF0894DD494D81|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Set in the year 1950, Pablo Neruda, the famous [[Chile]]an poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman, like his father. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail (the island has no cars). Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry.

Meanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works in her aunt's village cafe. He is shy with her, but he enlists Neruda's help. Mario constantly asks Neruda if particular metaphors that he uses are suitable for his poems. Mario is able to better communicate with Beatrice and express his love through poetry. Despite the aunt's strong disapproval of Mario, because of his sensual poetry (which turns out to be largely stolen from Neruda), Beatrice responds favourably.

The two are married. The priest refuses to allow Mario to have Neruda as his best man because of politics; however, this is soon resolved. This was because Di Cosimo was the politician in office in the area with the [[Christian Democrats]]. At the wedding, Neruda receives the welcome news that there is no longer a Chilean warrant for his arrest so he returns to Chile.

Mario writes a letter but never gets any reply. Several months later, he receives a letter from Neruda. However, to his dismay, it is actually from his secretary, asking Mario to send Neruda's old belongings back to Chile. While there Mario comes upon an old [[phonograph]] and listens to the song he first heard when he met Neruda. Moved, he makes recordings of all the beautiful sounds on the island onto a cassette including the heartbeat of his soon-to-be-born child.

Five years later, Neruda finds Beatrice and her son, Pablito (named in honour of Neruda) in the same old inn. From her, he discovers that Mario had been killed before their son was born. Mario had been scheduled to recite a poem he had composed at a large [[communist]] gathering in Naples; the demonstration was violently broken up by the police. She gives Neruda recordings of village sounds that Mario had made for him. The film ends with Neruda walking in the beach he used to talk with Mario, showing at the same time the communist gathering in which Mario was killed.

== Cast ==

== Setting ==
Whereas the novel and the 1985 film were set in Chile, with Neruda living in his home at [[Isla Negra]] around 1970, ''Il Postino: The Postman'' moves the setting to Italy in about 1950. The film is set and was filmed on the island of [[Procida]], gulf of [[Naples]]; some additional filming took place on [[Salina Island|Salina]], one of the volcanic [[Aeolian Islands|Aeolian Island]]s that form an archipelago off the northern coast of Sicily.

[[Corricella]] is the setting for some of the waterfront scenes in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Soundtrack ==
{{further|Il Postino (soundtrack)}}

In 1994 to promote the film, [[Miramax]] published ''The Postman (Il Postino): Music From The Miramax Motion Picture'', which besides the film's score, composed by [[Luis Enríquez Bacalov]], includes Neruda's poems recited by many celebrities. There are a total of 31 tracks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">The '''''Institute of Semitic Studies''''' (ISS) is a nonprofit independent research institution based in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]] dedicated to the academic study of [[Semitic studies|Semitic]] (and other major Afroasiatic) languages and cultures. Its work seeks especially to highlight the contribution of Afroasiatic peoples to world civilization, in general, and Western culture, in particular. It was founded in Princeton in 1984 and then incorporated in 1985  and is currently directed by [[Ephraim Isaac]] a [[Harvard]] trained scholar and peace activist. The Institute also releases a bi-annual linguistically focused international scholarly journal entitled the [[Journal of Afroasiatic Languages]]&lt;ref name="jaalsite"&gt;[http://jaalsite.com/ Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428105320/http://www.jaalsite.com/ |date=2013-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (JAAL) published by the [[Red Sea Press]].&lt;ref name="africaworldpressbooks"&gt;[http://www.africaworldpressbooks.com/servlet/Detail?no=975 JOURNAL OF AFROASIATIC LANGUAGES&lt;br&gt;Volume 5, Number 1, Summer 2012&lt;p&gt;Institute of Advanced Semitic and Afroasiatic Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its academic journal, it also recently launched an academic monograph series called [[Afroasiatic Studies]] in collaboration with the Red Sea Press. The Institute of Semitic Studies is the first independent research institute that focuses on Semitic and Afroasiatic studies within the United States.

==Major Achievements and Work==
Among the Institute’s major achievements to date is the sponsorship of the 1989 symposium on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. According to the Institute's website, "This symposium was editorialized in the Washington Post as a commendable peace-making effort among bitterly quarreling scholars.".&lt;ref name="instituteofsemiticstudies"&gt;[http://instituteofsemiticstudies.org/ISS_Site/About_The_Institute.html Institute of Semitic Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, the Institute sponsored the Second International Congress of "Yemenite Jewish Studies"&lt;ref name="ParfittTudor"&gt;Parfitt, Tudor. The Road to Redemption: The Jews of the Yemen, 1900-1950. Leiden, Netherlands: E.J. Brill, 1996, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  where the Congress brought together over 200 scholars and many interested individuals from Israel, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. A congratulatory message was given by the future US President [[Bill Clinton]] and the then Prime Minister Shamir of Israel.&lt;ref name="Theproceeding"&gt;The proceeding of the congress was published in 1999 by Ephraim Isaac--Judaeo-Arabic Studies: Proceedings of the Second International Congress of Yemenite Jewish Studies  co-editorYosef Tobi, University of Haifa &amp; Institute of Semitic Studies, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Institute supports a [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] project to make the Dead Sea Scrolls publicly available in their original Hebrew and/or Aramaic, with new English translations. It supports the University of Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary Project. In 1988, it co-sponsored with the Univ. of Pennsylvania the 35th International Congress of Assyriology. In 1991, it co-sponsored with [[Princeton University]] the Fifth Congress of Judaeo-Arabic Studies and another on Ancient Iraq. It has organized other major scholarly projects and frequent public and educational programs. Among these are those on the [[Nabataeans]], religions of pre-Islamic Arabia, and Ethiopic Christian manuscripts.&lt;ref name="instituteofsemiticstudies" /&gt;

==Collaborations==
The Institute has collaborated with [[Princeton University]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[New York State Bar Association|New York Bar Association]], the Israeli Association for Society and Culture, as well as Pennsylvania Governor’s Cultural Affairs Department, the University of the Arts, Please Touch Me Museum, the Woodrow Wilson Institute, and many others.

==Previous Donors==
Support for the work of the Institute has come from various sources, but most notably the [[Carnegie Corporation]] of New York, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the New Jersey Committee for the Humanities, the New York Committee for the Humanities, Bristol Myers Co, Blum Foundation, Lawrence Gelb Foundation, New York City Central Labor Council: AFL-CIO, State of Ben L. Burman, H. J. Stich Foundation, JDC, and many generous individuals all over the US.

==Media Recognition==
Even in its first years of establishment, the work of the Institute of Semitic Studies had caught national and international attention. In a little less than a decade, its work was reported in five front-page newspaper stories ([[New York Times]], 3; [[Trenton Times]], 2), and its role discussed in one major editorial (Washington Post). Stories about the work of the Institute have been featured in the [[Boston Globe]], [[Chicago Tribune]], [[Christian Science Monitor]], and several local, national, and international papers and other media including the BBC.&lt;ref name="instituteofsemiticstudies" /&gt;

==Mission and Peace-Activity==
The Institute’s mission is to promote the unique and rich contributions of Semitic and Afroasiatic culture and language to world civilization through rigorous academic research. As an integral part of its mission, however, it also seeks to integrate its scholarship with peace-building efforts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East through the promotion of mutual understanding of common cultural and linguistic heritages. The institute is planning to build an African Peace Center in Princeton which would be to dedicated academic peace-building research and conflict mediation for conflict ridden regions in Africa.

'''Intimacy''' is the degree to which a person can share feelings with another in a [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]. Intimacy is occasionally linked with [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] but it can also occur in a [[Platonic love|nonsexual]] or unromantic relationship. The [[dialectic]]s of connection-autonomy and openness-closedness manipulate the communication of intimacy between partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''Joseph M. Baumgarten''' (Vienna, September 7, 1928 – December 4, 2008) was a Semitic scholar known for his knowledge in the field of Jewish legal texts from biblical law to Mishnaic law and including the legal texts among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. 
Baumgarten immigrated to the United States with his family in 1939 as a result of the [[Anschluss]], Germany's occupation of Austria in 1938. In 1950, he was ordained a rabbi at [[Mesivta Torah Vodaath]], a prominent Brooklyn yeshiva. He married Naomi Rosenberg in 1953.

Baumgarten started his studies in the field of mathematics with a B.A. cum laude from Brooklyn College. It was a chance meeting at [[Johns Hopkins]] with [[William Foxwell Albright]] that caused him to change direction, eventually being awarded a Ph.D. in [[Semitic studies]] in 1954. His dissertation was entitled "The Covenant Sect and the Essenes." From 1952 to 1957 he remained at Johns Hopkins teaching Aramaic. In 1953 he began his long association with [[Baltimore Hebrew University|Baltimore Hebrew College]]. He also took on the role of rabbi to the Bnai Jacob Congregation in 1959. Throughout his life he was a member of the Rabbinical Council of America, a major organization of Orthodox rabbis.

Prof. Baumgarten served as visiting professor at Towson State College, University of Maryland, and the University of the Negev (now Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) in Israel. He was also in residence at the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1990 and again in 2001. He was a fellow at the Annenberg Institute (now the Center for Judaic Studies of the University of Pennsylvania) in Philadelphia in 1992-93.

1953 saw the first of his publications on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Essays from the early period of his study were collected in 1977, ''Studies in Qumran Law'' (Leiden: Brill, 1977). His knowledge of Qumran legal matters was probably the reason why [[John Strugnell]] gave him the task of publishing the Cave 4 fragments of the [[Damascus Document]]. His work on the [[Damascus Document]] not only brought its manuscripts to publication but provided the basis for understanding it within the framework of the history of [[Judaism]].

A [[festschrift]] was presented to him in 1995: ''Legal Texts and Legal Issues, Proceedings of the Second Meeting of the International Organization for Qumran Studies, Cambridge 1995, Published in Honour of Joseph M. Baumgarten'', edited by M. Bernstein, F. García Martínez, J. Kampen (Leiden: Brill, 1997).

==Publications==

His publications include:

* ''Law in the Dead Sea Scrolls'', (Routledge - an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis Books Ltd, July 2005) {{ISBN|0-415-19651-5}}
* ''Qumran Cave 4 Vol. XIII : The Damascus Document (4Q266-273)'', editor with Jozef T. Milik, Stephen Pfann, Ada Yardeni (Oxford: OUP, 1997) {{ISBN|0-19-826396-1}}

'''Khamti language''' ( Khamti : လိꩱ့်တဲးၵမ်းတီႈ (Khamti written), Khamti : ၵၢမ်းတဲးၵံးတီႈ (Khamti spoken) [[Shan language|Shan]] ၶၢမ်းတႆးၶမ်းတီႈ , [kháːm táj], or Shan: ၽႃႇသႃႇတႆးၶမ်းတီႈ, [pʰàːsʰàː táj]; Burmese:  ခန္တီးရှမ်းဘာသာ, [ʃáɴ bàðà]; Thai: ภาษาไทคำตี่ )
is a [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern Tai language]] spoken in Burma and India by the [[Khamti people]].

==Demographics==
In Burma, Khamti is spoken by 3,500 in [[Sagaing Region]], near [[Myitkyina]] and by 4,500 in [[Kachin State]], Putao District (both reported in 2000).  In India, it is spoken by 5,000 in [[Assam]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], in the Dikrong Valley, Narayanpur, and north bank of the [[Brahmaputra]] (reported in 2007).

Three dialects of Khamti are known: North Burma Khamti, Assam Khamti and Sinkaling Khamti.  All speakers of Khamti are bilingual, largely in Assamese and Burmese.&lt;ref name="Khamti Language Meta Data" /&gt;

==Name==
"Khamti" has been variously rendered ''Hkamti, Khampti, Khamti Shan, Khampti Shan, Khandi Shan, Kam Ti, Tai Kam Ti, Tai-Khamti, Kamti, Hkampti Shan,'' and ''Khampti Sam''.&lt;ref name="Khamti Language Meta Data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Khamti|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1425|website=Endangered Languages Project|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The language seems to have originated around [[Mogoung]] in Upper Burma.&lt;ref name="Khamti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Khamti|url=http://www.iitg.ernet.in/rcilts/phaseI/languages/khamti.htm|website=Khamti - A Language of Siamese-Chinese sub-family|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mung Kang was captured, a large group of Khamtis moved to the north and east of [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]].  In the year 1850, 300–400 Khamtis settled in Assam.&lt;ref name="Government Printing, Burma"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Needham|first1=J.F.|title=Outline Grammar of the Khamti Language|date=1894|publisher=Government Printing, Burma|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433081855326;view=1up;seq=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Unlike other Tai languages that display SVO word order, Khamti has SOV word order.&lt;ref&gt;Wilaiwan Kanittanan. 1986. Kamti Tai: From an SVO to an SOV language.

There are eleven official '''languages of South Africa''': [[Afrikaans]], [[South African English|English]], [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Northern Sotho]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Swazi language|SiSwati]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda language|Venda]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]].  Fewer than two percent of [[South Africa|South Africans]] speak a [[first language]] other than an official one.&lt;ref name=cib11 /&gt; Most South Africans [[Multilingualism|can speak more than one language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southafrica-info.com/arts-culture/11-languages-south-africa/|title=The 11 languages of South Africa - South Africa Gateway|last=Alexander|first=Mary|date=2018-03-06|work=South Africa Gateway|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and English were the first [[official language]]s of [[South Africa]] from 1910 to 1925. Afrikaans was [[Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925|added as a part of Dutch in 1925]], although in practice, Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch, which fell into disuse. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925]] says ''Dutch includes Afrikaans''; Article 119 of the constitution of 1961 says ''Afrikaans includes Dutch''&lt;/ref&gt; and Dutch was dropped in 1984, so between 1984 and 1994, South Africa had two official languages: English and Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/83cons.htm |title=Documents - Constitution - Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 110 of 1983 |publisher=Info.gov.za |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224204154/http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/83cons.htm |archivedate=24 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

English being the second language of many South Africans is most likely the most commonly spoken language of the nation. Many countries from around the world have turned to South Africa for their supply of low cost English and other educators.

Different government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.translate.org.za/pipermail/translate-announce/2006q4/000003.html Translate.org.za Newsletter 2006: Sesotho sa Leboa or Sepedi. 14 November 2006.

Since taking power in the 1994 election, the [[African National Congress|ANC]] has promoted English as the main language of government, even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose. Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English, as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English.

In terms of linguistic classification, the official languages include two [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] languages (English and Afrikaans) and nine [[Southern Bantu languages]]. Four of these are [[Nguni languages]] (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele) and three are [[Sotho–Tswana languages]] (Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Tswana). Tsonga is a [[Tswa–Ronga languages|Tswa–Ronga language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southafrica-info.com/arts-culture/11-languages-south-africa/|title=The 11 languages of South Africa - South Africa Gateway|date=2018-03-06|work=South Africa Gateway|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South African Sign Language]] is understood across the country, though sometimes sign-language interpreters use [[manually coded language in South Africa|manually coded language]].

The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu (23 percent), followed by Xhosa (16 percent), and Afrikaans (14 percent). English is the fourth most common first language in the country (9.6%), but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', "Tongues under threat", 22 January 2011, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa: the [[Sotho–Tswana languages|Sotho–Tswana]] branch (Sesotho, Northern Sotho, Tswana), or the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] branch (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Ndebele). For each of the two groups, the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group.

The nine indigenous African languages of South Africa can be divided into two geographical zones, with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country (Indian Ocean coast) and Sesotho languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland, as also in [[Botswana]] and [[Lesotho]]. [[Gauteng]] is the most linguistically heterogeneous province, with roughly equal numbers of Nguni, Sesotho and Indo-European language speakers. This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot, [[Tsotsitaal]], in large urban townships in the province.

Afrikaans, a language derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country ([[Western Cape|Western]] and [[Northern Cape]]). It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of [[Coloured]] ([[multiracial]])  people in the country.&lt;ref name=cib11&gt;{{cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885 |pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country, as a second (or third or even fourth) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas.

The [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]] recorded the following distribution of first language speakers:&lt;ref name="cib11"/&gt;

===Other significant languages spoken in South Africa===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pretoria]] --&gt;
Other languages spoken in South Africa, though not mentioned in the Constitution, include [[Fanagalo]], [[Lobedu language|Lobedu (''Khilobedu'')]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele (''Sindebele'')]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi (''Siphuthi'')]].
Lobedu has been variously claimed to be a dialect of Northern Sotho and an autonomous language. Fanagalo is a [[pidgin]] often used as a [[lingua franca]] in the mining industry.

Significant numbers of immigrants from [[Europe]], elsewhere in [[Africa]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]] means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa. In the older immigrant communities there are: [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Urdu]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Italian Language|Italian]] and smaller numbers of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] speakers.

These non-official languages may be used in limited semi-official use where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. More importantly, these languages have significant local functions in specific communities whose identity is tightly bound around the linguistic and cultural identity that these non-official SA languages signal.

The fastest growing non-official language is Portuguese {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} – first spoken by immigrants from Portugal, especially [[Madeira]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescochair-iuav.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lecture-10-May-2013-Portuguese-Migration-to-South-Africa.pdf|title=Portuguese Migration to, And Settlement in South Africa: 1510-2013 |publisher=SSIIM (UNESCO Chair on the Social and Spatial Inclusion of International Migrants – Urban Policies and Practices) |date=10 May 2013|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later black and white settlers and refugees from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] after they won independence from [[Portugal]] and now by more recent immigrants from those countries again – and increasingly French, spoken by immigrants and refugees from [[Francophone]] [[Central Africa]].

More recently, speakers of [[North Africa|North]], Central and [[West Africa]] languages have arrived in South Africa, mostly in the major cities, especially in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]], but also [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]].

==Constitutional provisions==
Chapter 1 (Founding Provisions), Section 6 (Languages) of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] is the basis for government [[language policy]].

The English text of the constitution signed by president [[Nelson Mandela]] on 16 December 1996 uses (mostly) the names of the languages expressed in those languages themselves. Sesotho refers to Southern Sotho, and isiNdebele refers to Southern Ndebele. Controversy surrounds the designation of Northern Sesotho as ''Sepedi'' (its main dialect) instead of the comprehensive ''Sesotho sa Leboa'' (which had been the wording in the [[South African Constitution of 1993|Interim Constitution of 1993]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 200 of 1993|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/constitution-republic-south-africa-act-200-1993#constituant%20and%20formal%20provisions|website=www.gov.za|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spelling of Venda is also incorrectly rendered as ''Tshivenda'' instead of the correct ''Tshivenḓa''.

The constitution mentions "sign language" in the generic sense rather than South African Sign Language specifically.

The following is a list of '''languages''' used in the '''[[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]''' since the contest's inception in 2003, which includes the year, country, song and artist through which each language made its debut. There is a rule in place that stipulates that any given song must be sung in one of the national languages of the country it represents. However, it is permissible for a song to contain lyrics in other languages on top of this.

The songs that contained the most languages were the Serbian entry in 2006 and the Albanian entry in 2015, both with eight. The Serbian song, "Učimo strane jezike", actually only contains two lines (found in its chorus) in Serbian, while the rest is sung in the English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Japanese languages. Albania's "Dambaje" is sung in Albanian, German, French, Spanish, English, Italian, Slovene,Imaginary Language &amp; Turkish, the last of which made its debut in Junior Eurovision.

Japanese, Kazakh, Latin, and Welsh have been featured in songs of the Junior contest, but they have never been used in songs of the senior [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

It is common to find [[minced oath]]s in literature and media. Writers often include minced oaths instead of [[profanity]] in their writing so that they do not offend audiences or incur [[censorship]].

==Novels==

[[W. Somerset Maugham]] referred to this problem in his 1919 novel ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'', where he admitted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle.&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maugham |first=W. Somerset |authorlink=W. Somerset Maugham |title=The Moon and Sixpence|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|year=1919|chapter=chapter 47 |isbn=978-0-486-44602-8|oclc=22207227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Geoffrey |title=Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English |publisher=Blackwell |year=1991 |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-631-16593-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, authors of children's fiction sometimes put minced oaths into the mouths of characters who swear a lot, as a way of depicting a part of their behaviour that would be unconvincing not to represent, but also avoiding the use of swear words which would be considered unsuitable for children to read.

In 1851, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bark's parts of speech are of an awful sort—principally adjectives. I won't, says Bark, have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my adjective premises!

In [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' series, characters use oaths such as "flaming" or "blood and ashes" or the interjection "light" in the same strength as a curse word, without having to print swear words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staveley |first1=Brian |title=OF LUMMOXES AND DICKHEADS: CURSING IN FANTASY |url=https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/cursinginfantas/ |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Fiction writer [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in novels such as ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' and ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'', uses '[[Shiv (weapon)|Shiv]]' and '[[Pudendal cleft|slit]]' to refer to male and female body parts (and sometimes males and females) respectively.

The lead characters of [[Anthony Crowley]] (a demon) and [[Aziraphale]] (an angel) from ''[[Good Omens]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], both use minced oaths on a number of occasions, though for different reasons (Aziraphale genuinely means to avoid offense, while Crowley, being a demon, simply finds it more acceptable to his post to say 'gosh' instead of 'God').

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2006 novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]'', the main characters, Lisey and Scott Landon, use the word ''smuck'' instead of ''fuck'', replacing it wherever ''fuck'' would be conceivably used: ''smucking, mothersmucker, smucked up'', etc.

In the ''[[Gaunt's Ghosts]]'' series by [[Dan Abnett]], the Imperial Guardsmen use the word ''feth'' as a general all-purpose swear word, primarily to replace the word ''fuck''.

In the series ''TZA'', John Spencer uses ''spash'' in place of most curses from the second book forth.

Throughout his comic novel ''[[Myron]]'', [[Gore Vidal]] replaces various obscenities with the names of judges who were involved in an obscenity trial.

In the ''[[Codex Alera]]'' series, by Jim Butcher, most obscenities are replaced with a variation of the word crow, e.g. crows or crowbegotten.

[[Terry Pratchett]] uses minced oaths for comic effect, for example in [[Mort]]: ''"A wizard. I hate ----ing wizards." "Well, you shouldn't ---- them then," replied the second, effortlessly pronouncing a row of dashes.''  In a later book, [[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]], the character [[Discworld characters#Mr Tulip|Mr Tulip]] habitually and persistently uses a similarly diagetic form of pseudo-profane interjection throughout his dialogue.

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'', the character 'Big Jim' Rennie avoids swearing by replacing words such as ''fucking and clusterfuck'' with ''cottonpicking and clustermug''.

Ernest Hemingway substituted muck for that with which it rhymes in 'Across the River and into the Trees ' and fornicate for that with which it doesn't rhyme in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' It makes for some awkward constructions in the latter.

[[Spider Robinson]], in his science fiction novels, consistently uses "kark" in place of "fuck", and "taken slot" in place of "fucking slut" -- "slot" perhaps being also a reference to the female anatomy as receptacle.

[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]] features the minced oaths of "mouse-dung" and rarely "fox-dung," and others relevant to the forest are used in place of curses.

==Comic books==
In the [[Judge Dredd]] comic strip featured in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'', the futuristic justice department approved the terms ''Stomm'', ''Drokk'', and ''Grud''. This last is a clear reference to the Christian God as it is accompanied by the apparatus of an organized religion, including "Church of Grud" and similar. Use of the terms includes the colorful "Grud on a Greenie!".&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/node/497833 |title=Swear words from science fiction |last=Saunders |first=Suzanne (Segnbora-t)|date=2000-04-15 |work=[[Everything2]] |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1979, ''2000 AD'' also featured a ''[[Dan Dare#2000 AD|Dan Dare]]'' comic strip, loosely set in the same continuity as ''Judge Dredd'', and these strips too used such parlance as ''Stomm'' and ''Drokk''.

In comic series ''[[Johnny the Homicidal Maniac]]'', the characters sometimes use the word ''fook'' in place of ''fuck''.

The DC Comics character [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], an invulnerable, intergalactic bounty hunter uses the term ''bastich'' or ''bastiches'' as a combination of bastard and bitch. i.e. "Take that you lousy bastiches!"

[[Captain Haddock]], from ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', swears unlike a real sailor with sesquipedalian ejaculations like "billions of blistering blue barnacles" and "thundering typhoons".&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9734 |title=Billions of Blistering Blue Barnicles! |last=Lopresti |first=Rob |date=2009-11-11 |work=Criminal Brief |accessdate=2009-11-13 |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==

In the [[Al Pacino]] epic ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', the title character [[Tony Montana]], played by Pacino, is warned by his Colombian accomplice in the censored version of the film, "Don't fool with me, Tony", and "I warned you not to fool with me, you foolish little monkey". Otherwise, the film, especially in its uncensored version, is filled with use of the word 'fuck', and the censored TV version replaces these in their dozens with 'fool'.

''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', in the film of the same name, which is rated PG, uses minced oaths to a particularly comical effect.

In the 1945 [[war film]] ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]'', the screenplay substitutes "loving" for "fucking" (the universal American soldier's descriptor).

In ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', the character Ralphie is punished by his parents for saying "Oh, fuck," although the offensive word is replaced with "fudge" in the film.  The narrator, an adult version of Ralphie (voiced by [[Jean Shepherd]]), explains that "I didn't say fudge.  I said THE word...the queen mother of dirty words: the F-dash-dash-dash word."

In the 1984 film ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]'', the character Roman Maronie is known for butchering the English language, especially English vulgarities:
:* You ''fargin' '' sneaky ''bastages''! (You fucking sneaky bastards!)
:* Don't ''bullshtein'' me! (Don't bullshit me!)
:* You lousy ''corksuckers''. (You lousy cocksuckers.)
:* Dirty ''summina-batches''. (Dirty sons-of-bitches.)
:* I'm gonna shove 'em up your ''icehole''. (I'm gonna shove 'em up your asshole.)

One of the more infamous TV edits is that of John McClane's iconic line from ''[[Die Hard]]'', "Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker" is changed to "Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon".

The TV edit of the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', instead of having the police lineup say, "Give me the keys, you fucking cocksucker", they say "Give me the keys, you fairy godmother".

In the 1998 film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', a well-known television edit exists of one profane-heavy scene altered. "See what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass" is changed to "See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps" and "this is what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs".

A television edit of the film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' contains the injunction "Flip you, melon farmer!" (Fuck you, motherfucker!)

A censored version of the 2004 film [[Shaun of the Dead]] contains a scene where "fuck" and "prick" are changed to "funk" and "prink", respectively. This leads to an exchange of minced oaths beginning, "it's four in the funking morning!" and ending with "it's not hip-hop, it's electro. Prink".

In Disney's 2016 animated film ''[[Zootopia]]'', Officer Judy Hopps uses the minced oath "Oh sweet cheese and crackers".
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The televised version of the 2006 film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' received the following edits to two of Samuel L. Jackson's lines: The line "I've had with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane" was changed to "I've had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane", and a later use of "fucking" is replaced with "freaking".

==Drama==

Late [[Elizabethan]] drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to [[Puritan]] opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'sblood&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's blood'' from [[Shakespeare]], ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slight&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''God's light'' from [[Ben Jonson]], and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'snails&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's nails'' from the historian John Hayward.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford |year=1989|edition=2|isbn=978-0-19-861186-8|url=http://www.oed.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swearing on stage was officially banned by the [[Act to Restrain Abuses of Players|Act to Restraine Abuses of Players]] in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623.

In some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'struth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (''By God's truth'') came to be spelled ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'strewth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''zounds'' changed pronunciation so that it no longer sounded like ''By God's wounds''.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|103–105}} Other examples from this period include ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slid&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for "By God's eyelid" (1598) and ''sfoot'' for "By God's foot" (1602). ''Gadzooks'' for "by God's hooks" (the [[nail (relic)|nails]] on [[Christian cross|Christ's cross]]) followed in the 1650s, ''egad'' for ''oh God'' in the late 17th century,&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|date=August 2006|edition=4|isbn=978-0-618-70172-8|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Charlton Grant|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary |editors=Guralnik, David, Agnes |publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons|location=Cleveland|date=April 2004|edition=4|isbn=978-0-7645-7125-1|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ods bodikins'' for "by God's little body" in 1709.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is similar to the use popularized in the 1950s of ''gee whiz'' as an oath for ''Jesus' wisdom''.&lt;ref name="AHD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD" /&gt;

In modern times, the gang members in the musical ''[[West Side Story]]'' talk in an invented 1950s-style slang that includes several minced oaths. At the end of the "Jet Song," they sing "We're gonna beat / Every last buggin' gang / On the whole buggin' street / On the whole ever-mother-lovin' street!" where ''buggin'' and ''mother-lovin'' are obvious minced oaths.

==Television==

"Freaking" (or sometimes "fricking") is often employed on U.S. over-the-air television entertainment programming as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my freaking food?" It is rarely used to replace "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse.

In the ''[[Father Ted]]'' episode "[[The Old Grey Whistle Theft]]", Ted's picnic at the local picnic area is disturbed by people claiming that he is in their "fupping spot". The man yells out "Fup off, ya grasshole" and when Ted asks them why they are talking like that, the man points to a list of picnic area rules, one of which is "No Swearing". The man finishes by yelling out "Fup off, ya pedrophile." In every single episode of ''Father Ted'' no Irish character utters the word "fuck", apart from one scene in "Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep" where the phrase "fucking hell" is shouted twice; although its attenuated alternative "[[feck]]" is heard repeatedly throughout.

In both incarnations of the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', characters use the word "frack" ([[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]]) or "frak" ([[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]]) in place of "fuck" in every sense of the word, as an interjection, as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my fracking food?" as well as "fuck" or "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse. Characters in the original series also use "felgercarb" in place of "shit". Characters on ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' then adopted "frak" from ''Battlestar Galactica''.

In the TV series ''[[Farscape]]'' the characters use the word "frell" as a combination of "frig", "fuck", and "hell" (as in "What the frell is going on?"), and the word "dren" instead of "shit". "Hezmana" and "yotz" are also used as rough replacements for "hell" and "crap" respectively.

In the TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', characters often use the word "gorram" in place of "goddam" or "god damned." Further, the word "fuck" and its variants is replaced variously by "hump", "humped" or "rutting". For example, "I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump," "If they find us at all, we're humped." and "It's the chain I go get and beat you with 'til you understand who's in ruttin' command here." Additionally, the characters do much of their cursing in Mandarin Chinese. This keeps the show unobjectionable enough to air on network television, yet at the same time maintain a realistic level of profanity for a show about outlaws, inspired by the wild west.

Likewise, in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', characters use a series of minced oaths regularly. Two such are used moderately, "Gimboid" and "goit" are derivations of "gimp" and "git" respectively (although "git" is frequently used also), but the final is a series trademark, "smeg". Although it is said to have derived from "smegma", the show's writers have said it is just a coincidence, as its similarity to the label of an Italian white-goods manufacturer. In any case, it has evolved into a word almost entirely specific to the Red Dwarf universe and numerous alterations were used in the show, such as: "smeg-head", "smeg-for-brains", "smegging", etc.

In ''[[South Park]]'' the word "[[fudge]]" (instead of "fuck") is frequently used, especially in the episode ''[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]'', where [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] sells chocolate fudge delicacies called "Fudge 'Ems", "Fudge This", "Go Fudge Yourself", "I Don't Give a Flying Fudge" and "I Just Went and Fudged Your Momma". "Lover" and "loving" are used in place of "fuck" through the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "Chickenlover". This is explained in the episode to be for the purpose of protecting young news viewers.

The television series ''[[A Bit of Fry and Laurie]]'' contains a sketch in which Fry and Laurie employ minced oaths; it is situated in a courthouse, and Laurie plays a policeman reciting the words of an offender. Examples include, "I apprehended the accused and advised him of his rights. He replied "Why don't you ram it up your pim-hole, you fusking cloff prunker."" and "Skank off, you cloffing cuck, you're all a load of shote-bag fuskers, so prunk that up your prime-ministering pim-hole." The sketch ends with Fry asking of Laurie's response to this language, and Laurie proclaiming, "I told him to mind his fucking language, m'lud."

In the Nickelodeon children's show ''[[iCarly]]'', characters often use the term "chizz" as a general purpose expletive, most often used in place of 'shit'.&amp;nbsp; ''iCarly'' is notorious for its thinly veiled adult humor.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, in the spinoff ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'', the term "wazz" is used in place of 'piss'.

Characters in the series ''[[The Good Place]]'' find themselves in an afterlife where they are incapable of using profanity. When they intend to curse, the word instead comes out as a benign minced oath such as "fork" for "fuck", "shirt" for "shit", or "bench" for "bitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Erik |title=The rules of The Good Place were meant to be broken |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-rules-of-the-good-place-were-meant-to-be-broken-1822250773 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbing of movies for television often replaces "Fuck you!" with "Forget you!", "bastard" with "buzzard", "fucking" with "stinking", and "prick" with "pig".

==Music==

[[The Fugs]], a mid-1960s band named by [[Tuli Kupferberg]], used a euphemism for "fuck" found in [[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ([[#Novels|above]]), ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="NM" /&gt;

==Internet==

In a discussion of profanity, writer Leigh Lundin uses the glyph [[ƒ]].&lt;ref name="CB0329"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=5931|title=WTF|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2009-03-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further discusses being "nannied" by Internet software, noting that words like cockatoo, pussycat, and even Hummer may be flagged,&lt;ref name="CB0729"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=137|title=Bad Words |chapter=Petting |last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2007-07-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become known as the [[Scunthorpe problem]].

In that vein, [[ProBoards]] forums replace the word "cock" with "thingy", thereby transforming the statement "cock his shotgun" into "thingy his shotgun". Similarly, the [[Something Awful forums]], filters replace "fuck" with the phrase "gently caress" and "shit" with "poo-poo" for unregistered users, and the Fark website replaces words such as "fuck" with "fark".&lt;ref name="fark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/|title=Fark|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, [[leet|alternative typographical glyphs]] are sometimes used to evade [[profanity filter]]s (such as $hit or $#!+ instead of [[shit]], @$$ or @rse instead of [[Buttocks|ass]] or [[Buttocks|arse]]).

"fsck", from "[[fsck|'''f'''ile'''s'''ystem '''c'''hec'''k''']]", is commonly used on Usenet and in other technology-related circles to replace "fuck".

A '''mire''' (or '''quagmire''') is a [[wetland]] type, dominated by living, [[peat]]-forming plants. Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter, due to waterlogging and subsequent anoxia. Like [[coral reef]]s, mires are unusual landforms in that they derive mostly from biological rather than physical processes, and can take on characteristic shapes and surface patterning.

There are four types of mire: [[bog]], [[fen]], [[marsh]] and [[swamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canadian wetland classification system|last=National Wetlands Working Group|year=1997|edition=2nd|publisher=University of Waterloo, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bog is a mire that due to its location relative to the surrounding landscape obtains most of its water from rainfall ([[ombrotrophic]]), while a fen is located on a slope, flat, or depression and gets most of its water from soil- or groundwater ([[minerotrophic]]). Thus while a bog is always acidic and nutrient-poor, a fen may be slightly acidic, neutral, or alkaline, and either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 |isbn=9780313327841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although marshes are wetlands within which vegetation is rooted in mineral soil, some marshes form shallow peat deposits: these should be considered mires. Swamps are characterized by their forest canopy and, like fens, are typically of higher pH and nutrient availability than bogs. Some bogs and fens can support limited shrub or tree growth on hummocks.

For botanists and ecologists, the term '''peatland''' is a more general term for any terrain dominated by peat to a depth of at least {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}, even if it has been completely drained (i.e., a peatland can be dry, but a mire by definition must be actively forming peat).

Mires, although perhaps at their greatest extent at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, are found around the globe. Mires occur wherever conditions are right for peat accumulation: largely where organic matter is constantly waterlogged. The distribution of mires therefore depends on topography, climate, parent material, biota and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Development of Peat Lands|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|last=Gorham|first=Eville|year=1857|volume=32|issue=2|pages=145–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of mire - bog, fen or swamp - depends also on each of these factors.

In polar regions, mires are usually shallow, because of the slow rate of accumulation of dead organic matter, and often contain permafrost. Very large swathes of Canada, northern Europe and northern Russia are covered by boreal mires. In temperate areas mires are typically more scattered due to historical drainage and peat extraction, but can cover large areas as [[blanket bog]] where precipitation is very high (e.g. in maritime climates inland near the coasts of the north-east and south Pacific, and the north-west and north-east Atlantic). In the sub-tropics, mires are rare and restricted to the wettest areas. In the tropics, mires can again be extensive, typically underlying tropical rainforest (e.g. in Kalimantan).

Mires are in rapid decline globally due to drainage for agriculture and forestry, and for peat harvesting. For example, more than 50% of original European mire area, more than 300000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wise use of mires and peatlands|last1=Joosten|first1=H.|last2=Clarke|first2=D.|year=2002|publisher=International Mire Conservation Group and International Peat Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
Mires have unusual chemistry, which influences ''inter alia'' their biota and the chemistry of the water outflow. Peat has very high [[cation-exchange capacity]] due to its high organic matter content: cations such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are preferentially adsorbed onto the peat in exchange for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Water passing through peat declines in nutrients and in pH. Therefore mires are typically nutrient-poor and acidic unless the inflow of groundwater (bringing in supplementary cations) is high.&lt;ref name=Rydin2006&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biology of Peatlands|year=2006|edition=1st|publisher=Oxford University Press|last1=Rydin|first1=Håkan|last2=Jeglum|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height==
[[File:Ruwenzori_Upper_Bigo_Bog.jpg|thumb|right|A valley mire creates a level ground surface in otherwise dramatic topography. Upper Bigo Bog, [[Rwenzori Mountains]], [[Uganda]].]]
Mires elevate the ground surface above the original topography. Mires can reach considerable heights above the underlying mineral soil or bedrock: peat depths of above 10m have been recorded in temperate regions (many temperate and most boreal mires were removed by ice sheets in the last Ice Age), and above 25m in tropical regions.&lt;ref name=Rydin2006 /&gt; When the absolute decay rate in the ''catotelm'' (the lower, water-saturated zone of a mire) matches the rate of input of new peat into the catotelm, the mire will stop growing in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The limits to peat bog growth|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|last=Clymo|first=R.S.|year=1984|volume=303|pages=605–654|bibcode=1984RSPTB.303..605C|doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simplistic calculation, using typical values for a Sphagnum bog of 1mm new peat added per year and 0.0001 proportion of the catotelm decaying per year, gives a maximum height of 10m. More advanced analyses incorporate expectable nonlinear rates of catotelm decay.

== Carbon storage ==
All types of mires share the common characteristic of being saturated with water at least seasonally with actively forming [[peat]] while having its own set of vegetation and organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.ceu.hu/students/03/nature_conservation/wwddetail/Types_classif.html|title=Wetlands Types and Classifications|website=www.personal.ceu.hu|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Biogeochemical process of carbon===

Mires influence carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere such that when the water table rises, such as during a rainstorm, the peat and its microbes are submerged under water and inhibits the access to oxygen, giving opportunity for anaerobic microorganisms to flourish. Carbon dioxide is released when the water table shrinks, such as during a drought, as this supplies the aerobic microbes with oxygen to decompose the peat, subsequently releasing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Alastair|date=2011-12-20|title=Carbon storage: When peat dries|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1360.pdf|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=22–22|doi=10.1038/nclimate1360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, also varies with the water table position and somewhat with temperature. [[Methanogen|Methanogens]] are responsible for producing methane via decomposition of the peat which consequently increases as the water table rises and oxygen levels are depleted. Increased temperatures in the soil also contributes to increased seasonal methane flux, though at a lower intensity. It is shown that the methane increased by as much as 300% seasonal from increased precipitation and temperature of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turetsky|first=M. R.|last2=Treat|first2=C.

Mires are important reservoirs of climatic information to the past because they are sensitive to changes in the environment and can reveal levels of isotopes, pollutants, macrofossils, metals from the atmosphere, and pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Przewodnik do oznaczania torfów i osadów jeziornych|last=Tobolski|first=K|publisher=PWN|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dating]] can reveal the age of the peat. The dredging and destruction of a mire will release the carbon dioxide that could reveal irreplaceable information about the past climatic conditions.  It is widely known that a plethora of microorganisms inhabit mires due to the regular supply of water and abundance of peat forming vegetation. These microorganisms include but are not limited to methanogens, algae, bacteria, zoobenthos, of which [[Sphagnum]] species are most abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuske|first=E|last2=Silamikele|first2=Inese|last3=Kalnina|first3=Laimdota|last4=Klavins|first4=Maris|date=2010-01-01|title=Peat formation conditions and peat properties: A study of two ombrotrophic bogs in Latvia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285748071_Peat_formation_conditions_and_peat_properties_A_study_of_two_ombrotrophic_bogs_in_Latvia|journal=Mires and Peat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peat in mires contain a substantial amount of organic matter, where [[humic acid]] dominates. Humic materials are able to store very large amounts of water, making them an essential component in the peat environment, contributing to an increased amount of carbon storage due to the resulting anaerobic condition. If the peatland is dried from long-term cultivation and agricultural use, it will lower the water table and the increased aeration will subsequently release carbon content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Environment|first=Szajdak, L., Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan (Poland).

Prematurely exposing the organic matter to the atmosphere promotes the conversion of organics to carbon dioxide to be released in the atmosphere. 
===Impacts on climate change===

[[Wetland|Wetlands]] provide an environment where organic carbon is stored in living plants, dead plants and peat, as well as converted to carbon dioxide and methane. Microbial activity is promoted by the large amounts of dissolved organic matter in wetlands, containing 45-50% carbon. [[Mineralization (geology)|Mineralization]] through bacterial oxidation converts this carbon to inorganic substances, allowing carbon storage to occur. Three main factors giving wetlands the ability to sequester and store carbon are the high biological productivity, high water table and low decomposition rates. Suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions are necessary to provide an abundant water source for the wetland. Fully water-saturated wetland soils allow anaerobic conditions to manifest, storing carbon but releasing methane.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kayranli|first=Birol|last2=Scholz|first2=Miklas|last3=Mustafa|first3=Atif|last4=Hedmark|first4=Åsa|date=2010-02-01|title=Carbon Storage and Fluxes within Freshwater Wetlands: a Critical Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13157-009-0003-4|journal=Wetlands|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=111–124|doi=10.1007/s13157-009-0003-4|issn=0277-5212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands make up about 5-8% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but contain about 20-30% of the planet’s 2500 Pg soil carbon stores.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitsch|first=William J.|last2=Bernal|first2=Blanca|last3=Nahlik|first3=Amanda M.|last4=Mander|first4=Ülo|last5=Zhang|first5=Li|last6=Anderson|first6=Christopher J.|last7=Jørgensen|first7=Sven E.|last8=Brix|first8=Hans|date=2013-04-01|title=Wetlands, carbon, and climate change|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9758-8|journal=Landscape Ecology|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=583–597|doi=10.1007/s10980-012-9758-8|issn=0921-2973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mires, as well as bogs, fens and marshes are the wetland types that contain the highest amounts of soil organic carbon, and can thus be considered peatlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Köchy|first=M.|last2=Hiederer|first2=R.|last3=Freibauer|first3=A.|date=2015-04-16|title=Global distribution of soil organic carbon – Part 1: Masses and frequency distributions of SOC stocks for the tropics, permafrost regions, wetlands, and the world|url=https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-1-351-2015|journal=SOIL|language=English|volume=1|issue=1|pages=351–365|doi=10.5194/soil-1-351-2015|issn=2199-3971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wetlands can become sources of carbon, rather than sinks, as the decomposition occurring within the ecosystem emits methane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Natural peatlands do not have a measurable cooling effect on the climate in a short time span as the cooling effects of sequestering carbon are offset by the emission of methane, which induces warming. Despite this, peatlands do result in cooling of the Earth's climate over a longer time period as methane is oxidized quickly and removed from the atmosphere whereas atmospheric carbon dioxide is continuously absorbed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramsar.org/document/peatlands-climate-change-mitigation-and-biodiversity-conservation|title=Peatlands, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation {{!}} Ramsar|website=www.ramsar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the paper ‘Wetlands, carbon and climate change’ by Mitsch et al., it was determined “that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to [[carbon sequestration]] in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Peatlands insulate the permafrost in subarctic regions, thus delaying thawing during summer, as well as inducing the formation of permafrost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As the global climate continues to warm, wetlands could become major carbon sources as higher temperatures cause higher carbon dioxide emissions. Compared with untilled cropland, wetlands can sequester around two times the carbon, and planted wetlands may be able to store 2-15 times more carbon than what they release. Carbon sequestration can occur in constructed wetlands, as well as natural ones. Estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes from wetlands indicate that natural wetlands have lower fluxes, but man-made wetlands have a greater carbon sequestration capacity. The carbon sequestration abilities of wetlands can be improved through restoration and protection strategies, but it takes several decades for these restored ecosystems to become comparable in carbon storage to peatlands and other forms of natural wetlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Impacts on society, agriculture, and industries===
Tropical peatlands comprise 0.25% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but store 3% of all soil and forest carbon stocks and are mostly located in developing countries. The exploitation of these ecosystems, such as the draining and harvesting of tropical peat forests, releases a large amount of carbon dioxide. In addition, fires caused by dry peat due to the draining of peat bogs releases even more carbon dioxide. The economic value of a tropical peatland used to be derived from raw materials, such as wood, bark, resin, and latex; the extraction of which did not release carbon emissions. Today, many of these ecosystems are drained for conversion to palm oil plantations, releasing the stored carbon dioxide and preventing the system from sequestering carbon again. The planned [https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography? Carbopeat Project] will attempt to assign economic value to the carbon sequestration performed by peat bogs to stop the exploitation of these ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wur.nl/en/show/Carbon-sequestration-in-peat-bogs-as-a-source-of-income.htm|title=Carbon sequestration in peat bogs as a source of income|work=WUR|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Nines Club" describes people who have achieved [[third class honours]] results in each of their three years of a standard length [[Bachelor's degree]] whilst at [[University]].   Bachelor's degree candidates who achieve a result not within the 3rd class bracket (normally 40 to 50%) in any of their three years do not qualify for the "Nines Club".

The term is normally reserved for Bachelor's degree candidates who attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities.

[[Carol Vorderman]], having studied [[Engineering]] at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] and co-presented [[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]] alongside [[Richard Whiteley]], is a noted member of the "Nines Club".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4206">In [[abstract rewriting]], an object is in '''normal form''' if it cannot be rewritten any further. Depending on the rewriting system and the object, several normal forms may exist, or none at all.

==Definition==
Stated formally, if (''A'',→) is an [[Abstract rewriting system#Definition|abstract rewriting system]], some ''x''∈''A'' is in '''normal form''' if no ''y''∈''A'' exists such that ''x''→''y''.

For example, using the term rewriting system with a single rule ''g''(''x'',''y'')→''x'', the term ''g''(''g''(4,2),''g''(3,1)) can be rewritten as follows, applying the rule to the outermost occurrence &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Each occurrence of ''g'' where the rule is applied is highlighted in '''boldface'''.&lt;/ref&gt; of ''g'':
:'''''g'''''(''g''(4,2),''g''(3,1)) → '''''g'''''(4,2) → 4.
Since no rule applies to the last term, 4, it cannot be rewritten any further, and hence is a normal form of the term ''g''(''g''(4,2),''g''(3,1)) with respect to this term rewriting system.

==Normalization properties==
Related concepts refer to the possibility of rewriting an element into normal form. 
An object of an abstract rewrite system is said to be '''weakly normalizing''' if it can be rewritten ''somehow'' into a normal form, that is, if ''some'' rewrite sequence starting from it cannot be extended any further.
An object is said to be '''strongly normalizing''' if it can be rewritten ''in any way'' into a normal form, that is, if ''every'' rewrite sequence starting from it eventually cannot be extended any further.
An abstract rewrite system is said to be '''weakly''' and '''strongly normalizing''', or to have the '''weak''' and the '''strong normalization''' property, if each of its objects is weakly and strongly normalizing, respectively.

For example, the above single-rule system is strongly normalizing, since each rule application properly decreases term size and hence there cannot be an infinite rewrite sequence starting from any term.
In contrast, the two-rule system { ''g''(''x'',''y'')→''x'', ''g''(''x'',''x'')→''g''(3,''x'') } is weakly, 
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Since every term containing ''g'' can be rewritten by a finite number of applications of the first rule to a term without any ''g'', which is in normal form.&lt;/ref&gt;
but not strongly 
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Since to the term ''g''(3,3), the second rule can be applied over and over again, without reaching any normal form.&lt;/ref&gt; normalizing, although each term not containing ''g''(3,3) is strongly normalizing. 
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a given term, let ''m'' and ''n'' denote the total number of ''g'' and of ''g'' applied to identical arguments, respectively. Application of any rule properly decreases the value of ''m''+''n'', which is possible only finitely many times.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''g''(4,4) has two normal forms in this system, viz. ''g''(4,4) → 4 and ''g''(4,4) → ''g''(3,4) → 3, hence the system is not [[confluence (term rewriting)#General case and theory|confluent]].

Another example: The single-rule system { ''r''(''x'',''y'')→''r''(''y'',''x'') } has no normalizing properties (not weakly or strongly), since from any term, e.g. ''r''(4,2) a single rewrite sequence starts, viz. ''r''(4,2)→''r''(2,4)→''r''(4,2)→''r''(2,4)→..., which is infinitely long.

==Normalization and confluency==
[[Newman's lemma]] states that if an [[abstract rewriting system]] ''A'' is strongly normalizing and is [[confluence (term rewriting)#Local confluence|weakly confluent]], then ''A'' is  [[confluence (term rewriting)#General case and theory|confluent]].

The result enables to further generalize the [[critical pair lemma]].{{clarify|reason=Explicitly state and justify the thus generalized lemma, or omit this sentence.|date=June 2013}}

'''Nzadi''' is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], "from Kwamuntu to [[Ilebo]] along the north side of the [[Kasai River]] in [[Bandundu Province]]." The number of speakers of Nzadi is not known, but is estimated to be in the thousands. The Nzadi language has three dialects, ''Ngiemba, Lensibun,'' and ''Ndzé Ntaa''.&lt;ref name=Crane&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Thera|title=A grammar of Nzadi [B865] : a Bantu language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9780520098862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Nzadi contains seven contrastive vowels, which can be either long or short. The table below shows all the vowel phonemes found in the language:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|         || ''front'' || ''central'' || ''back''
|-
| ''high'' || i  ii ||  || u uu
|-
| ''high-mid'' || e ee || || o oo
|-
| ''low-mid'' || ɛ ɛɛ || || ɔ ɔɔ
|-
| ''low'' || || a aa ||
|}

=== Consonants ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| || labial || alveolar || palatal || velar || labiovelar
|-
| stops || p b || t d || || k (g) || kp (gb)
|-
| affricates || (pf) bv || ts dz || || ||
|-
| fricatives || f v || s z || || || 
|-
| nasals || m || n || || || 
|-
| liquids || || l (r) || || || 
|-
| glides || || || y || || w
|}

=== Syllable Structure ===
Unlike other Bantu languages, which favor polysyllablic word stems, Nzadi consists primarily of monosyllabic stems. Bisyllabic stems are also present, but they are primarily borrowings or reduplications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyman|first=Larry|title=Post-Verbal subject in the Nzadi relative clause|journal=Journal of African Languages and Linguistics|date=June 2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=97–117|doi=10.1515/jall-2012-0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
: Examples
:* ''màáŋgǔl'' 'mango'
:* ''pɔtpɔ̂t'' 'mud'
:* ''kamyɔ̂'' 'car' (from French ''camion'' 'truck')
All stems necessarily begin with a consonant, and monosyllabic stems take four possible structures: CV, CVC, CVV, or CVVC. In the case of bisyllabic stems, both syllables begin with a consonant, and long vowels never occur in the first syllable, and rarely in the second.

=== Phonological Rules ===
As a result of the systematic shortening of word stems, Nzadi words tend to have more vowel clusters than other Bantu languages, and in many cases adjusts one or more of the adjacent vowels by the following processes.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;

==== Vowel Coalescence ====
When two different vowels occur in succession, one of three things can happen, depending on several factors:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! ''Coalescence Process'' !!  !! ''Occurs When''
|-

|}&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;

==== Vowel Shortening ====
In cases in which coalescence does not occur, a long vowel followed immediately by another vowel will shorten.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;
: Examples:
:: ''ibaa'' + ''ikwɔ'' = ''iba ikwɔ''
::: ''esúú na o dzé iba ikwɔ''
:::: 'the day that the man ate the banana'
:: ''ibaa'' + ''esaa'' = ''iba esaa''
::: ''esúú na o dzé iba esaa''
:::: 'the day that the man ate the food'

==== Vowel Harmony ====
Due to the historical word shortening from Proto-Bantu, Nzadi does not have the stem-level vowel harmony that many other Bantu languages do. However, one kind of harmony does present itself: /e-/ or /o-/ noun prefixes will harmonize to ɛ- or ɔ- if the stem has an identical /ɛ/ or /ɔ/ vowel.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;

== Tone ==
Nzadi, like other Bantu languages, has two contrastive tone leves, high (H) and low (L), which can combine to form falling (HL), rising (LH), and rising-falling (LHL) contour tones.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''H:'' || ''nwí'' || 'bee' || ''máán'' || 'wine'
|-
| ''L:'' || ''bwɔ'' || 'mushroom' || ''bvuur'' || 'load'
|-
| ''HL:'' || ''kît'' || 'chair' || ''wáàr'' || 'dress!'
|-
| ''LH:'' || ''bvǐm'' || 'theft' || ''tàá'' || 'father'
|-
| ''LHL:'' || ''dzǐˋ'' || 'eye' || ''mǎàn'' || 'ground'
|}

Tone in Nzadi conveys important lexical and grammatical information, and can be the only difference between different words and forms, as seen in the minimal quintuplet here:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''H:'' || ''ŋkún'' ||'that very one'
|-
| ''L:'' || ''okun'' || 'to bury, plant'
|-
| ''HL:'' || ''ekûn'' || 'firewood'
|-
| ''LH:'' || ''ikǔn'' || 'trunk'
|-
| ''LHL:'' || ''kǔˋn'' || 'bury! plant!"
|}&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;

=== General Tone Rules ===

==== Tone Absorption ====
When a contour tone is followed by another tone that begins with the same tone level as the end of the first, the first tone is simplified by dropping the final tone level. For example, a HL contour followed by a L tone will be simplified to H.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;
: Examples:
:: /mbéè/ 'friend'
:::''mbéé mǐˋ'' 'my friend'
:::''mbéé tàá'' 'the father's friend'

==== Contour Simplification ====
Contour simplification is similar to tone absorption, but occurs when adjacent tone levels are different, as seen in the following possessive constructions:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| /mbwɔ̌m okáàr/|| ''mbwɔm okáàr'' 'the woman's nose'
|-
| /mbǔn mbéè/ || ''mbun mbéè'' 'the friend's forehead'
|-
| /ikɔ̌ŋ é ibaa/ || ''ikɔŋ ibáà'' 'the man's spear'
|-
| /ikɔ̌ŋ é mùùr/ || ''ikɔŋ e múùr'' 'the person's spear'
|}&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;

=== Intonation ===
Despite the functional load of tone in Nzadi, intonation can interact or interfere with lexical tones, particularly when a pause in the utterance is taken. In this case, a H boundary tone is inserted.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt;
:Example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''L-L'' || ''mbum'' 'fruit' || ''mbǔm, mi ó pé mwǎàn'' 'a fruit I gave the child'
|-
| ''L-LH'' || ''mbǔm'' 'maggot' || ''mbǔm, mi ó pé mwǎàn'' 'a maggot I gave the child'
|-
| ''L-HL'' || ''mpúù'' 'rat' || ''mpúù, mi ó pé mwǎàn'' 'a rat I gave the child'
|-
| ''L-H'' || ''epúú'' 'cloth' || ''epúú, mi ó pé mwǎàn'' 'a cloth I gave the child'
|}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and introduction to poetry:

'''[[Poetry]]''' &amp;ndash; a form of [[art]] in which [[language]] is used for its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] qualities, in addition to, or instead of, its apparent [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is poetry?==
Poetry can be described as all of the following things:

* One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, poetry is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Poetry is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. 
** A form of [[literature]] &amp;ndash; literature is composition, that is, written or oral work such as books, stories, and poems.
** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.

== Types of poetry ==

=== Common poetic forms ===

* [[Epic poetry|Epic]] &amp;ndash; lengthy narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation. Milman Parry and Albert Lord have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. 
* [[Sonnet]] &amp;ndash; poetic form which originated in Italy; Giacomo Da Lentini is credited with its invention. 
* [[Shi (poetry)#Jintishi|Jintishi]] &amp;ndash; literally "Modern Poetry", was actually composed from the 5th century onwards and is considered to have been fully developed by the early Tang dynasty. The works were principally written in five- and seven-character lines and involve constrained tone patterns, intended to balance the four tones of Middle Chinese within each couplet.
* [[Villanelle]] &amp;ndash; nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a [[fixed verse form]].
* [[Waka (poetry)#Tanka|Tanka]] &amp;ndash; a classical Japanese poem, composed in Japanese (rather than Chinese, as with [[kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]])
* [[Ode]] &amp;ndash; a poem written in praise of a person (e.g. [[Ode to Psyche|Psyche]]), thing (e.g. a [[Ode on a Grecian Urn|Grecian urn]]), or event
* [[Ghazal]] &amp;ndash; an Arabic poetic form with rhyming couplets and a refrain, each line in the same meter
* [[Haiku]] &amp;ndash; a poem, normally in Japanese but also in other languages (particularly English), normally with 17 syllables arranged as 5 + 7 + 5

=== Periods, styles and movements ===

== History of poetry ==

[[History of poetry]] &amp;ndash; the earliest poetry is believed to have been recited or sung, such as in the form of hymns (such as the work of Sumerian priestess Enheduanna), and employed as a way of remembering oral history, genealogy, and law. Many of the poems surviving from the ancient world are recorded prayers, or stories about religious subject matter, but they also include historical accounts, instructions for everyday activities, love songs, and fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15333">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''pattern language''' is a [[formal language]] that can be defined as the set of all particular instances of a [[string (formal languages)|string]] of constants and variables. Pattern Languages were introduced by [[Dana Angluin]] in the context of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dana Angluin| title=Finding Patterns Common to a Set of Strings| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1980| volume=21| pages=46–62| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000080900410/pdf?md5=c3534f6c086df22fbf814b12984fab5e&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0022000080900410-main.pdf| doi=10.1016/0022-0000(80)90041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Given a finite set Σ of '''[[Term (logic)#Formal definition|constant]]''' symbols and a countable set ''X'' of '''[[Term (logic)#Formal definition|variable]]''' symbols disjoint from Σ, a '''pattern''' is a finite [[empty string|non-empty]] [[String (computer science)|string]] of symbols from Σ∪''X''.
The '''length''' of a pattern ''p'', denoted by |''p''|, is just the number of its symbols.
The set of all patterns containing exactly ''n'' distinct variables (each of which may occur several times) is denoted by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the set of all patterns at all by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;.
A '''substitution''' is a mapping ''f'': ''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; → ''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; such that&lt;ref group=note&gt;Angluin's notion of substitution differs from the usual notion of [[string substitution]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''f'' is a [[monoid homomorphism|homomorphism]] with respect to [[String_(computer_science)#Concatenation_and_substrings|string concatenation]] (⋅), formally: ∀''p'',''q''∈''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;. ''f''(''p''⋅''q'') = ''f''(''p'')⋅''f''(''q'');
* ''f'' is non-erasing, formally: ∀''p''∈''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;. ''f''(''p'') ≠ ε, where ε denotes the [[empty string]]; and
* ''f'' respects constants, formally: ∀''s''∈Σ. ''f''(''s'') = ''s''.
If ''p'' = ''f''(''q'') for some patterns ''p'', ''q'' ∈ ''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; and some substitution ''f'', then ''p'' is said to be '''less general than''' ''q'', written ''p''≤''q'';
in that case, necessarily |''p''| ≥ |''q''| holds.
For a pattern ''p'', its '''language''' is defined as the set of all less general patterns that are built from constants only, formally: ''L''(''p'') = { ''s'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; : ''s'' ≤ ''p'' }, where [[Kleene plus|Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] denotes the set of all finite non-empty strings of symbols from Σ.

For example, using the constants Σ = { 0, 1 } and the variables ''X'' = { ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ... }, the pattern 0''x''10''xx''1 ∈''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''xxy'' ∈''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has length 7 and 3, respectively.
An instance of the former pattern is 00''z''100''z''0''z''1 and 01''z''101''z''1''z''1, it is obtained by the substitution that maps ''x'' to 0''z'' and to 1''z'', respectively, and each other symbol to itself. Both 00''z''100''z''0''z''1 and 01''z''101''z''1''z''1 are also instances of ''xxy''. In fact, ''L''(0''x''10''xx''1) is a subset of ''L''(''xxy''). The language of the pattern ''x''0 and ''x''1 is the set of all bit strings which denote an even and odd [[binary number]], respectively. The language of ''xx'' is the set of all strings obtainable by concatenating a bit string with itself, e.g. 00, 11, 0101, 1010, 11101110 ∈ ''L''(''xx'').

| [[File:NP-hardness of pattern language membership svg.svg|thumb|600px|NP-hardness of pattern language membership, by [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from the [[NP-complete]] [[Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Exactly-1_3-satisfiability|1-in-3-SAT problem]]: Given a [[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]] of ''m'' clauses with ''n'' variables, a pattern of length 3''n''+4''m''+1 with 2''n'' variables and a string of length ''4''n+5''m''+1 can be constructed as shown (''m''=3 and ''n''=4 in the example). Upper-case variables in the pattern correspond to negated variables in the CNF.  The string matches the pattern if and only if an assignment exists such that in each clause exactly one literal is 1 (meaning "''true''" in the CNF). In the left part, e.g. "0''wW''0" is matched by "01110" just if one of ''w'',''W'' is matched by "1" (corresponding to "''false''") and the other by "11" (corresponding to "''true''"), i.e. if ''w'' corresponds to the negation of ''W''. In the right part, e.g. "0''xYZ''0" is matched by "011110" just if exactly one of ''x'',''Y'',''Z'' is matched by "11" and the others by "1", i.e. if exactly one literal corresponds to "''true''".]]

The problem of deciding whether ''s'' ∈ ''L''(''p'') for an arbitrary string ''s'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and pattern ''p'' is [[NP-complete]] (see picture),
and so is hence the problem of deciding ''p'' ≤ ''q'' for arbitrary patterns ''p'', ''q''.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 3.6, p.50; Corollary 3.7, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

The class of pattern languages is '''not closed''' under ...
* union: e.g. for Σ = {0,1} as [[#Definition|above]], ''L''(01)∪''L''(10) is not a pattern language;
* complement: Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; \ ''L''(0) is not a pattern language;
* intersection: ''L''(''x''0''y'')∩''L''(''x''1''y'') is not a pattern language;
* [[Kleene plus]]: ''L''(0)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is not a pattern language;
* homomorphism: ''f''(''L''(''x'')) = ''L''(0)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is not a pattern language, assuming ''f''(0) = 0 = ''f''(1);
* [[String_operations#String_homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]]: ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(111) = { 01, 10, 000 } is not a pattern language, assuming ''f''(0) = 1 and ''f''(1) = 11.
The class of pattern languages is '''closed''' under ...
* concatenation: ''L''(''p'')⋅''L''(''q'') = ''L''(''p''⋅''q'');
* reversal: ''L''(''p'')&lt;sup&gt;rev&lt;/sup&gt; = ''L''(''p''&lt;sup&gt;rev&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 3.10, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''p'', ''q'' ∈ ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are patterns containing exactly one variable, then ''p'' ≤ ''q'' if and only if ''L''(''p'') ⊆ ''L''(''q'');
the same equivalence holds for patterns of equal length.&lt;ref&gt;Lemma 3.9, p.52; Corollary 3.4, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
For patterns of different length, the [[#Definition|above]] example ''p'' = 0''x''10''xx''1 and ''q'' = ''xxy'' shows that ''L''(''p'') ⊆ ''L''(''q'') may hold without implying ''p'' ≤ ''q''.
However, any two patterns ''p'' and ''q'', of arbitrary lengths, generate the same language if and only if they are equal up to consistent variable renaming.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 3.5, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
Each pattern ''p'' is a [[Anti-unification_(computer_science)#Anti-unification_problem.2C_generalization_set|common generalization]] of all strings in its generated language ''L''(''p''), modulo associativity of (⋅).

==Location in the Chomsky hierarchy==
In a refined [[Chomsky hierarchy]], the class of pattern languages is a proper superclass and subclass of the singleton&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. languages consisting of a single string; they correspond to [[straight-line grammar]]s&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[indexed language]]s, respectively, but incomparable to the language classes in between; due to the latter, the pattern language class is not explicitly shown in the table [[#References|below]].

The class of pattern languages is incomparable with the class of [[finite language]]s, with the class of [[regular language]]s, and with the class of [[context-free language]]s:
* the pattern language ''L''(''xx'') is not context-free (hence neither [[Regular language#Deciding whether a language is regular|regular]] nor [[Regular language#Formal definition|finite]]) due to the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]];
* the finite (hence also regular and context-free) language { 01, 10 } is not a pattern language.
Each singleton language is trivially a pattern language, generated by a pattern without variables.

Each pattern language can be produced by an [[indexed grammar]]:
For example, using Σ = { ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' } and ''X'' = { '''''x''''', '''''y''''' },
the pattern ''a'' '''''x''''' ''b'' '''''y''''' ''c'' '''''x''''' ''a'' '''''y''''' ''b'' is generated by a grammar with nonterminal symbols ''N'' = { ''S''&lt;sub&gt;'''''x'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;'''''y'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S'' } ∪ ''X'', terminal symbols ''T'' = Σ, index symbols ''F'' = { ''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''''x'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;'''''x'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;'''''x'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''''y'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;'''''y'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;'''''y'''''&lt;/sub&gt; }, start symbol ''S''&lt;sub&gt;'''''x'''''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the following production rules:

In a similar way, an index grammar can be constructed from any pattern.

== Learning patterns ==
Given a sample set ''S'' of strings, a pattern ''p'' is called '''descriptive''' of ''S'' if ''S'' ⊆ ''L''(''p''), but not ''S'' ⊆ ''L''(''q'') ⊂ ''L''(''p'') for any other pattern ''q''.

Given any sample set ''S'', a descriptive pattern for ''S'' can be computed by 
* enumerating all patterns (up to variable renaming) not longer than the shortest string in ''S'',
* selecting from them the patterns that generate a superset of ''S'',
* selecting from them the patterns of maximal length, and 
* selecting from them a pattern that is minimal with respect to ≤.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 4.1, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on this algorithm, the class of pattern languages can be [[Language identification in the limit|identified in the limit]] from positive examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dana Angluin| title=Inductive Inference of Formal Languages from Positive Data| journal=Information and Control| year=1980| volume=45| pages=117-135| url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yinw/papers/Angluin80.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(80)90285-5}}; here: Example 1, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pauwasi languages''' are a likely [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]], mostly in Indonesia. The best described Pauwasi language is [[Karkar language|Karkar]], across the border in Papua New Guinea.

The Pauwasi family is not accepted by [[Søren Wichmann]] (2013), who splits it into separate ''Western'' and ''Eastern'' groups.&lt;ref name="Wichmann2013"&gt;Wichmann, Søren. 2013. [http://www.langlxmelanesia.com/wichmann313-386.pdf A classification of Papuan languages]. In: Hammarström, Harald and Wilco van den Heuvel (eds.), History, contact and classification of Papuan languages (Language and Linguistics in Melanesia, Special Issue 2012), 313-386. Port Moresby: Linguistic Society of Papua New Guinea.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
===narrow Pauwasi===
* '''Pauwasi''' family
** Eastern Pauwasi branch: [[Yafi language|Yafi]] (Zorop), [[Emumu language|Emumu]] (Emem)–[[Karkar language|Karkar]]
** Western Pauwasi branch?
***[[Dubu language|Dubu]] (Tebi)
***[[Towei language|Towei]]

The languages are not close: though the Eastern languages are clearly related, Yafi and Emumu are only 25% lexically similar.

Karkar-Yuri, long thought to be an isolate in Papua New Guinea, is clearly related and may actually form a dialect continuum with Emumu in Indonesia. On the other hand, the Western languages are so poorly attested that it is not certain that they are part of the Pauwasi family (or even related to each other), or if the common words are loans and they constitute a separate family or families, though a family connection appears likely.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Hammarström, 2010. [http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4478/hammarstrom.pdf;jsessionid=D9DEE77FAF311FE8E0400B767591E8C7?sequence=1 The status of the least documented language families in the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 1sg, 2sg, and 1pl pronouns are attested for any Indonesian language, and the proto-language cannot be reconstructed. Attested forms are:

{|
| ||'''1sg'''||'''2sg'''||'''1pl'''
|-
!Dubu
|no||fo||numu
|-
!Towei
|oŋgo||ŋgo||nu
|-
!Yafi
|nam||nəm||nin
|-
!Emumu
|&amp;nbsp;?||mo||nin
|-
!Karkar
|on-o||am-o||ex. yin-o, in. nám-o
|}

Yafi and Emumu are similar, and Dubu and Towei may share 1pl *numu, but there is not apparent connection between them.  Dubu ''no'' and Yafi ''nam'' might reflect pTNG *na, and Towei ''ngo'' pTNG *ga (*nga), and the plural pTNG *nu and *ni.

===broad Pauwasi===
Timothy Usher expanded the family with several previously unclassified languages. The inclusion of Molof is especially tentative (as of 2017).&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/pauwasi-river NewGuineaWorld Pauwasi River]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[Stephen Wurm]] (1975) classified the Indonesian languages as a branch of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] (TNG) phylum, a position which [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005) tentatively retained. Ross's TNG classification is based on [[personal pronouns]]. Since no pronouns could be reconstructed from the available data on the poorly attested Indonesian Pauwasi languages, which were all that were recognized as Pauwasi at the time, only a tentative assessment could be made, based on a few lexical items.  Some of the pronouns of Dubu and Yafi look like they might be TNG.  However, Ross counted Karkar, for which the pronouns were known, as an isolate because its pronouns did not pattern as TNG. At this stage its relationship to Emumu was unknown.

== Origins ==
The concept of poverty porn was first introduced in the 1980s, a golden age for charity campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Charity campaigns during this period made use of hard-hitting images such as pictures of malnourished children with flies in their eyes. This quickly became a trend and there were several notable campaigns such as Live Aid. Though some of these campaigns were successful in raising money for charity (over $150 million to help combat famine), some observers criticised the approach, claiming it oversimplified [[Chronic Poverty Research Centre|chronic poverty]]; this apparent sensationalism was dubbed by critics as "poverty porn."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Controversial poverty advertisements are making a comeback|url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865639266/Controversial-poverty-advertisements-are-making-a-comeback.html|website = DeseretNews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s the media used what some believed to be inappropriate use of children in poverty. However, towards the end of this era more positive images emerged to tell their stories, although, in recent years it has been noticed that the disturbing images are being highlighted once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = At What Point Does A Fundraising Ad Go Too Far?|url = https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/30/439162849/at-what-point-does-a-fundraising-ad-go-too-far|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In charity ==
The practice is controversial, as some believe it to be exploitative, whilst others praise the way it can allow organisations to reach their objectives. It has been common for charity organisations such as [[UNICEF]] and [[Oxfam]] to portray famine, poverty, and children in order to attract sympathy and increase donations.
[[File:Extreme-poverty-and-hunger.jpg|thumb|Stereotypical charity campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Report: Up To 200,000 Somali Children Could Die From Malnutrition|url = https://publichealthwatch.wordpress.com/2014/06/02/report-up-to-200000-somali-children-could-die-from-malnutrition/|website = publichealthwatch|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although poverty porn can be seen as a tool to generate further donations, many believe it deforms reality as it portrays the image of an impotent society, entirely dependent on other western societies to survive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is 'poverty porn' and why does it matter for development?|url = http://aidthoughts.org/?p=69|website = Aid Thoughts|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being overly voyeuristic.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

It is a common debate to have as to whether it is justifiable or not to portray stereotypes and to use sensationalism in order to generate empathy. [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]], a [[Nigerian people|Nigerian]] writer, notes that "The problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story."&lt;ref name="Meikle"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poverty porn: is sensationalism justified if it helps those in need?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/05/poverty-porn-development-reporting-fistula|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Glendora|last = Meikle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout fundraising campaigns, charities attempt to interview those who they are trying to help, in order to get the word across to the general public. However, it is common for them to encounter ongoing refusal from those in desolated situations to take pictures or to publicly share their traumatic story. This further emphasises the concept that being in an uneasy, not to say miserable, situation is a shameful one, and poverty porn in media exposes those who do not necessarily have the desire to be exposed.&lt;ref name="canberratimes.com.au"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poverty porn: look at these vulnerable people|url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/are-pictures-of-the-vulnerable-poverty-porn-20151003-gk0qv6.html|website = Canberra Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In media ==
Poverty porn is used in media through visually miserable images, in order to trigger some sort of emotion amongst its audience. It is commonly thought however, that to expose one's misery publicly through images, interviews and other means, is an impermissible invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name="canberratimes.com.au"/&gt;

The use of one photo to label an entire country as destitute makes the audience falsely assume that the entire country share the same story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Africans are fighting media poverty-porn by tweeting beautiful images of their real lives|url = http://www.theplaidzebra.com/africans-are-fighting-media-poverty-porn-by-tweeting-beautiful-images-of-their-real-lives/|website = The Plaid Zebra|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alli Heller, a Nigerian writer and anthropologist says: "Imagine for a minute that you were chronically incontinent. Now imagine that you didn't have access to adult diapers or sanitary napkins ... Imagine how the acidity of the unremitting flow of urine burned away at your thighs, cracking your skin and leaving you vulnerable to painful infections. Imagine the shame you'd feel – a grown adult incapable of avoiding the small pool of urine you'd leave behind on a friend's chair after a visit ... Why must we highlight the extreme cases when the norm is bad enough?"&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;

== In pop-culture ==
Poverty porn is highly exposed in today's pop culture, as the concept has become pervasive in films and TV shows.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = It's a bit rich moaning about poverty porn {{!}} Rachel Cooke|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/31/poverty-porn-britains-hardest-grafter-bbc|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reality TV ===
The British television programme ''The Hardest Grafter'' illustrates this as it portrays 25 of Britain's "poorest workers", all having the shared ultimate objective of winning £15,000 through the completion of various tasks. In this case, the contestants' poverty attracts a television audience which was, before the show even started, contested as various petitions were made in order to stop what was believed to be a "perverted audience and profit making operation". It is considered to not only be perverted, but also discriminatory as the contestants can only be poor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[BBC Two]] replied to these accusations by affirming that it would be a "serious social experiment to show just how hard those part of the low-wage economy work" as well as "tackling some of the most pressing issues of our time: why is British productivity low?"{{Cite quote|date=December 2015}}

A spokesman from the show's production company, Twenty Twenty, stated that: "the show will challenge and shatter all sorts of myths surrounding the low-paid and unemployed sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC's new 'poverty porn' TV series has everyone raging|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/britains-hardest-grafter-petition-set-up-as-twitter-reacts-to-bbc-poverty-porn-series-pitting-low-10281663.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broome, a reality TV show creator, states that it exposes the hardship of some families and their ability to keep on going through values, love and communication. He assures that he would much prefer create these shows rather than those like Jersey Shore which depicts "a group of strangers from New Jersey as they party throughout six seasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Poverty porn' reality TV: Does it have the capacity to do good?|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/poverty-porn-reality-tv-does-it-have-the-capacity-to-do-good-1.3118791|website = www.cbc.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ring der o.jpg|right|thumb|The Ring of O in its current most common shape.]]

The '''Ring of O''' is a specially designed [[Ring (finger)|ring]] which has been worn as a distinctive mark among [[BDSM]] practitioners, mainly in [[continental Europe]] — and especially the [[German language|German-speaking]] countries — since the 1990s. Its use is relatively widespread within this subculture. Its name derives from the name of the central female character in the classic BDSM novel ''[[Story of O]]'' (written by [[Pauline Réage]]), who was a [[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sex slave]] and wore an analogous ring.

== Description in literature ==
[[Image:Roissy triskelion iron ring signet.svg|right|thumb|Simplified depiction of the [[Triskelion]] ring as described in the original book.]]

The ring mentioned in the original novel was quite different from what is most commonly known as the "Ring of O" today.  The novel describes the ring as shaped similarly to a [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] (with a seal disk on top which was relatively large for a woman's ring), made out of dull-gray polished iron, lined with gold on the inside, and with a golden [[Triskelion]] on its top area.

The ring's symbolic meaning in the novel differs quite a bit from the one commonly used among BDSM practitioners today. In the book, such a ring is worn by a female "slave" after she has finished her training at Roissy.  Those wearing the ring are obliged to be obedient to any man who belongs to the secret society of Roissy (whose emblem is the triskelion), and must allow him to do absolutely everything with them that he pleases.

This stands in strong contrast to the ring's meaning today. People indicate by wearing such rings that they are interested in BDSM, and sometimes by the hand they wear it on whether they are a [[Top (BDSM)|Top]] or a [[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]].

== Modern shapes ==
[[Image:Bikini Model Jassi.jpg|right|thumb|Female model posed as a Bottom wearing a collar in the design of the Ring of O.]]
The first [[film adaptation]] of the novel ''Story of O'' showed a design consisting of a cylindrical steel ring with an attached ball holding an even smaller toroidal ring (which could swivel in one direction). This alluded to the leather collar and bracelets, each with a metal ring, that had been locked onto O during her training.

The first image of this jewellery design was published in the September issue (No.4) of the German BDSM magazine ''Schlagzeilen'' in 1989.

== As a collar ==
The term ''O Ring'' is sometimes used to refer to collars as well (contrasting with ''[[D-ring]]'' collars). In this context it can describe a collar with one large ring for fastening. Collars featuring such rings are often worn by [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]] to indicate that they are in a steady relationship.

'''Pertti Olavi "Spede" Pasanen''' (10 April 1930 &amp;ndash; 7 September 2001) was a Finnish film director and producer, comedian, humorist, inventor, TV personality and practitioner of gags.

During his career he directed, wrote, produced or acted in about 50 [[film|movie]]s and participated in numerous TV productions, including the comedy ''Spede Show'' and the game-show ''Speden Spelit''. Much of his more commercial work was in collaboration with [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] (whose most popular character created by Pasanen was [[Uuno Turhapuro]]; first in TV sketches and then in a long-lasting series of motion pictures) and [[Simo Salminen]]. Pasanen's films and TV shows, often made fast and inexpensively in a conveyor-belt mode, usually didn't gain much recognition from the [[critics]] but were extremely popular among Finnish audiences from the 1960s onwards.

He was the owner of his own film production company, Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen Ky. He is noted as the main influence of many who make an attempt to break into the Finnish comedy scene. Spede also had a long, strained relationship with [[Suomen elokuvasäätiö]], a government-financed film-funding organisation which continuously refused to fund his movies.

==Radio career==
[[File:Pasanen-Haarla-Alpola-1960.jpg|thumb|right|Pertti Pasanen (left) with Aune Haarla and Antero Alpola at Yleisradio’s entertainment division in 1960.]]
During the late 1950s and early 1960s Spede was a noted presence as a radio comedian. He applied to work at [[Yleisradio]] twice in 1956 and again in 1959 as an entertainment provider (ajanvietetoimittaja) and was hired on his second try. Spede's most popular program was ''Ruljanssiriihi'' which combined sketch-comedy and musical performances. The program eventually developed into the program ''Hupiklubi''. Spede and actor [[Leo Jokela]] also created the break-out character [[G. Pula-Aho]] (voiced by Jokela), a smart-talking, Helsinki slang using parrot who would insult Spede on Ruljanssiriihi.

Spede's other programs included ''Tervahöyry Hyrskynmyrskyn suvisilla laineilla'', ''Hyvää iltaa – tulkaa mukaan'' and ''Kesäterässä''.

==Film career==
After playing several supporting roles throughout the 1950s Spede made his first starring appearance in 1964's [[X-Paroni]] which he wrote and co-directed with his on-screen co-star [[Jaakko Pakkasvirta]]. The movie's success led to the creation of [[Milli Pilleri]] which also introduced moviegoers to [[Simo Salminen]] who became a fixture of Spede's acting troupe, often playing the side-kick to Spede's own characters. It was also the first movie Spede co-directed with [[Jukka Virtanen (director)|Jukka Virtanen]] and [[Ere Kokkonen]] who would alternate directing Spede's future motion pictures, while Spede focused more on writing and producing. 

1967's period-comedy [[Noin Seitsemän Veljestä]] was a parody of [[Robin Hood]] which Spede had worked on since the 1950s and introduced [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] as an adult actor (having made his on-screen debut years earlier as a child actor in [[Pojat (film)|Pojat]]). The success of these movies led to Spede producing and releasing three movies in 1969, [[Näköradiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut]], [[Leikkikalugangsteri]] as well as his first colour feature [[Pohjan Tähteet]]. Näköradiomies performed well despite being a more serious movie but it and Pohjan Tähteet underperformed in comparison to the more typically comical Leikkikalugangsteri. Despite Pohjantähteet winning a shared [[Jussi Award]] for Kari Sohlberg in the category of best cinematography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IMDB - Jussi Awards 1970 | url= https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000380/1970 | publisher = Internet Movie Database| date = 2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with Spede's own Leikkikalugangsteri and [[Jörn Donner]]'s Sixtynine 69), Pasanen did not produce another colour feature until the late 1970s.

Spede continued to experience success with [[Speedy Gonzales – noin 7 veljeksen poika]]  and the tragic comedy [[Jussi Pussi]] both released in 1970. Speedy Gonzales performed well, despite Vesa-Matti Loiri being absent due to a leg injury just prior to shooting (he instead received a writing credit). Spede had to finance most of his films during this period due to his poor relations with the Finnish Film Foundation.

In 1971, Spede released three motion-pictures, [[Kahdekses Veljes]] (his debut as a solo director) and [[Hirttämättömät]] (the sequel to Speedy Gonzales) both starring himself as well as [[Saatanan Radikaalit]], which was co-directed by its four starring actors Paavo Piironen, Heikki Nousiainen, Timo Nissi and Heikki Huopainen. Spede only produced this movie which was intended to give its four stars a chance to complete a motion-picture on their own. All three movies under-performed though which led to Spede taking a two-year hiatus from film-making during which he focused exclusively on his TV work. Regardless, Spede won the 1971 Producers' Jussi Award for all three movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IMDB - Jussi Awards 1971 | url= https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000380/1971 | publisher = Internet Movie Database| date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Spede released the first [[Uuno Turhapuro]] movie based on the popular skit-character by the same name. To save costs, Spede filmed and edited the movie entirely on video and had it transferred to film for theatrical distribution. Uuno became a hit and a further four Uuno films were finished during the 1970s. Spede resumed filming small budget comedies with 1974's [[Viu-Hah-Hah-Taja]], directed by [[Ere Kokkonen]] and mostly starring Spede's TV actors. Spede only appeared in a cameo and went uncredited as the film's writer. In 1979, he released [[Koeputkiaikuinen ja Simon enkelit]], his first colour feature since Pohjantähteet. The movie was a surprise hit and led to a sequel [[Tup Akka Lakko]] being released the following year.

In the 1980s, the Uuno series peaked in popularity with 1984's [[Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leivissä]] breaking the record of the most popular Finnish domestic film. Spede cranked out movies on an annual basis, using his stock actors and frequently utilizing the popular skit characters for movies such as [[Kliffaa Hei]], [[Pikkupojat]], [[Fakta Homma (film)|Fakta Homma]] and [[Onks Viljoo Näkyny]]. The last of these skit-comedy films is considered to be 1990's [[Rampe &amp; Naukkis - Kaikkien aikojen superpari]], which was lampooned on the popular characters created by [[Pirkka-Pekka Petelius]] and [[Aake Kalliala]] for the TV show [[Pulttibois]].

During the 1990s, Spede focused almost exclusively on producing rather than writing or directing films with TV work taking more and more of his time.

==TV career==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2017}}
Starting from 1964, Spede began making live 15-minute sketch programming for [[Yleisradio]]. The show which alternated between the titles Spedevisio, Speden Saluuna as well as Spede Show established many of the tropes and core actors whom Spede would use in his films. Most of the early skit work is now lost due to live broadcasts not being routinely recorded. Spede appeared on TV continuously until 1976 when he started to focus primarily on film work.

Starting from 1981, Spede once again put priority on TV work. First airing surviving black and white skits on the recently established independent Mainos-TV channel, Spede, Simo Salminen and Vesa-Matti Loiri began producing new skits. [[Hannele Lauri]] also joined as a regular cast-member. The new Spede Show continued to air until 1987 when Spede and Loiri had a mock-feud which led to the launch of Vesa-Matti Loiri's own TV sketch show, Vesku Show. Throughout the 1980s, Spede also produced other programs such as the comedy program ''Fakta Homma'' and the competition show ''[[Kymppitonni]]'' with host [[Riitta Väisänen]].

By the 1990s, Spede was himself tired of sketch-work but produced [[Aake Kalliala]]'s and [[Pirkka-Pekka Petelius]]'s [[Pulttibois]] and [[Tsa Tsa Tsaa]] as well as the sporty competition show [[Speden Spelit]]. Pasanen also produced more drama-programming such as ''Hynttyyt Yhteen'', ''Blondi Tuli Taloon'', and ''Ihmeiden tekijät'' (as well as its follow-up, ''Parhaat Vuodet''). Many of these shows became stables of MTV3 with many of them airing for several seasons. Spede also approved the production of the dramedy-series ''Kuumia Aaltoja'', which aired in 2003 (two years after his death).

==Influences and comedy==
Spede Pasanen named [[Bob Hope]] as one of his biggest comedy influences.

Spede Pasanen is considered emblematic of [[Savonian people|Savonian]] ironic humor varying between the fullest extremes of understatement and hyperbole. As he himself explained: "A Savonian never tells a thing exactly like it is." Spede's comedy denounced elitism and he explicitly sought to write and perform comedy for the largest possible audience. His early films in particular, featured elements uncommon to Finnish cinema such as fist-fights, car chases, other elaborate stunt-work as well as unconventional special effects. Many of his movies also featured unconventional settings (such as the medieval period or the wild west), though his later films focused almost entirely on poking fun at Finnish stereotypes.

His Uuno Turhapuro movies can be considered conventional [[farce]]s. An unemployed slacker will, with comically incredible luck, a father-in-law who is rich and connected but unlucky (mainly due to Uuno), and with slick charm, end up in roles of minister, general officer, or rich man, usually causing havoc in the father-in-law's businesses.

==Other achievements==
Pasanen was also an inventor and jack-of-all-trades; he had over 50 [[patent]]s registered to his name, and many of his films include [[Rube Goldberg]]-style gadgets. Besides gadgets involved with industrial production, his inventions include:

*The [[Ski jumping sling]]
*A [[Boat ski]] (to alleviate *bumps* in aquaplaning boat)
*A self-extinguishing, one-size-fits-all [[candlestick]].

For a period of time Pasanen was also obsessed with inventing a [[perpetual motion]] device. His crude drawings of it also appeared in his sketchs shows and films. Once he became convinced that perpetual motion is theoretically impossible, he openly ridiculed himself in the character of ''Härski Hartikainen'' in one of the Uuno Turhapuro movies.

==Personal life==
Spede married Pirjo Vainimäki, the leading lady of his first starring picture ''[[X-Paroni]]'', in 1965. Spede's first and only child, [[Pirre Pasanen]], was born later that year. The couple separated in the early 1980s and divorced later.

A family private individual, Pasanen did not discuss his personal relationships in public. He had a long relationship with the 1976 [[Miss Europe]], [[Riitta Väisänen]]. Pasanen valued loyalty and friendship, and even after separation, kept employing and financially supporting previous companions. During and after relationships, he vouchsafed confidentiality and privacy for all involved in his private life. His good relations with the media might have helped with this.

Pasanen's nickname "Spede" came from an earlier nickname "Speedy", referring to his prowess as an [[ice hockey]] player during his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Toiviainen, Sakari: [http://www.kava.fi/elavan-kuvan-museo/arkiston-aarteet/memoriam/kotimaiset-henkilot/spede-pasanen Spede Pasanen]. ''kava.fi''. Helsinki: Finnish national audiovisual archive. Accessed on 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 7 September 2001 Pasanen was playing a round of golf at the Sarfvik golf course in Kirkkonummi, Finland. At the 9th hole he began to feel ill and was taken to the club house, where his condition rapidly deteriorated. Despite resuscitation by a doctor and a rapid response of emergency medical services Pasanen died. His death was attributed to advanced [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000001253015.html Speden dramaattiset viime hetket – ”Pertti pelkäsi lääkäreitä”] Iltasanomat.fi 2016-09-03]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Uuno Turhapuro series, Pasanen played the role of Härski-Hartikainen, a car repairman with a cunning and ribald character, who often participated in Uuno's farcical adventures. His sidekick was Sörsselssön – earlier known as Lörssön (played by [[Simo Salminen]]).

=== Television series ===
Spede is considered the father of modern Finnish television sketch-humour. Starting his career on [[Yleisradio]] he later jumped camps to the competing [[MTV3]] network. However, his work on both has been extremely popular. Apart from starring in these series he was also the main producer for many of the popular shows on MTV3, such as the game-show ''Kymppitonni'' and the cult-hit show ''Pulttibois''.

[[File:Sphinx of Giza 01.jpg|thumb|240px|The Great Sphinx of Giza]]

The '''Sphinx water erosion hypothesis''' is a [[fringe theory|fringe claim]] contending that the main type of [[weathering]] evident on the enclosure walls of the [[Great Sphinx]] was caused by prolonged and extensive [[rainfall]]&lt;ref name="Schoch (1992)"&gt;Schoch, Robert M. (1992). [http://www.robertschoch.net/Redating%20the%20Great%20Sphinx%20of%20Giza.htm "Redating the Great Sphinx of Giza"] in ''Circular Times'', ed. Collette M. Dowell. Retrieved {{Nowrap|17 December}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; that would have predated the time of [[Djedefre]] and [[Khafre]], the [[Pharaoh]]s credited by most modern [[Egyptologists]] with building the Great Sphinx and [[Pyramid of Khafre|Second Pyramid]] at Giza around 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''"Why Sequence is Important"'', Lehner, Mark; Hunt, Brian V.

A. Schwaller de Lubicz, ''Sacred Science: The King of Pharaonic Theocracy'' (New York: Inner Traditions International, 1982. {{ISBN|0-89281-007-6}}). Originally published entitled ''Le Roi de la Théocratie Pharaonique'' (Paris: Flammarion, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Anthony West]], an author and alternative Egyptologist, investigated Schwaller de Lubicz's ideas further and, in 1989, sought the opinion of [[Robert M. Schoch]], a [[geologist]] and associate professor of [[natural science]] at the College of General Studies at [[Boston University]].

From his investigation of the enclosure's geology, Schoch concluded the main type of [[weathering]] evident on the Sphinx enclosure walls was caused by prolonged and extensive [[rainfall]].&lt;ref name="Schoch (1992)"/&gt; According to Schoch, the area has experienced a mean annual rainfall of approximately one inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) since the [[Old Kingdom]] (''c''. 2686 – 2134&amp;nbsp;BC), such that, since Egypt's [[Sahara#History|last period of significant rainfall]] ended between the late fourth and early 3rd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~e118/Fezzan/fezzan_palaeoclim.html Palaeoclimate and environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607025201/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~e118/Fezzan/fezzan_palaeoclim.html |date=7 June 2009 }}, Fezzan Project, Climate Research Unit, Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, [[University of East Anglia]].

Schoch further notes the same heavy precipitation-induced weathering as seen on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure is also found on the core blocks of the Sphinx and Valley Temples, both known to have been originally constructed from blocks taken from the Sphinx enclosure when the body was carved.&lt;ref name="robertschoch.com"&gt;{{cite web|website=Robertschoch.com|title=Geological Evidence Pertaining to the Age of the Great Sphinx|url=http://www.robertschoch.com/geodatasphinx.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319205441/http://www.robertschoch.com/geodatasphinx.html|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the presence of extensive 4th Dynasty repair work to the Sphinx and associated temples is acknowledged by such Egyptologists as Lehner and Hawass, Schoch contends: "Therefore if the granite facing is covering deeply weathered limestone, the original limestone structures must predate by a considerable degree the granite facing. Obviously, if the limestone cores (originating from the Sphinx ditch) of the temples predate the granite ashlars (granite facings), and the granite ashlars are attributable to Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty, then the Great Sphinx was built prior to the reign of Khafre."&lt;ref name="robertschoch.com"/&gt;

[[Colin Reader]], a British geologist, agrees that the suggested evidence of weathering indicates prolonged water erosion. Reader found, ''[[inter alia]]'', that the flow of rainwater causing the weathering had been stemmed by the construction of 'Khufu's quarries',&lt;ref&gt;Löhner, Franz; Zuberbühler, Teresa (2006). [http://www.cheops-pyramide.ch/khufu-pyramid/stone-quarries.html#herkunft ''Building the Great Pyramid: Quarries in Ancient Egypt'']. Updated 2006. Retrieved {{Nowrap|5 January}} 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which lie directly "[[wiktionary:upstream|upstream]]" of the Sphinx enclosure, and therefore concludes that the Sphinx must predate the reign of Khufu (2589 – 2566&amp;nbsp;BC), and certainly Khafra, by several hundred years. Reader disagrees with Schoch's palaeometeorological estimates, and instead concludes that the Sphinx dates to the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3150 – 2686 BC).).&lt;ref name="Reader (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reader |first=Colin |year=2002 |title=Giza Before the Fourth Dynasty |url=http://www.newchronology.org/tfiles/1542828234/09a005.pdf |journal=Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum |volume=9 |pages=9–21 |publisher=The Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Magli, ''Mysteries and Discoveries of Archaeoastronomy: From Giza to Easter Island'', page 374 (Praxis Publishing Limited, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-387-76564-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the disproportionate size of the head compared to the body, Reader, as does Schoch, also suggests the head of the Sphinx was originally that of a lion and recarved sometime later in the likeness of a pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailygrail.com/Hidden-History/2014/6/Did-the-Great-Sphinx-Egypt-Originally-Have-Different-Head|title=Did the Great Sphinx of Egypt Originally Have a Different Head? – The Daily Grail|website=dailygrail.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Robertschoch.com|title=The Great Sphinx|url=http://www.robertschoch.com/sphinxcontent.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801000638/http://www.robertschoch.com/sphinxcontent.html|archivedate=1 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of Egyptologists and archaeologists==
[[Zahi Hawass]], former Egyptian minister of state for antiquities affairs and secretary-general of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], was asked in an interview on the PBS series [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]] if it was possible that a more ancient civilization might have sculpted the Sphinx. Hawass replied: "Of course it is not possible for one reason  ….  No single artifact, no single inscription, or pottery, or anything has been found until now, in any place to predate the Egyptian civilization more than 5,000 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff writer |year=1997 |title=How Old Are the Pyramids? Part 1 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/explore/howold.html |website=Nova Online |publisher=[[PBS]] |access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reasoning and conclusion was supported in a similar NOVA interview by [[Mark Lehner]], another senior Egyptologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Staff writer |year=1997 |title=How Old Are the Pyramids? Part 2 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/explore/howold2.html  |website=Nova Online |publisher=[[PBS]] |access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeologists who have made similar criticisms include [[Kenneth Feder]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Feder, ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum'', page 130 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37918-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different argument used by Egyptologists to ascribe the Sphinx to Khafra is the "context" theory, which notes that the Sphinx is located in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafra.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark (Spring 2002). [http://www.aeraweb.org/PDFs/aeragram5_2_2002.pdf "Unfinished Business: The Great Sphinx"] in ''Aeragram'', '''5''':2 (Spring 2002), 10–14. Retrieved {{Nowrap|23 December}} 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215211948/http://www.aeraweb.org/PDFs/aeragram5_2_2002.pdf |date=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple, both of which display the same architectural style, with 100-[[tonne]] stone blocks quarried out of the Sphinx enclosure. A [[diorite]] statue of Khafra, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafra theory. Reader agrees that the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple are closely associated with the Sphinx, as is the Causeway and even part of the Khafra Mortuary Temple, but suggests this evidence merely indicates these structures also predate Khafra and does not link the Sphinx in any way to Khafra. [[Rainer Stadelmann]], former director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] in Cairo suggests Khufu, Khafra's father, was the builder of the Sphinx &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1478998/I-have-solved-riddle-of-the-Sphinx-says-Frenchman.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nic | last=Fleming | title=I have solved riddle of the Sphinx, says Frenchman | date=14 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contends Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure which he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.&lt;ref name="Reader (2002)"/&gt; Lehner's official website also offers a similar argument based on an [[Archaeological sequence]] of structures built in the area. Lehner points to the way several structures in the area incorporate elements from older structures, and based on the order in which they were constructed concludes that the archaeological sequencing does not allow for a date older than the reign of Khafra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeraweb.org/sphinx-project/why-sequence-is-important/ |title=Why Sequence is Important| website=Ancient Egypt Research Association (AERA) |access-date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawass points to the poor quality of much of the Giza limestone as the basis for the significant erosion levels. He has concluded, from the present-day rapid rate of erosion on the Member II surface of the Sphinx, that "[t]he eleven hundred years between Khafre and the first major restoration in the Eighteenth Dynasty, or even half this time, would have been more than enough to erode the Member II into the deep recesses behind Phase I restoration masonry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|title=The Secrets of the Sphinx: Restoration past and present|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-977-424-492-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paNczK-gUWMC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=sphinx+weathering&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KWYAT-TIGYXA8QOkje35AQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rainfall&amp;f=false|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schoch states that other structures and surfaces on the Giza Plateau are made from the same band of limestone as the Sphinx enclosure, but they do not show the same erosion as the walls of the Sphinx enclosure.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Peter Lacovara, an Egyptologist and curator at the [[Michael C. Carlos Museum]] at [[Emory University]], [[Atlanta]], assigns "some of the erosional features" on the enclosure walls to [[quarry]]ing activities rather than weathering, and states that other wear and tear on the Sphinx itself is due to [[Groundwater recharge|groundwater percolation]] and [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacovara|first=Peter|title=The Pyramids, the Sphinx: Tombs and Temples of Giza|year=2004|publisher=Bunker Hill Publishing|isbn=978-1-59373-022-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9gSkrNuezEC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=sphinx+weathering&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LWcAT8jYCIyn8gPmpdSgAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=schoch&amp;f=false|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of other geologists==
Some geologists have proposed alternative explanations for the evidence of weathering in the Sphinx enclosure.

One of the alternative erosion mechanisms proposed is called [[haloclasty]]. Moisture on limestone will dissolve salts, which are then carried by percolating moisture into the spaces inside the porous limestone. When the moisture dries the salt crystallises, and the expanding crystals cause a fine layer of surface limestone to flake off. It is accepted by Schoch ''et al.'' that this mechanism is evident in many places on the Giza Plateau. One proponent of the haloclasty process is Dr James A. Harrell of the [[University of Toledo]], who advocates that the deep erosion crevices were caused by the haloclasty process being driven by moisture in the sand that covered the carved rock for much of the time since it was exposed by quarrying.&lt;ref name="robertschoch.com"/&gt; Lal Gauri ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Gauri, K. Lal; Sinai, John J.; Bandyopadhyay, Jayanta K. (1995–04). "Geologic Weathering and Its Implications on the Age of the Sphinx", ''[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-GEA.html Geoarchaeology: an International Journal]'', '''10''':2 (April 1995), 119–133. ISSN 0883-6353.&lt;/ref&gt; also favour the haloclasty process to explain the erosion features, but have theorised that the weathering was driven by moisture deriving from atmospheric precipitation such as dew.

Analysis of the Sphinx's bedrock by the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] (1990–1992) concluded that "Continual salt crystallization, which has a destructive effect on the stone, would explain at least some of the deterioration of the Sphinx."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/7_2/sphinx.html|title=Newsletter 7.2 Summer 1992|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Getty Institute Probes Riddle of the Deteriorating Sphinx" by Kim Murphy, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 16 May 1990 [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-16/entertainment/ca-249_1_getty-institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

Haloclasty is rejected as an explanation for the vertical erosion features by Schoch because it doesn’t explain all the visible evidence, namely that the water erosion features are not evenly distributed, being concentrated in those areas that would have been particularly exposed to running water, whereas the haloclasty process should have operated evenly on all exposed limestone surfaces.&lt;ref name="robertschoch.com"/&gt; Similarly, Schoch points out that the alternative explanations do not account for the absence of similar weathering patterns on other rock surfaces in the Giza pyramid complex which were cut from the same limestone beds.&lt;ref name="Schoch (1999–2000)"/&gt;

In an article published in the January 2015 issue of GEO ExPro magazine, geoscientist Jørn Christiansen provided his own analysis of the "vertical weathering" after visiting the Sphinx. Christiansen found evidence that shows that at least some of the erosion took place before the Sphinx was carved. He stated that water most likely seeped through natural fissures in the limestone before the Sphinx had been carved, causing the walls of the Sphinx to look like they were carved much earlier than they really were. As such, Christiansen determined that there was no geological evidence to suggest the Sphinx was carved earlier than any other monuments on the Giza plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2015/01/the-great-sphinx-of-egypt-nature-s-shabby-chic-trick|title=The Great Sphinx of Egypt: Nature’s Shabby-Chic Trick?|date=2015-01-09|work=GEO ExPro|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reader, who agrees that the Sphinx predates Khafra but prefers a construction date within the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]], points to the tombs dug into the enclosure walls during [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty&amp;nbsp;XXVI]] (''c''. 600&amp;nbsp;BC), and notes that the entrances of the tombs have weathered so lightly that original chisel marks are still clearly visible. He points out that if the weathering on the enclosure walls (up to a metre deep in places) had been created by any of the proposed alternative causes of erosion, then the tomb entrances would have been weathered much more severely than they are in the modern day.&lt;ref name=Reader/&gt;

It is also agreed that wind erosion has played a significant role in eroding the Sphinx. Schoch states that wind erosion forms distinctive horizontal bands, whereas the water erosion features are clearly vertical.&lt;ref name="robertschoch.com"/&gt;

==Response of climatologists==
Recent studies by German [[Climatology|climatologists]] Rudolph Kuper and [[Stefan Kröpelin]], of the [[University of Cologne]] suggest the change from a wet to a much drier climate may have come to an end around 3500–1500 BC, which is as much as 500 years later than currently thought. Egyptologist Mark Lehner believes this climate change may have been responsible for the severe weathering found on the Sphinx and other sites of the 4th Dynasty. After studying sediment samples in the Nile Valley, Judith Bunbury, a geologist at the University of Cambridge, concluded that climate change in the Giza region may have begun early in the Old Kingdom, with desert sands arriving in force late in the era.&lt;ref&gt;Haddingham, Evan "Uncovering Secrets of the Sphinx" ''Smithsonian magazine'', February 2010 [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Uncovering-Secrets-of-the-Sphinx.html?c=y&amp;page=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoch points out that [[mudbrick]] mastabas on the [[Saqqara]] plateau about 20&amp;nbsp;km away, indisputably dated to Dynasties&amp;nbsp;I and II, have survived relatively undamaged, which he believes indicates that no heavy rainfall has occurred in the region since the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]], and nor was any heavy rain anticipated by those Early Dynastic Period communities who built those structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Robertschoch.com|title=Redating the Great Sphinx|url=http://www.robertschoch.net/Redating%20the%20Great%20Sphinx%20of%20Giza.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reader replied to this, stating that they "were built on an area of high ground and do not lie within any natural catchment. These tombs will not, therefore, have been exposed to any significant run-off." He concludes that "the fact that they are not significantly degraded, as Schoch has pointed out, demonstrates that rainfall itself has not been a significant agent of degradation in Egypt."&lt;ref name=Reader&gt;{{cite web|last=Reader|first=Colin|title=Further considerations on the Age of the Sphinx|url=http://www.ianlawton.com/as4.htm|accessdate=23 March 2014|date=2000-03-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010615/http://www.ianlawton.com/as4.htm|archivedate=2 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rainfall water run-off, however, has been a more significant factor. Reader cites evidence of flood water damage in another location to illustrate this.&lt;ref&gt;White, Chris, The Age of the Sphinx? Colin Reader vs. Robert Schoch – Water Erosion?

'''StoryCorps''' is an American [[non-profit organization]] whose mission is to record, preserve, and share the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. StoryCorps grew out of Sound Portraits Productions as a project founded in 2003 by radio producer [[David Isay]]. Its headquarters are located in the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

StoryCorps is modeled—in spirit and in scope—after the efforts of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) of the 1930s, through which oral history interviews across the [[United States]] were recorded. Another inspiration for the organization was [[oral history|oral historian]] [[Studs Terkel]], who cut the ribbon at the opening of StoryCorps’ first recording booth in [[Grand Central Terminal]]. To date, StoryCorps has recorded more than 60,000 interviews among more than 100,000 participants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several American territories.

==Interviews==
StoryCorps interviews usually take place between two people who know and care about each other. They can be friends, family, or mere acquaintances. A trained StoryCorps facilitator guides participants through the interview process. At the end of each 40-minute recording session, participants receive a complimentary [[Compact Disc|CD]] of their interview and are requested to make a $50 donation to offset the recording costs. With participant permission, a second copy of each interview is archived at the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] for future generations to hear. Segments of select interviews may air nationally on [[NPR]]’s ''[[Morning Edition]]''. These interviews can also be heard on the StoryCorps website.

==Recording methods==
There are several ways by which participants can record their stories.

===StoryBooth===
Participants can visit StoryBooths, which are small, publicly accessible recording studios located in public places. The first StoryBooth opened in [[New York City]]’s Grand Central Terminal on October 23, 2003, and was moved to [[Lower Manhattan]]’s [[Foley Square]] in July 2005. The second StoryBooth opened at the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in October 2008. The third StoryBooth opened at [[Atlanta]]’s public radio station [[WABE]] in October 2009.

===MobileBooth===
[[File:StoryCorps booth vehicle.jpg|thumb|A StoryCorps MobileBooth parked at the Library of Congress]]
In May 2005, two StoryCorps MobileBooths built from converted [[Airstream]] trailers began traveling the country, recording stories in various cities year-round.

===Services===
StoryCorps offers three additional recordings services for those who are unable to visit a StoryCorps booth. The Door-to-Door service sends teams of StoryCorps facilitators to temporary recording locations throughout the United States for several days at a time. The StoryKit service ships a professional quality, portable recording device to participants around the country. The “Do-It-Yourself” service allows individuals to download free step-by-step interview instructions, equipment recommendations, and a “Great Question” list to conduct interviews using their own recording equipment.

=== StoryCorps App ===
With the support of the 2015 TED Prize and the 2014 Knight Prototype Fund, StoryCorps has developed a free app that allows users to record interviews on a smartphone. The app helps users prepare questions and provides tips for setting up the right recording environment. Users can upload their interviews to the StoryCorps.me website, and all interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The StoryCorps App and StoryCorps.me are currently in public beta.

==Initiatives==
StoryCorps collaborates with groups, organizations, and institutions all over the country. Specifically, StoryCorps currently supports seven major initiatives that seek to reach out to the widest range of participants.&lt;ref&gt;StoryCorps Initiatives, http://storycorps.org/initiatives/, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Military Voices Initiative''' records, shares, and preserves the stories of post-9/11 veterans, active-duty service members, and their families. 
* The '''Memory Loss Initiative''' encourages individuals with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of [[memory loss]] to share their stories.
* The '''Historias Initiative''' collects the stories of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] throughout the United States and [[Puerto Rico]].
* The '''[[Griot]] Initiative''' preserves the voices and experiences of [[African Americans]].  These stories will be archived at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]].
* The '''September 11 Initiative''' honors and remembers the stories of survivors, rescue workers, and others most personally affected by the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].
* '''OutLoud''' seeks to record and preserve a diverse collection of LGBTQ stories across America.
* The '''Justice Project''' amplifies and preserves the stories of those whose lives have been impacted by mass incarceration and the criminal justice system.

== Community programs ==
StoryCorps currently has four community programs.
* Through the '''MobileBooth Tour''', StoryCorps visits cities and towns across the country to record the stories of the people who live there. The MobileBooth Tour partners with local public radio stations, cultural institutions and community-based organizations to get the word out and invite participants to bring someone to the StoryCorps MobileBooth.
* '''StoryCorps Legacy''' provides opportunities for people with serious illness, and their relatives, to record and share their life stories. StoryCorps Legacy partners with organizations across the country, including hospitals and clinics, pediatric centers, hospice and palliative care departments, and disease specific organizations.
* '''StoryCorpsU (SCU)''' is a year-long, cross-disciplinary (language arts, media, history), youth development program designed for 9th and 10th graders to help students develop self and social awareness, academic skills, and strengthened school relationships. SCU uses StoryCorps’ tested interviewing techniques, combined with outstanding radio broadcasts and animated shorts, to support high school students in the development of identity and in drawing connections between their unique strengths and the college application process. For the 2016-2017 school year, SCU will be implemented in nine schools, more than 30 classrooms, and seven cities. The program was most recently evaluated in 2015 by Dr. Ronald Ferguson, a leading national researcher on racial and economic achievement gaps in education.
* The '''StoryCorps Archive''' is the largest born-digital collection of human voices. The collection is housed and can be accessed at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

== Criticism ==
StoryCorps has been criticized on multiple fronts. While it has been called been called “an oral history of America,”&lt;ref&gt;“StoryCorps, An Oral History of America: Sound Booths Will Record Ordinary People’s Life Stories,” National Public Radio, October 23, 2003, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId1⁄41475619, accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; oral historians have critiqued the project’s methodology, specifically the "highly sculpted techniques of the interviews"&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;, such as the pre-scripted questions, the 40-minute time limit, and the presence of a StoryCorps staff member in the recording booth. The result of the technique is that interviews often elicit "an often-rehearsed moment, story, or memory." &lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians are also critical of the post-interview editing process, which they argue favor highly emotional and predictable narrative arcs.&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 258. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; StoryCorps stories typically feature tales of survival, which, as one historian has argued, perpetuates an “interpretive straightjacket of the neoliberal belief that people have their fates in their own hands.”&lt;ref&gt; Freund, Alexander. “Under Storytelling’s Spell? Oral History in a Neoliberal Age.” Oral History Review, vol. 42, no. 1, Winter/Spring  ///Winter/Spring2015 2015, pp. 13. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1093/ohr/ohv002.&lt;/ref&gt;

StoryCorps has also been criticized for how its stories are framed on [[Morning Edition]]. For example, in a 2016 story, an elderly man confessed to having stolen $2 from his home that had been left for Pearl, his family’s female, African American domestic servant. When Pearl insisted that she had not been paid that week, she was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Morning Edition. “A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/2016/12/09/504828481/a-lifelong-secret-can-you-help-this-ailing-94-year-old-man-make-amends. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; The title NPR gave the story - "A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?" - as well as [[Steve Inskeep]]’s closing request for listeners to help find Pearl drew ire from listeners, who found the sympathetic portrayal of the man to be misguided and offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires.

&lt;/ref&gt; One user wrote “waiting nearly a century to try to seek amends is horrific.” Another user suggested changing StoryCorps’ hashtag from #FindPearl to “FindJUSTICEforPearl.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, NPR acknowledged that “the segment comes across, even if this was not the attempt, as trying to manufacture a “feel good” feature.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires.

'''Su' ''' (autonym: {{ipa|ɟruʔ}}) is a [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer language]] of the [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch spoken in [[Attapeu Province]], [[Laos]]. The 1995 [[Attapeu Province|Attapeu]] census recorded a population of only 124 speakers in [[Sanamxay District|Sanamsay District]]. Su' autonyms are identical with that of the Jru' (known to the Lao as "Laven"), but they consider themselves to be a separate ethnic group (Sidwell 2003:19). There could also possibly be speakers in [[Stung Treng Province]], [[Cambodia]].

Su' speakers live in villages on both sides of Route 18, from Ban Chanto to about 10&amp;nbsp;km before Ban Mai.

The '''Swahili Wikipedia''' ({{lang-sw|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Swahili language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]]. It is currently one (and the first) of four language editions of Wikipedia in [[Niger–Congo languages]] with over 1,000 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias_by_language_group|title=List of Wikipedias by language group|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the largest language edition of Wikipedia in a Niger–Congo or Nilo-Saharan language, followed by the [[Yoruba Wikipedia]].

It was mentioned on August 27, 2006 in ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' and ''[[New York Newsday]]'' articles on the struggles of smaller Wikipedia language editions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/technology/27iht-wiki.2604689.html ''Building Wikipedia in African languages''], by Noam Cohen, [[International Herald Tribune]], August 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Google]] sponsored the creation of articles in the Swahili Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/technology/25link.html?_r=0|title = Hungry for New Content, Google Tries to Grow Its Own in Africa|date = January 24, 2010|accessdate = October 14, 2014|website = nytimes.com |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2009, the Swahili Wikipedia gave its main page a makeover.

'''Sydor Rey''' born Izydor Reiss (6 September 1908 – 15 November 1979) was a [[Polish literature|Polish]] poet and novelist. During [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|the Interbellum]] he worked in the [[Korczak's orphanages|Jewish orphanage]] of [[Janusz Korczak]] in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. The ''Interia Encyklopedia'' [http://encyklopedia.interia.pl/haslo?hid=99565&amp;kid=77 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his short story ''[[#Księga rozbitków installments|Anioł-Stróż]]'' ("Guardian Angel"; 1957), part of his book ''[[#Novels|Księga rozbitków]]'', to the memory of Janusz Korczak.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, ''Guardian Angel: A Story'', tr. N.&amp;nbsp;Guterman, ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;67, No.&amp;nbsp;2, February 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;58: [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/guardian-angel/ see online.] The story won the acclaim of readers: cf. Jan Leszcza, "Pochwała" (A Commendation), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;12, No.&amp;nbsp;2 (615), 12 January 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; A bisexual author, Sydor Rey did not frequently tackle gay subjects in his writings.&lt;ref name="Shulim" /&gt;

==Life in interwar Poland==
Sydor Rey was born in [[Wojniłów]] (now Voinyliv, Ukraine). He studied law and political science at the [[Lvov University]] and at [[Warsaw University]].  As a writer, Rey debuted in 1929.  He was a member of the literary collective (''zespół literacki'') ''Przedmieście'' in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Kwiatkowski, ''Literatura Dwudziestolecia'', [[Warsaw]], Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Instytut Badań Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk), 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;31.  {{ISBN|8301099283}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the group's [[literary magazine|literary journal]] indicated that the association was established on the initiative of Helena Boguszewska (1886{{ndash}}1978) and Jerzy Kornacki (1908{{ndash}}1981) in June{{ndash}}July 1933, with [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Adolf Rudnicki]], and [[Zofia Nałkowska|Zofja Nałkowska]] among the invited founder members.  Rudnicki had resigned from membership before the publication of their magazine in 1934, while [[Halina Krahelska]] and Sydor Rey were inducted as new members.&lt;ref name="organ"&gt;[[Halina Krahelska]], "Przedmowa" (Foreword); in: ''Przedmieście'', ed. H.&amp;nbsp;Boguszewska &amp; J.&amp;nbsp;Kornacki, [[Warsaw]], Towarzystwo Wydawnicze Rój, 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;v.  See also [[:pl:Zespół Literacki Przedmieście|Zespół Literacki Przedmieście]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's name (''przedmieście'', ''[[Polish language|Pol.]]'' "[[faubourg]]") has been explained as referring both to the group's programmatic preoccupation with the marginalized aspects of the culture and social life in the [[Second Polish Republic]], and to the connotation of "outpost" – hence by extension ''[[avant-garde]]''.&lt;ref name="organ" /&gt; The volume carried Sydor Rey's short story ''Królestwo Boże'' ("The Kingdom of God"), a fictional narrative of a visit to a privately owned factory by a friend of the proprietors. The visit becomes an occasion for remarkably detailed observations on the [[work conditions]] of the employees and their [[Industrial relations|relations with the management]], the government (represented by an industrial inspector), and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, ''Królestwo Boże''; in: ''Przedmieście'', ed. H.&amp;nbsp;Boguszewska &amp; J.&amp;nbsp;Kornacki, [[Warsaw]], Towarzystwo Wydawnicze Rój, 1934, pp.&amp;nbsp;158{{ndash}}177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First novel ''Kropiwniki''===
Sydor Rey's first novel ''Kropiwniki'' was published in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki: powieść'', Warsaw, Nakładem Księgarni F.&amp;nbsp;Hoesicka, 1937. (393&amp;nbsp;pp.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The title of the novel, ''Kropiwniki'', refers to the Polish provincial locality of Kropiwniki in the [[Volhynia]] (96 kilometres to the north of the Polish town of [[Włodzimierz Wołyński]]; since 1945 within the territory of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]), whose name the author uses as a [[code name|cryptonym]] for his native [[Wojniłów]], an ancient township founded in 1552 by the charter issued by [[Sigismund II Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ludwik Dziedzicki, in: ''[[Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland|The Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;13, p.&amp;nbsp;754, col.&amp;nbsp;2, ''[[s.v.]]'' [[Wojniłów]] [http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_XIII/754 (see online).]&lt;/ref&gt; Its real identity thus concealed, the place serves as a canvas on which the author paints the history of three generations of inhabitants from various social classes and religious communities of Polish society, including [[Poles]], [[Jews]], and [[Ukrainians]], representatives of the [[szlachta]] but also peasants, merchants, and artisans, thereby presenting an allegory on Polish society as a whole.&lt;ref name="CzS"&gt;[Anonymous], "Na ekranie, scenie i wśród książek: Sidor Rey – ''Kropiwniki''" (On the Screen, On the Stage, and Among the Books: Sidor [''[[sic]]''] Rey {{mdash}} ''Kropiwniki''), ''Czasopismo Skarbowe'' (Warsaw), vol.&amp;nbsp;12, No.&amp;nbsp;14, 15 July 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these various social groups, further subdivided in the book into additional subgroups and subtypes, espouses different and often conflicting sets of beliefs concerning social and political matters, whose beliefs moreover further mutate from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="CzS" /&gt; While the author parades a plethora of various types of characters on his stage, from the szlachta individuals affecting a grand aristocratic manner, through lordlings enlightened by foreign studies enough to be able to fraternize with the working classes, to well-to-do Jewish businessmen, he devotes most space to the radicalizing poverty of the township and the impenetrable ignorance of the peasant masses of the surrounding villages, succeeding to depict this broad gallery of human types in particularly vivid brush strokes of great directness.&lt;ref name="CzS" /&gt; Owing however to the well-nigh unmanageable breadth of the scope of his project, it has been observed by contemporary critics that the social doctrine on occasion takes precedence in his writing over art.&lt;ref name="CzS" /&gt; The author [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]] (1909{{ndash}}1983) in [[literary magazine]] ''Prosto z mostu'',&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Ignacy Fik]], ''20 lat literatury polskiej (1918{{ndash}}1938)'', Kraków, Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza Czytelnik, 1939, p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; was even less kind, having seen in ''Kropiwniki'' an expression of the alleged Communist stance of an author squandering his talent in a doctrinaire enterprise of quixotic futility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], "Nowe powieści: Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki''" (New Novels: Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki''), ''Prosto z mostu'' (Warsaw), vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;2 (110), 10 January 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Witold Gombrowicz]] too wrote a detailed and perhaps most considerate analysis of ''Kropiwniki'', arguing that it is the literary debuts that are more interesting, for all their inchoate form, than an author's later works which, though benefiting from the writer's more crystallized pattern of thought, in general tend to say little that is essentially new.&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Gombrowicz]], "Proletariacka huśtawka" (A Proletarian See-saw); in ''Czytelnicy i krytycy: proza, reportaże, krytyka literacka, eseje, przedmowy'', ed. W.&amp;nbsp;Bolecki, [[Cracow]], Wydawnictwo Literackie, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;220.  {{ISBN|8308033954}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rey also translated from the [[Yiddish]] into [[Polish language|Polish]] the [[biographical novel]] on [[Karl Marx]], ''Karl Marks (bay zayn shvel): byografisher montazsh-roman'' by the Polish writer [[Moisheh Grosman]] (1904{{ndash}}1961).&lt;ref&gt;[[Moisheh Grosman|M. Grosman]], ''Karol Marks: powieść biograficzna'', tr. S.&amp;nbsp;Rey, [[Warsaw]], Znicz, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Eugenia Prokop-Janiec of [[Jagiellonian University]] asserts that it was ultimately the pervasive [[antisemitism]] of the Polish society in the 1930s that forced the writers and poets like Sydor Rey and [[Henryka Łazowertówna]] (1909{{ndash}}1942), who never otherwise identified themselves as Jewish while working in the [[Polish language]], to align themselves with the Jewish community for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Prokop-Janiec, ''Polish{{ndash}}Jewish Literature in the Interwar Years'', tr. A.&amp;nbsp;Shenitzer, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (New York)]], Syracuse University Press, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;94{{ndash}}95. {{ISBN|0815629842}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sydor Rey's [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] entitled ''Spacer'' ("A Walk") deals with the thorny subject of [[race relations]] in a [[homoerotic]] context.  It is a short text about a male couple who, taking a stroll in a public park, attract the attention of a gathering crowd not for being gay but for being of different races: the bystanders are not hostile to both characters as a couple, but in each case only to one of them – selected according to the particular bystander's ''own'' racial allegiance: the Gentiles in the crowd of onlookers are hostile to the man who looks Jewish, for they believe him to be somehow exploitative of his companion; the Jews in the crowd on the other hand are hostile to the Gentile believing him to be about to cause harm to his Jewish companion to whom they consequently feel obliged to offer assistance.  Both men offer explanations to a policeman who arrives on the scene to institute ''ad hoc'' inquiry of his own into the commingling of the couple.  The story is an [[allegory]] on the impossibility of normal relations between the races on a private level without public or official harassment, even as relations between (or within) the sexes are tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, ''Spacer'' ("A Walk"), ''[[Nowy Głos]]'' (a [[daily newspaper|daily]] Jewish newspaper of [[Warsaw]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;2, No.&amp;nbsp;155, 5 June 1938, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; A bisexual author, Sydor Rey did not frequently tackle gay subjects in his writings.&lt;ref name="Shulim"&gt;Cf. Sydor Rey, ''Shulim: A Story'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;29, No.&amp;nbsp;4, April 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;324 [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/shulima-story/ (see online).]&lt;/ref&gt; His epigram "Na plaży" (On the Beach) is one of the exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Na plaży" (On the Beach); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' &amp; Painters' Press, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rey was one of the signatories of the [[open letter]] of the Polish writers against the bloody pacification by the Polish police of the workers' protests against the [[Sanacja]] régime in March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;"Protest pisarzy warszawskich" (Protest of the Writers of Warsaw), ''Kamena: miesięcznik literacki'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;3, Nos.&amp;nbsp;8{{ndash}}9 (28{{ndash}}29), April{{ndash}}May 1936, back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration==
On the eve of the [[Second World War]], in the spring of 1939 Sydor Rey emigrated from Warsaw to New York City, where he subsequently operated a [[second-hand bookshop]].&lt;ref&gt;Bio on the Onet.pl WIEM reference portal (see [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/21339,,,,rey_sydor,haslo.html online.)]&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and daughter left behind in Poland will perish in [[Cracow]] during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zofia Kozarynowa]], "O ''Księdze rozbitków''", ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;14, No.&amp;nbsp;48 (713), 29 November 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his American period his writings appeared frequently in the Polish-language [[weekly newspaper]] ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' ("The News: A Weekly") published in London, and in other [[émigré]] periodicals (while ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and the ''[[Transatlantic Review (1959)|Transatlantic Review]]'' published translations in the United States). In his reply to a survey of Polish writers living in exile conducted by the ''Wiadomości'' of London in 1958, nearly twenty years after his departure from Poland, Rey revealed that every writer creatively active in exile is ''spiritually present'', in the act of creation, in his native land.&lt;ref name="WTPoll"&gt;"Pisarze emigracyjni a literatura krajowa: ankieta ''Wiadomości''" ([[Émigré]] Writers ''vis-à-vis'' the Literature of the Home Country: A ''Wiadomości'' Poll), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;13, No.&amp;nbsp;33 (646), 17 August 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence there are in reality no "émigré writers" and no "émigré literatures".&lt;ref name="WTPoll" /&gt;  He appended his literary testament with the following codicil.

If I, after well-nigh twenty years spent in the United States, have never thought for a moment of adopting English as my creative medium, it is because spiritually I continue to reside in my [[Second Polish Republic|Homeland]].  The split involved here at times invests the written word of an author in exile with a terrifying beauty, which flows from his undaunted vision.  But at the same time this split can, in the long run, lead to the degeneration of the creative faculty {{mdash}} the most glaring case in point being that of the giant of Polish literature, [[Adam Mickiewicz]].  (...) [This happens] when a writer ceases to use the written word in the service of Beauty, as a building block in the project of constructing his own immaterial world, and starts using it as a magic charm invoked for the sake of transforming his immaterial world into a material one.&lt;ref name="WTPoll" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And Rey clearly remained devoted to the Polish language for life, in the sort of intricate way of an impeccable stylist, as evidenced in his corrections of the minutiae in the prose of other writers or in the praise he generously showered on the dextrous use of the language in other cases, even of those who might not have been professional writers.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Przyjemniejszy szmer" (A Still More Captivating Murmur), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;14, No.&amp;nbsp;32 (697), 9 August 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;6.  Sydor Rey, "Pisarze nie zawodowi" (Non-professional Writers), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;14, No.&amp;nbsp;46 (711), 15 November 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;6.  Cf. Sydor Rey, "Para Mistrzów" (Two Masters), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;16, No.&amp;nbsp;20 (789), 14 May 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; He was listed by the ''Wiadomości'' of London among the Polish writers in exile who ought to be members of the Polish Academy of Literature were such an institution to be established (or rather [[Polish Academy of Literature|revived]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rozstrzygnięcie plebiscytu czytelników ''Wiadomości'': kogo wybraliśmy do złożonej z 15 pisarzy emigracyjnej Akademii Literatury Polskiej gdyby taka Akademia powstała" (The Results of ''Wiadomości'' Readers' Plebiscite: Whom to Appoint to the 15-member Polish Academy of Literature in exile were such an Academy to be Established), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;14, No.&amp;nbsp;41 (706), 11 October 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no evidence, on the other hand, that in the United States Rey found anything like a substitute for the land of his youth; in a poem entitled "Miasto na Long Island" (A City on Long Island) published in 1960 he speaks of a "city flat and straight like a cadaver", with street names invoking "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] that have been exterminated, running streams that have been filled in, hills that have been levelled down, and forests that have been felled": what use to me this cemetery? he asks.  "Don't you know that I was born in a land where a [[Pegasus|white-winged horse]] would bend down to peer into my crib?"&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Miasto na Long Island" (A City on Long Island), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;15, No.&amp;nbsp;23 (740), 5 June 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;1.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' &amp; Painters' Press, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem "Banita" (The Banished One; 1961) Rey speaks of himself as a person deprived of speech, on account of his being "a poet without a land".&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Banita" (The Banished One), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;16, No.&amp;nbsp;52/53 (821/822), 24{{ndash}}31 December 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing from abroad==
During his exile in the United States he also chose to publish his books {{mdash}} ''Księga rozbitków'' ("The Book of the Shipwrecked"; first edition, 1959)&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, ''Księga rozbitków'', [[Warsaw]], Czytelnik, 1959. (227&amp;nbsp;pp.)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kropiwniki'' (second edition, 1962)&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki'', 2nd&amp;nbsp;ed., [[Cracow]], Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1962. (253&amp;nbsp;pp.) There is a 140-page difference in the number of pages between this second edition and the first edition of 1937, which ran to 393 pages: it is unclear whether this difference is due to a difference in typesetting styles or to an abridgement of the text (and if the latter should be the case, whether this would have been done by the Author or through an intervention of the censor).&lt;/ref&gt; {{mdash}} in the then [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist-controlled Poland]], where their publication would have been subject to (and has received) the advance approval of the [[Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|censors]].  He also granted an interview to the [[Polish Radio]] in 1963, apparently on a visit to Warsaw (see [[#Recordings|Recordings]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

''Księga rozbitków'' ("The Book of the Shipwrecked") is a collection of eighteen short stories that are, cumulatively, a psychological memoir of an author guilt-stricken for having passed the [[Holocaust]] in the physical safety of New York while being spiritually connected to the event as closely as or perhaps in some cases more closely than some of the victims, making the work something of a cross between a novel and a psychodrama ''cum'' a Gestalt therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Popiel, "The Memories of an Amputee", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;7, No.&amp;nbsp;2, Spring 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sydor Rey's novel ''Ludzie miejscowi'' ("The Folk of the Place") was published in installments in the ''Wiadomości'' of London between 1962 and 1966 (see [[#Ludzie miejscowi installments|Works]]).  While his writings in prose were praised for their astute psychological shadowing of characters and deep insights into the human condition, his poetry did not appeal to everyone.  [[Marian Pankowski]], reviewing his collection of poetry ''[[#Poetry monographs|Własnymi słowami]]'' ("In My Own Words"; 1967), refused to apply the label of "poetry" to his verses, arguing that the colloquial and sometimes crude turn of phrase favoured by the author put his epigrams beyond the pale of art, while the consistent unsublimated directness of expression made it impossible to interpret this style as a literary conceit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Pankowski]], "Rzeczywistość nieokrzesana, czyli o wierszach Sydora Reya" (Uncouth Reality, or About the Verses of Sydor Rey), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;23, No.&amp;nbsp;39 (1174), 29 September 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rey countered that the criticisms presented by Pankowski were illustrated by tendentiously selected quotations that did not constitute a representative sample and had been taken out of context, and that the overall method of extrapolating judgement of the whole ''oeuvre'' from bits and pieces was absurd, "rather like presenting an audience with the bottom sliver of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne's]] ''[[The Bathers (Cézanne)|Bathing Women]]'' {{mdash}} the figures cut off at the ankle {{mdash}} and averring this fragment to possess 'some characteristics of Cézanne's painting style', only to dispatch the artist ''[[in toto]]'' with the dictum that 'the rest of his output is much in the same manner'".&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "W obronie własnej" (In Self-defence), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;23, No.&amp;nbsp;45 (1180), 10 November 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Rey did not publish essays, his philosophical ideas found expression in his fiction, both in prose and in verse.  Poems that deal directly or (sometimes) veiledly with the principal tenets of the Judaeo-Christian religious doctrine {{mdash}} such as "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Bajka]]" (Fairy Tale),&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Bajka" (Fairy Tale) ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;15, No.&amp;nbsp;51/52 (768/769), 18{{ndash}}25 December 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;4.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' &amp; Painters' Press, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Ojcze nasz]]" (Our Father),&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Ojcze nasz" (Our Father), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;16, No.&amp;nbsp;52/53 (821/822), 24{{ndash}}31 December 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;3.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' &amp; Painters' Press, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Raz kozie śmierć]]" (Once a Death Befell a Goat) which quotes (in Hebrew) one of the [[Seven Last Words from the Cross|Seven Last Words]] in the scornful context of a [[Pastoral#Pastoral poetry|pastoral ditty]]&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Raz kozie śmierć" (Once a Death Befell a Goat), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;12, No.&amp;nbsp;4 (1086), 22 January 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;6.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' &amp; Painters' Press, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; {{mdash}} may offend religious sensibilities, expressive as they are of his deep agnosticism and his radical questioning of the [[truth value]] of that doctrine.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

As a literary critic, Sydor Rey believed that [[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was deeply indebted to [[Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms|A&amp;nbsp;Farewell to Arms]]'', notwithstanding the fact of Hemingway's having been "thick-skinned and effect-driven" as opposed to Pasternak's qualities of fragile intelligence and delicacy.&lt;ref&gt;Sydor Rey, "Pasternak i Hemingway" (Pasternak and Hemingway), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;14, No.&amp;nbsp;9 (674), 1 March 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an admirer of the works of [[Thornton Wilder]], to whom he dedicated a poem (entitled "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Festyn]]" {{mdash}} "A Village Fair"; translated in ''[[The Daily Orange]]'' in 1966 as "Picnic"), acknowledging his indebtedness in the writing of ''[[#Novels|Księga rozbitków]]'' to the style of Wilder's play ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[Anonymous], "Kronika: Sydor Rey w zbiorach Syracuse University" (Chronicle: Sydor Rey among the Holdings of the Syracuse University Library), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&amp;nbsp;21, No.&amp;nbsp;21 (1051), 22 May 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

His collected papers dating from the period between 1940 and 1969 {{mdash}} The Sydor Rey Papers {{mdash}} are preserved in the Special Collections Research Center of the [[Syracuse University Library]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], having been donated to the institution by the Author in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;The Sydor Rey Papers, [[Syracuse University Library]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (New York)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Syntax diagrams''' (or '''railroad diagrams''') are a way to represent a [[context-free grammar]]. They represent a graphical alternative to [[Backus–Naur form]] or to [[EBNF]] as [[metalanguages]]. Early books using syntax diagrams include the "Pascal User Manual" written by [[Niklaus Wirth]] &lt;ref name="Wirth1974"&gt;[http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:3059/eth-3059-01.pdf Niklaus Wirth: ''The Programming Language Pascal.'' (July 1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; (diagrams start at page 47) and the Burroughs [[CANDE]] Manual.&lt;ref name="burroughs71"&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B6500_6700/5000318_B6700_CANDE_Oct72.pdf Burroughs B6700/B7700 ''Command AND Edit (CANDE) Language: Information Manual'']&lt;/ref&gt;. In the compilation field, textual representations like BNF or its variants are usually preferred. BNF is text-based, and used by compiler writers and parser generators. Railroad diagrams are visual, and may be more readily understood by laypeople, sometimes incorporated into graphic design. The canonical source defining the [[JSON]] data interchange format provides yet another example of a popular modern usage of these diagrams.

== Principle of syntax diagrams ==

The representation of a grammar is made of a set of syntax diagrams. Each diagram defines a non-terminal. There is a main diagram which defines the language in the following way: to belong to the language, a word must describe a path in the main diagram.

Each diagram has an entry point and an end point. The diagram describes possible paths between these two points by going through other nonterminals and terminals. Terminals are represented by round boxes while nonterminals are represented by square boxes.

== Example ==

We use arithmetic expressions as an example. First we provide a simplified BNF grammar:
&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt;
&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;expression&gt; "+" &lt;term&gt;
&lt;term&gt;       ::= &lt;factor&gt; | &lt;term&gt; "*" &lt;factor&gt;
&lt;factor&gt;     ::= &lt;constant&gt; | &lt;variable&gt; | "(" &lt;expression&gt; ")"
&lt;variable&gt;   ::= "x" | "y" | "z" 
&lt;constant&gt;   ::= &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; &lt;constant&gt;
&lt;digit&gt;      ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

&lt;/source&gt;

This grammar can also be expressed in [[EBNF]]:
&lt;source lang="ebnf"&gt;
expression = term | expression, "+" , term;
term       = factor | term, "*" , factor;
factor     = constant | variable | "(" , expression , ")";
variable   = "x" | "y" | "z"; 
constant   = digit , {digit};
digit      = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";

&lt;/source&gt;

One possible set of syntax diagrams for this grammar is:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">'''Tadhg Ó Cobhthaigh''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1554.) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] poet.

[[Ó Cobhthaigh]] was a member of a [[hereditary]] [[bard]]ic family based in what is now [[County Westmeath]]. All that is known of his parents is that his father's name was Aedh.

Among his know surviving works is ''Crann seoil na cruinne an chroch naomtha'' (''The holy cross is the mast of the world'') and a lament of one hundred verses on the death of King of [[Kingdom of Uí Failghe|Uí Failghe]], Brian mac Cathaoir Ó Conchubhair Fáilghe (reigned c. 1525-c. 1556).

A third poem - ''Cia re ccuirfinn sed suirghe'' - in praise of Manus mac Aodh Dubh [[O'Donnell dynasty|Ó Domhnaill]] is ascribed to him. It consists of twenty [[stanza]]s, which won him the gift of a [[mare]] for each stanza from Ó Domhnaill.

He appears to be the same man that Captain [[Francis O'Neill]], apparently incorrectly, associates with [[Geoffrey Keating]] (c.1569-1643). Or perhaps a latter man of the same name. O'Neill attributes the following verses to Keating, concerning Ó Cobhthaigh:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Who is the artist by whom the cruit is player?
By whom the anguish of the envenomed spear’s recent would is healed,
through the sweet-voiced sound of the sounding-board, like the sweet~streamed peal of the organ?
Who is it that plays the enchanting music that dispels all the ills that man is heir to?
Tadhg O’Cobthaigh of beauteous form, -
The chief-beguiler of women,
The intelligent concordance of all difficult tunes,
The thrills of music and of harmony.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Taiwanese Sign Language''' or '''TSL''' ({{zh|t=台灣手語|p=Táiwān Shǒuyǔ}}) is the [[deaf sign language]] most commonly used in [[Taiwan]].

==History==
The beginnings of Taiwan Sign Language date from 1895.&lt;ref name="fisher501"&gt;Fischer, Susan ''et al.'' (2010). "Variation in East Asian Sign Language Structures" in {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|''Sign Languages,'' p. 501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of TSL developed from [[Japanese Sign Language]] during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. TSL is considered part of the [[Japanese Sign Language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|p. 499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSL has some [[Mutually intelligible languages|mutual intelligibility]] with both Japanese Sign Language and [[Korean Sign Language]]; it has about a 60% lexical similarity with JSL.&lt;ref name="fisher501"/&gt; 
 
There are two main dialects of TSL centered on two of the three major sign language schools in Taiwan: one in [[Taipei]], the other in [[Tainan City]] (the [[Taichung]] school used a sign language essentially the same as the Tainan school).

After [[Political status of Taiwan#Cession, retrocession and self-determination of Taiwan|the retrocession of Taiwan to the ROC]], Taiwan absorbed an influx of [[Chinese Sign Language]] users from [[mainland China]] who influenced TSL through [[Deaf education|teaching methods]] and [[loanwords]].&lt;ref name="fisher501"/&gt;

Serious linguistic research on TSL began in the 1970s and is continuing at present. The first International [[Symposium]] on Taiwan Sign Language [[Linguistics]] was held on March 1–2, 2003, at [[National Chung Cheng University]] in [[Minxiong, Chiayi|Minxiong]], [[Chiayi County|Chiayi]], Taiwan.

== Functional markers ==
TSL, like other sign languages, incorporates non-manual markers with lexical, syntactic, discourse, and affective functions. These include brow raising and furrowing, frowning, head shaking and nodding, and leaning and shifting the torso.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|p. 507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarnish''' is a thin layer of [[corrosion]] that forms over [[copper]], [[brass]], [[silver]], [[aluminum]], [[magnesium]], [[neodymium]] and other similar [[metals]] as their outermost layer undergoes a chemical reaction. Tarnish does not always result from the sole effects of oxygen in the air. For example, silver needs [[hydrogen sulfide]] to tarnish, although it may tarnish with oxygen over time. It often appears as a dull, gray or black film or coating over metal. Tarnish is a surface phenomenon that is self-limiting, unlike [[rust]]. Only the top few layers of the metal react, and the layer of tarnish seals and protects the underlying layers from reacting.

Tarnish actually preserves the underlying metal in outdoor use, and in this form is called [[patina]]. The formation of patina is necessary in applications such as copper roofing, and outdoor copper, bronze, and brass statues and fittings. Patina is the name given to tarnish on [[copper]] based metals.

==Chemistry==
Tarnish is a product of a [[chemical reaction]] between a [[metal]] and a [[nonmetal]] [[chemical compound|compound]], especially [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]. It is usually a metal [[oxide]], the product of [[oxidation]]. Sometimes it is a metal sulfide. The metal oxide sometimes reacts with water to make the hydroxide; and carbon dioxide to make the carbonate. It is a chemical change.There are various methods to prevent metals from tarnishing.


==Prevention and removal==
Using a thin coat of [[polishing|polish]] can prevent tarnish from forming over these metals. Tarnish can be removed by using [[steel wool]], [[sandpaper]], [[emery paper]], [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] or a [[File (tool)|file]] to rub or polish the metal's dull surface.  Fine objects (such as silverware) may have the tarnish electrochemically reversed (non-destructively) by resting the objects on a piece of aluminium foil in a pot of boiling water with a small amount of salt or baking soda,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/booklets/7_44_85_1.html?page=2 Finishing techniques in Metalwork - Philadelphia Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/homeexpts/TARNISH.html |title=Remove Tarnish from Silver |publisher=Scifun.chem.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it may be removed with a special polishing compound and a soft cloth. Gentler abrasives, like [[calcium carbonate]], are often used by museums to clean tarnished silver as they cannot damage or scratch the silver and will not leave unwanted residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/making-it-shine/ |title=Making it Shine &amp;#124; Ohio Historical Society Collections Blog |publisher=Ohiohistory.wordpress.com |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323201653/http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/making-it-shine/ |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vlax Romani''' is a [[Romani_language#Dialects|dialect]] group of the [[Romani language]]. Vlax Romani varieties are spoken mainly in [[Southeastern Europe]] by [[Romani people]].&lt;ref name=boretzky&gt;Norbert Boretzky and Birgit Igla. Kommentierter Dialektatlas des Romani. Wiesbaden:
Harrassowitz Verlag 2004. Teil 1: Vergleich der Dialekte.&lt;/ref&gt; Vlax Romani can also be referred to as an independent language&lt;ref name=ethnologue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rmy|title=Romani, Vlax|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as one dialect of the [[Romani language]]. Vlax Romani is the most widely spoken dialect subgroup of the Romani language worldwide. 

==Name==
The language's name is derived from the "[[Vlach]]s", a medieval exonym referring to the Romanians, as all the Vlax dialects share an extensive influence from [[Romanian language|Romanian]] on vocabulary, phonology and morphology.&lt;ref name="matras"&gt;{{cite book |title=Romani: A Linguistic Introduction  |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2002|isbn=9781139433242 |author=Yaron Matras |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many waves of migration of Roma out of Romania, some of them being connected to the 19th century [[Slavery in Romania|abolition of slavery in Romania]].&lt;ref name="matras"/&gt; This name was coined by British scholar [[Bernard Gilliat-Smith]] in his 1915 study on Bulgarian Roma, in which he first divided Roma dialects into Vlax and non-Vlax, based on whether they were influenced by Romanian or not.&lt;ref name="matras 2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Romani: A Linguistic Introduction  |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2002|isbn=9781139433242 |author=Yaron Matras |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity of the words ''Romani'' and ''Romania'' is a coincidence, they are not etymologically related.

== Classification ==
Vlax Romani is classified in two groups: Vlax I, or Northern Vlax (including [[Kalderash]] and [[Lovari]]), and Vlax II, or Southern Vlax.&lt;ref name=boretzky /&gt;

Elšík&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Elšík |first=Viktor |title=Dialect variation in Romani personal pronouns |url=http://ulug.ff.cuni.cz/lingvistika/elsik/veda/Elsik_2000_Pronouns.pdf |year=1999 |page=2|format=PDF|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses this classification and dialect examples (geographical information from Matras &lt;ref name="matras dialects"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Matras-2002 | reference= Matras, Yaron (2002).

==Writing systems==

Vlax Romani is written using the [[Romani orthography]], which is a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] with several additional characters. In the area of the former [[Soviet Union]] it is also written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ilholocaustmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TheJournies.pdf |title=Journey of Besieged Languages|website=ilholocaustmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
