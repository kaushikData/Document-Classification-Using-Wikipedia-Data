      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="833">'''Bayport''' is the city used as the setting in the [[Hardy Boys]] novels. In the books it is located on [[Barmet Bay]], a horseshoe-shaped inlet three miles from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the [[Northeastern United States]].  It is the residence of [[Fenton Hardy (The Hardy Boys)|The Hardy family]] and [[Chet Morton|The Morton Family]].

Most books are intentionally vague about what [[U.S. state|state]] Bayport is in, though ''[[The Castle Conundrum]]'' definitively places it in [[New York (state)|New York]], which does have a [[Bayport, New York|Bayport]] on [[Long Island]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35911">The '''Hittites''', also spelled '''Hethites''', were a group of people mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Under the names {{lang|he|בני-חת}} (''bny-ḥt'' "children of Heth") and {{lang|he|חתי}} (''ḥty'' "native of Heth") they are mentioned several times as living in or near [[Canaan]] since the time of [[Abraham]] (estimated to be between 2000 BC and 1500 BC) to the time of [[Ezra]] after the return from the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian exile]] (around 450 BC). Their ancestor  [[Heth (Bible)|Heth]] ({{Hebrew Name|חֵת|H̱et|Ḥēṯ}}, ''ḥt'' in the consonant-only [[Hebrew script]]) is said in Genesis to be a son of [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]], son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], son of [[Noah]].

In the late 19th century, the biblical Hittites were identified with a newly discovered [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking empire  of [[Anatolia]], a major regional power through most of the 2nd millennium BC, who therefore came to be known as the [[Hittites]]. This nomenclature is used today as a matter of convention, regardless of debates about possible identities between the Anatolian Hittite Empire and the biblical Hittites.

==Identification hypotheses==

According to Genesis, the Hittite Ephron sold [[Abraham]] the [[Cave of the Patriarchs|cave of Machpelah]] in [[Hebron]] for use as a family tomb. Later, Esau married wives from the Hittites. In the [[Book of Joshua]] 1:4, when the Lord tells Joshua "From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border", this "land of the Hittites" on Canaan's border is seen to stretch between Lebanon and the Euphrates, and from there toward the setting Sun (i.e., to the west).

According to the [[Book of Judges]] 1:26, when the Israelites captured [[Bethel]], they allowed one man to escape, and he went to the "land of the Hittites" where he founded the settlement of Luz. In King Solomon's era moreover the Hittites are depicted in the Old Testament along with Syria as among his powerful neighbors.

From around 1900, archaeologists were aware of a country established in Anatolia and known to Assyrians as "Hatti". Because it was initially assumed that the people of ''Hatti'' were identical to the ''Hetti'' of the Hebrew Bible, the term Hittite Empire is still today used to describe the Anatolian state.  Their language is known to have been a member of the Indo-European family. Because its speakers were originally based in Kanesh, they called their language "Neshili". The former inhabitants of Hatti and Hattusas are now called ''Hattites''; and their [[Hattic language]] was not Indo-European, but is of unknown linguistic relationship.

After the fall of the Hittite Empire around 1178 BC, a remnant of them, still using the name "people of Hatti", established some city-states in the region of northern Syria. Therefore these are usually assumed to be the Hittites mentioned in Solomon's time. 

===The case for identity===
Some scholars take the view that the two peoples are identical.&lt;ref name=Mendenhall1973&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendenhall|first=George|title=The Tenth Generation: The Origins of the Biblical Tradition|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1973|isbn=0-8018-1654-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the similarity in names, the Anatolian Hittites were a powerful political entity in the region before the collapse of their empire in the 14th-12th centuries BC, so one would expect them to be mentioned in the Bible, just in the way that the ''ḤTY'' post-Exodus are.  A stone [[lion]] relief found at [[Beth Shan]], near the [[Sea of Galilee]] (now at the [[Israel Museum]]), dated to about 1700 BC, has been interpreted by professor Bill Humble as confirming this identification, since lions are often pictured in Hittite art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knls.org/English/trascripts/humble03.htm Humble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621164708/http://knls.org/English/trascripts/humble03.htm |date=2006-06-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the account of the conquest of Canaan, the Hittites are said to dwell "in the mountains" and "towards the north" of Canaan &amp;mdash; a description that matches the general direction and geography of the original Hittite empire, which had been influential in the region prior to the [[Battle of Kadesh]].

Modern academics propose, based on much [[onomastic]] and archaeological evidence, that Anatolian populations moved south into Canaan as part of the waves of [[Sea Peoples]] who were migrating along the Mediterranean coastline at the time of the collapse of the Hittite Empire. Many kings of local city-states are shown to have had Hittite and [[Luwian]] names in the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze]] to [[Iron Age|Early Iron Age]] transition period. Indeed, even the name of Mount [[Zion]] may be Hittite in origin.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall1973"/&gt;

===The case for separation===
Because of the perceived discrepancy between the picture of the Hittites as developed in the Bible and the archaeological discoveries, some biblical scholars reject [[Archibald Sayce]]'s identification of the two peoples, and believe that the similarity in names is only a coincidence. For example [[E. A. Speiser]], referring to "the children of Heth" in the [[Book of Genesis]] writes "For reasons of both history and geography, it is most unlikely that this group name has any direct connection either with the Hattians of Anatolia or with their 'Hittite' successors."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Speiser |first=E. A. |authorlink=Ephraim Avigdor Speiser |title= Genesis: Introduction, Translation and Notes  |series=The [[Anchor Bible]] |volume=1 |year= 1964 |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Co.|isbn= 0-385-00854-6|pages= 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermediate hypotheses===
[[Trevor Bryce]] suggests that biblical references to Hittites may be separated into two distinct groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Kingdom of the Hittites|last= Bryce|first= Trevor|authorlink= Trevor Bryce|year= 1998|publisher= Clarendon Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-814095-9|pages=389–391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first, the majority, are to a Canaanite tribe as encountered by Abraham and his family. The names of these Hittites are for the most part of a Semitic type; for example &lt;u&gt;Ephron&lt;/u&gt; at {{bibleverse||Genesis|23:8-17|HE}} etc., &lt;u&gt;Judith&lt;/u&gt; at {{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34|HE}} and &lt;u&gt;Zohar&lt;/u&gt; at {{bibleverse||Genesis|23:8|HE}}. These were presumably the Hittites who were subject to [[Solomon]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-2|HE}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:20-21|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|8:7|HE}}) and who were elsewhere in conflict with the Israelites ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:17|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|3:5|HE}}). They were a small group living in the hills, and clearly to be distinguished from the Hittites of the Anatolian Kingdom.

But there are other biblical references which are not compatible with the notion of a small Canaanite hill tribe. Most notable among these is {{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:6|HE}}: "For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us."

This conveys the impression that the Hittite kings were commensurate in importance and power with the Egyptian pharaohs. A similar impression is conveyed by {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|1:17|HE}}: "And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means." In these cases there can be little doubt that the references are to the [[neo-Hittite]] kingdoms of Syria.

If the references to the Canaanite tribe are distinct from those to the neo-Hittite kingdom, the similarity between the names (only two significant consonants) could easily be due to chance.

==List of Biblical references==

===Source and ordering of citations===

Listed below are all the occurrences of the words "Heth", "Hittite" or "Hittites" in the King James Bible, found through a [[University of Virginia]] search service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/kjv.browse.html University of Virginia].&lt;/ref&gt;
The same information is available in book form in Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names|first=Alfred|last=Jones|origyear=1856|year=1990|publisher=Kregel Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The citations were arranged approximately in chronological order, more precisely according to the epoch in which the events in question are supposed to have occurred. Note that this is not always the time in which the words were actually written. (In particular, the covenant with Abraham about the future conquest of Canaan is sorted as if it were contemporary with the latter.) The epochs are indicated by the names of the biblical characters (Patriarchs, Judges, Kings or Prophets) prominent at the time.

===From Noah to Abraham===

The biblical view of the genetic relationships among humanity is set forth in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]:10, where various peoples are described as different lines of descent from [[Noah]]. In particular, [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] is one of the sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], who is also said to be the ancestor of the [[Egyptians]], and the [[Philistines]].  The sons of Canaan are given as [[Sidon]], Heth, then the [[Jebusite]]s, [[Amorite]]s, [[List of minor biblical tribes#Girgashites|Girgasites]], [[Hivite]]s, [[List of minor biblical tribes#Arkites|Arkites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Sinites|Sinites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Arvadites|Arvadites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Zemarites|Zemarites]], and the [[List of minor biblical tribes#Hamathites|Hamathites]].

====Noah====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|10:1|HE}} Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and [[Japheth]]: and unto them were sons born after the flood. [...] 6 And the sons of Ham; [[Biblical Cush|Cush]], and [[Mizraim]], and [[Phut]], and Canaan. 7 And the sons of Cush; [[List of minor biblical figures#Seba|Seba]], and [[Havilah]], and [[Sabtah]], and [[Raamah]], and [[Sabtecha]]: and the sons of Raamah; [[Sheba]], and [[Dedanites|Dedan]]. 8 And Cush begat [[Nimrod]] [...] 10 And the beginning of his kingdom was [[Babylon|Babel]], and [[Erech]], and [[Accad]], [...]. 13 And Mizraim begat [[Ludim]], and [[Anamim]], and [[Lehabim]], and [[Naphtuhim]], 14 And [[Pathrusim]], and [[Casluhim]], (out of whom came [[Philistim]],) and [[Caphtorim]]. 15 And Canaan begat [[Sidon]] his firstborn, and &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, 16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to [[Gerar]], unto [[Gaza City|Gaza]]; as thou goest, unto [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom, and Gomorrah]], and [[Admah]], and [[Zeboim (biblical)|Zeboim]], even unto [[Lasha]]. 20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
*{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:13|HE}} And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, [...]

===From Abraham to Egypt===
In this period, which is conjectured to start sometime after 2000 BC and end sometime before 1200 BC, the "children of Heth" (בני-חת, ''BNY-HT'') and the label "Hittite" (''HTY'') are mentioned multiple times, but referring to essentially only two events.

In {{bibleverse||Genesis|23:2|HE}}, towards the end of Abraham's life, he was staying in Hebron, on lands belonging to the "children of Heth", and from them he obtained a plot of land with a cave to bury his wife [[Sarah]]. One of them ([[Ephron]]) is labeled "the Hittite", several times. This deal is mentioned three more times (with almost the same words), upon the deaths of Abraham and Jacob.

Decades later, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34|HE}}, Abraham's grandson Esau is said to have taken two Hittite wives, and a Hivite one. This claim is repeated, with somewhat different names, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|36:2|HE}}. In {{bibleverse||Genesis|27:46|HE}}, [[Rebekah]] is worried that [[Jacob]] will do the same.

====Abraham====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|23:2|HE}} And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, saying, 4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 5 And the children of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt; answered Abraham, saying unto him, 6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;. 8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;: and Ephron the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt; answered Abraham in the audience of the children of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. [...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;.
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:8|HE}} Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, which is before Mamre; 10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

====Esau and Jacob====
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|26:34|HE}} And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;: 35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|27:46|HE}} And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|36:2|HE}} Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|49:29|HE}} And he [Jacob] charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt; 30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt; for a possession of a buryingplace. 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of &lt;u&gt;Heth&lt;/u&gt;.
*{{bibleverse||Genesis|50:13|HE}} For his [Jacob] sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephron the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, before Mamre.

This passage refers to Jacob being buried in Machpelah. Joseph was buried in Shechem Joshua 24.32 "And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."

===Exodus and the conquest of Canaan===

This period is conjectured to start sometime after 1800 BC and end sometime before 1000 BC. In this period (in which can be included the promise made to Abraham, centuries earlier, and its recall by [[Nehemiah]] half a millennium later), the Hittites are mentioned about a dozen times as part of an almost fixed formula that lists the "seven nations greater and mightier than [the Hebrews]" whose lands will be eventually conquered. Five other "major nations" are mentioned in almost all instances of the formula: [[Canaan]]ites, [[Amorites]], [[Hivites]], [[Jebusites]], and [[Perizzites]].  The [[Girgashites]] are mentioned only five times.  Abraham's covenant in {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18|HE}} omits the [[Hivites]] but includes the [[Kadmonites]], [[Kenites]], [[Kenizzite]]s, and [[Rephaim]].

Among the five references to the Hittites that cannot be classified as a variant of that formula, two ({{bibleverse||Numbers|13:29|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Joshua|11:3|HE}}) declare that the Hittites "dwell in the mountains", together with the [[Jebusites]], [[Amorites]], and [[Perizzites]], whereas the Canaanites live "on the east and on the west", on the coast of Jordan, and the [[Amalekites]] live "in the south". In {{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|HE}} the land of the Hittites is said to extend "from the wilderness and this Lebanon", from "the Euphrates unto the great sea".  In {{bibleverse||Judges|1:18|HE}}, the traitor from Bethel who led the Hebrews into the city is said to have gone to live among the Hittites where he built a city called Luz. Finally in {{bibleverse||Judges|3:5|HE}} it is said that the Hebrew lived and intermarried with the Hittites as well as with the other five "major nations".

====Abraham's covenant====

*{{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18|HE}} In the same day the {{LORD}} made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 20 And the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
*{{bibleverse||Nehemiah|9:8|HE}} And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

====Moses====

*{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:17|HE}} But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the [[Amorites]], the Canaanites, and the [[Perizzites]], the [[Hivites]], and the [[Jebusites|Jebusite]]; as the {{LORD}} thy God hath commanded thee:
*{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:1|HE}} When the {{LORD}} thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;

====Joshua====

*{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:8|HE}} And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. [...] 17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
*{{bibleverse||Exodus|13:5|HE}} And it shall be when the {{LORD}} shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
*{{bibleverse||Exodus|23:23|HE}} For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. [...] 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, from before thee.
*{{bibleverse||Exodus|33:2|HE}} And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
*{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:11|HE}} Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
*{{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|HE}} From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
*{{bibleverse||Joshua|11:3|HE}} And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
*{{bibleverse||Joshua|12:8|HE}} In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
*{{bibleverse||Joshua|24:11|HE}} And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

*{{bibleverse||Joshua|9:1|HE}} And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof.

====Judges====

*{{bibleverse||Judges|1:18|HE}} Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 19 And the {{LORD}} was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. [...] 21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. 22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the {{LORD}} was with them. 23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) 24 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy. 25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family. 26 And the man went into the land of the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day. 27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
*{{bibleverse||Judges|3:1|HE}} Now these are the nations which the {{LORD}} left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 3 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 4 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the {{LORD}}, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 5 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 6 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the {{LORD}}, and forgat the {{LORD}} their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 8 Therefore the anger of the {{LORD}} was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.

===Kingdoms period===

In this period the Hittites are mentioned as the ethnic label of two soldiers under king David (around 1000 BC), [[Ahimelech]] and [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter is murdered by David for the sake of his wife [[Bathsheba]].

In Solomon's reign (around 950 BC), the Hittites are listed as people whom the Hebrews had not been able "utterly to destroy" in their conquest of Canaan and who paid tribute to Israel.  The kings of the Hittites are mentioned (in two similar passages), together with Egypt and the kings of [[Syria]], as senders of lavish tribute to Solomon. Then Hittites are said to be among the "strange women" that Solomon loved, along with "the daughter of the pharaoh" and women from the other peoples in the region.

In the time of the prophet [[Elisha]] (around 850 BC) there is a passage in 2Kings 7:6 where the Syrians flee in the night after hearing a terrible noise of horses and chariots, believing that Israel had hired "the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians".

====Saul====

*{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|26:5|HE}} And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him. 6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

====David====

*{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:8|HE}}  These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: [...] 39 Uriah the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;: thirty and seven in all.
*{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|11:10|HE}} These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the {{LORD}} concerning Israel. [...] 41 Uriah the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
*{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11:3|HE}} And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;? 4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. ["Uriah the Hittite" named 4 more times in this chapter.]
*{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:9|HE}} [Nathan:] Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the {{LORD}}, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt; with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt; to be thy wife.
*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|15:5|HE}} Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the {{LORD}}, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;.

====Solomon====

*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:20|HE}} And all the people that were left of the Amorites, &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, 21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
*{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|8:7|HE}} As for all the people that were left of the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:28|HE}} And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
*{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|1:16|HE}} And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.
*{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1|HE}} But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;; 2 Of the nations concerning which the {{LORD}} said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the {{LORD}} his God, as was the heart of David his father. 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the {{LORD}}, and went not fully after the {{LORD}}, as did David his father. 7 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

====Elisha====
*{{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:6|HE}} For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

===Babylonian exile and return===

In Ezekiel 16:1, [[Jerusalem]] is said to be the daughter of a Hittite mother and an Amorite father, sister of [[Samaria]] and [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. The intent is clearly offensive, but it is not clear whether the reference to the Hittites is concrete or only symbolic.  However, a century later, Ezra is dismayed to learn, on his arrival from [[Babylon]], that the leaders who had remained on the land had been "polluted" by mixing with other people, including the Hittites.

====Ezekiel====

*{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:1|HE}} Again the word of the {{LORD}} came unto me, saying, 2 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 3 And say, Thus saith the Lord {{GOD}} unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;. [...] 44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. 45 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an &lt;u&gt;Hittite&lt;/u&gt;, and your father an Amorite. 46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

====Ezra====

*{{bibleverse|1|Esdras|8:3}} (Apocrypha) This Esdras went up from Babylon, as a scribe, being very ready in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel. 4 And the king [Artaxerxes] did him honour: for he found grace in his sight in all his requests. 5 There went up with him also certain of the children of Israel, of the priest of the Levites, of the holy singers, porters, and ministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem, [...]  68 Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, and said, 69 The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.
*{{bibleverse||Ezra|9:1|HE}} Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the &lt;u&gt;Hittites&lt;/u&gt;, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

'''Cave-In-Rock''' is a village in [[Hardin County, Illinois|Hardin County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. Its principal feature and [[tourist attraction]] is nearby [[Cave-in-Rock State Park|Cave-In-Rock]], on the banks of the [[Ohio River]]. In 1816, the earliest known permanent white settlers arrived and started building a town near the cave. The town was originally known as Rock and Cave, Illinois, with a post office under this name. On October 24, 1849, the town was officially renamed Cave-In-Rock. Cave-In-Rock was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Hardin County, Illinois Tourism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hardincountyil.org/history.htm |publisher=|accessdate=|date=|title=Hardin County Illinois Online: History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=names+for+cave-in-rock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo6J-BvenXAhWidN8KHQekAjIQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=names%20for%20cave-in-rock&amp;f=false|last1=Callary |first1=Edward |title=Place Names of Illinois |location=Urbana, IL |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2010 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 318 at the 2010 census.&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1711826| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Cave-In-Rock village, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cave==

[[File:Keelboat and flatboat.jpg|thumb|River pirates were some of the earliest settlers around Cave-in-Rock who preyed on the [[Ohio River]] [[flatboat]]s, [[keelboat]]s, and [[raft]]s, as profitable targets of goods, attacking the crews and pioneers who were easily overwhelmed and killed.]]

Cave-in-Rock's primary feature is a striking {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} riverside cave formed by wind and water erosion and by cataclysmic effects of the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]]. The cave is located at {{coord|37|28|07|N|88|09|21|W}}, just upriver (east) from the village. The first European to come across it was M. de Lery of France, who found it in 1739 and called it "''caverne dans Le Roc''". Other names for the cave include Rock-In-Cave, Rocking Cave, Rock-and-Cave, House of Nature, The Cave, Big Cave, and [[John Murrell (bandit)|Murrell]]'s Cave. The cave is the main feature of Illinois' [[Cave-in-Rock State Park]], established in 1929.&lt;ref name=DNR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R5/CAVEROCK.HTM |title=Cave-In-Rock - State Park |publisher=Illinois Department of Natural Resources |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402203142/http://dnr.state.il.us/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R5/CAVEROCK.HTM |archivedate=2007-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From the 1790s to the 1870s, the area around Cave-in-Rock was plagued by what historians as early as the 1830s referred to as the "Ancient Colony of Horse-Thieves, Counterfeiters and Robbers", and better known today due to Otto Rothert's history early in the 20th century as the "Outlaws of Cave-in-Rock".

In 1790, counterfeiters [[Philip Alston (counterfeiter)|Philip Alston]] and [[John Duff (counterfeiter)|John Duff]] (or John McElduff) used the cave as some type of rendezvous, though details are scarce. Although folklore printed in 19th century histories failed to establish a prior connection between the two men, both had lived in the area of [[Natchez, Mississippi]], at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

Duff was living upriver a few miles, either at Battery Rock or across the Ohio River at what would become [[Caseyville, Kentucky]], when in 1797 [[Samuel Mason]] moved his base of operations from [[Diamond Island (Kentucky)|Diamond Island]] and [[Henderson, Kentucky|Red Banks]] to the cave and made it the home of river pirates. Two of Mason's brothers had been business partners of Duff in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], in the 1780s. Mason created a combination [[tavern]], [[casino|gambling den]], [[brothel]], and criminal refuge.&lt;ref name=DNR/&gt; His men lured in gullible river travelers and then robbed and killed them.&lt;ref name=DNR/&gt;

James Wilson, also known as Bully Wilson, may actually have been an [[Pseudonym|alias]] for Samuel Mason, the next leader of the gang after Mason's hasty departure, or possibly the front man for Mason's operation. He may be the Wilson who married one of Mason's nieces. In 1799, he hung a sign over the cave's entrance saying "Wilson's Liquor Vault and House for Entertainment".

By this time, Duff and his associates had been making salt (or looking for [[silver]]) in the area around the [[Illinois Salines]] along the [[Saline River (Illinois)|Saline River]] in southeastern Illinois. A [[detachment (military)|detachment]] from the [[U.S. Army]] [[garrison]] at [[Fort Massac]], down river from Cave-In-Rock, captured him and three of his men, Blakely, Hazle and Hall. The soldiers took their prisoners by boat down the Saline River to the Ohio River, intending to return to the fort. Old histories do not explain why they stopped at the cave. Subsequent events suggest it took place during the spring of 1799, when Wilson was in business, making it a stop for entertainment. Duff and his men escaped and overpowered the soldiers. They tied them up, put them in a boat, and pushed it into the river to float downstream to the fort. On June 4, 1799, the [[company commander|commandant]] of Fort Massac, Captain Zebulon Pike, Sr., father of the future explorer of [[Pikes Peak]], hired a [[French Canadian]] [[coureur de bois]] and three [[Shawnee]] warriors to assassinate Duff, which they did.

The infamous [[Harpe brothers]] also reached the cave region in the spring of 1799.&lt;ref name=DNR/&gt; They are associated with two separate stories at the cave and one at the infamous Potts Spring area to the north. The first story has them pushing a young couple off the top of the cliff above the cave. They survived. The second was an act of piracy in which only one man survived. Later, he was forced off the cliff as well, this time involving the man being tied down to a horse. Neither survived. The Potts Spring story is recalled as a murder of two or three hunters. This Harpe murder site within twenty years would become the future location of the legendary [[Potts Inn]], which was presumed to be a human death trap for unsuspecting travelers along the [[Ford's Ferry High Water Road]], an early frontier highway, who wanted to spend the night for food and lodging.

Mason and Wilson's time at the cave may have come to an end during the summer of 1799, when they were attacked by a group of [[bounty hunter]]s/[[vigilante]]s under the leadership of Captain Young calling themselves "The Exterminators". No contemporary accounts attest to river pirates occupying the cave in the first decade of the 19th century. The Harpes retreated back into Kentucky, while Mason traveled downriver and began to focus on highway robbery along the [[Natchez Trace]].

The next generation of outlaws in the region sprang either from the [[Sturdivant Gang]], a group of counterfeiters based at [[Sturdivant Fort]], on top of the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River at what is now [[Rosiclare, Illinois]]; or the [[Ford's Ferry Gang]] led by [[James Ford (pirate)|James Ford]], based a few miles upriver from the cave at what became known as Ford's Ferry, Kentucky. Law enforcement officials led three raids against Sturdivant Fort in 1822 and 1823. Although it is not clear what happened following the raids, the gang had disappeared from the area by 1830. The Ford's Ferry Gang was broken up following the mysterious deaths or murders of James Ford's two sons, followed by his own assassination in 1833.

Even after the death of Ford, outlaws remained. [[Isaiah L. Potts]] operated Potts Inn on the Ford's Ferry High Water Road in Illinois north of the cave. Travelers checked in, but sometimes failed to check out. This presumed frontier hotel was very similar to the [[Bloody Benders]]' Wayside Inn, which appeared fifty years later in [[Labette County, Kansas]]. The legend of [[Billy Potts]], the returning son who was murdered unknowingly by his father, likely took place in the months following Ford's assassination. This tragic story of [[poetic justice]] has taken on [[folklore|folklorish]] proportions. Records show the elder Potts and his wife separated in 1834 or 1835.

Eson Bigsby (the first name sometimes spelled "Eason" or "Enos" and the last name sometimes spelled "Bixby") took up counterfeiting in Hardin County in the decades following the Sturdivants. His attack on his wife Anna in an effort to find out where her first husband's money was buried dates to the early 1860s and led to the legends of Anna Bixby, her treasure and her ghost. She survived running off a cliff in the dark. She is the namesake of the [[Anna Bixby Women's Center]] in nearby [[Harrisburg, Illinois]].

Although not completely connected to the "Ancient Colony", Logan Belt and the Logan Belt Gang terrorized Hardin County in the 1870s and 1880s, until Belt was assassinated.

[[File:Cave-in-Rock Ferry loading.jpg|thumb|Loading a vehicle onto the [[Cave-In-Rock Ferry]] in 2013]]
In the middle of the 1800s, church services were being held in the cave. This earliest Christian [[local church|congregation]] eventually formed the Big Creek [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] Church. Founded in 1807, it was the first church organized in southeastern Illinois. Cave-In-Rock incorporated in 1839, in the same year that Hardin County was created from a section of [[Pope County, Illinois|Pope County]].

According to the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]], "in 1929, the State of Illinois acquired {{convert|64.5|acre}} for a park that since has increased to {{convert|204|acres}}. The well-wooded, {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} hills and the rugged bluffs along the river—commanding expansive views of the famous waterway—became [[Cave-in-Rock State Park|Cave-In-Rock State Park]]".&lt;ref name=DNR/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In Walt Disney's ''[[Davy Crockett and the River Pirates]]'', [[Davy Crockett]] and [[Mike Fink]] anachronistically fight Sam Mason and his pirates. Also, at Walt Disney World's [[Magic Kingdom]], there is a scene called "Cut-Throat Corner" and "Wilson's Cave Inn" that can be seen on the bank of the [[Rivers of America (Disney)|Rivers of America]] while riding the [[Mark Twain Riverboat|''Liberty Belle'' Riverboat]] around [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island|Tom Sawyer's Island]]. This scene is based upon the real life Cave-In-Rock and the activity of river pirates during that time period.

A scene of the MGM classic ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' was filmed at the cave as well as at Battery Rock.&lt;ref name=DNR/&gt; In 1997, [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] show ''In Search of History'' filmed at the site for an episode entitled "River Pirates".

The "ninth book" of Christopher Ward's 1932 novel ''The Strange Adventures of Jonathan Drew; A Rolling Stone'' is titled "Cave-In-Rock". The action is set in 1824. Jonathan rescues two slaves duped into running away and working for a gang of dangerous outlaws who use Cave-In-Rock as their base of operations.

L. A. Meyer's novel ''[[Mississippi Jack]]'' features the heroine leading an anachronistic raid against river pirates as an homage to the aforementioned Davy Crockett episode.

In 2009, artist [[Greg Stimac]] photographed Cave-In-Rock's cave for his series of outlaw hideouts. In 2013, his photograph "Ancient Colony of Horse-Thieves, Counterfeiters and Robbers" was included in ''The Seven Borders'', an exhibition curated by Joey Yates at the [[Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft]].&lt;ref name="Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentuckyarts.org/the-7-borders/ |title=The Seven Borders, Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft_BLOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4materiality.wordpress.com/2013/08/ |title=Take Me to the River, Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft BLOG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greg Stimac's official website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gregstimac.com/#/work:16:hideout/media:275:ancient-colony-of... |title=Outlaw hideouts, Greg Stimac's official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is a gallery of the flags of the principal subdivisions of the countries and territories of [[Oceania]].  For purposes of this article, Oceania is taken to comprise [[Australasia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]].

The principal subdivisions are generally the ones that are identified as first-order subdivisions under the [[ISO 3166-2]] coding scheme.  If a country has no such first-order subdivisions, but has second-order subdivisions that have their own official flags, then the flags of those second-order subdivisions are given here.

This gallery includes only current official flags.  For historical or non-official flags of any particular country or territory (if any), see the main article for that country or territory.

Unless indicated otherwise, information on each country has been taken from the ''[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]'', as updated through July 11, 2016 (for which see the External Links section, below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/|website=cia.gov|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australasia==

===Australia===
{{Main article|List of Australian flags#States and territories}}
{{See also|States and territories of Australia}}

[[Australia]] comprises six states and two territories, as well as several dependant islands located in the Indian and Pacific oceans.

The official flag for each of the six states consists of the Australian national flag, but with the stars removed and replaced with the state's coat of arms.

Most of the dependent areas (sometimes called the "external territories") have no official flag of their own and instead use the Australian national flag.  Three external territories do have their own official flags–[[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and [[Norfolk Island]].

===New Zealand===
{{main article|List of New Zealand flags}}
{{See also|Regions of New Zealand}}
{{See also|Realm of New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] has sixteen first-level administrative subdivisions.  Eleven of them are governed by regional authorities; the other five are governed by unitary authorities (which combine the roles of regional and territorial governance).  The [[Chatham Islands]] lie outside any of the sixteen regions, but collectively possess some of the governing authority of a region.  Most of these seventeen authorities have not adopted official flags.

The Realm of New Zealand includes two non-self-governing territories, one of which ([[Tokelau]]) has its own official flag.  The other, the [[Ross Dependency]], does not.  It also includes the two island nations that are in [[associated state#States in a formal association|free association]] with New Zealand–the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]].  Their official flags are shown here.

===French Polynesia===
{{see also|Administrative divisions of French Polynesia}}
[[French Polynesia]] is an overseas [[collectivity]] of France.  It consists of six archipelagos: the [[Austral Islands]], the [[Gambier Islands]], the [[Marquesas Islands]], the [[Tuamotus|Tuāmotu Islands]], plus the [[Leeward Islands]] and the [[Windward Islands]] (the last two collectively formerly known as the [[Society Islands]]).  Although French Polynesia has no first-order administrative subdivisions within the meaning of the [[ISO 3166-2]] coding scheme, there are five second-order subdivisions that correspond to each of the archipelagos, except that the Gambier and Tuāmotu Islands are combined into a single administrative division.  None of these divisions has adopted an official flag.  However, a 1985 territorial decree permits the official use, alongside the French [[Flag of France|tricolour]] and the French Polynesian flag, of the official flag of the archipelago on which the flags are displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Territorial Flag|website=presidence.pf|url=http://www.presidence.pf/index.php?88|archive-date=February 17, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030217024916/http://www.presidence.pf/index.php?88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the archipelagos have adopted such official flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Polynesie Francaise - Histoire et Culture|publisher=Embassy of French Polynesia in China|archive-date=April 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406011131/http://www.tahitinui.cn/fr/1_2_3.htm|website=tahitinui.cn|url=http://www.tahitinui.cn/fr/1_2_3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two that have not are the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands.

Several [[space exploration]] missions are scheduled to occur in the future. The purpose of most of these missions is to launch [[spacecraft]] into space, providing information on nearby planets, asteroids, and other features in outer-space. In addition, [[astronomers]] are trying to figure out ways to make [[manned space exploration]] possible for large amounts of time, so that humans may be able to safely travel far away from Earth in the future.

== Missions ==
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}

=== Mars ===

==== Mars 2020 rover ====
{{Main|Mars 2020 rover}}
The Mars 2020 rover, part of NASA’s [[Mars Exploration Program]], is scheduled to launch in July/August 2020.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mars2020/overview|title=Mars 2020 Mission Overview|last=Perez|first=Martin|date=2016-07-15|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mission will collect samples for future return to Earth to provide insight on the possibility of life on Mars. It will seek for signs of past microbial life and habitable conditions while also collecting information on resources for future astronauts.The Mars 2020 rover will collect core samples and put them in a cache for future missions to retrieve for testing. Furthermore, the rover will test a method for producing oxygen from the atmosphere on Mars, characterize environmental conditions, and identify other resources for future astronauts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== InSight ====
{{Main|InSight}}
Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (''InSight''), part of NASA’s [[Discovery Program]], was launched in May 2018. It plans to study Mars’ interior to investigate the history of the evolution of this planet to provide insight on the evolutionary processes of all the rocky planets in the inner solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/insight/overview/index.html|title=Mission Overview|last=Greicius|first=Tony|date=2015-02-23|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Mars is less geologically active, it has more extensive signs of early terrestrial planet formation. The data collected will help scientists understand Mars’ history, which will provide information on the forces that shaped Earth.

=== Asteroids ===
{{main|Exploration of the asteroids}}
An article in science magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, "a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit"; second, "extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars"; and finally, "developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin." Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure.

Lucy has two close Earth flybys before encountering its Trojan targets. After 2033, Lucy will continue cycling between the two Trojan clouds every six years.]]

==== ''Lucy'' ====
{{Main|Lucy (spacecraft)}}
''Lucy'', part of NASA's Discovery Program, is scheduled to launch in October 2021 to explore six [[Jupiter trojan|Trojan Asteroids]] and a [[Asteroid belt|Main Belt asteroid]]. The two Trojan swarms ahead of and behind Jupiter are thought to be dark bodies made of the same material as the outer planets that were pulled into orbit near Jupiter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/04/nasas-newest-missions-will-explore-the-solar-systems-asteroids/|title=NASA’s newest missions will explore the solar system’s asteroids|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2017-01-04|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lucy'' will be the first mission to study the Trojans, and scientists hope the findings from this mission will revolutionize our knowledge of the formation of the solar system. For this reason, the project is named after [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], a fossilized hominid that provided insight on the evolution of humans. The asteroids studied are ancient fossils of planet formation which could hold clues to the origins of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/lucy-the-first-mission-to-jupiter-s-trojans|title=Lucy: The First Mission to Jupiter’s Trojans|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2017-04-21|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Psyche'' ====
{{Main|Psyche (spacecraft)}}
The ''Psyche'' spacecraft, part of NASA's Discovery Program, is scheduled to launch at the end of 2022 to [[16 Psyche]], a metallic object in the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/|title=Psyche|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 Psyche is 130 miles (210&amp;nbsp;km) wide, and it is made almost entirely of iron and nickel instead of ice and rock. Because of this unique composition, scientists believe it is the remnants of a planet’s core that lost its exterior through a series of collisions, but it is possible that 16 Psyche is only unmelted material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; NASA hopes to obtain information about planetary formation from directly studying the exposed interior of a planetary body, which would otherwise not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/science/cassini-nasa-missions.html|title=Cassini Is Gone.

==== OSIRIS-REx ====
{{Main|OSIRIS-REx}}
The Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft was launched on September 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/osiris-rex/about|title=About OSIRIS-REx|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2015-02-20|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will travel to [[101955 Bennu|1999 RQ36]] (Bennu) to collect samples of this asteroid because it is believed to be relatively unchanged. Bennu is largely made up of [[chondrule]]s, clumps of molten rock held together by electrostatic and gravitational forces, that have not been altered geologic activity or other reactions, making it a prime example of the early solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/bennus-journey|title=The Long, Strange Trip of Asteroid Bennu|last=Steigerwald|first=Bill|date=2015-02-20|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep space ===

==== TESS ====
{{Main|Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}}The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was launched on April 18, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-planet-hunter-on-its-way-to-orbit|title=NASA Planet Hunter on Its Way to Orbit|date=2018-04-19|website=NASA|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will search for [[exoplanet]]s using the [[Methods of detecting exoplanets|transit method]]. This mission is scheduled to run for two years, and will focus on 200,000 stars near our solar system to find orbiting exoplanets. TESS is on a larger scale than missions before as it will study brighter stars and cover more sky area than the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|2013 Kepler mission]] did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess|title=About TESS|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2016-07-15|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James Webb Space Telescope ====
{{Main|James Webb Space Telescope}}
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is scheduled to launch on March 30, 2021 as a collaboration between NASA, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwst.nasa.gov/about.html|title=About JWST/NASA|website=jwst.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/New_launch_date_for_James_Webb_Space_Telescope|title=New launch date for James Webb Space Telescope|last=Bauer|first=Markus|date=2018-06-28|work=ESA|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror that will serve as the premier observatory of the next decade. It will study the phases of the Universe, providing detailed information on the formation of solar systems and the evolution of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/about/index.html|title=James Webb Telescope Overview|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2015-01-29|work=NASA|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Limitations with deep space exploration  ==
The future possibilities for deep space exploration are currently held back by a set of technical, practical, astronomical, and human limitations, which define the future of manned and unmanned space exploration. As of 2017, the farthest any man-made probe has traveled is the current NASA mission [[Voyager 1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/|title=Voyager - Mission Overview|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently about 13 billion miles (21 billion km), or 19.5 light hours away from the Earth, while the nearest star is around 4.24 light years away.

=== Technical limitations ===
The current status of space-faring technology, including propulsion systems, navigation, resources and storage all present limitations to the development of human space exploration in the near future.

==== Distances ====
The astronomical order of magnitude of the distance between us and the nearest stars is a challenge for the current development of space exploration. At our current top speed of 157,100 miles per hour (70.2&amp;nbsp;km/s), the [[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios 2]] probe would arrive at the nearest star, [[Proxima Centauri]], in around 18,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiredcosmos.com/tag/breakthrough-propulsion-physics-program/|title=Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program {{!}} WiredCosmos|website=wiredcosmos.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; much longer than a human lifespan.

==== Propulsion and fuel ====
[[File:Vasimr.jpg|thumb|220x220px|The VASIMR Plasma based propulsion engine&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;]]
In terms of propulsion, the main challenge is the liftoff and initial momentum, since there is no friction in the vacuum of space. Based on the missions goals, including factors such as distance, load and time of flight, the type of propulsion drive used, planned to use, or in design varies from chemical propellants, such as liquid hydrogen and oxidizer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/multimedia/rs-25-engine-infographic.html|title=What Is The RS-25 Engine?|last=Harbaugh|first=Jennifer|date=2015-08-10|work=NASA|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Space Shuttle main engine|Space Shuttle Main Engine]]), to plasma&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/VASIMR|title=Our Engine {{!}} Ad Astra Rocket|website=www.adastrarocket.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even nanoparticle propellants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31665236/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/near-lightspeed-nano-spacecraft-might-be-close/#.WeX6_GhSw2y|title=Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be close|date=2009-07-08|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Project Longshot configurations.png|left|thumb|Project Longshot Nuclear Fission Engine schematic]]
As for future developments, the theoretical possibilities of nuclear based propulsion have been analyzed over 60 years ago, such as [[nuclear fusion]] ([[Project Daedalus]]) and [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] ([[Project Longshot]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearscience.com/lists/3_canceled_nasa_projects/|title=RealClearScience - Project Longshot|website=www.realclearscience.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have since been discontinued from practical research by NASA. On the more science fiction side, the theoretical [[Alcubierre drive]] presents a mathematical solution for “faster-than-light” travel, but it would require the mass-Energy of Jupiter, not to mention the technical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/09/warp-drive-plausible/|title=Warp Drives Might Be More Realistic Than Thought|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human limitations ===
The human part of manned space exploration add certain physiological and psychological issues and limitations to the future possibilities of space exploration, along with the need for storage and supply of sustenance.

==== Physiological issues ====
The transitioning gravity magnitudes on the body is detrimental to orientation, coordination, and balance. Without constant gravity, bones suffer disuse osteoporosis, and their mineral density falls 12 times faster than the average elderly adult’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/postsecondary/features/F_Bones_in_Space.html|title=NASA - Bones in Space|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Heather Deiss:MSFC, Virtual Astronaut: JSC|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without regular exercise and nourishment, there can be cardiovascular deterioration and loss in muscle strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/39645/16-423JFall-2002/NR/rdonlyres/Aeronautics-and-Astronautics/16-423JSpace-Biomedical-Engineering---Life-SupportFall2002/08BEAFB3-4CCC-479A-956B-5927B6AC935D/0/cardio_background.pdf|title=Cardiovascular Deconditioning in Weightlessness|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehydration can cause [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/renal.html|title=NASA - Renal Stone Risk During Space Flight: Assessment and Countermeasure Validation fact sheet (07/01)|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and constant [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydro-static]] potential in zero-g can shift body fluids upwards and cause vision problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1038.html|title=NASA - Vision Impairment and Intracranial Pressure|website=www.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, without Earth’s surrounding [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]], [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]] has much harsher effects in space. The exposure can include damage to the [[central nervous system]] (altered cognitive function, reduced [[Motor control|motor function]], and behavioral changes) and degenerative tissue diseases.

==== Psychological issues ====
[[File:Biosphere 2 4888964549.jpg|thumb|The Biosphere 2 greenhouse habitat]]
According to NASA, isolation in space can have detrimental effects on the human psyche. Behavioral issues, such as low morale, mood-swings, depression, and decreasing interpersonal interactions, irregular sleeping rhythms, and fatigue occur independently to the level of training, according to a set of NASA's social experiments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/15/psychology-experiment-kept-six-nasa-subjects-isolated-mars-volcano-8-months/669940001/|title=Psychology experiment kept six NASA subjects isolated on a Mars-like volcano for 8 months|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of which, [[Biosphere 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biosphere2.org/visit/what-is-biosphere-2|title=What Is Biosphere 2 {{!}} Biosphere 2|website=biosphere2.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 2 year long, 8 person crew experiment in the 1990s, in an attempt to study human necessities and survival in an isolated environment. The result of which were stressed interpersonal interactions and aloof behavior, including limiting and even ceasing contact between crew members,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; along with failing to sustain a lasting air-recycling system and food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1, 1990|title=Biosphere 2 test module experimentation program|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910004532.pdf|journal=NASA|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resources and sustenance ====
Considering the future possibility of extended, manned missions, food storage and resupply are relevant limitations. From a storage point of view, NASA estimates a 3-year Mars mission would require around 24 thousand pounds (10,000&amp;nbsp;kg) of food, most of it in the form of precooked, dehydrated meals of about 1.5 pounds a portion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html|title=NASA - Human Needs: Sustaining Life During Exploration|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Lindsay Crouch : LaRC|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh produce would only be available in the beginning of the flight, since there would not be refrigeration systems. Water's relative heavy weight is a limitation, so on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) the use of water per person is limited to 11 liters a day, compared to the average Americans' 132 liters.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
[[File:ISS-40 Vegetable Production System (Veggie).jpg|thumb|The ISS "Veggie plant growth system" and Red Romaine Lettuce]]
As for resupply, efforts have been made to recycle, reuse and produce, to make storage more efficient. Water can be produced through chemical reactions of Hydrogen and Oxygen in fuel cells,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and attempts and methods of growing vegetables in micro-gravity are being developed and will continue to be researched. Lettuce has already successfully grown in the [[International Space Station|ISS]]'s "Veggie plant growth system", and has been consumed by the astronauts, even though large-scale plantation is still impractical,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/astronauts-growing-their-own-veggies-in-space-gets-us-closer-to-mars/|title=Those Veggies Grown on the ISS Get Humans Closer to Mars|last=Tonn|first=Shara|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to factors such as pollination, long growth periods, and lack of efficient planting pillows.

== Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Space Craft Development     ==
The idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost, less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers. Autonomy will be a key technology for the future exploration of our solar system, where robotic spacecraft will often be out of communication with their human controllers.

=== Autonomous systems ===
Autonomy is defined by three requirements:
# The ability to make and carry out decisions on their own, based on information on what they sensed from the world and their current state. 
# The ability to interpret the given goal as a list of actions to take. 
# The ability to fail flexibly, meaning they are able to continuously change their actions based on what is happening within their system and their surrounding. 
Currently, there are many projects trying to advance space exploration and space craft development using AI.&lt;ref name="The Future of Aerospace Automation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.robotics.org/blog-article.cfm/The-Future-of-Aerospace-Automation/21|title=The Future of Aerospace Automation|website=Robotics Online|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NASA's autonomous science experiment ====
NASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing-1 (EO-1), which is NASA's first satellite in the millennium program, Earth-observing series launched on November 21, 2000. The autonomy of these satellites is capable of on-board science analysis, re-planning, robust execution, and model-based diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO-1 are analyzed on-board and down linked when a change or interesting event occurs. The ASE software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images. This experiment was the start of many that NASA devised for AI to impact the future of space exploration.

==== Artificial Intelligence Flight Adviser ====
NASA's goal with this project is to develop a system that can aid pilots by giving them real-time expert advice in situations that pilot training does not cover or just aid with a pilot's train of thought during flight. Based on the IBM Watson cognitive computing system, the AI Flight Adviser pulls data from a large database of relevant information like aircraft manuals, accident reports, and close-call reports to give advice to pilots. In the future, NASA wants to implement this technology to create fully autonomous systems, which can then be used for space exploration. In this case, cognitive systems will serve as the basis, and the autonomous system will completely decide on the course of action of the mission, even during unforeseen situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ase.jpl.nasa.gov|title=Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment|website=ase.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for this to happen, there are still many supporting technologies required.

In the future, NASA hopes to use this technology not only in flights on earth, but for future space exploration. Essentially, NASA plans to modify this AI flight Advisor for Longer range applications. In addition to what the technology is now, there will be additional cognitive computing systems that can decide on the right set of actions based upon unforeseen problems in space. However, in order for this to be possible, there are still many supporting technologies that need to be enhanced.

==== Stereo vision for collision avoidance ====
For this project, NASA's goal is to implement stereo vision for collision avoidance in space systems to work with and support autonomous operations in a flight environment. This technology uses two cameras within its operating system that have the same view, but when put together offer a large range of data that gives a binocular image. Because of its duo-camera system, NASA's research indicate that this technology can detect hazards in rural and wilderness flight environments. Because of this project, NASA has made major contributions toward developing a completely autonomous UAV. Currently, Stereo Vision can construct a stereo vision system, process the vision data, make sure the system works properly, and lastly performs tests figuring out the range of impeding objects and terrain. In the future, NASA hopes this technology can also determine the path to avoid collision. The near-term goal for the technology is to be able to extract information from point clouds and place this information in a historic map data. Using this map, the technology could then be able to extrapolate obstacles and features in the stereo data that are not in the map data. This would aid with the future of space exploration where humans can't see moving, impeding objects that may damage the moving space craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/autonomous-systems|title=Autonomous System|last=Obringer|first=Lee|date=2016-06-14|work=NASA|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of AI ===
Autonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions. They would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well. Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth would take too long. Space exploration could provide us with the knowledge of our universe as well as incidentally developing inventions and innovations. Traveling to Mars and farther could lead to advances in medicine, health, longevity, transportation, communications.&lt;ref name="The Future of Aerospace Automation"/&gt;

=== Robotic space craft development ===

==== Energy ====

===== Solar Panels =====
Changes in space craft development will have to account for the increase need of energy for its systems. Spacecrafts that are heading towards the centre of our solar system will have space systems with enhanced solar panel technology because of the abundant solar energy surrounding them. Future spacecraft development will enhance their solar panels to be designed to work more efficiently and be lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/nasa-ai-will-lead-the-future-of-space-exploration/|title=NASA: AI Will Lead the Future of Space Exploration|date=2017-06-27|work=Futurism|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators =====
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators are solid-state devices which have no moving parts. They generate heat from the radioactive decay of elements such as plutonium and have a typical lifespan of more than 30 years. In the future, this atomic way of providing energy for spacecrafts will be modified to be lighter and last longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160119-what-will-power-tomorrows-spacecraft|title=What will power tomorrow’s spacecraft?|last=Allison|first=Peter Ray|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Paraguay]]''' is a [[landlocked country]] in South America, bordering [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Bolivia]]. The [[Paraguay River]] (Spanish: ''Río Paraguay'') divides the country into strikingly different eastern and western regions. Both the eastern region (officially called Eastern Paraguay, ''Paraguay Oriental'', and known as the Paraneña region) and the western region (officially Western Paraguay, ''Paraguay Occidental'', and known as the Chaco) gently slope toward and are drained into the Paraguay River, which separates and unifies the two regions. With the Paraneña region reaching southward and the Chaco extending to the north, Paraguay straddles the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] and experiences both [[Subtropics|subtropical]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] climates.

==Borders==
Paraguay borders on three substantially larger countries: Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina. The definition of the northwestern boundary with Bolivia, extending through the low hills of the Chaco region, dates from 1938. The boundary between the Chaco and Brazil was defined in 1927; it continues from the confluence of the [[Apa River]] (''Río Apa'') and Paraguay River northward along the course of the Río Paraguay to the border with Bolivia. The northern border of the Paraneña region, set in 1872, follows the course of the [[Paraná River]] (''Río Paraná''), the [[ridge]]s of the mountains in the northeast region, and finally the course of the Apa River until it empties into the Paraguay River. Paraguay's southern border with Argentina comprises the [[Pilcomayo River]] (''Río Pilcomayo''), Paraná River, and Paraguay River. Argentina and Paraguay agreed on these boundaries in 1876.

==Natural regions==
[[Image:Cordillera de Paraguari.jpg|thumb|300px|Hills around [[Paraguarí]]]]
Paraguay falls into two main [[natural region]]s: the Paraneña region (a mixture of [[plateau]]s, rolling hills, and valleys) and the Chaco region (an immense [[Foothills|piedmont plain]]).

About 95 percent of Paraguay's population resides in the Paraneña region, which has all the significant [[Orography|orographic]] features and a more predictable climate. The Paraneña region can be generally described as consisting of an area of highlands in the east that slopes toward the Río Paraguay and becomes an area of lowlands, subject to floods, along the river.

The Chaco consists predominantly of lowlands, also inclined toward the Río Paraguay, that are alternately flooded and parched.

===The Eastern Region: Paraneña===
The Eastern region extends from the Río Paraguay eastward to the Río Paraná, which forms the border with Brazil and Argentina. The eastern hills and mountains, an extension of a plateau in southern Brazil, dominate the region. They reach to about {{convert|700|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level at their highest point. The Eastern region also has spacious [[plain]]s, broad valleys, and [[lowland]]s. About 80% of the region lies below {{convert|300|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation; the lowest elevation, {{convert|60|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, occurs in the extreme south at the confluence of the Río Paraguay and Río Paraná. 

The Eastern region is drained primarily by rivers that flow westward to the Río Paraguay, although some rivers flow eastward to the Río Paraná. Low-lying [[meadow]]s, subject to floods, separate the eastern mountains from the Río Paraguay.

The Eastern region as a whole naturally divides into five physiographic subregions:

# the Paraná Plateau
# the Northern Upland
# the Central Hill Belt
# the Central Lowland
# the Ñeembucú Plain

In the east, the heavily wooded Paraná Plateau occupies one-third of the region and extends its full length from north to south and up to {{convert|145|km|mi|0|sp=us}} westward from the Brazilian and Argentine borders. The Paraná Plateau's western edge is defined by an escarpment that descends from an elevation of about {{convert|460|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in the north to about {{convert|180|m|ft|0|sp=us}} at the subregion's southern extremity. The plateau slopes moderately to east and south, its remarkably uniform surface interrupted only by the narrow valleys carved by the westward-flowing tributaries of the Río Paraná.

The Northern Upland, the Central Hill Belt, and the Central Lowland constitute the lower terrain lying between the escarpment and the Río Paraguay. The first of these eroded extensions stretching westward of the Paraná Plateau—the Northern Upland—occupies the portion northward from the [[Aquidabán River]] (''Río Aquidabán'') to the Apa River on the Brazilian border. For the most part it consists of a rolling plateau about {{convert|180|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level and {{convert|76|to|90|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above the plain farther to the south. The Central Hill Belt encompasses the area in the vicinity of [[Asunción]]. Although nearly flat surfaces occur in this subregion, the rolling terrain is extremely uneven. Small, isolated peaks are numerous, and it is here that the only lakes of any size are found. Between these two upland subregions lies the Central Lowland, an area of low elevation and relief, sloping gently upward from the Río Paraguay toward the Paraná Plateau. The valleys of the Central Lowland's westward-flowing rivers are broad and shallow, and periodic flooding of their courses creates seasonal swamps. This subregion's most conspicuous features, its flat-topped hills, project {{convert|6|-|9|m|ft|1|sp=us}} from the grassy plain. Thickly forested, these hills cover areas ranging from a [[hectare]] to several square kilometers ([[acre]]s to square miles). Apparently the weathered remnants of rock related to geological formations farther to the east, these hills are called ''islas de monte'' ([[mountain island]]s), and their margins are known as ''costas'' (coasts).

The remaining subregion—the Ñeembucú Plain—lies in the southwest corner of the Paraneña region. This alluvial flatland has a slight westerly-southwesterly slope obscured by gentle undulations. The Tebicuary River (''Río Tebicuary'')—a major tributary of the Río Paraguay – bisects the swampy lowland, which is broken in its central portion by rounded swells of land up to three meters in height.

The main orographic features of the Paraneña region include the Cordillera de Amambay, the Cordillera de Mbaracayú, and the Cordillera de Caaguazú. The Cordillera de Amambay extends from the northeast corner of the region south and slightly east along the Brazilian border. The mountains reach on average  {{convert| 400|m|ft| 0|sp= us}} above sea level, although the highest point reaches {{convert|700|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The main chain, {{convert|200|km|mi|0|sp=us}} long, has smaller branches that extend to the west and die out along the banks of the Río Paraguay in the Northern Upland.

The [[Cordillera de Amambay]] merges with the [[Cordillera de Mbaracayú]], which reaches eastward {{convert|120|km|mi|0|sp=us}} to the Río Paraná. The average height of this mountain chain is {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}}; the highest point of the chain, {{convert|500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, lies within Brazilian territory. The Río Paraná forms the Salto del Guairá waterfall where it cuts through the mountains of the Cordillera de Mbaracayú to enter Argentina.

The [[Cordillera de Caaguazú]] falls where the other two main mountain ranges meet and extends south, with an average height of {{convert|400|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Its highest point, [[Cerro de San Joaquín]], reaches {{convert|500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. This chain is not a continuous massif but is interrupted by hills and undulations covered with forests and meadows. The Cordillera de Caaguazú reaches westward from the Paraná Plateau into the Central Hill Belt.

A lesser mountain chain, the [[Serranía de Mbaracayú]], also rises at the point where the Cordillera de Amambay and Cordillera de Mbaracayú meet. The Serranía de Mbaracayú extends east and then south to parallel the Río Paraná; the mountain chain has an average height of {{convert|500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.

===The Western Region (Chaco)===
[[Image:Chaco Paraguay cattleranch2.JPG|300px|thumb|right|[[Cattle ranch]], [[Presidente Hayes Department]], Chaco]]  
{{main|Gran Chaco}}

Separated from the Eastern region by the Paraguay River, the Chaco region is a vast plain with elevations reaching no higher than {{convert|300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and averaging {{convert|125|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Covering more than 60 percent of Paraguay's total land area, the Chaco plain slopes gently eastward to the Río Paraguay.

The Paraguayan Chaco is subdivided into two parts. The ''Alto Chaco'' (Upper Chaco), also called ''Chaco Seco'' (Dry Chaco) is the western three-quarters of the region, bordering on Bolivia, while the ''Bajo Chaco'' (Lower Chaco) or ''Chaco Húmedo'' (Humid Chaco) borders on the Paraguay River. The low hills in the northwestern part of the Alto Chaco are the highest parts in the Gran Chaco. One prominent [[wetland]] of the Bajo Chaco is the Estero Patiño, which at {{convert|1500|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} forms the largest [[swamp]] in the country.

The Paraguay Chaco's western two-thirds belong to the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] tropics with annual precipitations between {{convert|550|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, vegetation being dry low scrub in the west to higher growth [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] (semi-arid impenetrable [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]]) forest towards the east. The eastern third belongs to the semi-humid tropics, with rainfall between {{convert|1000|and|1300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, taller vegetation, and tropical semi-humid forest. A belt about {{convert|50|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in length along the Paraguay River again has a different [[evergreen]] vegetation of wetlands and [[Arecaceae|palm tree]] forests (''Bajo Chaco'').

Annual evaporation is around {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The very pronounced dry season lasts from May to October, and a wet season occurs from November to April, when the vegetation turns green and abundant.

The soils of the Chaco are very deep [[sediment]]ary [[soil]]s rich in nutrients, including [[luvisol]]s, [[cambisols]], and [[regosols]], and are in general very fertile and apt for agriculture and pasture (always presuming responsible and sustainable techniques), more so than most of the world's semi-arid tropics.&lt;ref name= fao&gt;
{{cite news | first= Dr. Fernando | last= Riveros | title= The Gran Chaco| publisher= FAO | url = http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/agpc/doc/Bulletin/GranChaco.htm| accessdate = 2009-01-09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting factors include a lack of ground freshwater in most of the Paraguay's Chaco, except in the north and the west. The lowlands facing the Paraguay River have insufficient drainage and seasonal flooding (which again increases soil fertility) as a constraint.

==Drainage==
[[Image:Lago Ypacarai.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of [[Ypacarai Lake]], east of Asunción.]]
The Río Paraguay has a total course of 2600&amp;nbsp;km, 2300&amp;nbsp;km of which are [[Navigability|navigable]] and 1200&amp;nbsp;km of which either border on or pass through Paraguay. The head of navigation is located in Brazil, and during most years vessels with 21 m [[Draft (hull)|drafts]] can reach [[Concepción, Paraguay|Concepción]] without difficulty. Medium-sized ocean vessels can sometimes reach Asunción, but the twisting course and shifting [[Shoal|sandbars]] can make this transit difficult. Although sluggish and shallow, the river sometimes overflows its low [[Bank (geography)|banks]], forming temporary swamps and flooding villages. [[River island]]s, [[meander]] scars, and [[Oxbow lake|oxbow (U-shaped) lakes]] attest to frequent changes in course.

The major tributaries entering the Paraguay River from the Paraneña region—such as the Apa, Aquidabán, and Tebicuary Rivers—descend rapidly from their sources in the Paraná Plateau to the lower lands. There they broaden and become sluggish as they meander westward. After heavy rains these rivers sometimes flood nearby lowlands.
[[File:Saltos del Monday111.JPG|thumb|left|400px|[[Saltos del Monday]].]]
About 4700&amp;nbsp;km long, the Paraná River is the second major river in the country. From [[Salto del Guairá]], where the river enters Paraguay, the Paraná River flows 800&amp;nbsp;km to its juncture with the Río Paraguay and then continues southward to the [[Río de la Plata]] Estuary at [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. In general, the Río Paraná is navigable by large ships only up to [[Encarnación, Paraguay]] but smaller boats may go somewhat farther. In summer months the river is deep enough to permit vessels with drafts of up to three meters to reach Salto del Guairá, but seasonal and other occasional conditions severely limit the river's navigational value. On the upper course, sudden floods may raise the water level by as much as five meters in twenty-four hours; west of Encarnación, however, the rocks of the riverbed sometimes come within one meter of the surface during winter and effectively sever communication between the upper river and Buenos Aires.

The rivers flowing eastward across the Paraneña region as tributaries of the Paraná River are shorter, faster-flowing, and narrower than the tributaries of the Paraguay River. Sixteen of these rivers and numerous smaller streams enter the Paraná River above Encarnación.

Paraguay's third largest river, the Pilcomayo River, flows into the Paraguay River near Asunción after demarcating the entire border between the Chaco region and Argentina. During most of its course, the river is sluggish and marshy, although small craft can navigate its lower reaches. When the Pilcomayo River overflows its low banks, it feeds the Patiño Estuary (''Estero Patiño'').

Drainage in the Chaco region is generally poor because of the flatness of the land and the small number of important streams. In many parts of the region, the [[water table]] is only a meter beneath the surface of the ground, and there are numerous small ponds and seasonal marshes. As a consequence of the poor drainage, most of the water is too salty for drinking or irrigation.

Because of the seasonal overflow of the numerous westward-flowing streams, the lowland areas of the Paraneña region also experience poor drainage conditions, particularly in the Ñeembucú Plain in the southwest, where an almost impervious clay subsurface prevents the absorption of excess surface water into the aquifer. About 30 percent of the Paraneña region is flooded from time to time, creating extensive areas of seasonal marshlands. Permanent bogs are found only near the largest geographic depressions, however.

==Climate==
[[File:Paraguay map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Paraguay map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Paraguay experiences a subtropical climate in the Paraneña region and a tropical climate in the Chaco. The Paraneña region has a humid climate, with abundant precipitation throughout the year and only moderate seasonal changes in temperature. During the [[Southern Hemisphere]]'s summer, which corresponds to the northern winter, the dominant influence on the climate is the warm [[sirocco]] winds blowing out of the northeast. During the winter, the dominant wind is the cold [[pampero (wind)|pampero]] from the [[South Atlantic]], which blows across Argentina and is deflected northeastward by the Andes in the southern part of that country. Because of the lack of topographic barriers within Paraguay, these opposite prevailing winds bring about abrupt and irregular changes in the usually moderate weather. Winds are generally brisk. Velocities of 160&amp;nbsp;km/h (100&amp;nbsp;mph) have been reported in southern locations, and the town of Encarnación was once leveled by a [[tornado]].

The Paraneña region has only two distinct seasons: summer from October to March and winter from May to August. April and September are transitional months in which temperatures are below the midsummer averages and minimums may dip below freezing. Climatically, autumn and spring do not really exist. During the mild winters, July is the coldest month, with a mean temperature of about {{convert|18|°C|1}} in Asunción and {{convert|17|°C|1}} on the Paraná Plateau. There is no significant north-south variation. The number of days with temperatures falling below freezing ranges from as few as three to as many as sixteen yearly, and with even wider variations deep in the interior. Some winters are very mild, with winds blowing constantly from the north, and little frost. During a cold winter, however, tongues of [[Antarctic]] air bring subfreezing temperatures to all areas. No part of the Paraneña region is entirely free from the possibility of frost and consequent damage to crops, and snow flurries have been reported in various locations.

Moist tropical air keeps the weather warm in the Paraneña region from October through March. In Asunción the seasonal average is about {{convert|24|°C|1}}, with January—the warmest month—averaging {{convert|29|°C|1}}. Villarrica has a seasonal mean temperature of {{convert|21|°C|1}} and a January mean of {{convert|27|°C|1}}. During the summer, daytime temperatures reaching {{convert|38|°C|1}} are fairly common. Frequent waves of cool air from the south, however, cause weather that alternates between clear, humid conditions and storms. Skies will be almost cloudless for a week to ten days as temperature and humidity rise continually. As the soggy heat nears intolerable limits, thunderstorms preceding a cold front will blow in from the south, and temperatures will drop as much as {{convert|15|C-change}} in a few minutes.

[[Rainfall]] in the Paraneña region is fairly evenly distributed. Although local meteorological conditions play a contributing role, rain usually falls when tropical air masses are dominant. The least rain falls in August, when averages in various parts of the region range from {{convert|200|to|100|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. The two periods of maximum precipitation are March through May and October to November.

For the region as a whole, the difference between the driest and the wettest months ranges from {{convert|100|to|180|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|1270|mm|in|sp=us}}, although the average on the Paraná Plateau is {{convert|250|to|380|mm|in|1|sp=us}} greater. All subregions may experience considerable variations from year to year. Asunción has recorded as much as {{convert|208|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and as little as {{convert|560|mm|in|sp=us}} of annual rainfall; [[Puerto Bertoni]] on the Paraná Plateau has recorded as much as {{convert|3300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and as little as {{convert|790|mm|in|1|sp=us}}.

In contrast to the Paraneña region, the Chaco has a tropical wet-and-dry climate bordering on semi-arid. The Chaco experiences seasons that alternately flood and parch the land, yet seasonal variations in temperature are modest. Chaco temperatures are usually high, the averages dropping only slightly in winter. Even at night the air is stifling despite the usually present breezes. Rainfall is light, varying from {{convert|500|to|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year, except in the higher land to the northwest where it is somewhat greater. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months, and extensive areas that are deserts in winter become summer swamps.

==Environment==
{{main|Environmental issues in Paraguay}}
Current environmental issues include deforestation (Paraguay lost an estimated 20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of forest land between 1958 and 1985) and water pollution (inadequate means for waste disposal present health risks for many urban residents). Paraguay is a party to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], the [[Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]], the [[Law of the Sea]], and the [[Ozone Layer Protection]]. It has also signed, but not ratified, the [[Nuclear Test Ban]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3561">{{short description|Systematic investigation of the geology in a region for the purpose of creating a geological map or model}}
A '''geological survey''' is the systematic investigation of the geology beneath a given piece of ground for the purpose of creating a [[geological map]] or [[scientific model|model]]. Geological surveying employs techniques from the traditional walk-over survey, studying [[outcrop]]s and [[landforms]], to intrusive methods, such as hand augering and machine-driven [[borehole]]s, to the use of [[geophysical]] techniques and [[remote sensing]] methods, such as [[aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]].  Such surveys may be undertaken by state, province, or national geological survey organizations to maintain the geological [[inventory]] and advance the knowledge of [[geosciences]] for the benefit of the nation.
A geological survey map typically superimposes the surveyed extent and boundaries of geological units on a topographic map, together with information at points (such as measurements of orientation of bedding planes) and lines (such as the intersection of faults with the land surface). The maps and reports created by geological survey organisations generally aim for geographic continuity and completeness in establishing the spatial patterns of near-surface rock units. The map may include [[Cross section (geology)|cross sections]] to illustrate the three-dimensional interpretation. Subsurface geological and geophysical maps, providing limited coverage of deeper geology (known, for example, from drilling for oil or gas), are maintained internally by major oil companies and regulators. Some geological survey organisations have collaborated with them to include subsurface geology in their systematic surveys, for example, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081226215559/http://www.ags.gov.ab.ca/publications/wcsb_atlas/atlas.html Geological Atlas of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin]. Subsurface maps typically depict the three-dimensional form of geological surfaces by means of contours and cross sections. Computer-based models are increasingly used to provide more comprehensive information storage and greater flexibility of presentation.
In the United States, the 50 state surveys are coordinated by the [[Association of American State Geologists]].

Some examples of national geological surveys are listed here:

* [[Geoscience Australia]] - known from 1992 to 2001 as the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO), and from 1946 to 1992 as the Bureau of Mineral Resources
* [[Geological Survey of Canada]]
* [[Geological Survey of India]]
* [[Geological Survey of Pakistan]]
* [[Saudi Geological Survey]]
* [[British Geological Survey]] 
* [[United States Geological Survey]]
* [[Geological Survey of Austria]]
* [[Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières]]

Individual states or provinces may also have a geological survey.  Examples include:

* [[Alberta Geological Survey]]
* [[Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador]]
* [[Pennsylvania Geological Survey]]
* [[Utah Geological Survey]]
* [[Delaware Geological Survey]]

'''Glaciology''' (from Latin: ''[[wikt:glacies|glacies]]'', "frost, ice", and Ancient Greek: λόγος, ''[[logos]]'', "subject matter"; literally "study of ice") is the scientific study of [[glacier]]s, or more generally  [[ice]] and natural phenomena that involve ice.

Glaciology is an interdisciplinary [[Earth science]] that integrates [[geophysics]], [[geology]], [[physical geography]], [[geomorphology]], [[climatology]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]], [[biology]], and [[ecology]]. The impact of glaciers on people includes the fields of [[human geography]] and [[anthropology]]. The discoveries of water ice on the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Pluto]] add an extraterrestrial component to the field, as in "astroglaciology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annals of Glaciology, v.9 |page=255 |author=Richard S. Williams, Jr. |url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/9/igs_annals_vol09_year1987_pg254-255.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |year=1987 |publisher=[[International Glaciological Society]] |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

A glacier is an extended mass of ice formed from snow falling and accumulating over a long period of time; glaciers move very slowly, either descending from high mountains, as in valley glaciers, or moving outward from centers of accumulation, as in [[continental glacier]]s.

Areas of study within glaciology include glacial history and the reconstruction of past glaciation. A glaciologist is a person who studies glaciers. A glacial geologist studies glacial deposits and glacial erosive features on the landscape. Glaciology and glacial geology are key areas of polar research.

==Types==
[[File:Bylot Island Glacier (cropped).jpg|thumb|A [[Bylot Island]] glacier,  [[Sirmilik National Park]], [[Nunavut]]. This mountain glacier is one of many coming down from the interior [[ice cap]] on top of the [[Byam Martin Mountains]]. |400px]]
There are two general categories of glaciation which glaciologists distinguish: ''alpine glaciation'', accumulations or "rivers of ice" confined to valleys; and ''continental glaciation'', unrestricted accumulations which once covered much of the northern continents.

*Alpine – ice flows down the valleys of mountainous areas and forms a tongue of ice moving towards the plains below.  Alpine glaciers tend to make the [[topography]] more rugged, by adding and improving the scale of existing features such as large ravines called ''[[cirque]]s'' and ridges where the rims of two cirques meet called [[arête]]s.
*Continental – an ice sheet found today, only in high latitudes ([[Greenland]]/[[Antarctica]]), thousands of square kilometers in area and thousands of meters thick.  These tend to smooth out the landscapes.

==Zones of glaciers==
* Accumulation, where the formation of ice is faster than its removal.
* Wastage or ablation, where the sum of melting and evaporation (sublimation) is greater than the amount of snow added each year.

==Movement==
[[File:Khurdopin glacier &amp; Shimshal River.jpg|thumb|Khurdopin glacier and [[Shimshal]] River, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], northern Pakistan 2017. Several glaciers flow into the Shimshal Valley, and are prone to blocking the river.  Khurdopin glacier surged in 2016–17, creating a sizable lake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90672&amp;src=eoa-iotd Khurdopin glacier &amp; Shimshal River, Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;|375px]]
[[File:Glaciers of Shimsal Valley from space.jpg|thumb|Glaciers of Shimsal Valley from space, May 13, 2017. Khurdopin glacier has dammed the Shimshal River, forming a [[glacial lake]]. The river has started to carve a path through the toe of the glacier. By early August 2017, the lake had completely drained.|375px]]

; [[Ablation]] : wastage of the glacier through sublimation, ice melting and iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]].
; [[Ablation zone]] :Area of a glacier in which the annual loss of ice through ablation exceeds the annual gain from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].
; [[Arete (landform)|Arête]] : an acute ridge of rock where two cirques meet.
; [[Bergschrund]] : crevasse formed near the head of a glacier, where the mass of ice has rotated, sheared and torn itself apart in the manner of a geological fault.
; [[Cirque]], corrie or cwm : bowl shaped depression excavated by the source of a glacier.
; [[Creep (deformation)|Creep]] : adjustment to [[Stress (physics)|stress]] at a [[Molecule|molecular]] level.
; [[Fluid mechanics|Flow]] : movement (of ice) in a constant direction.
; [[Fracture]] : brittle failure (breaking of ice) under the stress raised when movement is too rapid to be accommodated by creep. It happens for example, as the central part of a glacier moves faster than the edges.
; [[Pyramidal peak|Horn]] : spire of rock, also known as a pyramidal peak, formed by the [[headward erosion]] of three or more cirques around a single mountain. It is an extreme case of an arête.
; [[Plucking (glaciation)|Plucking]]/Quarrying : where the [[adhesion]] of the ice to the rock is stronger than the [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] of the rock, part of the rock leaves with the flowing ice.
; [[Tarn (lake)|Tarn]] : a post-glacial lake in a cirque. 
; [[Tunnel valley]] : The tunnel that is formed by hydraulic erosion of ice and rock below an ice sheet margin. The tunnel valley is what remains of it in the underlying rock when the ice sheet has melted.

=== Rate of movement ===
Movement of the glacier is very slow. Its velocity varies from a few centimeters per day to a few meters per day. The rate of movement depends upon the numbers of factors which are listed below :
* [[Temperature]] of the ice
* [[Grade (slope)|Gradient]] of the slope
* Thickness of the glacier&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text book of Physical Geology|last=Mahapatra|first=G.B.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=81-239-0110-0|location=Nazia printers, Delhi|pages=269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subglacial water dynamics

==Glacial deposits&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;==
[[File:Kettle pond Hossa.jpg|thumb|A kettle pond in [[Hossa, Finland|Hossa]], [[Suomussalmi]] municipality, Finland]]

===Stratified===
; Outwash sand/gravel : from front of glaciers, found on a plain
; [[Kettle (landform)|Kettles]] : block of stagnant ice leaves a depression or pit
; [[Esker]]s : steep sided ridges of gravel/sand, possibly caused by streams running under stagnant ice
; [[Kame]]s : stratified drift builds up low steep hills
; [[Varve]]s : alternating thin sedimentary beds (coarse and fine) of a [[proglacial lake]]. Summer conditions deposit more and coarser material and those of the winter, less and finer.

===Unstratified===
[[File:Drowned drumlin in Clew Bay (cropped).jpg|thumb|Drowned drumlin in [[Clew Bay]], Ireland|370px]]
; [[Till]]-unsorted : (glacial flour to boulders) deposited by receding/advancing glaciers, forming moraines, and drumlins
; [[Moraine]]s : (Terminal) material deposited at the end; (Ground) material deposited as glacier melts; (lateral) material deposited along the sides.
; [[Drumlin]]s : smooth elongated hills composed of till.
; [[Ribbed moraines]] : large subglacial elongated hills transverse to former ice flow.

[[File:Die back valley gnangarra.jpg|thumb|Heath landscape in the [[Stirling Range]], Western Australia, with a [[Phytophthora cinnamomi|dieback]]-infested valley in the mid-ground]]
A '''heath''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|θ}}) is a [[shrubland]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] found mainly on free-draining infertile, [[acid]]ic soils and is characterised by open, low-growing woody vegetation. [[Moorland]] is generally related to high-ground heaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Polunin|first= Oleg |authorlink = Oleg Polunin |author2=Walters, Martin |title= A Guide to the Vegetation of Britain and Europe |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 1985|isbn= 0-19-217713-3|page= 220}}&lt;/ref&gt; with—especially in [[Great Britain]]—a cooler and more damp climate.

Heaths are widespread worldwide, but are fast disappearing and considered a rare habitat in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeonland.org.uk/heath%20and%20moorland/index.htm|title=Heath and Moorland|last=Anon|work=Field Studies Council|publisher=FSC|accessdate=4 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131004094204/http://www.lifeonland.org.uk/heath%20and%20moorland/index.htm|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form extensive and highly diverse communities across [[Australia]] in humid and sub-humid areas where [[fire regime]]s with recurring burning are required for the maintenance of the heathlands.&lt;ref name="Specht"&gt;Specht, R.L. 'Heathlands' in 'Australian Vegetation' R.H. Groves ed. Cambridge University Press 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Even more diverse though less widespread heath communities occur in [[Southern Africa]]. Extensive heath communities can also be found in the [[California]] [[chaparral]], [[New Caledonia]], central [[Chile]] and along the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In addition to these extensive heath areas, the [[vegetation type]] is also found in scattered locations across all continents, except [[Antarctica]].

==Characteristics==
Heathland is favoured where climatic conditions are typically hard and dry, particularly in summer, and soils acidic, of low fertility, and often sandy and very free-draining; a [[mire]] may occur where drainage is poor, but usually is only small in extent. Heaths are dominated by low shrubs, {{convert|20|cm|in}} to {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} tall.

Heath vegetation can be extremely plant-species rich, and heathlands of Australia are home to some 3,700 endemic or typical species in addition to numerous less restricted species.&lt;ref name="Specht"/&gt; The [[fynbos]] heathlands of South Africa are second only to tropical rainforests in plant biodiversity with over 7,000 species.&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1203|name=Montane fynbos and renosterveld}}&lt;/ref&gt; In marked contrast, the tiny pockets of heathland in Europe are extremely [[Depauperate ecosystem|depauperate]] with a flora consisting primarily of [[Calluna|heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris''), [[Erica|heath]] (''Erica'' species) and [[Ulex|gorse]] (''Ulex'' species).

The bird [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]] of heathlands are usually cosmopolitan species of the region.&lt;ref name="Specht"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; In the depauperate heathlands of Europe, bird species tend to be more characteristic of the community and include [[Montagu's harrier]], and the [[tree pipit]]. In Australia the heathland avian fauna is dominated by nectar-feeding birds such as [[honeyeater|honey-eaters]] and [[Lories and lorikeets|lorikeets]] although numerous other birds from [[emu]]s to [[eagle]]s are also common in Australian heathlands. Australian heathlands are also home to the world's only nectar-feeding terrestrial mammal: the [[honey possum]]. The  bird fauna of the South African fynbos includes [[sunbird]]s, warblers and siskins. Heathlands are also an excellent habitat for insects including [[ant]]s, moths, butterflies and wasps with many species being restricted entirely to it. One such example of an organism restricted to heathland is the silver-studded blue butterfly, ''[[Silver-studded blue|Plebejus argus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Roger L.H.|last2=Sparks|first2=Tim H.|title=When is a habitat not a habitat? Dramatic resource use changes under differing weather conditions for the butterfly Plebejus argus|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320705004738|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=129|issue=3|pages=291–301|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.10.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Anthropogenic heaths==
[[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] heath habitats are a [[cultural landscape]] that can be found worldwide in locations as diverse as northern and western Europe, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and New Guinea.

These heaths were originally created or expanded by centuries of human clearance of the natural forest and woodland vegetation, by grazing and burning. In some cases this clearance went so far that parts of the heathland have given way to open spots of pure sand and [[sand dune]]s, with a local climate that, even in Europe, can experience temperatures of {{convert|50|C|F}} in summer, drying the sand spot bordering the heathland and further raising its vulnerability for wildfires. Referring to heathland in England, [[Oliver Rackham]] says, "Heaths are clearly the product of human activities and need to be managed as heathland; if neglected they turn into woodland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Countryside|first=Oliver|last=Rackham|authorlink = Oliver Rackham|page=282|publisher=Phoenix|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the conservation value of even these man-made heaths has become much more appreciated,{{Why|date=September 2015}}{{citation needed|reason=Evidence not given|date=September 2015}} and consequently most heathlands are protected. However they are also threatened by tree incursion because of the discontinuation of traditional management techniques such as grazing and burning that mediated the landscapes. Some are also threatened by [[urban sprawl]]. Anthropogenic heathlands are maintained artificially by a combination of grazing and periodic burning (known as swailing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-22054636|title=Dartmoor fire 'largest in years'|date=7 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or (rarely) mowing; if not so maintained, they are rapidly re-colonised by forest or woodland. The re-colonising tree species will depend on what is available as the local seed source, and thus it may not reflect the natural vegetation before the heathland became established.

{{State organisation of Ottoman Empire}}
A '''kadiluk''', in some cases equivalent to a [[Qadaa|kaza]], was a local [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|administrative subdivision]] of the [[Ottoman empire]], which was the territory of a [[Qadi|kadı]], or judge.&lt;ref name="bosnia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|authorlink=Noel Malcolm|title=Bosnia: A Short History|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-330-41244-2|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There could be several kadiluks in a [[sanjak]]. The kadı's duties extended beyond those of a modern [[judge]]; in addition to law enforcement, kadiluks were involved in matters such as taxation and conscription.&lt;ref name="kosovo"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Noel Malcolm|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-330-41224-8|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gypsies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ginio|first=Eyal|title=Neither Muslims nor Zimmis: The Gypsies (Roma) in the Ottoman State|url=http://www.marston.co.uk/rspp/luprsv014p02a00117.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123025723/http://www.marston.co.uk/RSPP/LUPRSV014P02A00117.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2009|df=dmy-all}} "''These records mirror the diversity of the kadi's responsibilities in the Ottoman city''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Although every kaza had a kadı, not every kadı was in charge of a kaza; a kadı's position moved, over time, with demographic and political changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hickok|first=Michael Robert|title=Ottoman military administration in eighteenth-century Bosnia|year=1997|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10689-5|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tanzimat]] reforms of 1864, kadiluks were decoupled from kazas.&lt;ref name="bosnia"/&gt;

The launch happened after North Korea [[January 2016 North Korean nuclear test|conducted a nuclear test]] on 6 January and as the [[United Nations Security Council]] was deciding on sanctions to be placed on the country following the nuclear test. The launch was also timed to celebrate the 74th birthday of the late leader [[Kim Jong-il]] on February 16.

==Pre-launch==
On 2 February 2016, North Korea sent a notification to the [[International Maritime Organization]] stating that the country was going to launch a [[Kwangmyongsong program|Kwangmyongsong earth observation satellite]] with a launch window of 8–25 February between 22:30 UTC and 03:30 UTC given. The notification also included the drop zones for the first stage, the payload fairing and the second stage of the rocket, which was similar to the areas designated for the launch of [[Kwangmyongsong-3 Unit 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Launch notification reveals rocket drop zones - North Korea Tech|url = https://www.northkoreatech.org/2016/02/03/launch-notification-reveals-rocket-drop-zones/|website = northkoreatech.org|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2016, North Korea sent another notification to the International Maritime Organization stating that the launch window had been changed to 7–14 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = All systems go?

It was initially claimed by U.S. officials that the satellite was "tumbling in orbit" and that no signals had yet been detected being transmitted from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-satellite-tumbling-in-orbit-u-s-officials-say/ North Korean satellite "tumbling in orbit," U.S. officials say] - CBSnews.com, 8 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later reported the tumbling had been brought under control and the orbit stabilized.&lt;ref name=reuters-20160210&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-satellite-orbit-idUSKCN0VI1XN |title=North Korea satellite in stable orbit but not seen transmitting: U.S. sources |author1=Andrea Shalal |author2=David Brunnstrom |publisher=Reuters |date=10 February 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the satellite has established communication with North Korea.

The head of the [[U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command]] stated that Kwangmyongsong-4 was almost twice as large as Kwangmyongsong-3, and South Korean officials estimated the mass as {{convert|200|kg}}.&lt;ref name=reuters-20160211&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-satelitte-missiledefense-idUKKCN0VJ2PF |title=North Korea satellite not transmitting, but rocket payload a concern - U.S. |author=David Brunnstrom |publisher=Reuters |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian news agency [[TASS]] reported on February 22nd statement by Colonel Andrei Kalyuta of Russia's National Space Monitoring Center, based on orbit of the satellite its in line with declared purpose, activity of satellite and equipment were confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://special.tass.ru/politika/2688450|title=ТАСС|access-date=2018-10-09|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite tracker and astronomer for [[Leiden Observatory]] has Marco Langbroek captured images of the satellite on February 28th, based on long exposure images the satellite is either not tumbling or is in a very slow tumble .

==Post-Launch==

North Korea registered the satellite with the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] on May 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea Registers Satellite with UN|url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/05/north-korea-registers-satellite-with-un/|first=Leo|last=Byrne|date=27 May 2016|access-date=27 May 2016|publisher=NK News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to claiming North Korea was planning a moon mission, Hyon Kwang-il, director of the scientific research department at NADA, said the satellite had completed 2,513 orbits and had transmitted 700 photographic images in the day following its launch.&lt;ref name="msnnorthkorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ap-exclusive-north-korea-hopes-to-plant-flag-on-the-moon/ar-BBvePu4?li=BBnbcA1 |title=AP Exclusive: North Korea hopes to plant flag on the moon |publisher=Associated Press |date=4 August 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820032940/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ap-exclusive-north-korea-hopes-to-plant-flag-on-the-moon/ar-BBvePu4?li=BBnbcA1 |archivedate= 20 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite passes over North Korea four times a day and continues to transmit data.{{Update after|2017|02}} However, international experts, such as astrophysicist [[Jonathan McDowell]], have not confirmed any transmissions from the satellite.&lt;ref name="msnnorthkorea"/&gt;

In May 2017 North Korea has released satellite images of [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD]] site in Seongju county, South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.yna.co.kr/mob2/en/contents_en.jsp?cid=AEN20170510009000315&amp;site=0400000000&amp;mobile|title=Yonhapnews Agency - Mobile|website=m.yna.co.kr|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea, Japan, the United States and other countries have accused North Korea of testing a ballistic missile (Unha is the satellite launch version of [[Taepodong-2]]) capable of hitting the United States.&lt;ref name=reuters-20160207/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/06/asia/north-korea-rocket-launch-window/|title=U.S., other nations condemn North Korean rocket launch - CNN.com|author=Ralph Ellis, K.J.

A '''large igneous province''' (LIP) is an extremely large accumulation of [[igneous rock]]s, including intrusive (sills) and extrusive (lava flows, tephra deposits), arising when magma travels through the crust towards the surface. The formation of LIPs is variously attributed to [[mantle plume]]s or to processes associated with divergent [[plate tectonic]]s.&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title= Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author= Foulger, G.R. |authorlink= Gillian Foulger |url= http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of some of the LIPs the past 500 million years coincide in time with mass extinctions and rapid climatic changes, which has led to numerous hypotheses about the causal relationships. LIPs are fundamentally different from any other currently active volcanoes or volcanic systems.

== Definition ==
In 1992 researchers first used the term ''large igneous province'' to describe very large accumulations—areas greater than 100,000 square kilometers (approximately the area of Iceland)—of [[mafic]] igneous rocks that were erupted or emplaced at depth within an extremely short [[geological time]] interval: a few million years or less.&lt;ref name=Coffin&gt;{{cite book |last=Coffin |first=M |last2=Eldholm |first2=O |ref=CITEREFCoffinEldholm1992 |year=1992 |chapter=Volcanism and continental break-up: a global compilation of large igneous provinces |editors=Storey, B.C., Alabaster, T., [[Robert John Pankhurst|Pankhurst, R.J.]] |title=Magmatism and the Causes of Continental Breakup |publisher=Geological Society of London |series=Special Publications |place=London |volume=68 |pages=17–30 |doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.1992.068.01.02 |bibcode = 1992GSLSP..68...17C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mafic, basalt sea floors and other geological products of 'normal' plate tectonics were not included in the definition.&lt;ref name=Bryan&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bryan |first=Scott |last2=Ernst |first2=Richard |year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2007.08.008|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/LIPClass2.html |title=Proposed Revision to Large Igneous Province Classification |bibcode=2008ESRv...86..175B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
The definition of ''LIP'' has been expanded and refined, and is still a work in progress. ''LIP'' is now frequently also used to describe voluminous areas of, not just mafic, but all types of igneous rocks. Sub-categorization of LIPs into ''large volcanic provinces'' (LVP) and ''large plutonic provinces'' (LPP), and including rocks produced by normal plate tectonic processes, has been proposed but are not generally accepted.&lt;ref name="Sheth"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheth|first=Hetu C.|year=2007|title='Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs)': Definition, recommended terminology, and a hierarchical classification|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/sheth2007-esr.pdf|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=85|issue=3–4|pages=117–124|bibcode=2007ESRv...85..117S|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2007.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LIPs are geographically intact, such the basaltic [[Deccan Traps]] in India, while others have been fragmented and separated by plate movements, like the [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province]] (CAMP)—parts of which are found in Brazil, eastern North America, and north-western Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svensen|first=H.

==Motivations for study of LIPs==
[[File:Flood Basalt Map.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map showing the recognized continental large igneous provinces.]]
Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are created during short-lived igneous events resulting in relatively rapid and high-volume accumulations of volcanic and intrusive igneous rock. These events warrant study because:

* The possible links to mass extinctions and global environmental and climatic changes. [[Michael Rampino]] and [[Richard Stothers]] (1988) cited eleven distinct flood-basalt episodes - occurring in the past 250 million years - which created volcanic provinces and oceanic plateaus and coincided with [[mass extinctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Michael R. Rampino &amp; Richard B. Stothers|year=1988|title=Flood Basalt Volcanism During the Past 250 Million Years|url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|journal=Science|volume=241|issue=4866|pages=663–668|bibcode=1988Sci...241..663R|doi=10.1126/science.241.4866.663|pmid=17839077}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme has developed into a broad field of research, bridging geoscience disciplines such as biostratigraphy, volcanology, metamorphic petrology, and Earth System Modelling.

*The study of LIPs has economic implications. Some workers associate them with trapped hydrocarbons.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} They are associated with economic concentrations of copper–nickel and iron.&lt;ref name=Eremin&gt;N. I. Eremin; Platform Magmatism: Geology and Minerageny; ISSN 1075-7015, Geology of Ore Deposits, 2010, Vol. 52, No. 1, pp. 77–80. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2010. {{doi|10.1134/S1075701510010071}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also associated with formation of major mineral provinces including [[Ore#Nickel-cobalt-platinum deposits|Platinum-Group Element (PGE) Deposits]], and in the Silicic LIPs, silver and gold deposits.&lt;ref name=Bryan/&gt; Titanium and vanadium deposits are also found in association with LIPs.&lt;ref&gt;M.-F. Zhou et al.; Two magma series and associated ore deposit types in the Permian Emeishan large igneous province, SW China; Lithos; Vol. 103 (2008) pp.352–368; {{doi|10.1016/j.lithos.2007.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*LIPs in the geological record have marked major changes in the hydrosphere and atmosphere, leading to major climate shifts and maybe mass extinctions of species.&lt;ref name=Bryan/&gt; Some of these changes were related to rapid release of greenhouse gases from the crust to the atmosphere. Thus the LIP-triggered changes may be used as cases to understand current and future environmental changes.  
*Plate tectonic theory explains topography using interactions between the tectonic plates, as influenced by viscous stresses created by flow within the underlying mantle. Since the mantle is extremely viscous, the mantle flow rate varies in pulses which are reflected in the lithosphere by small amplitude, long wavelength undulations. Understanding how the interaction between mantle flow and lithosphere elevation influences formation of LIPs is important to gaining insights into past mantle dynamics.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;Braun, J; The many surface expressions of mantle dynamics; Nature Geosciences; VOL 3; DECEMBER 2010; {{doi|10.1038/ngeo1020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* LIPs have played a major role in continental breakup, continental formation, new crustal additions from the upper mantle, and supercontinent cycles.&lt;ref name=Braun/&gt;

==Large igneous province formation==
[[File:3-Devils-grade-Moses-Coulee-Cattle-Feed-Lot-PB110016.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Three Devil's grade in [[Moses Coulee]], Washington is part of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]] LIP.]]
Earth has an outer shell made of a number of discrete, moving tectonic plates floating on a solid convective mantle above a liquid core. The mantle's flow is driven by the descent of cold tectonic plates during subduction and the complementary ascent of plumes of hot material from lower levels. The surface of the Earth reflects stretching, thickening and bending of the tectonic plates as they interact.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = Philip A | year = 2011 | title = Geodynamics: Surface impact of mantle processes | url = | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 498–499 | doi = 10.1038/ngeo1216 | bibcode = 2011NatGe...4..498A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean-plate creation at upwellings, spreading and subduction are well accepted fundamentals of plate tectonics, with the upwelling of hot mantle materials and the sinking of the cooler ocean plates driving the mantle convection. In this model, tectonic plates diverge at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, where hot mantle rock flows upward to fill the space. Plate-tectonic processes account for the vast majority of Earth's volcanism.&lt;ref name=hump&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphreys | first1 = Eugene | last2 = Schmandt | first2 = Brandon | year = 2011 | title = Looking for mantle plumes | url = | journal = Physics Today | volume = 64 | issue = 8| page = 34 | doi = 10.1063/PT.3.1217 | bibcode = 2011PhT....64h..34H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the effects of convectively driven motion, deep processes have other influences on the surface topography. The convective circulation drives up-wellings and down-wellings in Earth's mantle that are reflected in local surface levels. Hot mantle materials rising up in a plume can spread out radially beneath the tectonic plate causing regions of uplift.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; These ascending plumes play an important role in LIP formation.

===Formation characteristics===
When created, LIPs often have an areal extent of a few million km² and volumes on the order of 1 million km³. In most cases, the majority of a basaltic LIP's volume is emplaced in less than 1 million years. One of the conundra of such LIPs' origins is to understand how enormous volumes of basaltic magma are formed and erupted over such short time scales, with effusion rates up to an order of magnitude greater than mid-ocean ridge basalts.

===Formation theories===
The source of many or all LIPs are variously attributed to mantle plumes, to processes associated with plate tectonics or to meteorite impacts.

====Plume formation of LIPs====
Although most of volcanic activity on Earth is associated with subduction zones or mid-oceanic ridges, there are significant regions of long-lived, extensive volcanism, known as [[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], which are only indirectly related to plate tectonics. The [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]], located on the [[Pacific Plate]], is one example, tracing millions of years of relative motion as the plate moves over the [[Hawaii hotspot]]. Numerous hotspots of varying size and age have been identified across the world. These hotspots move slowly with respect to one another, but move an order of magnitude more quickly with respect to tectonic plates, providing evidence that they are not directly linked to tectonic plates.&lt;ref name=hump/&gt;

The origin of hotspots remains controversial. Hotspots that reach the Earth’s surface may have three distinct origins. The deepest probably originate from the boundary between the lower mantle and the core; roughly 15–20% have characteristics such as presence of a linear chain of sea mounts with increasing ages, LIPs at the point of origin of the track, low shear wave velocity indicating high temperatures below the current location of the track, and ratios of He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to He&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; which are judged consistent with a deep origin. Others such as the [[Pitcairn hotspot|Pitcairn]], Samoan and Tahitian hotspots appear to originate at the top of large, transient, hot lava domes (termed superswells) in the mantle. The remainder appear to originate in the upper mantle and have been suggested to result from the breakup of subducting lithosphere.&lt;ref name=cour&gt;Vincent Courtillot, Anne Davaille, Jean Besse, &amp; Joann Stock ;Three distinct types of hotspots in the Earth’s mantle; Earth and Planetary Science Letters; V. 205; 2003; pp.295–308&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent imaging of the region below known hotspots (e.g., [[Yellowstone hotspot|Yellowstone]] and Hawaii) using seismic-wave [[tomography]] has produced mounting evidence that supports relatively narrow, deep-origin, convective plumes that are limited in region compared to the large-scale plate tectonic circulation in which they are imbedded. Images reveal continuous but torturous vertical paths with varying quantities of hotter material, even at depths where crystallographic transformations are predicted to occur.&lt;ref&gt;E. Humphreys and B. Schmandt; Looking for Mantle Plumes; Physics Today; August 2011; pp. 34- 39&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

====Plate-related stress formation of LIPs====
A major alternative to the plume model is a model in which ruptures are caused by plate-related stresses that fractured the lithosphere, allowing melt to reach the surface from shallow heterogeneous sources. The high volumes of molten material that form the LIPs is postulated to be caused by convection in the upper mantle, which is secondary to the convection driving tectonic plate motion.&lt;ref name= Hagstrum &gt;J.T. Hagstrum; Antipodal hotspots and bipolar catastrophes: Were oceanic large-body impacts the cause?; Earth and Planetary Science Letters; Vol 236; (2005) pp. 13–27; {{doi|10.1016/j.epsl.2005.02.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early formed reservoir outpourings====
It has been proposed that geochemical evidence supports an early-formed reservoir that survived in the Earth's mantle for about 4.5 billion years. Molten material is postulated to have originated from this reservoir, contributing the Baffin Island flood basalt ~60 million years ago. Basalts from the Ontong Java plateau show similar isotopic and trace element signatures proposed for the early-Earth reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew G. Jackson &amp; Richard W. Carlson; An ancient recipe for flood-basalt genesis; Nature (2011) {{doi|10.1038/nature10326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meteorite-induced formation====
Seven pairs of hotspots and LIPs located on opposite sides of the earth have been noted; analyses indicate this coincident antipodal location is highly unlikely to be random. The hotspot pairs include a large igneous province with continental volcanism opposite an oceanic hotspot. Oceanic impacts of large meteorites are expected to have high efficiency in converting energy into seismic waves. These waves would propagate around the world and reconverge close to the antipodal position; small variations are expected as the seismic velocity varies depending upon the route characteristics along which the waves propagate. As the waves focus on the antipodal position, they put the crust at the focal point under significant stress and are proposed to rupture it, creating antipodal pairs. When the meteorite impacts a continent, the lower efficiency of kinetic energy conversion into seismic energy is not expected to create an antipodal hotspot.&lt;ref name= Hagstrum/&gt;

A second impact-related model of hotspot and LIP formation has been suggested in which minor hotspot volcanism was generated at large-body impact sites and flood basalt volcanism was triggered antipodally by focused seismic energy [13,14]. This model has been challenged because impacts are generally considered seismically too inefficient [15], and the Deccan Traps of India were not antipodal to, and began erupting several Myr before, the end-Cretaceous Chicxulub impact in Mexico. In addition, no clear example of impact-induced volcanism, unrelated to melt sheets, has been confirmed at any known terrestrial crater.&lt;ref name= Hagstrum/&gt;

==Classification==
In 1992, Coffin and Eldholm initially defined the term "large igneous province" (LIP) as representing a variety of mafic igneous provinces with areal extent &gt;1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that represented "massive crustal emplacements of predominantly mafic (Mg- and Fe-rich) extrusive and intrusive rock, and originated via processes other than 'normal' seafloor spreading."&lt;ref&gt;Coffin, M.F., Eldholm, O. (Eds.), 1991. Large Igneous Provinces: JOI/USSAC workshop report.

Geological Society of London Special Publication, vol. 68, pp. 17–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffin, M.F., Eldholm, O., 1994. Large igneous provinces: crustal structure, dimensions, and external consequences. Reviews of Geophysics Vol. 32, pp. 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt; That original definition included continental [[flood basalt]]s, [[oceanic plateau]]s, large [[dike swarm]]s (the eroded roots of a volcanic province), and [[passive margin|volcanic rifted margins]]. Most of these LIPs consist of basalt, but some contain large volumes of associated [[rhyolite]] (e.g. the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]] in the western United States); the rhyolite is typically very dry compared to island arc rhyolites, with much higher eruption temperatures (850&amp;nbsp;°C to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C) than normal rhyolites.

Since 1992 the definition of 'LIP' has been expanded and refined, and remains a work in progress. Some new definitions of the term 'LIP' include large granitic provinces such as those found in the Andes Mountains of South America and in western North America. Comprehensive taxonomies have been developed to focus technical discussions.

In 2008, Bryan and Ernst refined the definition to narrow it somewhat: "Large Igneous Provinces are magmatic provinces with areal extents &gt;1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, igneous volumes &gt;1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and maximum lifespans of ∼50 Myr that have intraplate tectonic settings or geochemical affinities, and are characterised by igneous pulse(s) of short duration (∼1–5 Myr), during which a large proportion (&gt;75%) of the total igneous volume has been emplaced. They are dominantly mafic, but also can have significant ultramafic and silicic components, and some are dominated by silicic magmatism." This definition places emphasis on the high magma emplacement rate characteristics of the LIP event and excludes seamounts, seamount groups, submarine ridges and anomalous seafloor crust.&lt;ref name=Bryan_2&gt;S.E. Bryan &amp; R.E. Ernst; Revised definition of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs); Earth-Science Reviews Vol. 86 (2008) pp. 175–202&lt;/ref&gt;

'LIP' is now frequently used to also describe voluminous areas of, not just mafic, but all types of igneous rocks. Sub-categorization of LIPs into Large Volcanic Provinces (LVP) and Large Plutonic Provinces (LPP), and including rocks produced by 'normal' plate tectonic processes, has been proposed. Further, the threshold to be included as a LIP has been lowered to &gt;5x10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Sheth/&gt; The working taxonomy, focused heavily on geochemistry, which will be used to structure examples below, is:
*Large igneous provinces (LIP)
**Large volcanic provinces (LVP)
***Large rhyolitic provinces (LRPs)
***Large andesitic provinces (LAPs)
***Large basaltic provinces (LBPs): oceanic, or continental flood basalts
***Large basaltic–rhyolitic provinces (LBRPs)
**Large plutonic provinces (LPP)
***Large granitic provinces (LGP)
***Large mafic plutonic provinces

[[File:The difference between a sill and a dike.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Illustration showing a vertical [[Dike (geology)|dike]] and a horizontal sill.]]
Aerally extensive [[dike swarm]]s, [[Sill (geology)|sill]] provinces, and large layered [[ultramafic]] intrusions are indicators of LIPs, even when other evidence is not now observable. The upper basalt layers of older LIPs may have been removed by erosion or deformed by tectonic plate collisions occurring after the layer is formed. This is especially likely for earlier periods such as the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Proterozoic]].&lt;ref name=Bryan_2 /&gt;

Both radial and linear dyke swarm configurations exist. Radial swarms with an areal extent &gt;2000&amp;nbsp;km and linear swarms extending &gt;1000&amp;nbsp;km are known. The linear dyke swarms often have a high proportion of dykes relative to country rocks, particularly when the width of the linear field is less than 100&amp;nbsp;km. The dykes have a typical width of 20–100 meters, although [[ultramafic]] dykes with widths greater than 1000 meters have been reported.&lt;ref name=Bryan_2 /&gt;

Dykes are typically sub-vertical to vertical. When upward flowing (dyke-forming) magma encounters horizontal boundaries or weaknesses, such as between layers in a sedimentary deposit, the magma can flow horizontally creating a sill. Some sill provinces have areal extents &gt;1000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Bryan_2 /&gt;

==Correlations with LIP formation==

===Correlation with hot-spots===
The early volcanic activity of major [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], postulated to result from deep mantle plumes, is frequently accompanied by flood basalts. These flood basalt eruptions have resulted in large accumulations of basaltic lavas emplaced at a rate greatly exceeding that seen in contemporary volcanic processes. Continental rifting commonly follows flood basalt volcanism. Flood basalt provinces may also occur as a consequence of the initial hot-spot activity in ocean basins as well as on continents. It is possible to track the hot spot back to the flood basalts of a large igneous province; the table below correlates large igneous provinces with the track of a specific hot spot.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;M.A. Richards, R.A.

===Relationship to extinction events===
Eruptions or emplacements of LIPs appear to have, in some cases, occurred simultaneously with [[oceanic anoxic event]]s and [[extinction event]]s. The most important examples are the [[Deccan Traps]] ([[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]), the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] ([[Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction]]), the [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province]] ([[Triassic-Jurassic extinction event]]), and the [[Siberian traps]] ([[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]).

Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the association of LIPs with extinction events. The eruption of basaltic LIPs onto the earth's surface releases large volumes of sulfate gas, which forms sulfuric acid in the atmosphere; this absorbs heat and causes substantial cooling (e.g., the [[Laki (volcano)|Laki]] eruption in Iceland, 1783). Oceanic LIPs can reduce oxygen in seawater by either direct oxidation reactions with metals in hydrothermal fluids or by causing algal blooms that consume large amounts of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2113/gselements.1.5.289 |last=Kerr |first=AC |ref=CITEREFKerr2005 |date=December 2005 |title=Oceanic LIPS: Kiss of death |journal=Elements |volume=1 |pages=289–292 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ore deposits===
Large igneous provinces are associated with a handful of ore deposit types including:

===Related structures===

====Volcanic rifted margins====
[[File:mantleplume.png|right|240px|thumb|Extension thins the crust. Magma reaches the surface through radiating sills and dikes, forming basalt flows, as well as deep and shallow magma chambers below the surface. The crust gradually thins due to thermal subsidence, and originally horizontal basalt flows are rotated to become seaward dipping reflectors.]]

[[Volcanic passive margin|Volcanic rifted margins]] are found on the boundary of large igneous provinces. Volcanic margins form when rifting is accompanied by significant mantle melting, with volcanism occurring before and/or during continental breakup. Volcanic rifted margins are characterized by: a transitional crust composed of [[basalt]]ic [[igneous rock]]s, including [[lava]] flows, [[sill (geology)|sills]], [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[gabbro]]s, high volume basalt flows, seaward-dipping reflector sequences (SDRS) of basalt flows that were rotated during the early stages of breakup, limited passive-margin subsidence during and after breakup, and the presence of a lower crust with anomalously high seismic P-wave velocities in lower crustal bodies (LCBs), indicative of lower temperature, dense media.

Example of volcanic margins include:
* The Yemen margin
* The East Australian margin
* The West Indian margin
* The Hatton–Rockal margin
* The US East Coast
* The mid-Norwegian margin
* The Brazilian margins
* The Namibian margin

====Dike swarms====
[[File:Mackenzie dike swarm.png|thumb|right|Map of the Mackenzie dike swarm in Canada]]

A dike swarm is a large geological structure consisting of a major group of parallel, linear, or radially oriented dikes intruded within continental crust. They consist of several to hundreds of dikes emplaced more or less contemporaneously during a single intrusive event, and are magmatic and stratigraphic. Such dike swarms are the roots of a volcanic province. Examples include:
* [[Mackenzie dike swarm]] (Canadian Shield)
* [[Long Range dikes]] (Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada)
* [[Mistassini dike swarm]] (western Quebec, Canada)
* [[Matachewan dike swarm]] (northern Ontario, Canada)
* Sorachi Plateau and Belt (Hokkaido, Japan)
* Uralian dike swarm (Russia)&lt;ref name="Puchkov2016"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/11035897.2015.1118406 | title=A Devonian &gt;2000-km-long dolerite dyke swarm-belt and associated basalts along the Urals-Novozemelian fold-belt: part of an East-European (Baltica) LIP tracing the Tuzo Superswell | first=Victor | last=Puchkov | first2=Richard E. | last2=Ernst | first3=Michael A. | last3=Hamilton | first4=Ulf | last4=Söderlund | first5=Nina | last5=Sergeeva | journal=GFF | year=2016 | volume=138 | pages=6–16 | doi=10.1080/11035897.2015.1118406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sills====
A series of related sills that were formed essentially contemporaneously (within several million years) from related dikes comprise a LIP if their area is sufficiently large. Examples include:
* [[Winagami sill complex]] (northwestern Alberta, Canada)
* [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] (South Africa) with an area of over 66,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (25,000 sq mi), and a thickness reaching 9 kilometres (5.6&amp;nbsp;mi) thick.

== Biographies ==

=== Betsy Baker ===
'''Betsy Baker''' (August 20, 1842 – October 24, 1955) was born '''Betsy Ann Russell''' in [[Great Brington]], [[England]], emigrated to the United States, settled in [[Nebraska]], and became the world's oldest person.&lt;ref name=Nebraska&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nehca.org/UserDocs/Pages/Nebraska_Centenarians_1867_to_2001.pdf |title=Nebraska’s centenarians age 107 or above — 1867 to 2001 |first=E.A. |last=Kral |publisher=Nebraska Health Care Association |access-date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She lived for 65 years in [[Johnson County, Nebraska|Johnson County]], where she was called "the Queen mother of the Johnson County Fair" in 1953. At age 107, she received a congratulations letter from president [[Harry S. Truman]]. She was featured upon her 112th birthday in the US Army magazine ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.&lt;ref name=Nebraska /&gt; She died in [[Tecumseh, Nebraska|Tecumseh]], aged 113 years and 65 days.&lt;ref name=Nebraska /&gt;

Baker was the first supercentenarian listed by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's then-oldest person.&lt;ref name=Nebraska /&gt; In 2002, researchers confirmed she had been the world's oldest living person by modern verification standards for an unknown period of time prior to her death in 1955.&lt;ref name=Nebraska /&gt;&lt;ref name=nehca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nehca.org/pdfs/supercentenearians.pdf |title=NEHCA list of Nebraska supercentenarians |first=E.A. |last=Kral |publisher=Nebraska Health Care Association |date=7 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311154332/http://www.nehca.org/pdfs/supercentenearians.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second person in the world (after Delina Filkins) to have reached the age of 113 and to have been validated by modern standards.&lt;ref name=nehca /&gt;

=== Jeanetta Thomas ===
'''Jeanetta Jane Thomas''' (2 December 1869 – 5 January 1982)&lt;ref name="Supercentenarians who lived in the United Kingdom"/&gt; of [[Llantrisant]], Wales was a British [[supercentenarian]] and was mentioned in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] in the 1980s. She was a child of quarry owning parents.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian - 7 January 1982 (page 7)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas spent her youth in London working as a [[seamstress]]. At the age of around 40, she returned to Wales to open a [[drapery]] shop, which she ran until the age of 98.&lt;ref name="thomas1982guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldest woman dies aged 112|pages=1|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the oldest living person in the United Kingdom from 20 October 1980 until her death, at the age of 112 years and 34 days.

From the age of 107, Thomas resided at a nursing home at [[Cowbridge]], Wales.&lt;ref name="thomas1982guardian"/&gt; A photograph of her, which was taken the day before her 112th birthday, appeared in [[The Times]]. Had Thomas lived another six days, she would have broken the British longevity record which at that time was held by Alice Stevenson. Thomas still holds the record for the oldest Welsh-born woman ever, although Welshman John Evans and English-born Anna Eliza Williams (who died in Wales) both lived longer.

=== Daisy Adams ===
'''Daisy Irene Adams''' (née '''Woodward'''; 30 June 1880 – 8 December 1993) was for about nine months the oldest person in the UK, between 17 March 1993 and her death on 8 December 1993. She was from [[Church Gresley]], [[Derbyshire]]. She died at the age of 113 years and 161 days, and outlived her husband and three of her five children. Her husband died on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]], meaning that she was widowed in her thirties. Adams was a [[teetotal]]er and ate little. Her son Ted put her longevity down to "living a quiet life".&lt;ref name="AdamsTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Oldest Briton dies |work=The Times |date=9 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebecca Hewison ===
Rebecca Hewison (née '''Ramsdale'''; 19 October 1881 – 22 September 1994) was a British supercentenarian and the oldest person living in Britain until her death aged 112 years, 338 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roger Thatcher |title=The Demography of Centenarians in England and Wales |year= |publisher= |page= |quote= | jstor=3030263|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Grimsby]], Hewison was the fourth child of six born to Will, a timber merchant, and Betsy-Ann Ramsdale. She married George Hewison, a [[stonemason]], in Grimsby in 1905. In 1938 she moved to be with her daughter Frances in North London. Later in 1963 the family moved to [[Berrynarbor]] in [[Devon]] until Hewison was 105 when she returned to her hometown of Grimsby. In 1990 she met the [[Queen Mother]] at [[RAF Scampton]]. She also was a supporter of [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] football club and met the team in 1991, the year she turned 110 and also the year that the team completed a second successive promotion. Hewison was also taken for flights in [[aeroplane]]s and [[helicopter]]s at [[Humberside Airport]].

=== Lucy Jane Askew ===
'''Lucy Jane Askew''' (8 September 1883 – 9 December 1997) was an English [[supercentenarian]] and the [[List of European supercentenarians|oldest person in Europe]] at the time of her death at the age of 114 years and 92 days. Askew was born and died in [[Loughton]], [[Essex]]. She was born to Arthur George Askew and Susan Elizabeth Askew née Ellis, prosperous landowners. Lucy had five other siblings, all of whom she outlived, although three of them also lived past [[centenarian|100]]. Askew never married and was a devout [[Christian]]. Askew moved into a nursing home when she was 106 and survived a leg operation at 108. She was in good health until shortly before her death when she died peacefully in her sleep. She attributed her longevity to a modest lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Askew"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/38373.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=Britain's oldest woman dies at 114 |date=10 December 1997|accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AskewScotsman"&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain's oldest woman dies at 114 |work=The Scotsman |date=11 December 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amy Hulmes ===
'''Amy Isabel Hulmes''' née Matthews (5 October 1887 – 27 October 2001)&lt;ref name="GRGUK"&gt;[http://www.grg.org/Adams/L/UK.HTM Validated supercentenarians who lived and/or died in the UK] The Gerontology Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Bury, Greater Manchester]], [[England]] was a British [[supercentenarian]] who became the oldest person in Britain after the death of Eva Morris in November 2000, until her death at the age of 114 years and 22 days.&lt;ref name="GRGUK" /&gt; She was also thought to be the [[oldest people|oldest person in the world]], before the discovery of [[Maude Farris-Luse]] who was nine months older. Hulmes was the youngest of nine children, and gave up smoking at the age of 84. She could reportedly still touch her toes at the age of 105.&lt;ref name="Hulmes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/14/davidward |publisher=The Guardian |title=Accolades for a stout survivor from the Victorian era |date=14 June 2001|accessdate=24 January 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1361356/Woman-who-was-oldest-dies-at-114.html|title=Woman who was oldest dies at 114|publisher=The Telegraph|date=3 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Edith Ingamells ===
'''Edith 'Judy' Ingamells''' (née '''Gude''';  12 January 1894 – 1 March 2006)&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Southern|first=Kate|title=UK's Oldest woman dies|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/localnews/display.var.707184.0.uks_oldest_woman_dies_aged_112.php|publisher=EnfieldIndependent|date=15 March 2006|accessdate=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the oldest living person in the United Kingdom, following the death of 113-year-old Lucy d'Abreu on 7 December 2005, until her death aged 112 years 48 days. Judy's successor as the UK's oldest living person was Emmeline Brice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK's oldest woman dies aged 111|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/5239974.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2 August 2006|accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], Ingamells, nicknamed "Judy", moved to [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], [[London]] at the beginning of [[World War II|the Second World War]], where she married a florist, Percy, who worked for a family firm based in [[Covent Garden]]. She lived in other areas around [[England]], and worked as a [[Hatmaking|milliner]] before coming back to settle in Enfield in 1990. Ingamells had three daughters, five grandchildren, four great-grand children and two great-great-grandchildren. When serenaded with wartime songs on her 112th birthday, Ingamells responded "I don't like war songs. Who wants to remember something as horrible as the war?".&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; The secret to Ingamells' [[longevity]], said daughter Pat Bull at the time of her 111th birthday, was to "never look back, always look forward, which she is certainly doing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kate|last=Southern|title=Judy, 111, is the greatest gran|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/display.var.562877.0.judy_111_is_the_greatest_gran.php|publisher=Enfield Independent|date=20 January 2005|accessdate=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Small Khitan Inscription.jpg|thumb|Detail of Khitan small script on the epitaph of Yelü Dilie (1026-1092)]]
The '''list of Khitan inscriptions''' comprises a list of the corpus of known inscriptions written in the [[Khitan large script]] and the [[Khitan small script]].  These two [[Writing system|scripts]] were used by the [[Khitan people]] in northern [[China]] during the 10th through 12th centuries for writing the extinct [[Khitan language]].  The Khitan language was in use during the [[Liao Dynasty]] (907–1125), the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]] (1124–1218) and the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], but the last recorded Khitan speaker, [[Yelü Chucai]], died in 1243, and the language probably became extinct soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy, ''Shūshǐ huìyào'' (書史會要), written by Tao Zongyi (陶宗儀) in the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Khitan language is therefore little understood, and the two Khitan writing systems are only partially deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only one monument in a Khitan script was known before the 20th century, the ''Record of the Younger Brother of the Emperor of the Great Jin Dynasty'' (''Langjun xingji'' 郎君行記), which has stood in front of the tomb of [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu of Tang]] since at least 1618.  Until the 1920s it was believed to be written in the [[Jurchen script]]. Only after the discovery of the memorial tablets of [[Emperor Xingzong of Liao]] and his consort was it realized that the ''Record of the Younger Brother of the Emperor'' and the Liao-dynasty memorial tablets were both written in a Khitan script.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several more memorial tablets in the same script were discovered during the 1930s, including memorials for [[Emperor Daozong of Liao]] and his consort.  Initially it was not clear whether the script inscribed on these memorial tablets was the Khitan large script, recorded to have been devised in 920, or the Khitan small script, recorded to have been devised about 925.  A different, unknown script, which appeared more similar to Chinese (incorporating many [[Chinese character|characters]] borrowed directly from Chinese), had been discovered on a temple monument in 1935, as well as on a memorial to Xiao Xiaozhong in 1951; and in 1962 [[Jin Guangping]] suggested that these two monuments were written using the Khitan large script, and that the ''Record of the Younger Brother of the Emperor'' and the imperial memorial tablets were written using the Khitan small script.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This identification of the two Khitan scripts is now widely accepted.

There are about 15 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan large script, ranging in date from 986 to 1176, and about 40 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan small script, ranging in date from 1053 to 1171.&lt;ref name="Wu Yingzhe 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Wu Yingzhe|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two scripts are mutually exclusive (never occurring together on the same monument), but it is not known why the Khitan people used two different scripts, or what determined the choice of which script to use.

In addition to monumental inscriptions, short inscriptions in both Khitan scripts have also been found on tomb murals and rock paintings, and on various portable artefacts such as mirrors, amulets, [[paiza]] (tablets of authority given to officials and envoys), and special non-circulation coins.  A number of bronze official [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] with the seal face inscribed in the Khitan large script are also known.  The Khitan characters on these seals are engraved in a convoluted calligraphic style that imitates the Chinese "nine-fold" [[seal script]] style of calligraphy.

This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[Palau]]''', sorted by location.

The Republic of Palau ({{lang-pau|Beluu er a Belau}}), is an [[island nation]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It emerged from [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|trusteeship]] (administered by the [[United States]]) in 1994. It is one of the [[List of countries by date of independence|world's youngest]] and smallest [[sovereign states]]. In English, the name is sometimes spelled Belau in accordance with the native pronunciation.

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Wallis and Futuna'''. The avifauna of [[Wallis and Futuna]] include a total of 39 species, of which two have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans and three are rare or accidental. Two species are globally threatened.

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Wallis and Futuna.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.

*(A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Wallis and Futuna
*(I) '''[[Introduced species|Introduced]]''' - a species introduced to Wallis and Futuna as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

==Tropicbirds==
'''Order''': [[Phaethontiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phaethontidae]]

[[Tropicbird]]s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.

*[[Red-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon rubricauda''
*[[White-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon lepturus''

==Boobies and gannets==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Sulidae]]

The sulids comprise the [[gannet]]s and [[Booby|boobies]]. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.

*[[Red-footed booby]], ''Sula sula''
*[[Brown booby]], ''Sula leucogaster''

==Frigatebirds==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Fregatidae]]

[[Frigatebird]]s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.

*[[Great frigatebird]], ''Fregata minor'' (A)
*[[Lesser frigatebird]], ''Fregata ariel''

==Bitterns, herons and egrets==
'''Order''': [[Pelecaniformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Ardeidae]]

The family Ardeidae contains the [[bittern]]s, [[heron]]s and [[egret]]s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.

*[[Pacific reef heron]], ''Egretta sacra''

==Ducks, geese and swans==
'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]

Anatidae includes the [[duck]]s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.

*[[Pacific black duck]], ''Anas superciliosa''

==Hawks, kites and eagles==
'''Order''': [[Accipitriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Accipitridae]]

Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kites]], [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]] and [[Old World vulture]]s. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight.

*[[Swamp harrier]], ''Circus approximans'' (A)

==Rails, crakes, gallinules and coots==
'''Order''': [[Gruiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Rallidae]]

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the [[Rail (bird)|rails]], [[crake]]s, [[coot]]s and [[gallinule]]s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

*[[Buff-banded rail]], ''Gallirallus philippensis''
*[[Australasian swamphen]], ''Porphyrio melanotus''

==Plovers and lapwings==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Charadriidae]]

The family Charadriidae includes the [[plover]]s, [[dotterel]]s and [[lapwing]]s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

*[[Pacific golden plover]], ''Pluvialis fulva''

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[tattler (bird)|tattler]]s, [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

*[[Bar-tailed godwit]], ''Limosa lapponica''
*[[Whimbrel]], ''Numenius phaeopus''
*[[Bristle-thighed curlew]], ''Numenius tahitiensis''
*[[Wandering tattler]], ''Tringa incana''
*[[Ruddy turnstone]], ''Arenaria interpres''

==Gulls, terns, and skimmers==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Laridae]]

Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s, and [[skimmer]]s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years.

*[[Greater crested tern]], ''Thalasseus bergii'' (A)
*[[Black-naped tern]], ''Sterna sumatrana''
*[[Bridled tern]], ''Onychoprion anaethetus''

'''Order''': [[Psittaciformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Psittaculidae]]

*[[Blue-crowned lorikeet]], ''Vini australis''

==Cuckoos and anis==
'''Order''': [[Cuculiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Cuculidae]]

The family Cuculidae includes [[cuckoo]]s, [[Geococcyx|roadrunner]]s and [[Ani (bird)|anis]]. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs.

==Barn owls==
'''Order''': [[Strigiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Tytonidae]]

[[Barn owl]]s are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. They have long strong legs with powerful talons.

*[[Barn owl]], ''Tyto alba''

==Swifts==
'''Order''': [[Apodiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Apodidae]]

[[Swift]]s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.

*[[White-rumped swiftlet]], ''Aerodramus spodiopygius''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4475">[[File:Plano de Granada 1795.jpeg|thumb|Luis del Mármol Carvajal, "Historia del rebelión y castigo de los moriscos del Reino de Granada". Map of Granada, 1795.]]
'''Luis del Marmol Carvajal''' ([[Granada]], [[Spain]], 1520 - [[Velez Malaga]], [[Spain]], 1600) was a Spanish chronicler  living many years among the formerly [[Moorish]] [[Granada]] kingdom [[morisco]]'s  inhabitants and in the [[North African]] [[Berber people|Berber]] regions at the end of the 15th, and a good part of the 16th century.

He was proficient in [[Hassaniya]] Arabic, Berber [[Tamazight]] and/or the [[Algeria]]n [[Berber language|Berber]] [[Taqbaylit]] language. He was the illegitimate son of a High Justice Officer, Pedro del Marmol, who recognized him as his natural son in 1528. Whether his mother was some sort of slave or personal servant of this High Court Office lawyer, his  father, "given" or "bought" after the conquest of [[Granada]], 1492, cannot be confirmed.

It is well known that after the dissolution of the [[Caliph of Córdoba]] in the 11th century, many of the rulers and people from the kingdom of [[Granada]] maintained that their identities were essentially [[Zenata]] Berber. This may explain their settlements and affinity with the [[Merinid]] and after the  [[Wattasids]] dynasty, (وطاسيون waṭāsīyūn),  ruling [[Fes|Fez]], until, after 1554, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadi]]´s rulers, (Arabic: سعديون), from [[Tagmadert]], at the [[Draa river]] valley, near [[Tidzi]], near  [[Zagora, Morocco|Zagora]],  conquered the town.

It is said that for eight years Luis del Marmol was imprisoned in [[Algiers]], and that he returned to [[Spain]] in his mid-thirties after fighting in Italy, Spain and the North African litoral from the Atlantic shores. He spent time moving and visiting places, including Libyan Berber areas. Dates for these adventures are given just around 1554, curiously enough after the conquest of [[Fes|Fez]].
 
Luis del Mármol y Carvajal's history is a very valuable reference for it covers a period longer by a further 50 years, than that of the other [[Andalusia]]n chronicler, the diplomat and author of [[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Description of Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;Descrittione dell'Africa, Venice edition: 1550. French and Latin editions, 1556.&lt;/ref&gt;,  known as [[Leo Africanus|Joannes Leo Africanus]], or  al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan [[al-Fasi]], (ar: حسن ابن محمد الوزان الفاسي) (c. 1494 – c. 1554?).

Mercosur's purpose is to promote [[free trade]] and the fluid movement of goods, people, and currency. It currently confines itself to a customs union, in which there is free intra-zone trade and a common trade policy between member countries. The official languages are Spanish, Portuguese, and [[Guarani language|Guarani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercosur.int/buscarenmarco.jsp?url=http%3A//200.40.51.218/SAM/GestDoc/PubWeb.nsf/Busqueda%3FOpenAgent%26TextoBusqueda%3Dguarani%26modulo%3DNormativa%26ModuloBusqueda%3DNormativa%26lang%3DESP%20 |title=Buscar |publisher=Mercosur.int |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225063003/http://www.mercosur.int/buscarenmarco.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2F200.40.51.218%2FSAM%2FGestDoc%2FPubWeb.nsf%2FBusqueda%3FOpenAgent&amp;TextoBusqueda=guarani&amp;modulo=Normativa&amp;ModuloBusqueda=Normativa&amp;lang=ESP%20 |archivedate=25 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its foundation, Mercosur's functions have been updated, amended, and changed many times: it is now a full [[customs union]] and a [[trading bloc]]. Mercosur and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] are customs unions that are components of a continuing process of South American [[economic integration|integration]] connected to the [[Union of South American Nations]] (USAN).

== History ==
===Founding===
[[File:Sede del Mercosur - Montevideo, Uruguay.jpg|thumb|left|Headquarters of MERCOSUR, Montevideo, Uruguay.]]
Mercosur was established in 1991 by the [[Treaty of Asunción]], which was later amended and updated by the 1994 [[Treaty of Ouro Preto]].
Mercosur originated in 1988, when presidents [[Raúl Alfonsín]] of Argentina and [[José Sarney]] of Brazil signed the ''Argentina-Brazil Integration and Economics Cooperation Program'' or '''PICE''' (Portuguese: Programa de Integração e Cooperação Econômica Argentina-Brasil, Spanish: Programa de Integración y Cooperación Económica Argentina-Brasil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.uol.com.br/actasoft/actamercosul/espanhol/tratado_de_integracion.htm |title=Tratado de Integración, Cooperación y Desarrollo entre Brasil y Argentina |publisher=.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol Number 20 of the program also proposed the [[Gaucho (currency)|Gaucho]] as a currency for regional trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=November 1987 |title=Protocolo No. 20 |trans-title=Protocol Number 20 |url=http://www19.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/integracion_latinoamericana/documentos/129-Revista_Completa.pdf |language=es |journal=integración latinoamericana |volume=12 |issue=129 |pages=67 |doi= |access-date=2017-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding of the [[Mercosur Parliament]] was agreed upon at the December 2004 presidential summit. Up to 2010 it was planned to have 18 representatives from each country, regardless of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|url=http://www.mercosur.int/innovaportal/file/1104/1/2005_protocoloparlamentomcs_es.pdf|title=Protocolo Constitutivo del Parlamento del Mercosur|article=24|language=es|access-date=2017-07-19|date=9 de diciembre de 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2004|title=Hacia el Parlamento del MERCOSUR |trans-title= |url= |language=es |location=Montevideo |publisher= |isbn=9974-7868-4-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Memberships and suspensions===

====Suspension of Paraguay====
[[File:Izamiento.jpg|thumb|First lifting headquarters of Mercosur in Montevideo (2001).]]
After suspending Paraguay in 2012, the presidents of the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela) said in July 2013 that they would lift the suspension after the inauguration of Paraguay's newly elected President, Horacio Cartes, on 15 August 2013. However, Paraguay said it would not return to the Mercosur fold as long as Venezuela held its rotating presidency. Venezuela held Mercosur's rotating presidency until July 2014. Paraguay has objected to Venezuela's inclusion in the trading bloc, and says that a new member can only be included after a unanimous vote and argues that such a vote should not have been held while Paraguay was suspended.&lt;ref name="President Cartes sworn in"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23716472|title=Paraguay's President Horacio Cartes sworn in|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Minister [[Eladio Loizaga]] said he would rather deal with Paraguay's neighbours individually at first. "We have pending issues with Argentina, with Uruguay; we have to recompose all that," he said. "Mercosur will be later because our priority are {{sic}} the bilateral relations," he added.&lt;ref name="President Cartes sworn in" /&gt;

====Bolivian membership status====
On 7 December 2012, Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]] signed a protocol aimed at accession to full membership of the block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/mundo/instituto-boliviano-de-comercio-exterior-critica-entrada-do-pais-no-mercosul,0318cb643b58b310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|title=Instituto Boliviano de Comércio Exterior critica entrada do país no Mercosul|publisher=Terra.com|date=|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a proposal requires review and possible legislative approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Economia_Negocios/0,,MUL35367-9356,00-PETROBRAS+VALE+DEZ+VEZES+O+PIB+DA+BOLIVIA.html|title= Petrobras vale dez vezes o PIB da Bolívia|publisher=Globo.com|date=|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7 of 2015, the heads of Mercosur having decided to accept Bolivia's request to become a full member country, Bolivian president Evo Morales signed the Brasilia protocol. This acted Bolivia's full membership to the Mercosur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercosur.int/innovaportal/v/6923/2/innova.front/bolivia-ingresa-al-mercosur|title=MERCOSUR - Bolivia ingresa al MERCOSUR|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the presidents of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, while present in Rio de Janeiro for the Olympic Games, met to discuss suspending Venezuela from Mercosur. The three countries were in doubt about whether Venezuela was complying with the union's requirements for full membership, citing [[human rights violations]] among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/venezuelas-mercosur-membership-peril|title=Venezuela's Mercosur Membership is in Peril|publisher=Stratfor|date=August 8, 2016|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Venezuela was rejected from assuming the presidency of Mercosur by those three countries, prompting a dispute that continued in full throttle to the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay-Dispute-Venezuela-as-Mercosur-Head--20160804-0021.html|title=Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay Dispute Venezuela as Mercosur Head |publisher=Telesur|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2016, Paraguayan Foreign Minister [[Eladio Loizaga]] announced that Venezuela would be suspended in December 2016 after the nation was given a three-month period to reform its laws to abide to Mercosur requirements, with Mercosur noting that "rules governing trade, politics, democracy and human rights" needed to be overhauled in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela suspended from Mercosur beginning December|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-suspended-mercosur-beginning-december-000548012.html|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 2016, Venezuela was suspended from Mercosur.&lt;ref name=APvenSUS&gt;{{cite news|title=Mercosur suspends Venezuela for failure to follow rules|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2016/South-American-nations-say-they-have-suspended-Venezuela-from-the-Mercosur-trade-group-over-its-failure-to-comply-with-its-commitments-when-it-joined-the-group-in-2012/id-d6c987ac4ca84a1ebe5497d4169c6d0e|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member states ==

[[File:Mercosur.png|thumb|Dark blue: Full members&lt;br&gt;Grey blue: Associated members&lt;br&gt;Blue: Observer members]]
Mercosur is composed of 5 [[sovereign state|sovereign]] member states: Argentina; Brazil; Paraguay; Uruguay and Venezuela (suspended since December, 2016); and a state in process of incorporation, Bolivia (since July 17, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-mercosur-bolivia-idUSE5N0V801V20150717|title=Bolivia to join Mercosur as full member - Rousseff|date=17 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Impeachment of Fernando Lugo|impeachment of President Fernando Lugo]] by the Paraguayan Senate, this country was suspended from Mercosur, and the admittance of Venezuela as a full member became effective on 31 July 2012.&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt; Venezuela had four years to fully adapt to the trade bloc regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/articulos/2012/07/31/venezuela-tendra-cuatro-anos-para-adaptarse-a-normativa-comercial-del-mercosur-5443.html|title=Venezuela tendrá cuatro años para adaptarse a normativa comercial del Mercosur|work=Telesur|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and failed to do so, with the nation being suspended from Mercosur on 1 December 2016.&lt;ref name=APvenSUS/&gt;

Directly subordinated to the Common Market Group, the Work Subgroups draw up the minutes of the decisions to submit for the consideration of the Council, and study specific Mercosur concerns. The work subgroups are: 
* Commercial matters
* Customs matters
* Technical standards
* Tax and monetary policies relating to trade
* Land transport
* Sea transport
* Industrial and technology policies
* Agricultural policy
* Energy policy
* Coordination of macroeconomic policies
* Labor, employment and social security matters

Work subgroups are held quarterly, alternating in every member state, in alphabetical order, or at the Common Market Group Administrative Office. Activities are carried out by the Work Subgroups in two stages: preparatory and conclusive. In the preparatory stage, members of the Work Subgroups may request the participation of representatives from the private sector of each member state. The decision-making stage is reserved exclusively for official representatives of the member states. The delegations of representatives from the private sector in the preparatory stage of the Work Subgroup activities will have a maximum of three representatives for each member state directly involved in any of the stages of the production, distribution or consumption process for the products that fall within the scope of the subgroup's activities.,

== Geography ==

The territory of Mercosur consists of the combined territories of six of the 12 countries of [[South America]] and their population. Including the overseas territories of member states, Mercosur experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Antarctic]] to [[tropical climate|tropical]], rendering meteorological averages for Mercosur as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a [[subtropical climate]] (Uruguay, Southern Paraguay, Northeastern Argentina and Southern and Southeastern Brazil), or a tropical climate (Venezuela and Northeastern Brazil).

{{wide image|Iguazu Décembre 2007 - Panorama 7.jpg|1000px|&lt;center&gt;[[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between Argentina and Brazil is an area with [[subtropical climate]] and are one of the [[New7Wonders of Nature|New Seven World Natural Wonders]].&lt;/center&gt;}}

The region is highly urbanized, and the largest cities in Mercosur are the [[global city|global cities]] [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]]. The white population is the majority in Argentina and CLGT and represents around half the population in Brazil. Mestizos form the majority population in Paraguay.&lt;ref name=bar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoamerica.org/primera/lb_2011.pdf|title=Informe Latinobarómetro 2011|publisher=[[Latinobarómetro]]|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Mercosur nations have significant Native American populations, especially in Paraguay (Guaraní is a national language in the country along with Spanish, and almost all Paraguayans have Guaraní genetic ancestry), Argentina (especially in the country's North-Western, Northern, and Southern provinces), Brazil (in the Northern Amazonian states of the nation, where Native American tribes have vast reservation lands).

Along with Paraguay (where it is one of two official languages), sectors of Argentina (Corrientes) speak Guaraní. However, the Mercosur does not provide all, or even most, services in Guaraní. The official website, almost all official summits are only held in Spanish and Portuguese.

== Merchandise trade ==
Intra-Mercosur merchandise trade (excluding Venezuela) grew from US$10 billion at the inception of the trade bloc in 1991,&lt;ref name=ege&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionege.org/publicaciones/semanario/2011/06/12/Seccion1.html|title=El Mercosur hoy, a 20 años de su constitución|publisher=Fundación EGE|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033605/http://www.fundacionege.org/publicaciones/semanario/2011/06/12/Seccion1.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to US$88 billion in 2010; Brazil and Argentina each accounted for 43% of this total.&lt;ref name=dg /&gt; The trade balance within the bloc has historically been tilted toward Brazil,&lt;ref name=ege /&gt; which recorded an intra-Mercosur balance of over US$5 billion in 2010.&lt;ref name=dg /&gt;

Merchandise trade with the rest of the world in 2010 resulted in a surplus for Mercosur of nearly US$7 billion; [[trade in services]], however, was in deficit by over US$28 billion.&lt;ref name=dg /&gt; The EU and China maintained a nearly balanced merchandise trade with Mercosur in 2010, while the United States reaped a surplus of over US$14 billion; Mercosur, in turn, earned significant surpluses (over US$4 billion each in 2010) in its trade with Chile and Venezuela.&lt;ref name=dg /&gt; The latter became a full member in 2012.

Activities will be carried out by the Work Subgroups in two stages: preparatory and conclusive. In the preparatory stage, the members of the Work Subgroups may request the participation of representatives from the private sector of each member state. The decision-making stage is reserved exclusively for official representatives of the member states. The delegations of representatives from the private sector in the preparatory stage of the Work Subgroup activities will have a maximum of three representatives for each member state directly involved in any of the stages of the production, distribution or consumption process for the products that fall within the scope of the subgroup's activities.

== International jurisdiction over contractual matters ==
{{No sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Asunción - Tribunal del Mercosur.JPG|thumb|left|Court of Mercosur, in the city of [[Asunción]], Paraguay]]
The rules on litigation jurisdiction over contractual matters will apply to disputes arising from [[civil law (common law)|civil]] or commercial international contracts between private-law legal entities or individuals provided that: They are domiciled or headquartered in different member states: At least one of the parties to the contract is domiciled or headquartered in any member state and, additionally, has made a choice of jurisdiction in favor of a court in one of the member states. In this case, there must be a reasonable connection between the jurisdiction chosen and the controversy. The scope of the application of the international jurisdiction guidelines over contractual matters excludes the following: legal relationships between bankrupt entities/individuals and their creditors and any other analogous proceedings (especially concordatas composition with creditors); matters under agreements involving family and [[succession law]]; social security contracts; administrative contracts; employment contracts; consumer sales contracts; transport contracts; insurance policies; and rights in rem.

=== Choice of jurisdiction ===
Courts in member nations to whose jurisdiction the contracted parties have agreed to submit the matter in writing will have jurisdiction to settle controversies stemming from civil or commercial international contracts.

=== Agreement of choice ===
[[File:Satélites SABIA-Mar 1 y SABIA-Mar 2.jpg|thumb|The [[SABIA-Mar]], scheduled to launch in 2022, is a '''Brazilian/Argentine''' earth observation satellite.]]

The jurisdiction can be agreed on at the time the contract is signed, during the life of the contract, or even when the dispute actually arises. The validity and effects of the choice of venue will be governed by the law of the member nations that normally have jurisdiction to hear the case, always resorting to the law most favorable to the validity of the contract. Whether or not jurisdiction is chosen, such jurisdiction will be prorogated in favor of the courts of the member state where the proceedings are in fact filed, provided the respondent voluntarily allows this in an affirmative and unfeigned way.

=== Subsidiary jurisdiction ===
[[File:13557727 894310980694612 437275486302448628 n - copia.jpg|thumb|left|Mercosur Permanent Tribunal of Revision]]
Should the contracted parties not agree on courts competent to settle disputes, the member state chosen by the plaintiff of the case has jurisdiction—the court of the place where the contract is to be performed, the court of the domicile of the respondent, or the court of the [[domicile (law)|domicile]], or headquarters of the claimant when the latter can show that it has done its part. For purposes of item (i) above the place of performance of the contract is the member state where the obligations on which the claim is based have been or should be performed, taking into consideration the following: For contracts involving certain specific items, the place where they existed at the time of contract signing; For contracts involving specific items according to their type, the place of domicile of the debtor at the time of contract signing; For contracts involving [[fungible]] items, the place of domicile of the debtor at the time of conclusion of the contract; and For service rendering contracts:

* If in regard to items, this the place where they were at the time of contract signing.
* If effectiveness is related to any special place, this is the place where they were to produce effects.
* In all other cases, this is the place of domicile of the debtor at the time of contract signing. For purposes of application of second item above for determination of the domicile of the respondent in a contractual dispute involving individuals, the following will be taken into consideration: The habitual residence: On a subsidiary basis, the central place of business; and In the absence of any such considerations, the place where found, meaning the actual residence. When dealing with a legal entity, the determination of the domicile will be based on where the administrative headquarters have been set up. The claim plaintiff can, as an alternative, file in any of the places where the legal entity has branches, establishments, agencies or any other type of representation. Legal entities headquartered in any member state that have concluded contracts with any other member state can be sued in the courts of this latter state should there be any dispute as to the construction and implementation of the obligations regulated by contract. In the event there is a codefendant, a suit on contractual matters can be adjudicated with the courts of jurisdiction in the territory of the domicile of any of the parties to the litigation. Additionally, any claims entailing personal [[collateral contract|collateral]] rights or intervention of nonmember states in contractual obligations can be filed with the court hearing the main proceeding.

=== Counterclaims ===
In the event of there being a counterclaim based on any act or fact that served as the basis for the main proceeding, the courts hearing the main proceeding will be competent to hear any counterclaims that may arise.

Based on the premise that education is a fundamental factor in the regional [[Regional integration|integration]] process, educational courses at the primary or junior high level, provided that they do not entail technical studies, will be recognized by member states as being on the same level for all member nations. Likewise, to facilitate continuing education, course certificates issued by an institution accredited in one of the member states is valid in all other member states. Nontechnical primary and junior high level studies that have not been completed are accredited by any member state, thereby allowing course conclusion in another member nation. Studies are completed using an equivalency table to determine the level achieved.

=== Regional technical commission ===
A regional technical commission harmonizes mechanisms for accreditation across member nations, and resolves any situation not be covered by the equivalency table. This commission includes delegations from the ministries of education of each member nation, and meets whenever at least two member states think it necessary. Meeting sites are established on a rotating basis. Any disputes among member states as a result of application, construction, or noncompliance regarding provisions related to education are initially resolved by direct diplomatic negotiations. Should the countries not reach an accord or only partially resolve the dispute, they resort to procedures set out in the [[dispute resolution]] system. Should the member nations enter into a bilateral convention or accord with provisions more favorable to their students, the member states in question can apply whichever provisions they consider most advantageous.

== Free trade zones ==
{{More sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Ushuaia 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Province of [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]] in Argentina has a free-trade zone.]]
[[File:Manaus 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Manaus]], Brazil, has a free-trade zone.]]
The member nations can have commercial free-trade zones, industrial free-trade zones, export processing zones, and special customs areas, all of which target providing merchandise marketed or produced in these areas with treatment different from that afforded in their respective customs territories.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Uruguay's Vice-President [[Danilo Astori]] said the issue of a free trade agreement with the United States must be dealt and that "opportunities must be built".  He also said that "each Mercosur country should have a multiplicity of memberships. Mercosur must have joint international policies, an agreement on moderate protection from third parties and above all must have agreements with other trade blocks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bilaterals.org/spip.php?article23684#sthash.6BQkZrpp.dpuf |title=Uruguay calls on Mercosur to sign a free trade agreement with United States |publisher=bilaterals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tariffs ===
The member states can assess merchandise from these areas with the common external tariff used for Mercosur merchandise, or, in the case of certain special products, the domestic tariff prevailing in each individual state. In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, in the case of certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local companies do not feel the need to compete with large international companies.

=== Safeguards ===
Products produced or marketed in the [[free-trade zone]]s of each member nation will be eligible for the safeguard system whenever this entails an increase not provided for in imports, but capable of causing damages or threatened damages to the importer country.

=== Incentives ===
In the event of the producing nation's granting special incentives for production from the free-trade zones that are not compatible with the corresponding guidelines established under the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the member nation can make any adjustments needed to return the situation to equilibrium.

=== Creation ===
The member nations agreed that any free-trade zones that in August 1994 were already in operation could operate normally under Mercosur, along with any that are set up in light of legal guidelines prevailing or in course in congress during this same time period. This means that a member nation can no longer create new free-trade zones that are more privileged.
Mercosur is an effective agreement for its members.

=== Manaus and Tierra del Fuego FTZs ===
The actual implementation of Mercosur will not affect the special [[Manaus]], Brazil, and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego]], Argentina, free-trade zones organized in light of their special geographic situations. These two free-trade zones may continue normal operations until 2013.

== Reciprocal promotion and protection ==
{{No sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:CUPULAMERCOSUL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Celso Amorim]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], [[Sérgio Cabral]] during the leadership of Mercosur/Mercosul.]]
The nations subscribing to the [[Treaty of Asunción|Asunción Treaty]] consider that the creation and maintenance of conditions favorable to individual or corporate investment for the jurisdiction of one of the member states in the territory of another state is essential to intensify the economic cooperation targeted so as to accelerate the integration process among all four member states. In this context, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil signed on 1 January 1994 in the city of [[Colonia del Sacramento]], Uruguay, the Colonia Protocol for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Mercosur Investments (Colonia Protocol). It was established in this protocol that investments under Mercosur by investors resident or domiciled in the territory of any member state will be entitled to treatment no less favorable than that accorded by the other member state to national investors or nonmember states.

=== Investors ===
For the purposes of constructing the [[Colonia (United States)|Colonia]] Protocol, investors are considered to be: Individuals who are citizens of any of the member nations or that reside there on a permanent basis or are domiciled there, with due regard for legislation prevailing in such territory; Legal entities organized pursuant to the legislation of one of the member nations that are headquartered there; and Legal entities organized in the territory where the investment is made, actually and directly or indirectly controlled by the legal entities or individuals mentioned above.

=== Investment ===
The term investment includes all types of assets such as: movable or immovable property, such as rights in rem and guarantee in rem rights; shares, corporate holdings and any other type of corporate participation; credit instruments and rights that may have an economic value; intellectual property rights or materials, Including copyrights and [[industrial property]] rights such as patents, industrial drawings, trademarks, commercial names, technical procedures, know-how and goodwill; Economic concessions involving [[public law]], such as research, cultivation, extraction or natural resource exploration concessions.

=== Freedom to invest ===
[[File:Ponte Internacional Barão de Mauá como Patrimônio Cultural do MERCOSUL na cidade de Jaguarão (18125301660).jpg|thumb|right|Brazil–Uruguay international border]]
The nation receiving the investment cannot avail itself of unjustified or discriminatory means capable of restricting the investor's freedom to manage, maintain, use, enjoy and dispose of its investments.

=== Tax ===
The member states are not however obligated to extend to investors in the other nations signatory to the Colonia Protocol the [[Cost–benefit analysis|benefits]] of any treatment, preference or [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] resulting from international accords relating fully or partially to tax matters.

=== Exceptions ===
In addition, the member nations can temporarily establish a list of exceptions where the new treatment will not yet prevail.
[[File:Marco das 3 fronteiras.jpg|thumb|right|Landmark of the Three Borders – Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, in [[Foz do Iguaçu]].]]
In this way, the various member nations decided to except the following economic sectors:
*'''Argentina:''' ownership of real estate on the frontier strip, air transportation, naval industry, nuclear power plants, uranium mining, insurance and fishery;
*'''Brazil:''' mineral prospecting and mining; use of [[hydraulic energy]]; health care; television and radio broadcasting and telecommunications in general, acquisition or leasing of rural properties; participation in the financial [[intermediation]], insurance, social security and capitalization systems; chartering and cabotage as well as inland navigation;
*'''Paraguay:''' ownership of real property on the frontier strip; communications, including radio and television broadcasting; air, sea and land transportation; electricity, water and telephone services; prospecting for hydrocarbons and strategic minerals; import and refining of petroleum derivatives and postal services;
*'''Uruguay:''' electricity; hydrocarbons; basic petrochemicals, atomic energy; prospecting for strategic minerals; financial intermediation; railways, telecommunications; radio broadcasting; press and audiovisual means.

=== Expropriation and compensation ===
The member nations undertook to do nothing to [[nationalize]] or expropriate investments in their territories that pertain to investors from the signatory countries, unless such measures are taken based on public need. In such case, nothing discriminatory can be done, but everything must be implemented by due legal process. Compensation for the investment holder that is expropriated or nationalized should be both adequate and effective, and made in advance, based on the real investment value determined at the time the decision is publicly announced by the proper authorities. This payment will be updated until actual payment, and the affected investor will receive interest.

=== Transfers ===
The original member state investors will be ensured free transfer of their investments and any earnings thereon. These transfers can be made in freely convertible currency, using the [[exchange rate]] prevailing on the market pursuant to the procedures established by the member state receiving the investment. Member nations cannot adopt any exchange measures restricting free transfer of the funds invested or from activities exercised in their respective territories.

== Role and potential ==
[[File:Foto oficial 49° Cumbre del Mercosur.jpg|thumb|left|297x297px|Plenary Session of the 49th Mercosur Summit in [[Asunción|Asuncion]], December 28, 2015.]]
Some South Americans see Mercosur as giving the capability to combine resources to balance the activities of other global economic powers, especially the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, N: ''Regionalist governance in the new political economy of development: relaunching the Mercosur''. Third World Quarterly 22: 565–583. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization could also potentially pre-empt the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA);&lt;ref&gt;Robles, F (2001): ''Latin American corporate strategy under the new regionalism'' in Prakash, A. and Hart, J.A. (eds.) Responding to globalization. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; however, over half of the current Mercosur member countries rejected the FTAA proposal at the IV Cumbre de las Américas ([[4th Summit of the Americas|IV Summit of the Americas]]) in Argentina in 2005.

The development of Mercosur was arguably weakened by [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|the collapse of the Argentine economy in 2001]] and it has still seen internal conflicts over trade policy, between Brazil and Argentina, Argentina and Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil, etc. In addition, many obstacles must be addressed before the development of a common currency in Mercosur.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman Reis, T. (2005). "Aspectos Jurídicos da Criação de um sistema monetário para o Mercosul", Hardman Reis e Gomes Eduardo (Coord.) Globalização e Comércio Internacional no Direito da Integração. São Paulo, Ed. Lex/Aduaneiras, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Mercosur signed a cooperation agreement with the [[Andean Community of Nations]] trade bloc (CAN) and they published a joint letter of intent for future negotiations towards integrating all of South America.&lt;ref&gt;Davison, Phil (4 December 2004). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/south-america-takes-first-step-to-a-union-of-nations-676327.html South America takes first step to a union of nations]. ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect of increased political integration within the organization, as per the [[European Union]] and advocated by some, is still uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4079505.stm S America launches trading bloc]. [[BBC News]]. 9 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia, also a member of CAN and an associate member of Mercosur before the UNASUR process started, plays a crucial part in relations, says Marion Hörmann, since Bolivia is traditionally seen as a mediator between the Andean countries and the rest of South America. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927084954/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/168821/index.en.shtml Regional Integration: Key Role for Bolivia]

The bloc comprises a population of more than [[List of countries by population|270 million people]], and the combined Gross Domestic Product of the full-member nations is in excess of US$3.0 trillion a year ([[Purchasing power parity]], PPP) according to [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) numbers, making Mercosur the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest]] economy in the World. It is the fourth-largest trading bloc after the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Klonsky, Joanna; Hanson, Stephanie (20 August 2009). [http://www.cfr.org/publication/12762/ Mercosur: South America's Fractious Trade Bloc]. [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The working of Mercosur has not met with universal approval within interested countries. Chile has to a certain extent preferred to pursue bilateral agreements with trading partners, and there have been calls from Uruguayan politicians to follow this example.&lt;ref&gt;Garces, Raul O. (6 August 2009). [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ihY6g-y0Kd3aNTbDQqZz2x6JcdAAD99TMQFG0 Uruguay: Ex-dictator's son says quit Mercosur]. [[Associated Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Placas de veículos do Mercosul mercosur.jpg|thumb|309x309px|[[Vehicle registration plates of the Mercosur|Mercosur common plates]], in use since January 2016]]
With the 2005 cooperation agreement with Mercosur, the [[Andean Community]] gained four new associate members: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These four Mercosur members were granted associate membership by the Andean Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in an enlarged session with the Commission (of the Andean Community) on 7 July 2005. This move reciprocates the actions of Mercosur, which granted associate membership to all the Andean Community nations by virtue of the Economic Complementarity Agreements ([[Free Trade Agreement]]s) signed between the CAN and individual Mercosur members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunidadandina.org/ingles/common/mercosur2.htm |title=Common Foreign Policy / CAN – Mercosur – Andean Community |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407152202/http://www.comunidadandina.org/ingles/common/mercosur2.htm |archivedate=7 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of Surveying''' was originally the Michigan Museum of Surveying, but in 2007, the museum moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]] to become a national museum. The museum officially opened in Springfield on September 24, 2010 and closed in January, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Surveying Closed|url=http://interact.stltoday.com/pr/arts-entertainment/PR010313104311476|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=10 December 2015|date=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space, the museum housed many exhibits on [[surveying]], a room sponsored by [[NCEES]], and the [[Science on a Sphere]]. The museum was on the Old State Capitol Plaza, just north of the [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site (Illinois)|Old State Capitol]]. 

==Exhibits==
The museum had three exhibit rooms:
*The first exhibit room was funded by NCEES. The demographics of surveyors show an [[Aging in the American workforce|aging workforce]], and the goal of this exhibit was to inspire students to become surveyors. The donation was $75,000 which was used to construct a 45 seat theater. The theater showed videos on the history and evolution of surveying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/About_NCEES/News/News_Pages/NCEES_inks_funding_arrangement_with_National_Museum_of_Surveying.php  NCEES: NCEES inks funding arrangement with National Museum of Surveying]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The second exhibit was on the history of surveying. 
*The last exhibit was the Science on a Sphere, which was funded by [[NOAA]]

'''Ogaden''' (pronounced and often spelled ''Ogadēn''; {{lang-so|Ogaadeen}}) is the unofficial name of the [[Somali Region]], the territory comprising the eastern portion of [[Ethiopia]]. The inhabitants are predominantly ethnic [[Somali people|Somali]]s.

The region, which is around 200,000 square kilometres, borders [[Djibouti]], [[Somalia]] and [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebru Tareke, "The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited," in Board of Trustees, Boston University, ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies''. Boston University African Studies Center, 2000, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt; Important towns include [[Jijiga]], [[Degahbur]], [[Gode]], [[Kebri Dahar]], [[Fiq, Ethiopia|Fiq]], [[Shilabo]], [[Kelafo]], [[Werder, Ethiopia|Werder]] and [[Danan, Ethiopia|Danan]].

The Ogaden is a [[plateau]], with an elevation above sea level that ranges from 1,500 metres in the northwest, falling to about 300 metres along the southern limits and the [[Shebelle Valley|Wabi Shebelle]] valley. The areas with altitudes between 1,400 and 1,600 metres are characterised as [[semi-arid]]; receiving as much as 500–600&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall annually. More typical of the Ogaden is an average annual rainfall of 350&amp;nbsp;mm and less. The landscape consists of dense shrubland, bush grassland and bare hills.&lt;ref&gt;Ayele Gebre-Mariam, [http://www.nccr-north-south.unibe.ch/publications/Infosystem/On-line%20Dokumente/Upload/AGM_CriticalIssueLand.pdf ''The Critical Issue of Land Ownership'']{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Working Paper No. 2 (Bern: NCCR North-South, 2005), p. 12 (accessed 19 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, the Ogaden has suffered from increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, which has led to an increasing frequency of major droughts: in 1984–85; 1994; and most recently in 1999–2000, during which pastoralists claim to have lost 70–90 percent of their cattle.&lt;ref&gt;CHF International, [http://www.chfhq.org/files/3707_file_Somali_Region_Assessment_8.4.06.pdf ''Grassroots Conflict Assessment in the Somali Region''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726084227/http://www.chfhq.org/files/3707_file_Somali_Region_Assessment_8.4.06.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }} (Aug. 2006), p. 12 (accessed 12 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Somali Region Map.svg|250px|thumb|right|Map of Ethiopia highlighting the [[Somali Region]].]]

There are few historical texts written about the people who lived in what is known today as the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. Ogaden was part of the Somali [[Ifat Sultanate]] in the 13th and beginning of the 14th centuries AD. The borders of the sultanate extended to the Shewa - Addis Ababa area of Ethiopia. The Ifat Sultanate was succeeded by the [[Adal Sultanate]]. There was an ongoing conflict between the Adal Sultanate and the Christian Kingdom of Abyssinia throughout this time. During the first half of the 16th century, most of Abyssinian territory was conquered and came under the rule of Adal, when [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], the leader of the Somali-dominated Adal's Army, took control.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Ogaden (Western Somali) Struggle for Self - Determination'', first edition (London:Mohamed Abdi, 2007), pp. 4-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last quarter of the 19th century, the region was conquered by [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] of Abyssinia and Ethiopia solidified their claim by treaties in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'' (London: [[James Currey]], 1991), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

I.M. Lewis argues a subtly different interpretation of this treaty, emphasising that "the lost lands in the [[Haud]] which were excised from the Protectorate [i.e. British Somaliland] were not, however ceded to Ethiopia".&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Lewis, ''A Modern History of the Somali'', fourth edition (Oxford: [[James Currey]], 2002),p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Ethiopia exerted little administrative control east of Jijiga until 1934 when an Anglo-Ethiopian boundary commission attempted to demarcate the [[Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897|treaty boundary]]. This boundary is still disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Modern History'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italians annexed the region to [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1936 after their [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|conquest of Ethiopia]]. Following their conquest of [[Italian East Africa]], the British sought to let the Ogaden be unified with [[British Somaliland]] and the former Italian Somaliland, to realize [[Greater Somalia]] which was supported by many Ogaden Somalis.&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''History'' p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia unsuccessfully pleaded before the London Conference of the Allied Powers to gain the Ogaden and [[Eritrea]] in 1945, but their persistent negotiations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=35701 |title=Ethiopia offers Britain land in exchange for Zeila port of Somaliland - 1946 • Ethiopian Review |publisher=Ethiopianreview.com |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATQQ0FMS1FQC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=british+corridor+somaliland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N3MW7LTGAu&amp;sig=pDHOxfJhW6fwLYeWRyhPfcaMR-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=779QT_6NDIGLhQeUqOnkCw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20corridor%20somaliland&amp;f=false |title=The British Empire in the Middle East, 1945-1951: Arab Nationalism, the ... - Wm.

In the late 1970s, internal unrest in the Ogaden resumed. The [[Western Somali Liberation Front]], spurred by Makhtal Dahir, used guerilla tactics to resist Ethiopian rule. Ethiopia and Somalia fought the [[Ogaden War]] over control of this region and its peoples.

In 2007, the [[Ethiopian Army]] launched a [[2007 Ogaden conflict|military crackdown in Ogaden]] after Ogaden rebels killed dozens of civilian staff workers and guards at an Ethiopian oil field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/world/africa/25ethiopia.html Ethiopian Rebels Kill 70 at Chinese-Run Oil Field]&lt;/ref&gt; The main rebel group is the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] under its Chairman Mohamed O. Osman, which is fighting against the Ethiopian government. Some Somalis who inhabit Ogaden claim that Ethiopian military kill civilians, destroy the livelihood of many of the ethnic Somalis and commit crimes against the nomads in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Ogaden Human Rights Committee | title=Mass Killings in the Ogaden: Daily Atrocities Against Civilians by the Ethiopian Armed Forces | url=http://www.ogadenrights.org/MASS_KILLINGS_ogaden.pdf | date=2006-02-20 | accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs revealed massive brutality and killings by the ONLF rebels, which the Ethiopian government labels "terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/pha100207.htm |title=US Committee on Foreign Affairs on Ethiopia |publisher=Foreignaffairs.house.gov |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127125819/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/pha100207.htm |archivedate=2012-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of this war can't be established due to a media blockade in the Ogaden region.

A '''principality''' (or '''princedom''') can either be a [[monarchy|monarchical]] [[feudatory]] or a [[sovereign state]], ruled or reigned over by a [[monarch]] with the title of [[prince]] or by a monarch with another title considered to fall under the generic meaning of the term ''prince''.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Princesofmonacoandwales.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Serene Highness|His Serene Highness]] [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] (on the left) represents a principality where he wields administrative power. [[Royal Highness|His Royal Highness]] [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince Charles, Prince of Wales]] represents a titular principality with limited power.]] --&gt;

==Terminology==
Most of these states have historically been a [[Body politic|polity]], but in some occasions were rather territories in respect of which a princely title is held. The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality.

Generally recognised surviving sovereign principalities are [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], and the co-principality of [[Andorra]]. Extant royal [[primogenitures]] styled as principalities include [[Asturias]] (Spain). The [[Principality of Wales]] existed in the northern and western areas of Wales between the 13th and 16th centuries; the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Act of 1536]] which legally incorporated [[England and Wales|Wales within England]] removed the distinction between those areas and the [[Welsh Marches|March of Wales]], but no principality covering the whole of Wales was created. Since that time, the title [[Prince of Wales]] (together with [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]], among other titles) has traditionally been granted to the heir to the reigning monarch of the [[United Kingdom]], but it confers no responsibilities for government in Wales. It has country status and is one of four countries in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Geraint H.|title=A Concise History of Wales|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521823678|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=sriBkaHhpREC&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Principality of Catalonia]] existed in the north-eastern areas of Spain between 14th and 18th centuries, as the term for the territories ruled by the Catalan courts, until the defeat of the Habsburgs in the Spanish succession war, when these institutions were abolished due to their support for the Habsburg pretender. Principality of Asturias is the official name of autonomous community of [[Asturias]].

The term '''principality''' is also sometimes used generically for any small monarchy, especially for small sovereign states ruled by a monarch of a lesser rank than a king, such as a [[Fürst]] (usually translated in English as "prince"), as in Liechtenstein, or a [[Grand Duke]]. No sovereign [[duchy]] currently exists, but [[Luxembourg]] is a surviving example of a sovereign grand duchy. Historically there have been sovereign principalities with many styles of ruler, such as [[Countship]], [[Margraviate]] and even [[Lordship]], especially within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

While the preceding definition would seem to fit a [[princely state]] perfectly, the European historical tradition is to reserve that word for native monarchies in colonial countries, and to apply "principality" to the Western monarchies.

==European==
===Development===
Though principalities existed in antiquity, even before the height of the [[Roman Empire]], the principality as it is known today developed in the [[Middle Ages]] between 750 and 1450 when [[feudalism]] was the primary [[economic]] and social system in much of Europe. Feudalism increased the power of local princes within a king's lands. As princes continued to gain more power over time, the authority of the king was diminished in many places. This led to political fragmentation as the king's lands were broken into mini-states ruled by princes and dukes who wielded absolute power over their small territories. This was especially prevalent in [[Europe]], and particularly with the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]].

During the [[Late Middle Ages]] from 1200 to 1500, principalities were often at war with each other as royal houses asserted sovereignty over smaller principalities. These wars caused a great deal of instability and economies were destroyed. Episodes of [[bubonic plague]] also reduced the power of principalities to survive independently. Eventually, agricultural progress and development of new trade goods and services boosted commerce between principalities. Many of these states became wealthy, expanded their territories and improved the services provided to their citizens. Princes and dukes developed their lands, established new ports and chartered large thriving cities. Some used their new-found wealth to build palaces and other institutions now associated with sovereign states.

===Consolidation===
[[File:Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann I Josef]], last prince of [[Liechtenstein]] prior to the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]]]
While some principalities prospered in their independence, less successful states were swallowed by stronger royal houses. Europe saw consolidation of small principalities into larger [[monarchy|kingdoms]] and [[empire]]s. This had already happened in [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the first millennium, and this trend subsequently led to the creation of such states as [[France]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. Another form of consolidation was orchestrated in [[Italy]] during the Renaissance by the [[Medici]] family. A banking family from [[Florence]], the Medici took control of governments in various [[Italy|Italian]] regions and even assumed the [[papacy]]. They then appointed family members as princes and assured their protection. [[Prussia]] also later expanded by acquiring the territories of many other states.

However, in the 17th to 19th centuries, especially within the Holy Roman Empire, the reverse was also occurring: many new small sovereign states arose as a result of transfers of land for various reasons.

Notable principalities existed until the early 20th century in various regions of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].

===Nationalism===
[[Nationalism]], the belief that the nation-state is the best vehicle to realise the aspirations of a people, became popular in the late 19th century. A characteristic of nationalism is an identity with a larger region such as an area sharing a common language and culture. With this development, principalities fell out of favour. As a compromise, many principalities united with neighbouring regions and adopted constitutional forms of government, with the monarch acting as a mere figurehead while administration was left in the hands of elected parliaments. The trend in the 19th and 20th centuries was the abolition of various forms of monarchy and the creation of republican governments led by popularly elected presidents.

===Ecclesiastical principalities===
Several principalities where genealogical inheritance is replaced by succession in a religious office have existed in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], in each case consisting of a feudal polity (often a former secular principality in the broad sense) held ''ex officio'' — the closest possible equivalent to hereditary succession — by a [[Prince of the church]], styled more precisely according to his ecclesiastical rank, such as [[Prince-bishop]], [[Prince-abbot]] or, especially as a form of crusader state, [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]].

Some of these instances were merely religious offices without sovereign power over any territory, while others, such as [[Prince-bishop of Salzburg|Salzburg]] and [[Prince-bishop of Durham|Durham]], shared some of the characteristics of secular princes.

==Asia==
Prior to the European colonialism, [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]] were under the influence of [[Indosphere]] of [[greater India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term ''indianization'' [[George Coedes]] defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhist|Buddhism]] and the [[sanskritization|Sanskrit dialect]].&lt;ref name=coedes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date=1967|publisher=Australian National University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|spread of Hinduism]] and [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhism]]. [[Indian honorifics]] also influenced the [[Malay styles and titles|Malay]], [[Thai royal and noble titles|Thai]], [[Filipino styles and honorifics|Filipino]] and [[Indonesian names#Honorifics|Indonesian]] honorifics.&lt;ref name=tit1&gt;Krishna Chandra Sagar, 2002, An Era of Peace, Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colonial context, the term [[princely states]] was used, especially for those that came under the sway of a European colonising power: for example the [[British India]]n and neighbouring or associated (e.g., Arabian) princely states were ruled by monarchs called Princes by the British, regardless of the native styles, which could be equivalent to royal or even imperial rank in the [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] cultures.

==Other principalities==
===Other===
Principalities have also existed in ancient and modern civilizations of [[Africa]], [[Pre-Columbian America]] and [[Oceania]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Micronational principalities===
Several [[micronation]]s, which ''de facto'' have few characteristics of sovereign states and are not recognized as such, more or less seriously claim the status of sovereign principalities. Examples are [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]], a former military fort in the [[North Sea]]; [[Principality of Seborga|Seborga]], internationally considered a small town in [[Italy]]; and [[Principality of Hutt River|Hutt River]] and [[Principality of Wy]] in [[Mosman]], internationally considered to be in [[Australia]].

'''Real estate in Panama''' is about how the [[Republic of Panama]]'s [[real estate industry]] has grown since 2006, as foreign investments helped to fuel Panama's economy and housing market.

In spite of the economic and housing market growth, [[poverty]] is a problem in Panama.  Most indigenous people live in extreme poverty while others located in rural areas live in basic poverty.  Lack of sanitation, electricity, basic water, health, and education amongst the poor is a serious problem affecting Panama’s housing conditions.

In an attempt to encourage foreign investments for real estate projects and infrastructure, the government of Panama enacted laws protecting foreigners and citizens who make investments.

[[Corruption]] permeates the real estate market including claims of drug profits and money laundering financing real estate projects.

Similar to the U.S. and Canada, Panama uses a system of publicly recorded titled deeds as proof of real estate ownership.  A unique Rights of Possession system exists allowing individuals to occupy unused government lands in order to make improvements to them.

==Background==
The Republic of Panama is located in [[Central America]] between the [[Republic of Costa Rica]] and the [[Republic of Colombia]].

Since the [[Panama Canal]] opened in 1914, The [[Economy of Panama]] has depended on banking, transportation, and the [[service industry]].&lt;ref&gt;2015 Index of Economic Freedom: Panama http://www.heritage.org/index/country/panama&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2012 report by the [[U.S. State Department]], Panama is open to foreign investment with a generally positive investment climate and "sterling economic success" enjoying high economic growth with expected continuing "strong growth in the years ahead".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Dept., "2012 Investment Climate – Panama"  June 2012,   http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2012/191215.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The World Bank]] reported Panama has experienced the fastest economic growth in Latin America for the past ten years.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, "Panama Overview" 2014 http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/panama/overview&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of its growing economy, nearly 25% of Panama's population lives in poverty in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, "World Factbook: Panama 2015", https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pm.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Poverty==

The World Bank states that while Panama has experienced the fastest economic growth since 2006, indigenous children have "significantly less access to basic services such as education, electricity and sanitation than children in rural or urban areas."&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, "Panama Overview"  August 18, 2015   http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/panama/overview&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Bank also claims that Panama has the largest inequality of separation between the rich and the poor in the world.  Poverty amongst the indigenous areas is "abysmal" where 95% are poor and 86% "live in extreme poverty".  In the rural areas away from the cities 65% live in poverty and 39% live in extreme poverty.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, "Panama: Poverty Assessment: Priorities and Strategies for Poverty Reduction" 2011

Panama's real estate market began to grow in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Davis, "Panama Real Estate an Insider's Game?", The Visitor, May 31, 2013  https://ftp.thevisitorpanama.com/2013/05/panama-real-estate-an-insiders-game/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Kiselev, "The concrete Jungle: Panama's Construction Explosion", Lehigh University Press, https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/the_concrete_jungle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2006 - 2007'''

The building boom began with the proposed skyscraper project called the [[Palacio de la Bahia]] , even though it was cancelled in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Skyscraper Page "Palacio de la Bahia", http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=41303&lt;/ref&gt;   A second tall skyscraper project was also proposed around the same time.

"The real estate boom in Panama City started in 2006."&lt;ref&gt;PTY English News, http://www.ptyenglishnews.com/Panama-Real-Estate.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The failure of the [[Palacio de la Bahia]] and [[Ice Tower]] skyscraper projects generated a lot of international media publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Guide, June 22, 2007, http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20070622080305821&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama City's real estate boom really got a lift when [[Donald Trump]] announced the construction of a huge hotel, casino, condominium apartments, and office building on the waterfront in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;The Tico Times newspaper, "Donald Trump Launches Luxury Tower in Panama", April 28, 2006  http://www.ticotimes.net/2006/04/28/donald-trump-launches-luxury-tower-in-panama&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower]] was to be a $220 million development including a hotel, casino, yacht club, full-service spa and a private beach club.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, "Trump Ocean Club, International Hotel &amp; Tower", May 5, 2006 https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/05/realestate/05break1.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;  The 70 story [[Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower]] building shaped like a ship's sail was to be the most expensive and largest building south of the United States with Donald Trump's name helping Panama's image worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, "Donald Trump Goes on an Adventure in Panama", March 20, 2010, http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1973869,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Donald Trump's Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower began construction in 2007 and the hotel officially opened on July 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Skyscraper Page, "Trump Ocean Club International Hotel &amp; Tower",

The former U.S. Howard Air Force Base was to be developed on a specialized economic zone of 1,400 hectares called the [[Panama Pacifico]] to be developed by [[London &amp; Regional Properties]] from the [[United Kingdom]] , with an initial investment of $705 million, which included 20,000 homes, according to the government's Panama Pacific Agency (APP).&lt;ref&gt;Panama Pacific Agency (APP) http://www.app.gob.pa/index.php?p=app&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reuters]] claimed that Panama's construction boom may have been fueled by illegal drug money based on the amount of empty new condominium buildings while construction continued including 9 out of 10 of Latin America's tallest buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Beatty, Reuters, "Construction boom in Panama is built on drug money", December 7, 2007  https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/12/31/us-panama-skyscrapers-idUSN2053334120071231&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all of the positive publicity there were some speculating a real estate bubble would burst because most Panamanians couldn't afford the high prices and not enough foreigners would purchase the expensive new apartments.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Molano, Latin Trade, "Panama: A Bubble Waiting to Burst" September 26, 2006  http://latintrade.com/panama-a-bubble-waiting-to-burst/&lt;/ref&gt;

The skyscraper construction boom caused abusive conditions by developers against buyers resulting in a Third Court of Appeals of Panama decision dated November 27, 2007 whereby new rules were created to stem the abusive conditions in new construction purchase and sales contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Achurra M. of Pardini law firm, HG.Org Legal Resources, May 20, 2008 "Real Estate Buyer Rights in Panama: Recent Developments" http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6188&lt;/ref&gt;

Since taking control of the Panama Canal from the U.S. in 2000 the country had seen dramatic growth with visible prosperity in Panama City, but Panama still suffered from widespread poverty.&lt;ref&gt;NPR Organization, "Panama's Canal Divides A Country Into Haves And Have-Nots" June 1, 2014  https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/05/30/317394468/panamas-canal-divides-a-country-into-haves-and-have-nots&lt;/ref&gt;  While Panama prospered over the last 10 years, the benefits were not shared by all where the country's welfare still needed to be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;Fox News Latino, "Panama Canal Centennial Spoiled By Specter Of Expansion Woes", August 16, 2014 http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/money/2014/08/16/panama-canal-centennial-spoiled-by-specter-expansion-woes/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015'''

In 2015, international investors were said to fuel Panama City's real estate growth.&lt;ref&gt;PTY Life Magazine, "International Investors Fuel Panama City Real Estate Growth", March 2015, http://pty.life/panama-city-real-estate-growth/&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreign investments in Panama of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2015 increased by 32% over the same period in 2014 according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census.&lt;ref&gt;PTY Life Magazine, "International Investments in Panama Ramping Up", July 28, 2015  http://pty.life/international-investment-in-panama-is-ramping-up/&lt;/ref&gt;  Panama City's real estate market was experiencing substantial rising sales and prices.  Like Miami, Panama City relied heavily on foreign investors who were finding real estate investments very attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Fortune Builders Real Estate Education Company, "Panama City Real Estate and Market Trends", July 20, 2015, http://www.fortunebuilders.com/panama-city-real-estate-and-market-trends/&lt;/ref&gt;  "With current and developing projects, Panama was once again proving a boom time for renters of construction equipment."&lt;ref&gt;Newsroom Panama, "Panama’s continuing building boom", August 19, 2015 http://www.newsroompanama.com/business/real-estate/panama’s-continuing-building-boom&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first time, Panama City’s real estate market was seeing a significant increase of European buyers, primarily from Italy, Spain and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;The Visitor, "The Europeans Are Coming", October 1, 2015 Page 2 https://thevisitorpanama.com/issues/visitor21-40/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Barton, NuWire Investment, "Influx of Euro Buyers Hits Panama City Real Estate", September 17, 2015 http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/new-influx-of-euro-buyers-hits-panama-city-real-estate-63045.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama over built hotel rooms created a crisis in the hotel industry where as much as 70% was discounted for hotel rooms to attract customers.&lt;ref&gt;Newsroom Panama, "Panama Hotel Rooms A Buyer's Market", July 20, 2015 http://www.newsroompanama.com/travel/panama/panama-hotel-rooms-a-buyer-s-market&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bill before Panama's National Assembly in 2015 sought to tighten money laundering controls as the country remained on the gray list of the [[Financial Action Task Force]](FATF)which negatively effected the nation's economy.  A recent International Monetary Fund report indicated that gaps existed in money laundering controls involving real estate agents, insurance brokers, casinos, and lawyers transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Newsroom Panama, "Realtors, casinos, lawyers, insurance, face money laundering controls", February 2, 2015  http://www.newsroompanama.com/news/latin-america/realtors,-casinos,-lawyers,-insurance,-face-money-laundering-controls&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama needed to get rid of its reputation as a major transit for illegal immigrants and illegal drugs and a money laundering haven while 33% of its population lived in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, "Panama Profile" February 13, 2015 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19888936&lt;/ref&gt;  Panama was still a poverty stricken country.&lt;ref&gt;DW Media Broadcast, "Poverty in Panama" April 10, 2015 http://www.dw.com/en/poverty-in-panama/av-18374058&lt;/ref&gt; Panama continued to have the highest economic growth rate in the American continent while the Ministry of Finance announced a reduction in the poverty rate over the past year on October 8, yet over 10 percent of the population remains in “extreme poverty”.&lt;ref&gt;Newsroom Panama,"Rate down but over 10% of Panamanians in extreme poverty" October 10, 2015 http://www.newsroompanama.com/news/panama/rate-down-but-over-10-of-panamanians-in-extreme-poverty&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the housing boom, construction of luxury apartments made the dream of owning a home further away for the majority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Newsroom Panama, "Martinelli’s Singapore fantasy clouded by corruption" August 9, 2015 http://www.newsroompanama.com/columns/your-man/martinelli’s-singapore-fantasy-clouded-by-corruption&lt;/ref&gt;  Panama's Vice-President and the Cabinet Council proposed that the National Assembly pass a new law specifically for the extradition of Russian fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;Newsroom Panama, "Cabinet approval for Russia extradition deal" August 31, 2015  http://www.newsroompanama.com/news/panama/cabinet-approval-for-russia-extradition-deal&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real estate ownership ==

'''Titled properties'''

There are two types of real property ownership.  One is the traditional titled deed ownership seen in most countries. The second is called "Rights of Possession" which is the right to occupy government owned properties with the ability to transfer the rights to others.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Offshore Legal Services, "Real Estate Basics (Part 1)", The Visitor, April 22, 2011  https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor17-16/third.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to "fee simple" title in the U.S., Panama titled property is the most secure method of owning real estate. Title deeds filed with the government's Public Registry verify one's title allowing banks to issue [[mortgage]] loans using the property as [[collateral (finance)]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Know what type of Real Estate you are buying", The Visitor, September 22, 2006 https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor12-20/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public registry'''

Ownership of private property transfers when the title deed is registered with Panama's Public Registry.&lt;ref&gt;Panama attorneys Patricia Villanueva and Elizabeth Heurtematte in Latin Lawyer November 2014 http://latinlawyer.com/reference/topics/67/jurisdictions/34/panama/&lt;/ref&gt;  Liens, mortgages and other security instruments are registered in Panama's Public Registry with online access to most of this information.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Dept., "2012 Investment Climate – Panama", June 2012, http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2012/191215.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The link to Panama's Public Registry is:   http://www.registro-publico.gob.pa/

'''Rights of possession'''

People can take possession of government land to improve it.  This is called "Rights of Possession" that can be passed down to the next generation and to the next.  These rights can be sold to other parties including foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Offshore Legal Services, "About Rights of Possession Properties" Part 1, The Visitor, April 29, 2011 https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor17-17/third.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concession properties'''

[[Concession (contract)]] properties are government grants to public property allowing individuals or companies to occupy for a specific purpose such as developing a [[marina]] or a [[hotel]].  Most concessions are for 20 years and may be renewed.  Concessions are popular in coastal areas and government protected lands.  The government protects the concession rights through a written [[contract]].  [[Title insurance]] is available for concession properties.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Offshore Legal Services, "About Rights of Possession Properties" Part 2, The Visitor, May 6, 2011  https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor17-18/third.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, a new law was created allowing for marine concession rights to be used by investors as collateral for loans.&lt;ref&gt;Panama attorneys Diego de la Guardia and Jose Luis Sosa, "Panama", Latin Lawyer, July 31, 2015  http://latinlawyer.com/reference/topics/53/jurisdictions/34/panama/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Real estate trusts'''

In 2010, Panama created a new law allowing for Real Estate Trusts, which are based on the U.S. [[Real estate investment trust]] (REIT) and made changes to the tax laws in 2014 allowing investors to avoid paying a [[Capital Gains Tax]] while the Trust only pays a 5% Dividends Tax.  Small investors can join other investors in forming a Real Estate Trust to purchase real estate to develop and lease.&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, "Panama REIT Industry Aims for Takeoff" December 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Real estate taxes'''

Panama has a [[Property Tax]] based on the value of the land and its improvements with the maximum annual rate being 2.1% of the total value.  Prior to 2012, Panama had several laws exempting certain residential real properties from paying the property tax for 20 years.  Starting in 2012, the property tax exemption changed to 15 years for residential properties valued up to $100,000 USD; 10 years for properties valued from $100,000 to $250,000; and a 5-year exemption for properties valued above $250,000.  Non-residential and commercial properties enjoy a 10-year exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Encuentra 24, 2014, http://www.encuentra24.com/content/panama-en/real-estate/view/a-review-of-annual-panama-property-taxs&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama also has a Title Transfer Tax of 2% of the actual value of the real property imposed when the seller transfers the title to the buyer.  There is also a 10% Capital Gains Tax which can be reduced to 5% if owned by a corporation selling its corporate shares instead of title to the property which also avoids the 2% Title Transfer Tax.&lt;ref&gt;Manoj Chatlani, Panama attorney  &amp; Steven Rich, The Visitor,  "Tips for Buying Panama Real Estate", January 28, 2008,  https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor14-3/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rental [[income taxes]] for property owners is exempt for the first $30,000 USD and has a 27% rate on income above that amount.  The Capital Gains Tax differs for individuals who only pay a 10% rate while real estate dealers (individuals selling multiple properties per tax year) pay up to 27% and corporations pay a flat 30% rate.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Panama's Taxes Related to Real Estate", Panama Guide, August 7, 2006,   http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20060807175536720&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Condominiums'''

Panama has a Horizontal Property Law for condominiums.  This law governs [[condominium]] units as well as a condominium building's common areas like the pool, lobby, gym, and social areas. Panama's Public Registry has the Horizontal Property Regime Section where all important documents are recorded such as the land's title deed and the condominium's rules &amp; regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Panama attorneys Patricia Villanueva and Elizabeth Heurtematte, "Panama", Latin Lawyer November 2014 http://latinlawyer.com/reference/topics/67/jurisdictions/34/panama/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Panama laws protecting real property buyers.  Law 6 of 2006 prohibits the construction industry from engaging in advertising fraud.  In 2007, Panama's Ministry of Housing enacted regulations preventing real estate developers and their promoters from selling or advertising properties before the approval of the project's Master Plan.  Panama's National Environmental Authority also has regulations over real estate developments.  Panama real estate buyers also are protected by Law 45 of 2007 known as the Consumer Protection Act allowing the Consumer Protection Agency to investigate buyer's complaints against real estate developers and agents.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Offshore Legal Services, "Pre-Construction Contracts", The Visitor, June 25, 2010,  https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor16-26/third.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Condominium hotels'''

[[Condo]] Hotels are popular in Panama especially in Panama City and along the beaches of both coasts.  Investors purchase an apartment in either the hotel building or an adjoining apartment building.  The developer of the hotel will manage the advertising, renting, and cleaning of the apartment and will share the income with the investor.  Users of the apartments will have access to the pool, gym, spa, tennis courts, restaurants, and other hotel amenities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Condo Hotel Investment", The Visitor, October 10, 2008,  http://demo.vitocortesewebsite.dev3.sibers.com/New_Site/Visitor14-37/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Real estate brokers'''

'''Definition'''

Panama law defines a [[real estate broker]] as one who professionally and habitually operates as an agent, intermediary, mediator, or representative in real estate transactions.  The law excludes people who work as administrators, promoters, maintenance providers, and rent collectors working for a licensed real estate broker.  Because of these exceptions, many foreigners work as promoters for Panama real estate companies.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Finding a Real Estate Agent (Part 1)", The Visitor, May 4, 2007,   https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor13-10/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Licensing'''

A Panama [[real estate agent]] (broker) license is only available to a Panama citizen or a foreign resident (of at least five years) who must take required courses and pass a written examination administered by the Ministry of Industry &amp; Commerce; obtain a $10,000 bond covering malpractice claims; pay a $25 annual fee; obtain a police record showing no felonies were committed; and obtain a [[Power of Attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;Panama Guide, "Law Governing Real Estate Agents in Panama", March 3, 2007  http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20070303100422247&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Realtors in Panama'''

In order to become a "[[Realtor]]" a licensed real estate broker must be a member of the Panamanian Association of Real Estate Brokers and Developers (ACOBIR) and then apply to be a member of the [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Finding a Real Estate Agent (Part 2)",  The Visitor, May 18, 2007, https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor13-11/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a link to the translation from Spanish to English of The Law Governing Real Estate Agents in Panama:  http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20070303100422247

'''Multiple listing service in Panama'''

Not until 2014 did Panama start its first [[Multiple Listing Service]] (MLS) for real estate offices and agents to share their listings with each other and to have a system for sharing a [[commission (remuneration)]] when sales occur.  The MLS was created by the Panama Association of Brokers and Real Estate Developers (ACOBIR) in existence since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Panama English News, "Panama's First Multiple Listing Service", June 15, 2015, http://www.panamaenglishnews.com/xmultiple.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mortgages'''

Panama banks offer a real estate [[mortgage]] to its citizens and foreigners.  Foreigners will pay a higher interest rate and can obtain up to 75% financing and can qualify if they have good credit.&lt;ref&gt;Encuentra 24, "Steps to Obtaining a Mortgage in Panama", 2014, http://www.encuentra24.com/content/panama-en/real-estate/view/steps-to-obtaining-a-mortgage-in-panama&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escrow companies'''

Panama has a few [[escrow]] companies, which will collect the buyer's payments and hold them until the seller transfers the property's title to the buyer.  The escrow company will perform a [[title search]] to make sure no [[liens]] or [[encumbrances]] exist, verify that the seller is the true owner, and will pay the real estate commission and other costs spelled out in the Buy-Sell Contract.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Offshore Legal Services, "Escrow Services", The Visitor, April 1, 2010,  https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor16-14/third.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Title insurance'''

The first [[title insurance]] company in Panama was Chicago Title Insurance Company from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Central America Data, May 29, 2009, http://www.centralamericadata.com/en/article/home/Latin_America_Title_Opens_in_Panama&lt;/ref&gt;  Title insurance is available in Panama to protect buyers from liens, encumbrances, and defects to the title.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Title Insurance",  The Visitor, April 10, 2009,   https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor15-15/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Developing real estate'''

Panama's urban areas are divided by [[zoning]] codes setting forth the type of construction, area and height restrictions, density, allowable activities, and parking spaces.  Areas are divided into commercial, residential, or mixed usage.  These codes must be followed in order for a [[real estate development]] or a builder to obtain a [[construction permit]] and an [[occupancy permit]].&lt;ref&gt;Panama attorneys Patricia Villanueva and Elizabeth Heurtematte, "Panama", Latin Lawyer, November 2014 http://latinlawyer.com/reference/topics/67/jurisdictions/34/panama/&lt;/ref&gt;  A builder needs to obtain approval from eight government agencies in order to begin construction of real property in Panama.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Developing Properties",  The Visitor, January 26, 2007,  https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor13-3/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renting properties'''

Real estate [[leases]] are governed by the Civil Code of 1917, which covers most residential leases and all commercial and industrial leases.  The [[security deposit]] for a residential rental is deposited with the Ministry of Housing along with the [[rental agreement]] and the security deposit is returned to the tenant after the lease expires unless the [[property owner]] claims [[property damage]] or past due rent payments.  The tenant can terminate the lease before it expires with at least 30 days written notice before the next rent payment.  Property owners cannot terminate leases early.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rich, "Know the Rules of Renting",  The Visitor, March 21, 2008,   https://www.thevisitorpanama.com/New_Site/Visitor14-8/special_visitor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silver Strand Falls''' drops 574 feet (175m) along Meadow Brook, at the western end of Yosemite Valley, within [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=108|publisher=World Waterfall Database|title=Silver Strand Falls|accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The falls are commonly thought to drop 1170 feet (356m); this is incorrect.  The name Widow's Tears had been applied to Silver Strand Falls in the past, but the lower-volume waterfall located one drainage to the east of Meadow Brook is now known as Widow's Tears and is thought to drop {{convert|1170|ft|m}}, hence the confusion regarding the height.

Note that the recent 1:24,000 topo map of Yosemite Valley shows the height of this waterfall as {{convert|400|ft|m}}, not {{convert|574|ft|m}}, which is derived, apparently, from ice climbers. Since the waterfall is not vertical, it is possible that the ice-climbing height is, in fact, {{convert|574|ft|m}}, while the difference in elevation between the top and bottom is as shown on the topo sheet at {{convert|400|ft|m}}.  

The origin of the number "1,170 feet" for the height either of this or of nearby Widow's Tears is obscure. But in any case, this height is not supported either by a field survey or by the topo sheet. It appears that the Widow's Tears drop more or less steeply in a square alcove for about {{convert|810|ft|m}}, then proceeds to drop at generally lower angle an additional {{convert|700|ft|m}} over a series of small stepdowns and slabs.  

Since both Silver Strand and Widow's Tears are located on streams draining small, relatively low areas, they both dry up completely in a normal year by mid June since they are fed exclusively by melting snow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">[[Image:SSNNavigation.jpg|thumb|[[Bone segment navigation|Surgical navigation]] for the orbit and [[Zygomatic bone|zygoma]] on the SSN system (Color coding for the preoperative, predicted and goal position of the fragments, respectively)]]
The '''surgical segment navigator (SSN)''' is a computer-based system for use in [[surgical navigation]]. It is integrated into a common [[platform (computing)|platform]], together with the surgical tool navigator (STN), the surgical microscope navigator (SMN) and the 6[[degrees of freedom (engineering)|DOF]] manipulator (MKM), developed by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]].

== SSN ==
The '''SSN''' has been developed as a computer system for [[bone segment navigation]] in [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]]. It allows a very precise repositioning of bone fragments, with the advent of preoperative simulation and [[surgical planning]].The system has been developed since 1997 at the [[University of Regensburg|University of Regensburg, Germany]], with the support of the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Company]]. Its principle is based on an infrared localisation system, composed of an [[infrared]] camera and at least three infrared [[transmitters]] attached to each bony fragment. The SSN is mainly used in [[orthognatic surgery]] (surgical correction of dysgnathia), but also for the surgical reconstruction of the orbit, or other surgical interventions to the midface.

== SSN++ ==
Since 2001, at the [[University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg, Germany]], the '''SSN++''' has been developed, a markerless-[[patient registration|registration]] navigation system, based on a native (=markerless) [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]]. In this case, the [[patient registration]] is obtained on the operating table, using a surface scanner. The SSN++ correlates the surface scan data (gathered on the operating table) with the skin surface reconstruction from the [[dataset]] obtained preoperatively by [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]]. This principle complies with the [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching]] principle described for flying objects. The advantage of the new method is that the [[patient registration|registration of the patient's position]] becomes a simple automated procedure; on the other hand, the radiation load for the patient is reduced, compared to the method using markers.

'''Sôvä nad Sŕním''' is the name of a fictional village in [[Slovakia]]. It was founded on [[Festival fantazie]] 2008 in [[Chotěboř]] on 2 July 2008. This village is the base of Slovak [[Torchwood]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://torchwood.cz Czech Torchwood site]&lt;/ref&gt; branch. It is told that Torchwood 4 disappeared and reappeared on 3 places [[Prague]], [[Brno]] and Sôvä nad Sŕním.
&lt;br /&gt;
Officially, Sôvä nad Sŕním has 42 citizens, however the number moves up to 47 during the time of mating.
&lt;br /&gt;
The name of this village could be translated as "''Owl-nestling over Roe-point''". In Judoon language ''Sou Vou Dou Rou''.

[[File:WFink in 2007 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Tier-Scalable Reconnaissance:&lt;/center&gt;'''Three-tiered utilization on Mars. Tier 1: spaceborne orbiter; Tier 2: airborne blimps; Tier 3: ground-based rovers.]]

'''Tier-Scalable Reconnaissance''' is the term for an approach to deploying and controlling vehicles in multiple areas of interest, such as in the exploration of planets or diverse regions on Earth. It is not a rigid or fixed paradigm, but is infinitely extensible. It uses hierarchical levels of oversight called ''tiers'', each tier commanding or controlling the vehicles within the tier beneath it. The size of each tier can be scaled from one to many vehicles.

== Origination ==
The tier-scalable reconnaissance paradigm was originated by Dr. [[Wolfgang Fink]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;Fink W, Dohm JM, Tarbell MA, Hare TM, Baker VR (2005) ''Next-Generation Robotic Planetary Reconnaissance Missions: A Paradigm Shift; Planetary and Space Science'', 53, 1419-1426&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

== History ==
Robotic planetary exploration missions typically use a single lander or rover. This is by design, driven primarily by safety and engineering constraints, at the expense of mission reliability and science return. Rovers are generally capable mobile platforms, but they are incapable of exploring multiple distant sites on a planetary surface. They are usually not used to explore potentially hazardous, scientifically interesting regions. At the other extreme, orbiting satellites have the benefit of a global perspective, but miss much surface detailed information. In either case, using a rover or orbiter, monitoring changing events on the surface is difficult, if not altogether impossible.

Tier-scalable reconnaissance, on the other hand, distributes the burden of data gathering across different logical tiers. In this way, a mission is more distributed, goal-driven, and less constrained. And, because of the numerous vehicles in each tier, a mission is more survivable and more capable. Consider the following scenario: The vehicles in the spaceborne and airborne tiers have overhead perspectives at different scales and resolutions. They map out areas of interest and acquire terrain data, and then choose targets for visiting and sampling by the ground vehicles. The overhead perspective also allows the higher tiers to determine paths for safe passage of these vehicles to their targets. The ground-tier vehicles gather local data that complement the remote sensing data obtained by the spaceborne and airborne vehicles.

In addition to the spaceborne and ground tiers, there may be several airborne tiers having vehicles such as balloons, blimps, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at different altitudes. The tier-scalable reconnaissance paradigm is not limited to space, aerial, and ground applications but can be applied as well to water, subterranean, and ocean floor scenarios for scientific, commercial, or military purposes.

The tier-scalable reconnaissance paradigm is also highly automated. Spaceborne orbiters command and control the airborne vehicles autonomously, and the airborne vehicles in turn command and control the ground-tier reconnaissance vehicles. This allows orbiters, airships, and rovers to act in a unified, controlled manner. A mission that uses this paradigm is also considered more survivable. Since the airborne and ground-tier vehicles can be quite inexpensive, even expendable, many such vehicles can be used collectively to explore numerous science targets with complementary suites of instruments. Even if one or more vehicles should fail, others are present to take up the slack and continue the mission.

== Scenarios ==
Tier-scalable reconnaissance missions allow access to targets of great interest on planetary bodies, something which is not currently feasible with conventional single-rover or single-orbiter mission designs. Tier-scalable reconnaissance missions also enable spanning larger surface areas than previously possible – mimicking the way geologists explore regions on Earth – and therefore allow for greater data return.

Consider how the tier-scalable paradigm adapts to various environmental scenarios:

[[File:WFink in 2007 2.jpg|left|100px|border]]
* '''Environments with atmospheres and with non-extreme surface temperatures (Earth, Mars):'''
** Tier 1: Spaceborne orbiters, which guide deployment and control of 
** Tier 2: Airborne balloons or blimps, which in turn deploy and control
** Tier 3: Surface-based buoys, and sensors, which in turn deploy and control
** Tier 4: Submersibles and sensors.

[[File:WFink in 2007 3.jpg|left|100px|border]]
* '''Environments with atmospheres and with extreme surface temperatures (Venus, Titan)''':&lt;ref&gt;Noor AK, Cutts JA, Balint TS (2007) ''Platforms for discovery: Exploring Titan and Venus''; Aerospace America/June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
** Tier 1: Spaceborne orbiters, which guide deployment and control of 
** Tier 2: Airborne balloons or blimps, which, if conditions permit, deploy and control
** Tier 3: Ground sensor webs, rovers, or submersibles.

[[File:WFink in 2007 4.jpg|left|100px|border]]
* '''Environments without atmospheres and with extreme surface conditions (Mercury, Moon, Europa):'''
** Tier 1: Spaceborne orbiters, which guide deployment of and communicate with 
** Tier 2: Ground-based rovers and sensor webs.

== Commanding &amp; Operation ==
Using traditional means, simultaneous commanding of even a few reconnaissance vehicles becomes exceedingly complex, and so the logistical and computational demands of the tier-scalable paradigm scale quickly beyond the computers able to fit on such vehicles. This problem is overcome by using a ''round-robin concurrent commanding scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;Fink W, Tarbell MA, Jobling FM (2008) ''Tier-Scalable Reconnaissance - A Paradigm Shift in Autonomous Remote Planetary Exploration of Mars and Beyond''. Chapter 1 in “Planet Mars Research Focus”, Ed. F. Columbus. Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, NY. (in press)&lt;/ref&gt; In this scheme, the vehicles are not commanded simultaneously; instead, each is commanded in turn, one by one. Moreover, each vehicle is given a small command set to execute. In this way, one vehicle is being commanded while the others are executing their issued commands. Depending on how close the vehicles are to each other and how accurately they execute their navigation commands, an airborne deployment reassessment is done so that refined trajectories are computed for each vehicle. Thus, each vehicle can be commanded in turn without threat of collision.

In the tier-scalable paradigm, ground-tier vehicles are commanded typically through the use of local airborne vehicles, such as blimps or balloons. The airborne vehicles contain onboard tracking and command systems for use with the ground-tier vehicles. With a wide field of view, the tracking and commanding systems on board the airborne vehicles determine optimal paths for the ground-tier vehicles, identifying both obstacles and interesting science targets. The ground-tier vehicles are then commanded to navigate through the operational area to the designated targets, while avoiding the identified obstacles. Therefore, this approach does not rely on the limited horizontal view of the ground-tier vehicles. Each ground-tier vehicle includes its own instrument suite to collect information, which is transmitted back to the airborne tier.

The ground-tier vehicles may conduct measurements en route to their targets. If an interesting object is encountered along the way, a vehicle may request permission of the commanding tier to explore it. A ground-tier vehicle may also find itself in an area of geography through which it cannot pass. In this case, it would request an alternate trajectory to its target, or even a target reassignment. These resolutions are possible because the higher-level airborne commanding tier is able to reassess the deployment of the vehicles, refining the trajectories of each of the vehicles at each step. In this way, even if a vehicle should go off-course, such as from sliding on sandy soil, the commanding tier will recalculate a path to the target based on the vehicle’s current position.

== Applications ==
Robotic reconnaissance operations are called for in extreme environments such as space, as well as in potentially hazardous or inaccessible operational areas on Earth, such as those related to military or terrorist activities, or areas that have been exposed to biochemical agents, radiation, or natural disasters.

Tier-scalable reconnaissance opens access to geologic sites not currently feasible to visit, such as canyons, mountain ranges, chaotic and rugged terrain, impact basins and craters, even volcanoes and liquid pools or lakes. In addition, other exotic locales of scientific interest exist on the planetary bodies of the [[Solar System]] that are particularly crucial in the search for extraterrestrial biological activity in general, and sample return missions in particular.

Potential terrestrial applications include Homeland Security, border control, battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance, telecommunications relay, and weather observations, as well as monitoring of military checkpoints, standoff detection, and delivery/removal of explosives such as landmine cleanup.

== Advantages &amp; Implications ==
Some of the major advantages of tier-scalable reconnaissance architectures include: 
# Overhead navigation, enabling deployment of simple, inexpensive, expendable ground vehicles; 
# Efficient commanding of multiple ground vehicles;
# Mission safety, reliability, and survivability;
# Optimized target identification, path planning, and obstacle avoidance; and
# Real time reconnaissance, allowing identification and characterization of active events.

Also, tier-scalable reconnaissance reduces driving requirements for ground vehicles, since they already are deployed in the vicinity of where they need to be. Therefore, driving is limited to “fine-tuning” the location of the ground-tier vehicles to perform local sampling, as opposed to “long-distance” driving towards the location where they need to be. Hence, inexpensive, expendable miniaturized vehicles with limited driving capabilities can be used.

The ground-tier vehicles have limited onboard computing capabilities, since they off-load data analysis to a primary lander or higher tiers that have higher-grade computing equipment. Conceptually, a primary lander is a higher-grade computing engine that also acts as a communication relay, much like a planetary internet router between the tiers. Thus, the tier-scalable reconnaissance paradigm, by its inherent architecture, is an extended distributed computing topology unto itself.

== Developments ==
Individual components of the tier-scalable reconnaissance paradigm are either under development or have already been tested and proven “in the field.” These include orbiters, balloons, blimps, airships, and ground-based vehicles such as rovers and landers as well as sensor webs. The biggest challenge, however, appears to be not so much the hardware but the “intelligent” software that would enable all the components of a tier scalable mission to be integrated and function autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Science Magazine, March 2006 issue: ''Exploring Mars with Blimps and Cliff-scaling Robots''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vehicle tracking system''' combines the use of [[automatic vehicle location]] in individual vehicles with [[computer software|software]] that collects these [[Fleet vehicle|fleet]] data for a comprehensive picture of vehicle locations. Modern vehicle tracking systems commonly use [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] or [[GLONASS]] technology for locating the vehicle, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology can also be used. Vehicle information can be viewed on [[electronic map]]s via the Internet or [[Geographic information system|specialized software]].  Urban public transit authorities are an increasingly common user of vehicle [[tracking system]]s, particularly in large cities.

==Active versus passive tracking==
Several types of vehicle tracking devices exist. Typically they are classified as "passive" and "active". "Passive" devices store GPS location, speed, heading and sometimes a trigger event such as key on/off, door open/closed. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point, the device is removed and the data downloaded to a computer for evaluation. Passive systems include auto download type that transfer data via wireless download. "Active" devices also collect the same information but usually transmit the data in near-real-time via [[cellular network|cellular]] or [[satellite network]]s to a computer or data center for evaluation.

Many modern vehicle tracking devices combine both active and passive tracking abilities: when a cellular network is available and a tracking device is connected it transmits data to a server; when a network is not available the device stores data in internal memory and will transmit stored data to the server later when the network becomes available again.

Historically, vehicle tracking has been accomplished by installing a box into the vehicle, either self-powered with a battery or wired into the vehicle's power system.  For detailed vehicle locating and tracking this is still the predominant method; however, many companies are increasingly interested in the emerging [[cell phone]] technologies that provide tracking of multiple entities, such as both a salesperson and their vehicle.  These systems also offer tracking of calls, texts, web use and generally provide a wider range of options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pay-as-you-go tracking|date=January 6, 2011|publisher=FleetOwner - [[Penton (company)|Penton]]|url=http://fleetowner.com/information_technology/news/pay-as-you-go-tracking-0106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical architecture==
Major constituents of the GPS-based tracking are:

# GPS tracking: The device fits into the vehicle and captures the GPS location information apart from other vehicle information at regular intervals to a central server. Other vehicle information can include fuel amount, engine temperature,  altitude, [[reverse geocoding]], door open/close, tire pressure, cut off fuel, turn off ignition, turn on headlight, turn on taillight, battery status, [[GSM]] area code/cell code decoded, number of GPS satellites in view, glass &lt;!-- window??? --&gt; open/close, fuel amount, emergency button status, cumulative idling, computed [[odometer]], engine RPM, [[throttle]] position, GPRS status and a lot more. Capability of these devices actually decide the final capability of the whole tracking system; most vehicle tracking systems, in addition to providing the vehicle's location data, feature a wide range of communication ports that can be used to integrate other onboard systems, allowing to check their status and control or automate their operation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/gps.htm|title=How GPS Receivers Work|date=2006-09-25|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# [[GPS tracking server]]: The tracking server has three responsibilities: receiving data from the [[GPS tracking unit]], securely storing it, and serving this information on demand to the user. &lt;!-- ummm...what? Commented out as I don't think this really adds anything substantive, and sounds like "marketing-speak" and therefore is opinion and not encyclopedic
It is the intelligence, power and configuration of GPS tracking server, that culminates into usability and feature support. --&gt;
# [[User interface]]: The UI determines how one will be able to access information, view vehicle data, and elicit important details from it. &lt;!-- The original author's opinion:  "Most usable is the one that is web-based and doesn't demand installation of custom software." --&gt;

==Common uses==

Vehicle tracking systems are commonly used by fleet operators for [[fleet management]] functions such as [[fleet tracking]], routing, dispatching, on-board information and security. Some vehicle tracking systems are bundled with or interface with [[fleet management software]]. Along with commercial fleet operators, urban [[public transport|transit]] agencies use the technology for a number of purposes, including monitoring [[On-time performance|schedule adherence]] of buses in service, triggering automatic changes of buses' [[destination sign]] displays once the vehicle approaches the [[bus terminus]] (or other set location along a bus route such as a particular bus stop along the route), and triggering pre-recorded (or even [[Speech synthesis|synthetic speech]]) bus stop, route (and its destination) or service announcements for passengers.

The [[American Public Transportation Association]] estimated that, at the beginning of 2009, around half of all transit buses in the United States were already using a GPS-based vehicle tracking system to trigger automated stop announcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: Comments to Access Board Docket Number 2007-1|date=January 20, 2009|publisher=Office of Technical Information Services, [[American Public Transportation Association|APTA]]|url=http://www.apta.com/gap/fedreg/documents/apta_comments_access_board_bus_2009.pdf|pages=3|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can refer to external announcements (triggered by the opening of the bus's door) at a bus stop, announcing the vehicle's route number and destination, primarily for the benefit of [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] customers, or to internal announcements (to passengers already on board) identifying the next stop, as the bus (or [[tram]]) approaches a stop, or both; the latter are often also displayed on an internal [[LED display]] or [[LCD monitor]] connected to the system while the loudspeakers play them. Data collected as a transit vehicle follows its route is often continuously fed into a computer program which compares the vehicle's actual location and time with its schedule, and in turn produces a frequently updating display for the driver, telling him/her how early or late he/she is at any given time, potentially making it easier to adhere more closely to the published schedule.

Such programs are also used to provide customers with [[Real-time data|real-time information]] as to  the waiting time until arrival of the next bus or tram/streetcar at a given stop, based on the nearest vehicles' actual progress at the time, rather than merely giving information as to the ''scheduled'' time of the next arrival.&lt;ref name="SFMTA2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Real-Time Muni Arrival Information Just a Free Call Away|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=[[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency|San Francisco MTA]]|url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/news/press_releases/2005/rel316.htm|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transit systems providing this kind of information assign a unique number to each stop, and waiting passengers can obtain information by entering the stop number into an automated telephone system or an application on the transit system's website.&lt;ref name="SFMTA2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bus tracking apps"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cell phone bus tracking applications developed|date=April 2009|publisher=''[[Metro Magazine]]''|url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/Article/Story/2009/04/Cell-phone-bus-tracking-applications-developed.aspx|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transit agencies provide a virtual map on their website, with icons depicting the current locations of buses in service on each route, for customers' information,&lt;ref name="Duluth"&gt;{{cite web|title=WebWatch allows you to obtain ‘real-time’ schedule information for your bus stop and (to) track buses in real time.|year=2007|publisher=[[Duluth Transit Authority]]|url=http://www.duluthtransit.com/RiderGuide/WebWatchTips.aspx|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others provide such information only to dispatchers or other employees.

With the GPS technology being enhanced day by day, companies are coming up with devices that are compatible with phones and other modern gadgets. These devices provide live time activity of the fleet on personal devices without even logging onto their website as well. Keeping a track of fleet commander's actionable data, improving efficiency, reducing fuel cost etc. also come under fleet tracking. These devices and software help in cost-cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost cutting and real-time tracking|url=https://www.fleetcommander.com/about/|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other applications include monitoring driving behavior, such as an employer of an employee, or a parent with a teen driver.

Vehicle tracking systems are also popular in consumer vehicles as a [[theft prevention]], monitoring and retrieval device. Police can simply follow the signal emitted by the tracking system and locate the stolen vehicle. When used as a security system, a Vehicle Tracking System may serve as either an addition to or replacement for a traditional [[car alarm]]. Some vehicle tracking systems make it possible to control the vehicle remotely, including block doors or engine in case of emergency. The existence of vehicle tracking device then can be used to reduce the insurance cost, because the loss-risk of the vehicle drops significantly.

Vehicle tracking systems are an integrated part of the "layered approach" to vehicle protection, recommended by the [[National Insurance Crime Bureau]] (NICB) to prevent [[motor vehicle theft]]. This approach recommends four layers of security based on the risk factors pertaining to a specific vehicle. Vehicle Tracking Systems are one such layer and are described by the NICB as “very effective” in helping police recover stolen vehicles.

Some vehicle tracking systems integrate several security systems, for example by sending an automatic alert to a phone or email if an alarm is triggered or the vehicle is moved without authorization, or when it leaves or enters a [[geofence]].

Other scenarios in which this technology is employed include:

*Stolen vehicle recovery: Both consumer and commercial vehicles can be outfitted with RF or GPS units to allow police to do tracking and recovery. In the case of LoJack, the police can activate the tracking unit in the vehicle directly and follow tracking signals.
*Asset tracking: Companies needing to track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location on a map and closely monitor movement and operating status.
*Field service management: Companies with a field service workforce for services such as repair or maintenance, must be able to plan field workers’ time, schedule subsequent customer visits and be able to operate these departments efficiently. Vehicle tracking allows companies to quickly locate a field engineer and dispatch the closest one to meet a new customer request or provide site arrival information.
*Field sales: Mobile sales professionals can access real-time locations. For example, in unfamiliar areas, they can locate themselves as well as customers and prospects, get driving directions and add nearby last-minute appointments to itineraries. Benefits include increased productivity, reduced driving time and increased time spent with customers and prospects.
*Trailer tracking: Haulage and Logistics companies often operate lorries with detachable load carrying units. The part of the vehicle that drives the load is known as the cab and the load carrying unit is known as the trailer. There are different types of trailer used for different applications, e.g., flat bed, refrigerated, curtain sider, box container.
*[[Surveillance]]: A tracker may be placed on a vehicle to follow the vehicle's movements.&lt;ref name="warrantless-gps"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215800542|title=Court Asked To Disallow Warrantless GPS Tracking |last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 4, 2009| work=Information Week |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transit tracking: temporary tracking of assets or cargoes from one point to another. Users will ensure that the assets do not stop on route or do a U-Turn in order to ensure the security of the assets.
*Fuel Monitoring: monitor the fuel through tracking device (with help of fuel sensor connected to the device).
*Distance Calculation: calculate the distance travelled by the fleet.
*OBD II - Plug and play interface which provides most engine diagnostics information.

Vehicle tracking systems are widely used worldwide. Components come in various shapes and forms but most use [[Global Positioning System|GPS technology]] and [[GSM]] services. Additionally, these systems may also feature short range data communication systems such as [[WiFi]]. While most will offer real-time tracking, others record real time data and store it to be read, in a fashion similar to data loggers. Systems like these track and record and allow reports after certain points have been solved

== Vehicle OBD tracking systems ==
Vehicle OBD tracking systems make use of OBD GPS trackers that plug into the onboard diagnostic (OBD) port of a light or medium duty vehicle. A cellular OBD GPS tracker directly communicates with the cell tower for sending the location and other vehicle performance data to the server over cellular wireless network. Usually, the tracker device draws power from the OBD port itself and contains a built-in antenna along with a GPS module for receiving the GPS signal. In addition, OBD trackers communicate with the different vehicle subsystems for receiving vehicle diagnostic and fuel consumption related data. Users can view the information using standalone software or web browser from a desktop/laptop computer or using smartphone apps.

== Fleet management tracking ==
Aside from [[Anti-theft system|theft-prevention]] the most common use of vehicle tracking is in logistics and transport. These systems make use of GPS and GSM technology to provide precise and constant location telematics to an individual fleet manager. These systems are typically equipped with features to monitor statistics such as; fuel consumption, average speed, current driver time and location. There has been a recent increase in demand for this technology as [https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours/eu-rules EU regulations] place increased restrictions on the hours driver are allowed to work in a given day. It is currently limited to 9 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours/eu-rules|title=Drivers' hours: EU rules - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are legally obligated to install a tachograph in any vehicle that is expected to carry goods. This obligation has led many to attempt to cauterize this potentially onerous obligation, instead turning it into a benefit. Fleet management systems use GPS &amp; GSM technology. Much like other forms of trackers, although due to their nature they are equipped with more thorough diagnostic features.

Other uses such as ''Trailer Tracking, Fuel Monitoring, Distance Calculation, Asset Tracking,'' and  ''Field Sales'' can all be incorporated into a Fleet Management solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278363|title=How does a GPS tracking system work? {{!}} EE Times|website=EETimes|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unconventional uses==

Industries not traditionally known to use vehicle tracking systems (logistics and transportation industries are the ones that have traditionally incorporated vehicle tracking system into their operations) have started to use it in creative ways to improve their processes or businesses.

The hospitality industry has caught on to this technology to improve customer service. For example, a luxury hotel in Singapore has installed vehicle tracking systems in their limousines to ensure they can welcome their VIPs when they reach the hotel.

Vehicle tracking systems used in food delivery vans may alert if the temperature of the refrigerated compartment moves outside of the range of safe food storage temperatures.
Car rental companies are also using it to monitor their rental fleets.

Some businesses are able to use the times gathering from vehicle tracking reports to track hours billable to customers and/or replace the use of time clocks with employees. &lt;ref&gt;https://gotrack.com/5-vehicle-tracking-uses-advice/ Retrieved 1/27/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veld''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɛ|l|t}} or {{IPAc-en|f|ɛ|l|t}}), also spelled '''veldt''', is a type of wide open rural landscape in [[:Southern Africa]]. Particularly, it is a flat area covered in grass or low [[scrubland|scrub]], especially in the countries of [[South Africa]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Botswana]]. A certain sub-tropical woodland [[ecoregion]] of Southern Africa has been officially defined as the [[Bushveld]] by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at0717|name=Southern Africa bushveld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees are found only in a few places—frost, fire and grazing animals allow grass to grow but prevent the growth of trees.

==Etymology==
The word ''veld'' ({{IPA-nl|fɛlt|af}}) comes from the [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] word for "field".

The etymological origin is older modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''veldt'', a spelling that the [[History of Dutch orthography|Dutch abandoned]] in favour of ''veld'' during the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Winkel, Lammert Allard te. De grondbeginselen der Nederlandsche spelling: Regelen der spelling voor het Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal. Publisher: D. Noothoven van Goor, 1873. Download from: [https://archive.org/details/degrondbeginsel00winkgoog]&lt;/ref&gt; decades before the first Afrikaans dictionary.&lt;ref name="EAWCHBE"&gt;Eric Anderson Walker (ed). The Cambridge History of the British Empire, Volume 4. Cambridge University Press 1963 (Afrikaans: pp. 890–894)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Iris. South Africa in World History. Oxford University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0195337938}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cognate]] to the English ''field'', it was spelt ''velt''&lt;ref&gt;[http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=MNW&amp;id=61858 Lemma = "velt"], ''Middelnederlandsch Woordenboek'', [[Dutch Language Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Middle Dutch]] and ''felt''&lt;ref&gt;[http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=ONW&amp;id=ID3615 Lemma = "felt"], ''Oudnederlands Woordenboek'', [[Dutch Language Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Old Dutch]].

==Climate==

The climate of the veld is highly variable, but its general pattern is mild winters from May to September and hot or very hot summers from November to March, with moderate or considerable variations in daily temperatures and abundant sunshine. Precipitation mostly occurs in the summer months in the form of high-energy [[thunderstorm]]s.

Over most of the South African Highveld, the average annual rainfall is between {{convert|500|-|900|mm}} a year, decreasing to about {{convert|250|mm}} near the western border and increasing to nearly {{convert|1000|mm}} in some parts of the [[Lesotho Highlands]]; the South African Lowveld generally receives more precipitation than the Highveld. Temperature is closely related to elevation. In general, the mean July (winter) temperatures range between {{convert|7|C}} in the Lesotho Highlands and {{convert|16|C}} in the Lowveld. January (summer) temperatures range between {{convert|18|C}} and {{convert|30|C}}.

In Zimbabwe the precipitation averages around {{convert|750|-|900|mm}} on the Highveld, dropping to less than {{convert|350|mm}} in the lowest areas of the Lowveld. Temperatures are slightly higher than in South Africa.

Over the entire veld, seasonal and annual average rainfall variations of up to 40 percent are common. Damaging drought affects at least half the area about once every three or four years; it reduces plant and animal biomass to sustainable levels again. Everywhere the average number of hours of annual sunshine varies from 60 to 80 percent of the total amount possible.

== Definitions ==
Veld can be loosely compared to the Australian terms [[outback]] or "[[the bush]]", to the [[prairie]] of North America, to the [[pampas]] lowlands of South America, or to the [[steppe]] of Central Asia. Someone from Yorkshire might equate "wandering across the [[moorland|moors]]" to "walking through the veld."{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

By extension, the veld can be compared to the "[[boondocks]]" or those places "beyond the [[black stump]]" in Australia. There is a sense in which it refers in essence to unimproved land (and is therefore not the equivalent of the English [[paddock]]) and does not include areas used both for pastoral activities and the planting of crops. These areas are referred to as fields. The word is less appropriate for land that is heavily forested, mountainous, or urban. The simplest explanation will be to say the word "veld" means "natural vegetation"; excluding vegetation like swamps and forests. It does include mountains with vegetation but not deserts or mountains without natural vegetation.

The veld definition may encompass different natural environments, both humid and dry, such as [[Coastal plain]], [[Coastal prairie (disambiguation)|Coastal prairie]], [[Flooded grasslands and savannas]], [[Grassland]], [[Prairie]], [[Savanna]], [[Steppe]], [[Meadow]], [[Water-meadow]], [[Flood-meadow]], [[Wet meadow]], as well as [[Field (agriculture)|agricultural fields]].
Whereas mountainous peaks and thick forests do not really fit in with the term ''veld'', bushes are acceptable. The area then becomes ''Bosveld'', a term that is used mainly to describe ''Die Bosveld'' ("The [[Bushveld]]"), which is both a loose botanical classification and a specific geographical part of what used to be known as the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], as described for example in the story [[Jock of the Bushveld]].

===Other uses===
*The word [[Renosterveld]], "rhinoceros-field", is now used to differentiate one of the major vegetation types of the [[Cape Floristic Region]].
*A carefully husbanded sports field on which the game of [[Rugby football|Rugby]] is played in the middle of cities such as Cape Town or Johannesburg is referred to as a "rugbyveld" in the Afrikaans language.
*The word "veld" also carries military connotations. The word "field" in English has a strong association with "war", as evidenced by the expression "the first foe in the field" and the lines of the ballad 'Lord Marlborough' (see [[John Churchill]]): "You generals all and champions bold, that takes delight in field, that knocks down churches and castle walls but now to death must yield". The same relationship is paralleled in [[Afrikaans]]. Just as the English Army has its [[Field Marshal]]s, the Boer armies had their [[Veldkornet]]s and [[Veldkommando]]s.

=== Highveld and Lowveld ===
&lt;!--This section linked from [[Swaziland]]--&gt;
[[File:Lowveld map 1.png|thumb|left|300 px| A map of [[South Africa#Geography|South Africa]] showing the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] and its relation to the [[Highveld]], Lowveld and [[Lesotho]] Highlands. The portion of the Great Escarpment that is colored red is known as the [[Drakensberg]]. It forms the only well defined boundary of the Lesotho Highlands and the Low- and Highveld. The west- and southward extents of all three of these areas are arbitrary. The term "Lowveld" is used only in [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Thus, although the Lowveld is continuous with [[Mozambique]]'s coastal plain, the term "Lowveld" is not used there, hence it is shown in orange, as opposed to the yellow in the other southern African countries. The term "Lowveld" is also not applied to other low-lying areas in South Africa, Botswana or Zimbabwe.]]

==== Highveld ====
{{main|Highveld}}
Much of the interior of [[South Africa|Southern Africa]] consists of a high plateau, the higher portions {{convert|1500|-|2100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of which are known as the '''[[Highveld]]''', starting at the [[Drakensberg]] escarpment, {{convert|220|km|miles|abbr=on}} to the east of Johannesburg and sloping gradually downwards to the west and south west, as well as to the north, through the [[Bushveld]] towards the [[Limpopo river]].&lt;ref name= "Altas"&gt;Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). p. 13. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;
These higher, cooler areas (generally more than {{convert|1500|m|ft|disp=or}} above sea level) are characterised by flat or gently undulating terrain, vast [[grasslands]] and a modified tropical or [[subtropical climate]]. To the east, the Highveld's border is marked by the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]], or the [[Mpumalanga]] [[Drakensberg]], but in the other directions the boundary is not obvious and often arbitrary. The [[blesbok]] and [[quagga]] were among the large animals that once roamed on the highveld in great numbers. Nowadays there still is a sizeable population of [[springbok]] in some areas,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Despard Estes, ''The Behavior Guide to African Mammals'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-27297-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though much of the area is devoted to commercial farming and South Africa's largest conurbation ([[Gauteng|Gauteng Province]]).

==== Lowveld ====
The lowlands, below about {{convert|abbr=on|500|m|ft|0}} altitude, along South Africa's northern border with [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where a 180-million-year-old failed [[rift valley]] cuts into [[South Africa#Geography|Southern Africa's central plateau]] and locally obliterates the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]],&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy t. &amp; Rubidge B.

Readers Digest Association, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Limpopo river|Limpopo]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save river]]s run from the central African highlands via the Lowveld into the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east. The [[Limpopo]] Lowveld extends southwards, east of the [[Drakensberg]] [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|escarpment]] through [[Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga Province]] and ultimately into eastern [[Swaziland]]. This southern limb of the Lowveld is bounded by [[South Africa]]'s border with [[Mozambique]] to the east and the north-eastern part of the [[Drakensberg]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). pp. 13, 182, 192. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; This region is generally hotter and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld.

=== Thornveld ===
Thornveld (also thorn veld or thornveldt), often referred to as "acacia thornveld", is a type of semi-arid savanna in which grassland with thorny [[Acacia sensu lato|acacia]] and certain species of thorny bushes predominate. The predominant plant species are usually different in the thornveld of the plains or in the hill thornveld, where, for example, species of genus ''[[Balanites]]'' are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecotravel.co.za/Guides/Reserves/KNP/EcoZones/Thorn_Veld.htm |title=Thorn Veld Ecozone – Kruger National Park |publisher=Ecotravel.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511224120/http://www.ecotravel.co.za/Guides/Reserves/KNP/EcoZones/Thorn_Veld.htm |archivedate=11 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the characteristic species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agriculture.kzntl.gov.za/publications/production_guidelines/veld_in_natal/veld_4.8.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701140643/http://agriculture.kzntl.gov.za/publications/production_guidelines/veld_in_natal/veld_4.8.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-01 |title=KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture – Mixed Thornveld Ecozone |publisher=Agriculture.kzntl.gov.za |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the thornveld include:
*Grasses: Grass species belonging to genus [[Themeda]] and [[Hyparrhenia]]
*Trees and bushes: Genus ''[[Acacia sensu lato|Acacia]]'' and ''[[Rhus]]'', such as ''[[Acacia caffra]]'', ''[[Acacia sieberiana]]'' and ''[[Rhus pentheri]]'' and other species like ''[[Ziziphus mucronata]]'', ''[[Ehretia rigida]]'' and ''[[Cussonia spicata]]''.

=== Sandveld and Hardveld ===

[[File:Bakwena royal cemetery.jpg|thumb|Bakwena Royal Cemetery, [[Molepolole]], in the Hardveld area of southeast Botswana]]

==== Sandveld ====
Sandveld, in the general sense of the word, is a type of veld characterised by dry, sandy soil, typical of certain areas of the Southern African region. It usually absorbs all water from the seasonal rains, although aquatic habitats, largely seasonal, may be also found in specific places in the sandveld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bgis.sanbi.org/fsp/Reports/SandveldFreshwaterEcosystems2008.pdf |title=Aquatic Ecosystems of the Sandveld-Saldanha |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only certain hardy plant species thrive in the sandveld environment. These consist especially of grasses forming clumps and certain kinds of trees and shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/planttuv/thamnocortbach.htm |title=Thamnochortus bachmannii |publisher=Plantzafrica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sandveld vegetation has a particular pattern of growth, rarely covering the whole terrain and thus leaving patches of sandy soil exposed on the surface. Some of the typical sandveld species are ''[[Acacia haematoxylon]]'', ''[[Acacia luederitzii|A. luederitzii]]'', ''[[Boscia albitrunca]]'', ''[[Terminalia sericea]]'', ''[[Lonchocarpus nelsii]]'', ''[[Bauhinia petersiana]]'' and ''[[Baphia massaiensis]]''.

==== Hardveld ====
Hardveld is a term applied to certain areas of rocky soils in Botswana, located mostly in the eastern part of the country. The landscape is an undulating plain with scattered rocky hill ranges. There are areas of hardveld also in South Africa in the mountainous central [[Kamiesberge|Kamiesberg]] of the [[Northern Cape]] with hilly escarpments and deep river valleys. The soil of the hardveld is characterised by rocky outcrops, as well as an abundance of stones and pebbles of different shapes and sizes.

The flora of the hardveld is typical of rocky [[savanna]], with denser vegetation and thus less denuded patches than in the sandveld, as well as taller trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.agric.za/limpopo/pdf/basin_profile_part1c.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - ORIG_Basin Profile.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a higher diversity of species in the hardveld compared with the sandveld. ''[[Peltophorum africanum]]'', ''[[Acacia nigrescens]]'', ''[[Acacia tortilis|A. tortilis]]'', ''[[Combretum apiculatum]]'' and ''[[Colophospermum mopane]]'' are some of the representative species of the northern hardveld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPC/doc/Counprof/Botswana/botswana.htm |title=FAO Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles – Botswana |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915124212/http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/counprof/botswana/botswana.htm |archivedate=15 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quote ===
{{cquote|How well I remember the years I spent tending the cattle on the large farm, roaming over all its far expanse of veld, in which every kloof, every valley, every koppie was endeared to me by the most familiar associations. Month after month I had spent there in lonely occupation—alone with the cattle, myself and God. The veld had grown part of me, not only in the sense that my bones were a part of it, but in that more vital sense which identifies nature with man ... Having no human companion, I felt a spirit of comradeship for the objects around me. In my childish way I communed with these as with my own soul; they became the sharers of my confidence.|||[[Jan Smuts]]}}
